Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 02:30 AM Onego Bio Raises €37 Million in Additional FundingDOUGLAS, ISLE OF MAN / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2024 / Agronomics (LSE:ANIC), a leading listed company focused on the field of cellular agriculture, is pleased to announce that portfolio company Onego Bio Ltd (""Onego Bio""), focused on commercialising egg proteins via precision fermentation, has successfully raised €27 million in its Series A financing, led by NordicNinja VC, a Japanese-Nordic VC backing companies in climate and deep tech. In addition, Onego Bio secured a further €9.5 million in non-dilutive funding from Business Finland, a government organisation offering grant funding for innovative Finnish companies that address significant global needs and challenges. Agronomics participated in the round with a €1.55 million investment (the ""Subscription"") alongside existing investors Maki VC and Holdix and new investors EIT Food and Tesi, the Finnish sovereign wealth fund.Subject to audit, Agronomics' position in Onego Bio, including the Subscription, will be carried at £11.1 million (€12.9 million), including an unrealised gain of £3.8 million. This represents a gross IRR of 27.57% and a MOIC of 1.53x. Agronomics now holds an equity stake of 16.36% in Onego Bio on a fully diluted basis, accounting for approximately 6.4% of Agronomics' last stated Net Asset Value at 31 December 2023, including post-balance sheet date adjustments.Agronomics' first investment in Onego Bio was In February 2022, when it led the Seed round with a €6.9 million investment. Concurrent with the close of the Seed round, Onego Bio secured an exclusive license from VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. (""VTT"") to commercialise its proprietary strains of the highly productive protein expression system Trichoderma reesei (""Trichoderma"") to produce egg proteins. Prior to securing the licence, more than a decade of research had been conducted at VTT under the guidance of Chris Landowski, now CTO of Onego Bio. Chris recognised the advantages of Trichoderma over other protein expression systems, given its extensive use and high productivity in other fields such as enzyme production.A LCA (Life-Cycle Analysis) conducted by VTT and published in Nature Foods in 2021, showed that the production of ovalbumin via precision fermentation using Trichoderma as a host organism instead of chickens could reduce environmental impacts across a range of different impact categories, such as global warming potential, land use, marine eutrophication, terrestrial acidification and stratospheric ozone depletion. Additionally, current supply chains, which at the industrial scale lead to poor animal welfare conditions, are often interrupted by outbreaks of avian flu causing shortages and price volatility. By decoupling egg protein production from intensive poultry farming, precision fermentation provides a more sustainable, ethical and secure supply of egg protein. Onego Bio is one of few companies in the field targeting the egg market which was valued at USD 136.2 bn in 2022 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.Onego Bio's Series A funding will be used to continue scaling and optimising its production processes and productivity, finance its work with its contract manufacturing partners and prepare for FDA filing for regulatory approval in the United States. Onego is on track to receive self-affirmed GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status for Bioalbumen® this year, with a no-objections letter expected from the FDA in 2025. As a US-Finnish company, Onego plans to first launch in North America, where the regulatory landscape allows a faster market entry, followed by expansion in Europe, South America and Asia.Jim Mellon, Executive Chairman of Agronomics commented:""Eggs are an essential part of food businesses, but with the egg market constantly fluctuating in supply and costs due to avian flu and increased demand for cage-free, manufacturers are challenged to find a viable replacement with a consistent, reliable, and safe supply of high-quality protein at an accessible price. A long-term sustainable solution for chicken eggs is needed. We have been highly impressed with Onego's capabilities and vision from the very beginning. By repurposing a well-established technology from the enzyme industry for food protein production, they are well-positioned to scale to the massive volumes needed to future-proof the supply of the world's most versatile and popular food protein.""New Agrarian Company Limited, an affiliate of Agronomics, invested EUR 0.5 million along with Jim Mellon, who personally invested EUR 0.25 million on the same terms.About Bioalbumen®Bioalbumen® is a bioidentical protein to the major protein in chicken egg white, ovalbumin. Nutritionally complete, Onego's egg protein contains all essential amino acids, has the highest possible protein digestibility score PDCAAS of 1.0, and delivers a whopping >90 g protein per 100 g. With a clean neutral flavor and superior functional properties, Bioalbumen® is an ideal industrial ingredient for replacing eggs and enhancing the texture, taste, and performance of a wide range of applications across the food industry. Onego currently collaborates with over 25 well-known CPG companies, integrating Bioalbumen® into their innovation pipeline for a wide range of products, including baked goods, confectionery, snacks, sauces, pasta, meat alternatives, and more.About Onego Bio:Onego Bio is a US-Finnish food-biotech company revolutionizing the food system by harnessing the power of precision fermentation to manufacture real egg protein entirely animal-free.

The NDA is supported by data from FRUSICA-1 Phase II study, showing promising results. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of the New Drug Application and the Priority Review status for the combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab by the China National Medical Products Administration is a significant milestone in oncology therapeutics, particularly for endometrial cancer treatment. The combination therapy targets a patient segment with advanced endometrial cancer with particular molecular profiles (pMMR and non-MSI-H) that have limited treatment options after failing first-line therapies. This specificity in targeting is a reflection of the personalized medicine approach that is becoming increasingly prevalent in oncology.From a research perspective, the FRUSICA-1 study's endpoints such as ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS and OS are standard metrics for assessing the efficacy of oncology treatments. The pharmacokinetic assessments will provide insights into how the drugs are processed in the body, which can be critical for understanding safety profiles and optimizing dosing regimens. As the data will be presented at an upcoming medical conference, it will undergo peer review, which is essential for validation in the scientific community.For stakeholders, this development could signal a potential shift in the standard of care for the targeted patient population, which could lead to increased demand for the treatment if approved. However, it is important to wait for the detailed results and peer-reviewed data before drawing conclusions about the treatment's efficacy and safety. Healthcare Market Research Analyst With the Priority Review designation, HUTCHMED and Innovent may see an accelerated timeline towards commercialization in China, one of the largest pharmaceutical markets. The designation implies that the treatment addresses an unmet medical need, which could translate into a competitive advantage and potential market exclusivity benefits. Furthermore, the collaboration between HUTCHMED and Innovent reflects a growing trend of partnerships in the biotech industry to pool resources and expertise.The market impact of this combination therapy will depend on several factors, including the final clinical trial results, pricing strategy, reimbursement policies and the ability of the companies to execute an effective go-to-market plan. Given that endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies in China, there is a significant patient population that could benefit from this treatment. A successful launch could result in substantial revenue growth for both companies.It is important for investors to monitor subsequent trial results and regulatory decisions as they will have direct implications on the stock performance of HUTCHMED and Innovent. Moreover, the companies' ability to scale production and navigate the complex regulatory and reimbursement landscape in China will be important for the long-term success of the therapy. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Specialist The regulatory process for new drug approvals in China has undergone reforms aimed at expediting the availability of innovative treatments. The Priority Review status granted to fruquintinib and sintilimab combination therapy is indicative of the treatment's potential to address a significant clinical need in China. This regulatory milestone can potentially reduce the time to market, subject to positive outcomes from the review process.Given the Breakthrough Therapy designation received previously, the combination therapy has likely demonstrated substantial improvement over existing therapies in one or more clinically significant endpoints. The NMPA's decision will be based on a thorough review of the clinical data and if approved, this could set a precedent for future regulatory filings for similar combination therapies in oncology.For companies operating in the pharmaceutical sector, navigating the regulatory environment is as important as the clinical development of new therapies. The success of this filing could influence the strategic regulatory planning for HUTCHMED and Innovent, potentially impacting their pipeline development and investment in R&D. It's also a signal to the industry about the Chinese regulatory authority's openness to innovative oncology treatments. 04/02/2024 - 12:30 AM — NDA accepted and both fruquintinib and sintilimab granted Priority Review, following Breakthrough Therapy designation in July 2023 — — First regulatory filing for fruquintinib for use in combination with a leading immune checkpoint inhibitor — HONG KONG, SHANGHAI, China & FLORHAM PARK, N.J., April 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) and Innovent Biologics, Inc. (“Innovent”) (HKEX:1801) today jointly announce that the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for the combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with pMMR1 or non-MSI-H2 tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy but are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation has been accepted and granted priority review by the China National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”). The NDA is supported by data from FRUSICA-1, the endometrial cancer registration cohort of a multi-center, open-label Phase II study investigating fruquintinib in combination with sintilimab in endometrial cancer patients who experienced disease recurrence, disease progression or intolerable toxicity with treatment on platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was independent review committee (IRC) assessed objective response rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints including disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), as well as pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments. Data from FRUSICA-1 will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference. Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier NCT03903705. “This is the first regulatory filing for the combination of fruquintinib and the immune checkpoint inhibitor sintilimab. It also represents an important step closer to reshaping the treatment landscape for this challenging disease in China,” said Dr. Michael Shi, Head of R&D and Chief Medical Officer of HUTCHMED. “Endometrial cancer remains one of the most common gynecological malignancies. We look forward to bringing this much-awaited treatment advancement to endometrial cancer patients to improve their treatment outcome.” “TYVYT® (sintilimab injection), as a backbone therapy in immuno-oncology, in combination with an anti-angiogenetic drug, may improve the prognosis for endometrial cancer patients in China,” said Dr. Hui Zhou, Senior Vice President of Innovent. “We are excited about the NDA acceptance and priority review designation, which increases our potential to bring a new treatment option to endometrial cancer patients, and concurrently strengthens the leadership position of TYVYT® in China.” The NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to the combination of fruquintinib and sintilimab for this potential indication in July 2023. The NMPA granted this designation to this combination as a new treatment that could target a serious condition for which there are no effective treatment options, and where clinical evidence demonstrates substantial advantages over existing therapies. About Endometrial Cancer Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the uterus. Globally, an estimated 417,000 people were diagnosed with endometrial cancer and it caused approximately 97,000 deaths in 2020.3 Іn China, an estimated 82,000 people were diagnosed with endometrial cancer, causing approximately 17,000 deaths in 2020.4 Although early-stage endometrial cancer can be surgically resected, recurrent and/or metastatic endometrial cancer remains an area of high unmet need with poor outcomes and limited treatment options.5,6,7 About Fruquintinib Fruquintinib is a selective oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”)-1, -2 and -3. VEGFR inhibitors play a pivotal role in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. Fruquintinib was designed to have enhanced selectivity that limits off-target kinase activity, allowing for high drug exposure, sustained target inhibition, and flexibility for its potential use as part of a combination therapy. Fruquintinib has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and is being investigated in combinations with other anti-cancer therapies. About Fruquintinib Approval in China Fruquintinib is approved for marketing for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have previously received fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan-based chemotherapy, and those who have previously received or are not suitable for receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) therapy or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) therapy (RAS wild-type) in China, where it is co-developed and co-marketed by HUTCHMED and Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name ELUNATE®. It was included in the China National Reimbursement Drug List (“NRDL”) in January 2020. The approval was based on data from the FRESCO study, a Phase III pivotal registration trial of fruquintinib in 416 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in China, which were published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA. Since its launch in China and as of mid-2023, fruquintinib has benefited more than 80,000 colorectal cancer patients. About Fruquintinib Approval in the United States Fruquintinib received approval for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan‑based chemotherapy, an anti‑VEGF therapy, and, if RAS wild‑type and medically appropriate, an anti-EGFR therapy in the United States in November 2023, where it is marketed by Takeda under the brand name FRUZAQLA™. The approval was based on data from two large Phase III trials: the multi-regional FRESCO-2 trial, data from which were published in The Lancet, along with the FRESCO trial conducted in China. The trials investigated fruquintinib plus best supportive care versus placebo plus best supportive care in patients with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Both FRESCO and FRESCO-2 met their primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints and showed consistent benefit among a total of 734 patients treated with fruquintinib. Safety profiles were consistent across trials. Takeda has the exclusive worldwide license to further develop, commercialize, and manufacture fruquintinib outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. About Sintilimab Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in China, is a PD-1 immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody co-developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells.8 In China, sintilimab has been approved and included in the NRDL for seven indications. The updated NRDL reimbursement scope for TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) includes: For the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer lacking EGFR or ALK driver gene mutations;For the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who progressed after EGFR-TKI therapy;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer;For the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with no prior systematic treatment;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Besides, the combination of sintilimab and fruquintinib for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial cancer with pMMR or non-MSI-H tumors that have failed prior systemic therapy but are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation has been accepted and granted priority review by the NMPA. In addition, two clinical studies of sintilimab have met their primary endpoints: Phase II study of sintilimab monotherapy as second-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;Phase III study of sintilimab monotherapy as second-line treatment for squamous NSCLC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy.

The move aims to enhance value and focus on higher-growth, higher-margin operations, generating significant cash flow and revenue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic alliance between Whirlpool Corporation and Arçelik A.Ş, resulting in the creation of Beko Europe B.V., is a significant restructuring of Whirlpool's European operations. The aim is to enhance market reach and operational efficiency. By owning a 25 percent stake in the new entity, Whirlpool can capitalize on a broader European market without the full responsibility of managing the business. The projected net present value of future cash flow and incremental free cash flow suggest a positive financial outlook.However, the success of such ventures often hinges on post-merger integration and the effectiveness of the new management structure. The appointment of Whirlpool executives to Beko Europe B.V.'s board indicates an intention to maintain strategic influence. The focus on sustainable manufacturing and product innovation aligns with current industry trends towards environmental responsibility and technological advancement, which are key factors in maintaining competitive advantage. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the completion of the Whirlpool-Arçelik transaction is expected to yield substantial benefits. The anticipated $750 million in net present value of future cash flows represents a significant return on investment. The additional $200-$300 million in incremental free cash flow by 2025 indicates a strong potential for reinvestment and shareholder returns. This liquidity is particularly important for funding ongoing operations and future strategic initiatives.Investors should note the strategic retention of the InSinkErator and EMEA KitchenAid businesses by Whirlpool, which suggests that these segments are either too valuable to divest or present significant growth opportunities. Whirlpool's focus on its leading positions in the Americas and India and the emphasis on high-margin products, is a clear strategy aimed at maximizing profitability and market share. Economist The transaction between Whirlpool and Arçelik reflects broader economic trends in the global appliance industry, where companies are seeking scale and scope efficiencies through consolidation. The formation of Beko Europe B.V. is a strategic move to leverage the combined strengths of both companies. By streamlining operations and focusing on core competencies, the new entity is positioned to respond more effectively to market dynamics, including fluctuating consumer demand and global supply chain challenges.The projected revenue and cash flow benefits must be weighed against the risks of market concentration and potential antitrust concerns. The long-term economic impact will depend on the new entity's ability to innovate and adapt to changing consumer preferences, particularly in the face of increasing digitalization and the growing importance of smart home technologies. 04/02/2024 - 02:30 AM BENTON HARBOR, Mich., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Whirlpool Corporation today announced the completion of its transaction with Arçelik A.Ş (""Arcelik"").

Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The repurchase of shares by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (IHG) can have a significant impact on the company's capital structure and shareholder value. Share buybacks are often viewed positively in the market as they can indicate that a company believes its shares are undervalued and it can also improve financial ratios such as earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding.However, the timing and price of the buyback transactions should be analyzed. The average price paid per share, as well as the highest and lowest prices, can provide insights into the company's buyback strategy and market conditions. It's also worth noting that the cancellation of the purchased shares will permanently reduce the share count, potentially leading to a higher EPS if net income remains constant or grows.Investors should monitor the company's future earnings reports to assess the impact of the share buyback on profitability and EPS growth. Additionally, the reduction in capital through share buybacks could impact the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or pay down debt. Financial Analyst InterContinental Hotels Group's decision to execute a share buyback program and cancel the repurchased shares reflects a capital allocation strategy that prioritizes returning value to shareholders. This move can be interpreted as a signal of management's confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects.From a financial perspective, the reduction of shares in circulation can lead to a more favorable supply-demand dynamic for the remaining shares. However, it's important to evaluate the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements to ensure that the buyback does not compromise financial stability or the ability to fund ongoing operations and investments.Additionally, the share buyback could affect the company's stock liquidity, which is an important consideration for investors. A lower number of shares available for trading can lead to higher share price volatility. Investors should also consider the opportunity cost of the capital used for the buyback, as these funds could have been deployed elsewhere for potentially higher returns. 04/02/2024 - 02:00 AM LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / April 2, 2024 / InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (the Company) The Company announces that on 28 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

Positive The launch of Bernstein by AllianceBernstein and Societe Generale marks a significant development in the global cash equities and equity research sector. Bernstein aims to offer institutional investors, corporates, and financial institutions premier investment insights, liquidity access, and leading global trading technology. The joint venture, organized under two legal entities with offices in key financial hubs, plans for Societe Generale to eventually acquire full ownership after five years. Robert van Brugge, previously CEO of Bernstein Research Services, has been appointed CEO of Bernstein, with Stephane Loiseau as Deputy CEO. Societe Generale and AllianceBernstein aim to enhance their client offerings, leverage synergies, and grow revenues sustainably through the joint venture. The closing of the transaction has received approval from regulatory and antitrust authorities, paving the way for the official launch of Bernstein. The new brand, leveraging the Bernstein name, aims to deliver best-in-class research and insights to global clients. Robert van Brugge and Stephane Loiseau bring extensive experience and expertise to their respective roles within the joint venture. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The launch of Bernstein by AllianceBernstein and Societe Generale represents a strategic expansion into the cash equities and equity research space, a sector known for its competitive nature and high entry barriers. The leveraging of AllianceBernstein's research prowess with Societe Generale's global reach and trading technology could potentially disrupt the current market dynamics. The joint venture's aim to provide a comprehensive suite of services across the equities value chain is indicative of a trend towards one-stop financial solutions, catering to the evolving needs of institutional investors and financial institutions.From a market perspective, the integrated offerings might attract clients seeking consolidated research and trading services, which could lead to increased market share and revenue growth for both entities. The strategic geographical positioning with hubs in key financial centers like New York, London, Paris and Hong Kong is designed to maximize market penetration and client accessibility. However, the success of this venture will depend on its ability to differentiate itself from established competitors and the seamless integration of the two firms' services and corporate cultures. Financial Analyst The official launch of Bernstein is a significant development for shareholders of both AllianceBernstein and Societe Generale. The joint venture has the potential to unlock revenue synergies by combining the research and trading expertise of both firms. This move could be seen as an effort to diversify revenue streams and reduce reliance on more volatile segments of the financial industry. For investors, the long-term benefits hinge on the joint venture's ability to capture market share and deliver on its promise of premier investment insights and liquidity access.The fact that Societe Generale plans to eventually own 100% of both entities could suggest a roadmap for gradual integration and a strategic exit for AllianceBernstein from direct ownership, which may have implications for their investment portfolio and focus. This could result in a reevaluation of AllianceBernstein's stock as it reshapes its business model. The financial health and stock performance of both companies should be monitored closely as the joint venture evolves. Legal Expert The transaction's closing, having received regulatory and antitrust approval, indicates compliance with legal and competitive standards, which is a positive sign for the joint venture's future operations. The structured plan for Societe Generale to acquire full ownership over five years introduces a clear timeline for the transition of control, which provides a degree of certainty for investors and clients alike. However, the acquisition is subject to further regulatory approvals and such processes can introduce delays or impose conditions that might affect the joint venture's strategic objectives.It is essential to consider the legal complexities and potential risks associated with cross-border ventures, including differing regulatory environments and the challenges of aligning legal structures across jurisdictions. The successful management of these legal aspects will be important for the seamless operation of the joint venture and for maintaining investor confidence. 04/02/2024 - 01:00 AM NASHVILLE, Tenn. and PARIS, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AllianceBernstein (NYSE: AB) and Societe Generale (EURONEXT: GLE) today announced the official launch of Bernstein, a joint venture creating a leading global cash equities and equity research business.

Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 02:00 AM Application based on results from the TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trial Additional BLA under review in the U.S. for Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s datopotamab deruxtecan for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) Biologics License Application (BLA) for datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) has been accepted in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have received prior systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. Datopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action date for its regulatory decision, is January 29, 2025. The BLA is based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trial, which were presented at a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO23) 2023 Congress and in an oral presentation at the 2023 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (#SABCS23). In the trial, datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement for the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to investigator’s choice of chemotherapy in patients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer previously treated with endocrine-based therapy and at least one systemic therapy. For the dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), interim results numerically favored datopotamab deruxtecan over chemotherapy but were not mature at the time of data cut-off. The trial is ongoing and OS will be assessed at future analyses. The safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with that observed in other ongoing trials with no new safety concerns identified. The most common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events in the datopotamab deruxtecan and chemotherapy arms, respectively, were neutropenia (1% vs. 31%), stomatitis (6% vs. 3%), fatigue (2% vs. 2%) and anemia (1% vs. 2%). “The FDA’s acceptance of the BLA brings us closer to providing patients with previously treated HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer an alternative option to conventional chemotherapy earlier in the metastatic setting,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “Following our recently accepted application for advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer in the U.S., along with additional regulatory reviews underway in China, the EU, Japan and other regions, we are working swiftly to bring datopotamab deruxtecan as a potential new treatment option to patients around the world.” “Despite marked progress in the treatment of HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, most patients with advanced disease develop endocrine resistance and face the prospect of one or several lines of chemotherapy,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “If approved, datopotamab deruxtecan has the potential to provide these patients an efficacious and better tolerated alternative to conventional chemotherapy.” An additional BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial is under review in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior systemic therapy. Additional regulatory submissions for datopotamab deruxtecan in lung and breast cancer are underway globally. About TROPION-Breast01 TROPION-Breast01 is a global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus investigator’s choice of single-agent chemotherapy (eribulin, capecitabine, vinorelbine or gemcitabine) in patients with unresectable or metastatic HR positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer who have progressed on and are not suitable for endocrine therapy per investigator assessment and have received at least one additional systemic therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Breast01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review and OS. Key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, duration of response, investigator-assessed PFS, disease control rate, time to first subsequent therapy and safety. TROPION-Breast01 enrolled more than 700 patients in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov. About Hormone Receptor Positive, HER2 Negative Breast Cancer More than 275,000 breast cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022.1 HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer is the most common subtype, accounting for more than 65% of diagnosed cases.2 Breast cancer is considered HR positive, HER2 negative when tumors test positive for estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors and negative for HER2 (measured as HER2 score of IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-).2,3 Standard initial treatment for this subtype of breast cancer is endocrine therapy but most patients with advanced disease will develop resistance, underscoring the need for additional options.4,5 TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer and is associated with increased tumor progression and poor survival.6,7 About Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. A comprehensive global clinical development program is underway with more than 20 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for the manufacturing and supply of ENHERTU and datopotamab deruxtecan. About the DXd ADC Portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo The DXd ADC portfolio of Daiichi Sankyo currently consists of six ADCs in clinical development across multiple types of cancer. ENHERTU, a HER2 directed ADC, and datopotamab deruxtecan, a TROP2 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with AstraZeneca. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), a HER3 directed ADC, ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd), a B7-H3 directed ADC, and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), a CDH6 directed ADC, are being jointly developed and commercialized globally with Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, N.J. USA. DS-3939, a TA-MUC1 directed ADC, is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology to target and deliver a cytotoxic payload inside cancer cells that express a specific cell surface antigen, each ADC consists of a monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. Datopotamab deruxtecan, ifinatamab deruxtecan, patritumab deruxtecan, raludotatug deruxtecan and DS-3939 are investigational medicines that have not been approved for any indication in any country. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

The deal merges OSN+'s premium video content with Anghami's music and podcasts, promising enhanced streaming experience and innovative products. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of a majority stake in Anghami by OSN Group represents a significant consolidation within the media and entertainment sector. This transaction, which values Anghami at $3.69 per share, is a substantial premium over the recent closing price, indicating a strong belief in the strategic value of Anghami's assets and market position. The combined entity's user base and revenues suggest a competitive scale in the regional market.The integration of Anghami's music and podcast library with OSN+'s video content could potentially create a diversified media platform capable of competing with larger global streaming services. This diversification may also open up new revenue streams through cross-selling and bundled subscription offerings. However, the success of this strategy will largely depend on the execution of the integration and the combined entity's ability to maintain and grow its subscriber base in a highly competitive environment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transaction's impact on Anghami's stock is significant, as it was acquired at a multiple of 1.9x its last closing price. This premium reflects the anticipated synergies and the growth potential that OSN Group sees in Anghami. Investors will be closely monitoring the post-acquisition performance, particularly in terms of user growth, average revenue per user (ARPU) and cost synergies.While the short-term liquidity event is beneficial for Anghami's shareholders, it is essential to consider the long-term implications. The challenge will be to leverage the combined technology and content offerings to capture market share and achieve profitability. Investors should also be aware of the risks associated with such mergers, including potential cultural clashes, integration costs and the possibility of not realizing the expected synergies. Technology Analyst The emphasis on Anghami's 'strong tech stack' and 'AI-driven hyper-personalization' is noteworthy. The ability to enhance the user experience through technology is a critical factor in the streaming industry. The commitment to rolling out 'best-in-class products' suggests a focus on innovation to retain and grow the customer base.For stakeholders, the technological integration between the two platforms will be crucial. If successful, it could lead to a more seamless user experience and higher engagement rates. However, merging different tech stacks can be complex and may require significant investment and time to achieve the desired outcome. Stakeholders should look for updates on technological milestones post-merger to gauge the progress and effectiveness of the integration. 04/02/2024 - 02:30 AM The transaction has received all required regulatory approvals for successful closure OSN Group's investment in Anghami gives it a majority stake at a valuation of $3.69 per share ABU DHABI, UAE, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Anghami Inc.

Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 12:00 AM AI-powered Hole Insights and Spanish-language AI narration to further connect fans to one of golf's most iconic events. ARMONK, N.Y., April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Masters Tournament today announced several new fan features coming to the Masters app and Masters.com digital experience for this year's event. Powered by generative AI capabilities built from watsonx – IBM's AI and data platform – fans this year will have access to shot-by-shot Hole Insights offering detailed, data-driven projections and analysis for each hole on course. In addition, IBM will release AI-enabled Spanish language narration as an expansion of its English-language AI Narration feature debuted in 2023. These new capabilities – a product of collaboration between experts from IBM Consulting, and the Masters digital team – aim to deliver a more personalized and engaging digital viewing experience for millions of new and existing golf fans around the world following Masters Tournament action April 11-14. IBM Hole Insights, joining the ""Track Shots"" experience on the 2024 Masters.com website and mobile apps, brings together natural language processing and structured data to generate detailed breakdowns of current and historical play, as well as projections of anticipated play, around any given hole, including: Data-driven recaps of how each hole has played daily and throughout the 2024 Tournament (e.g., ""The 14th hole has played difficult today, with 25% of shots resulting in bogies."").Projections of how each hole might play, based on past and current performance data (e.g., ""The 9th hole is projected to be the third most difficult hole today."").Historical insights into how each hole has played, based on eight years of Tournament data – including more than 170,000 shots – and ball position on course (e.g., ""Shots historically hit in this location have an 82% chance of resulting in a birdie."").Hole Insights marks the first time that fans can receive insights based on live Tournament shots directly on the Masters website. IBM is also debuting the next chapter in its AI sports narration story – Spanish language narration. IBM and the Masters first introduced AI Narration last year to provide automated audio and closed caption commentary for on-demand highlight videos of every shot on every hole – approximately 20,000 over the course of the Tournament. Now, fans will have access to the same narration in both Spanish audio and closed caption forms. Fans following highlight videos on 2024 Masters app and website can use the English and Spanish narration interchangeably and simultaneously, as desired. For example, watching Tournament play while receiving English audio narration, with Spanish closed captions overlaid, and vice versa. Powering this new feature is a combination of generative AI and large language models built on watsonx. Moving beyond simple English-to-Spanish translation, a team of IBM engineers and subject matter experts through a process known as few shot learning trained the AI model to natively ""understand"" and ""communicate"" in Spanish to deliver authentic audio and closed captioning narration experiences to Spanish-speaking fans. ""The generative AI power of watsonx is enabling IBM and the Augusta National Golf Club to co-create technology solutions that bring the magic of the Masters to life for millions of fans around the world,"" said Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at IBM. ""From training and tuning to monitoring and maintenance, watsonx manages the entire lifecycle of the AI models used to create features such as AI Narration and Hole Insights. These are the same capabilities we're applying to our work with businesses across industries as they aim to build better customer care experiences, reach new levels of productivity, and make more informed, data-driven business decisions."" For more than 25 years, the Masters has worked closely with IBM to guide their journey of digital transformation, from design and user interface to the back-end systems that transform Masters data into compelling and approachable golf insights. Today's newly announced Hole Insights and Spanish AI narration features join ongoing efforts by IBM and the Masters to reimagine and deliver a world-class digital experience for millions of fans – from launching Masters.com in 1996, to the introduction of AI Highlights, Round in Three Minutes, My Group, Player Insights and Projections powered with IBM Watson.

Negative None. 04/02/2024 - 12:15 AM NON-TOXIC, CYANIDE-FREE TECHNOLOGY CAN POTENTIALLY DOUBLE SILVER RECOVERIES AND SIGNIFICANTLY CUT LEACHING TIMES VANCOUVER, BC, April 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Silver One Resources Inc. (TSXV: SVE) (OTCQX: SLVRF); (FSE: BRK1) – ""Silver One"" or the ""Company"") announces the results of initial metallurgical testing using a novel, cyanide-free leaching process that can potentially double silver recoveries and cut leaching times. The leaching process is used in conjunction with a unique extraction process which is suitable for the recovery of silver from refractory mineralization. This innovative leaching process involves a trademarked technology called TNS, developed by Extrakt Processing Solutions, LLC (""EPS"") Ky, USA. The tests were conducted on representative samples of the largest heap leach pad (LP1) from the Company's 100% owned, past-producing Candelaria Silver Mine in Nevada. Recently, EPS announced a strategic global alliance with Bechtel Energy Technologies & Solutions, Inc. (""Bechtel"") to commercialize Extrakt's groundbreaking TNS™ technology (see https://www.bechtel.com/newsroom/press-releases/extrakt-and-bechtel-partner-to-commercialize-groundbreaking-solid-liquid-separation-technology/). Highlights Preliminary metallurgical testing using EPS' proprietary solutions have significantly increased Candelaria's leach pad silver recoveries, exceeding 100% in comparison to previous testing using cyanide leaching (see Company's news release of May 21, 2019).The sample tested consists of leached oxides from LP1, crushed to <1 inch (<25.4 mm) by previous operators, and has an average silver grade of 48.1 g/t. Crushing the leach pad material to ≤2 mm (2000 microns) has returned an average silver recovery of 49% in comparison to the cyanide leach test recoveries of 21% to 29% from past tests commissioned by the Company (see Company's news releases of April 19, 2018 and May 21, 2019, and figure 1 for the location of LP1).Additional short-term (5-15 minutes) milling to 550 and 110 microns (0.55 and 0.11 mm) increases the leach pad recoveries to 59.9% and 64.4%, respectively.The use of the trademarked TNS technology has positive ESG implications, notably because it reduces environmental impact. Unlike cyanide use, this process consumes minimal water, and no toxic effluents are produced. Furthermore, the residues (tailings) are inert and non-acid generating.Additional testing on material from both the existing leach pads and fresh ore is planned for the second half of 2024.Gregory Crowe, President and CEO commented: ""The impressive results from the initial testing using EPS' technology have encouraged Silver One to expand this testing to cover both leach pads and fresh mineralization. The results show the technology performs well in the treatment of difficult or refractory mineralized material, such as the partially leached material on the Candelaria heap leach pads. The use of these proprietary solutions yields potential for possibly doubling silver recoveries in comparison to traditional cyanide leaching. This may positively impact the overall economics of the project. EPS' leaching agents not only improve silver extraction but are also more environmentally friendly and save water by assisting in the dewatering of tailings, and the extraction process is simpler and potentially less costly. Furthermore, we are optimistic about this innovative technology as it is backed up by EPS' years of research and development. We are looking forward to continuing testing to optimize the operating parameters, test diverse types of mineralized material including fresh never-leached material, and validate the results."" Background EPS has developed a novel solid-liquids separation technology (TNS™) and leach processes to recover metals. EPS extensive research and development has resulted in constant improvements and adaptations that have accumulated 40 patents, producing, in the process, formulations suitable to separate metals from complex oxide and refractory mineralized materials. TNS™ technology was designed for the application of liquid solids separation in dewatering of mine waste and is also very effective in separating hydrocarbons in oil-sands. The TNS™ process, combined with its unique cyanide-free leach technology especially formulated to extract metals, has demonstrated to recover more silver and gold than traditional leaching methods. The traditional silver cyanide leaching typically takes several hours to several days using agitated leaching techniques. However, EPS' innovative technology uses patented chemistry to extract metals in less time than an agitated leaching system. It also separates liquids from solids, enabling dry-stacked tailings; it works with coarse particles (≤2 mm or 2000 microns material in Candelaria' s case) and is not inhibited by the presence of clays. Thus, the process potentially reduces capital and operating costs while increasing metal recovery. The TNS technology has been tested on materials from mine sites from various parts of the world and piloted successfully in dewatering oil-sand tailings in Canada and with major coal operation in the U.S. The leach technology is also in the process of being tested in the extraction of gold from tailings for a project in Canada. Testing and Leach Results A bulk sample representative of leach pad 1 (LP1) weighing 228 kg and entirely crushed to ≤2 mm (<2000 microns) with a Vertical Shaft Impact crusher at CEMCO's facilities in Belen, NM, was shipped to EPS laboratory in Kentucky for metallurgical testing. The material consisted of leached oxide and partially refractory material with an average silver head grade of 48.12 g/t, which was considered depleted by Kinross when mining and processing ceased in 1998. A representative portion of the bulk sample was weighed and sieved to separate two fractions. Material smaller than 2 millimeters was used for testing. The tests were conducted on 1 to 2 kg splits of the sieved (<2 mm) material. Splits tested were prepared according to acceptable industry standard practices (homogenized, coned and quartered several times). The minus 2 mm size was selected because of economic reasons, as it is a size fraction that can be achieved with one single stage of HPGR crushing. This is inexpensive relative to milling and yields better silver recoveries than those obtained by leaching the coarser (1 inch = 25.4 mm) material existing in Candelaria's leach pads. The current silver recoveries using EPS' proprietary solutions average 49% on samples as received at the lab (<2 mm = 2000 microns), which significantly exceed the 20.9% and 29% silver recoveries achieved with cyanide leaching from bottle roll tests using material of similar size respectively (See the Company's news release dated May 21, 2019). Further milling for short periods (5 to 13 minutes) yields finer material (550 to 110 microns = 0.55 to 0.11 mm), increasing silver recoveries to between 59.9% to 64.4% (see details in Table 1). These recoveries far exceed the silver recoveries by traditional cyanide leach methods. Historic cyanide heap-leach silver recoveries of fresh ore, as reported by Kinross and its predecessors, averaged 51% during the open-pit life of the mine in the 1980's and 90's. Subsequent testing by Silver One using cyanide on partially leached material yielded recoveries in the 21-29% range for LP1 (see Company's news releases of April 19, 2018 and May 21, 2019). All EPS' tests had a leach time of 24 hours (non-optimized, EPS estimates that leach times can be reduced with additional testing) indicating that the historic long leach times of days or months have the potential to also be reduced significantly. For comparison, earlier bottle roll tests conducted by the Company on leach pad and fresh mineralization samples have been run for 46 to 96 hours and column tests for 120 days (See the Company's news releases dated May 21, 2019 and December 13, 2022). Final results from Extrakt are anticipated in the latter part of 2024. These results will be used in an anticipated economic study on the Candelaria project. Analytical and QA/QC Samples were assayed both by the Advanced Materials Institute (AMI) Bowling Green, Ky, and by American Assay Laboratories (""AAL"") in Sparks, NV, USA., (IAS accredited Laboratory, ISO/IEC 17025:2005). AMI and AAL insert blanks, standards and include duplicate analyses to ensure proper sample preparation and equipment calibration. AAL analyzed heads, tails and pregnant solution samples for gold and silver by ICP-Ultra Trace (ICP-AES+ICP-MS analyses) while AMI analyzed same samples for silver only by ICP-OES. Solids were digested in acid (hydrofluoric, hydrochloric and nitric acid) using teflon beakers. AMI and AAL are independent of Silver One.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/01/2024 - 11:57 PM MONTREAL, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PyroGenesis Canada Inc. (http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX: PYR) (OTCQX: PYRGF) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company (the “Company” or “PyroGenesis”) that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes advanced plasma processes and sustainable solutions which are geared to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) and address environmental pollutants, is pleased to announce its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31st, 2023. “2023 was an interesting year for PyroGenesis, as we dealt with many of the issues associated with the growth and adoption of clean technology in a cautious economic environment,” said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. “We navigated cash management challenges brought about by higher costs associated with commercializing our technologies, continued inflationary pressures on material and labour costs, longer sales cycles for system sales caused by the uncertain economic environment we are all facing, and multiple requests from potential customers to help them in their investigation of using plasma as a solution to their many problems. As much of this type of work is new-use proof-of-concept, profit margins are negligible, and timelines imprecise.” “While many of these efforts did not yield large contracts or system sales during the year, we cannot underestimate the impact these engagements have had and are having,” said Mr. Pascali. “In a few short years we have moved front-of-mind to many current and potential heavy industry customers who sought us out as they made their initial steps on their decarbonization journey. Since late 2019, when our work on the first tests of plasma in iron ore pelletization heralded our entry into the field of heavy industry decarbonization, the opportunities have expanded far beyond the one-furnace/one-industry concept, to numerous process heating steps in virtually every heavy industry. The array of opportunities possible within the aluminum industry alone has surpassed that of any one specific technology solution we offered in the past. This is a fundamental change that has taken hold in 2023 which I would suggest significantly de-risks PyroGenesis overall.” Mr. Pascali added, “As the decarbonization trend continues to mature, we are well-positioned as a company with deep experience in the field – a key factor to customers as the scale of projects amplifies. This, along with our continued focus on cost optimization, our strong backlog of almost $29 million, negligible debt, the recent commercialization of our titanium metal powder production system, and a very robust sales pipeline, feeds my optimism for the future. As I have mentioned in the past, our revenue will fluctuate quarter to quarter, but our commitment will not. We are positioning ourselves to become a leader in heavy industry decarbonization technology solutions for many years to come.” The information below represents important highlights from the past year, followed by an outline of the Company’s strategy and outlook for 2024. 2023 Q4 Production Highlights The information below represents highlights from the past quarter for each of the Company’s main business verticals, followed by an outline of the Company’s strategy, and key developments that will impact the subsequent quarters. In Q4 2023, PyroGenesis continued its focus on advancing its updated business strategy that was first outlined in the Company’s 2022 fourth quarter and year-end results. As noted, as the variety of uses for the Company’s core technologies has expanded, and industry interest has increased, the Company is concentrating its activities under a three tiered solution ecosystem that aligns with economic drivers that are key to global heavy industry: Energy Transition & Emission Reduction: fuel switching, utilizing the Company’s electric-powered plasma torches and biogas upgrading technology to help heavy industry reduce fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, Commodity Security & Optimization: recovery of viable metals, and optimization of production methods/processes geared to increase output, maximize raw materials and improve availability of critical minerals, Waste Remediation: safe destruction of hazardous materials, and the recovery and valorization of underlying substances such as chemicals and minerals. Within each vertical the Company offers several solutions at different stages of commercialization. Commodity Security & Optimization In October, the Company provided an update (Press Release dated October 3, 2023) on two projects: (i) the PUREVAP™ Quartz Reduction Reaction (“QRR”) pilot plant and (ii) the Fumed Silica Reactor (“FSR”) project. For the QRR project – an initiative to create high purity silicon from quartz in a single step using a plasma reactor – the noteworthy progress and confirmations included: Completion of the scaling up of the QRR process by 2,500x from the previous laboratory scale, validating the original proof of concept.Demonstration of operation in a semi-continuous batch cycle.Production of silicon from quartz using a one-step direct carbothermal reduction process.25% reduction in raw material use compared with conventional methods.Achievement of 3N+ (or 99.9+%) silicon purity, a crucial purity level for battery-grade silicon applications.Optimized QRR design for high performance during the tapping process, minimizing silicon contamination. For the FSR project – an initiative to convert quartz into fumed silica in a single step using a plasma reactor – the Company announced that in a major step towards commercial-scale production, PyroGenesis had successfully deployed the FSR on a laboratory scale, resulting in the milestone production of fumed silica. Preliminary tests and analysis also confirmed that the material produced has chemical and physical characteristics compatible with those of commercially available fumed silica. In October, the Company announced (Press Release dated October 11, 2023) a successful “pour” of silicon from the PUREVAP™ Quartz Reduction Reaction (QRR), successfully validated 100% of the project's critical milestones. In November, the Company announced (Press Release dated November 9, 2023) a successful third-party validation of fumed silica, from the FSR project, from lab-scale production. Separately, the Company announced that production of the fumed silica pilot plant was underway, which was announced as intended to be in operation in Q2 of 2024. In December, the Company announced (Press Release dated December 18, 2023) the successful receipt of a U.S. patent for its innovative NEXGEN Plasma Atomization metal powder production technology for use in additive manufacturing and 3D printing. Waste Remediation In October, the Company announced (Press Release dated October 24, 2023) receipt of a $360,000 initial contract from a European engineering services firm undertaking the discovery and safe destruction of chemical warfare agents within the European Union. Under this agreement, as part of a potential three-phase project, PyroGenesis will first provide a lab-scale size plasma arc chemical warfare agent destruction system (the “PACWADS”) as part of a multi-partner project aimed at identifying, extracting, and disposing of chemical munitions and chemical warfare agents residing in active marine passageways and corridors. The second phase will consist of testing the system to validate efficiency, performance and capacity. The eventual goal is to develop a full-scale system once results from the lab-scale system are reviewed. Q4 Financial Highlights In November, the Company confirmed receipt (Press Release dated November 20, 2023) of a production milestone payment of $520,000 associated with the plasma torch contract with a U.S. corporation for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) destruction (Press Release dated September 12, 2023). In December, the Company announced (Press Release dated December 20, 2023) closing of a $1,250,000 non-brokered private placement of a convertible loan in the amount of $1.25 million with Fiducie de Crédit Mellon Trust, a related party. Status as a Dual-Listed Publicly Traded Company As part of the Company’s proactive risk management strategy, the Company announced in its Q2 news release (Press Release dated August 10, 2023) that it was evaluating the costs and benefits of maintaining a dual listing on both Nasdaq and the TSX. That evaluation entailed an analysis of several key factors, including (i) the financial costs associated with being on each exchange, such as insurance costs, regulatory compliance costs, legal fees, and accounting fees, (ii) the volume of trading on both exchanges, and (iii) the regulatory and compliance requirements of each exchange. On October 27, 2023, after careful consideration by the Board of Director, the Company announced it would be voluntarily delisting from the Nasdaq exchange. The Company’s shares were subsequently delisted from Nasdaq and shares ceased trading on November 16, 2023. On the same day, the Company’s shares began trading on the OTCQX Best Market, under the symbol “PYRGF”. None of these activities had any bearing on the Company’s main listing on the TSX, where the Company’s stock continued to trade uninterrupted under the symbol “PYR”. The Company also trades on the Frankfurt Exchange, under the symbol ""8PY”. Financial Summary Revenues PyroGenesis recorded revenue of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 (“Q4, 2023”), representing a decrease of $0.3 million compared with $3.3 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 (“Q4, 2022”). Revenue for fiscal 2023 was $12.3 million, a decrease of $6.7 million over revenue of $19 million compared to fiscal 2022. Revenues recorded in fiscal 2023 were generated primarily from: PUREVAP™ related sales of $1,660,928 (2022 - $6,272,697)DROSRITE™ related sales of $535,868 (2022 - $1,912,807)support services related to systems supplied to the US Navy $3,245,618 (2022 - $1,288,356)torch related sales of $3,396,458 (2022 - $5,558,210)Refrigerant destruction sales of $605,962 (2022 - $Nil)biogas upgrading & pollution controls of $1,713,810 (2022 - $3,347,443)other sales and services $1,186,437 (2022 - $633,990) Q4, 2023 revenues decreased by $0.3 million, mainly as a result of: PUREVAP™ related sales decreased by $0.6 million due to the completion of the project and the Company announcing the successful silicon “pour” validating all critical milestones and with this achievement, the stage is set for discussions in transitioning to commercial production,DROSRITE™ related sales decreased by $0.3 million due to customer delays in funding for the construction of the onsite facility,Support services related to systems supplied for the US Navy increased by $1.5 million due to the completion of several milestones and the increase in awarded contracts. In addition, in 2022 a revision in the cost budget affected the revenue recognized by percentage completion. At that time, the customer had yet to provide us with a firm purchase order for the change of scope,Torch-related products and services decreased by $1.4 million, due to the completion of the project, with the Company currently providing continuous onsite support,SPARC™ related sales increased by $0.2 million due to the advancement of the project, and,Biogas upgrading and pollution controls related sales increased by $0.2 million specifically due to the project advancement of our regenerative thermal oxidizer system. Fiscal 2023 revenues decreased by $6.7 million, mainly as a result of: PUREVAP™ related sales decreased by $4.6 million due to the completion of the project and initial phase of testing and one-time $3.6 million sale of IP, in 2022, which was not repeated in the current fiscal year,DROSRITE™ related sales decreased by $1.4 million due to the impact of the continued customer delays in funding for the construction of the onsite facility,Support services related to systems supplied for the US Navy increased by $2.0 million due to the completion of several milestones and the increase in awarded contracts,Torch-related products and services decreased by $2.2 million, due to the completion of the project, with the Company currently providing continuous onsite support,SPARC™ related sales increased by $0.6 million due to the advancement of the project, and,Biogas upgrading and pollution controls related sales decreased by $1.6 million due to the delivery of and agreed completion of projects during the comparable period of the previous year. As of April 1, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to backlog of signed and/or awarded contracts is $28.8 million. Revenue will be recognized as the Company satisfies its performance obligations under long-term contracts, which are expected to occur over a maximum period of approximately 3 years. Cost of Sales and Services and Gross Margins Cost of sales and services were $2.3 million in Q4 2023, representing an decrease of $0.5 million compared to $2.8 million in Q4, 2022, primarily due to a decrease of $0.1 million in employee compensation, a decrease of $0.3 million in direct materials, and a decrease of $0.2 million in foreign exchange on materials due to the reclassification of the expense from Cost of Sales and Services to Selling, General and Administrative expenses, which is in line with the decrease in product and service-related revenues, but offset by the increase in manufacturing overhead & other of $0.1 million. The gross profit for Q4, 2023 was $0.7 million or 23% of revenue compared to a gross margin of $0.5 million or 15% of revenue for Q4 2022, the increase in gross margin was mainly attributable a reduction of manufacturing overhead, employee compensation and to the impact on foreign exchange charge on materials. Fiscal 2023, cost of sales and services were $8.9 million compared to $10.9 million for the same period in the prior year, the $2.0 million decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $0.2 million in employee compensation (twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 - $3.7 million), a decrease of $1.1 million in subcontracting (twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 - $1.3 million) attributed to more work being completed in-house, a decrease in direct materials and manufacturing overhead & other of $1.5 million and $0.2 million respectively (twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 - $4.7 million and $1.4 million respectively), due to lower levels of material required based on the decrease in product and service-related revenues and the positive impact of the foreign exchange charge on material of $Nil due to the reclassification of foreign exchange from Cost of Sales and Services to Selling, General and Administrative expenses. The amortization of intangible assets for Q4, 2023 was comparable to Q4, 2022 and during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, was $0.9 million compared to $0.9 million for the same period in the prior year. This expense relates mainly to the intangible assets in connection with the Pyro Green-Gas acquisition, patents and deferred development costs. These expenses are non-cash items, and the intangible assets will be amortized over the expected useful lives. As a result of the type of contracts being executed, the nature of the project activity, as well as the composition of the cost of sales and services, as the mix between labour, materials and subcontracts may be significantly different. In addition, due to the nature of these long-term contracts, the Company has not necessarily passed on to the customer the increased cost of sales which was attributable to inflation, if any. The costs of sales and services are in line with management’s expectations and with the nature of the revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Included within Selling, General and Administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are costs associated with corporate administration, business development, project proposals, operations administration, investor relations and employee training. SG&A expenses for Q4, 2023 were $9.4 million, representing a decrease of $1.0 million compared to $10.4 million for Q4, 2022. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in share-based expenses of $0.6 million (Q4, 2022 - $1.3 million), a decrease in professional fees of $0.4 million (Q4, 2022 - $1.5 million), a decrease in office and general of $0.1 million (Q4, 2022 - $0.5 million), and a decrease of $4.2 million in expected credit loss & bad debt (Q4, 2022 - $4.5 million) offset by an increase in other expenses of $0.9 million (Q4, 2022 - $(0.1) million), an increase in foreign exchange charge of $0.3 million (Q4, 2022 - $Nil) and an increase in impairment of goodwill and changes in assumptions of cash flows of royalty receivables of $3.2 million (Q4, 2022 - $Nil). During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, SG&A expenses were $31.0 million, representing an increase of $1.9 million compared to $29.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase is mainly a result of employee compensation increasing by $1.5 million to $9.6 million (year ended December 31, 2022 - $8.1 million) mainly caused by additional headcount. As well, travel increased by $0.1 million to $0.4 million, the foreign exchange charge on materials was $0.3 million and goodwill impairment and changes in assumptions of cashflows from royalty receivables increased to $3.2 million. The expected credit loss and bad debt increased by $0.6 million due to an additional expense related to doubtful accounts and an amount related to the Company’s Italian subsidiary and a customer who both agreed on the final acceptance of a contract which resulted in the reversal of costs and profits in excess of billings on uncompleted contract. This was offset by the decrease of $1.0 million in professional fees, due to less legal, accounting and investor relation expenses, which are $4.1 million, compared to $5.1 million in the comparable period, a decrease in office and general, mainly related to the decrease of office expenses, to $1.0 million from $1.2 million, a variation of $0.2 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, and to a decrease in government grants of $0.2 million. Share-based compensation expense for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, was $0.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively (three and twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 - $1.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively), a decrease of $0.6 million and $2.4 million respectively, which is a non-cash item and relates mainly to 2021, 2022 and 2023 grants. Share-based payments expenses as explained above, are non-cash expenses and are directly impacted by the vesting structure of the stock option plan whereby options vest between 10% and up to 100% on the grant date and may require an immediate recognition of that cost. Depreciation on Property and Equipment The depreciation on property and equipment for the three and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, remained stable at $0.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, compared with $0.2 million and $0.6 million for the same periods in the prior year. The expense is determined by the nature and useful lives of the property and equipment being depreciated. Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses During the three-months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $0.5 million of R&D costs on internal projects, a decrease of $0.3 million as compared with $0.7 million in Q4, 2022. The decrease in Q4, 2023 is primarily related to a decrease of $0.1 million in materials and equipment (Q4, 2022 - $0.3 million), and a decrease of $0.2 million in other expenses, to $0.04 million (Q4, 2022 - $0.2 million). During the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred $2.2 million of R&D costs on internal projects, compared to $2.3 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to lower levels of R&D activities requiring less materials, equipment and subcontracting, decreasing to $0.6 million as compared with $1.2 million, offset by the increase in employee compensation to $1.1 million compared to $0.8 million for the same period in the prior year and the increase in other expenses to $0.5 million compared to $0.4 million for the same period in the prior year. In addition to internally funded R&D projects, the Company also incurred R&D expenditures during the execution of client funded projects. These expenses are eligible for Scientific Research and Experimental Development (“SR&ED”) tax credits. SR&ED tax credits on client funded projects are applied against cost of sales and services (see “Cost of Sales” above). Financial Expenses Finance costs for Q4 2023 represent an expense of $0.3 million, representing an increase year-over-year of approximately $0.3 million. The increase in finance expenses in Q4 2023 is primarily due to the interest and accretion related to the convertible debenture, convertible loan, and the increase in penalties and other interest. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, the finance costs represent an income of $1.3 million compared to an expense of $0.6 million for the 2022 comparable period, representing a favourable variation of $1.9 million year-over-year. The decrease in finance expenses is primarily due to the revaluation of the balance due on business combination due to negotiations between the Company’s Italian subsidiary and a customer who both agreed on the final acceptance of a contract, prior to final completion and the Company determined that a milestone related to the business combination would not be achieved. As a result, the contract did not attain the pre-determined milestone in connection with the balance due on business combination, and reversals of the liabilities were recorded offset by the increase in interest and accretion related to the convertible debenture and convertible loan. Finance expenses for fiscal 2023 also increased due to the convertible debenture, convertible loan, and the increase in penalties and other interest. Strategic Investments During the three-months ended December 31, 2023, the adjustment to fair market value of strategic investments for Q4, 2023 resulted in a loss of $0.5 million compared to a loss in the amount of $0.2 million in Q4, 2022, a variation of $0.3 million. During the twelve-months ended December 31, 2023, the adjustment to fair market value of strategic investments resulted in a loss of $0.3 million compared to a loss in the amount of $8.3 million for the same period in the prior year, a favorable variation of $8.0 million. The decrease in loss for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023, is attributable to the variation of the market value of the common shares owned by the Company of HPQ Silicon Inc. Comprehensive (Loss) Income The comprehensive loss for Q4, 2023 of $9.8 million compared to a loss of $10.8 million, in Q4, 2022, represents a variation of $1.0 million, and is primarily attributable to the factors described above, which have been summarized as follows: a decrease in product and service-related revenue of $0.3 million arising in Q4, 2023, but with a higher gross margin of 23%, and thus a gross profit of $0.7 million, as opposed to $0.5 million in Q4 of 2022,a decrease in SG&A expenses of $1.0 million arising in Q4, 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the allowance for credit loss of $4.2 million, decrease in professional fees, office and general, offset by increases in travel, other expenses, foreign exchange charge on materials, impairments and changes in assumptions in cashflows of royalty receivables,a decrease in share-based expenses of $0.6 million,a decrease in R&D expenses of $0.3 million primarily due to a decrease in subcontracting, materials and equipment, and other expenses, offset by an increase in employee compensation,an increase in finance costs of $0.3 million in Q4, 2023 primarily due to the interest and accretion on the convertible debenture, convertible loan, balance due on business combination and royalty receivable,a variation in the fair market value of strategic investments of $0.3 million. The comprehensive loss for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023, of $28.5 million compared to a loss of $32.2 million, for the same period in the prior year, represents a variation of $3.7 million, and is primarily attributable to the factors described above, which have been summarized as follows: a decrease in product and service-related revenue of $6.7 million, and annual gross margin of 28%, thus generating a gross profit of $3.4 million, as opposed to 43% margins in 2022 which generated $8.1 million in gross profit,an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.9 million was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation, travel, depreciation in property and equipment, depreciation of right-of-use assets, foreign exchange charge on materials, and the combination of credit loss, impairments and changes in cashflows of royalty receivables of $3.8 million which is offset by a decrease in professional fees, office and general, government grants and, other expenses,a decrease in share-based expenses of $2.4 milliona decrease in R&D expenses of $0.1 million primarily due to a decrease in subcontracting, materials and equipment, and an increase in employee compensation, investment tax credits and other expenses,a decrease in net finance costs (income) of $1.9 million is primarily due to the revaluation of balance due on business combination,a favourable variation in the fair market value of strategic investments of $8.0 million Liquidity and Capital Resources As at December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $1.8 million, included in the net working capital deficiency of $7.0 million. Certain working capital items such as billings in excess of costs and profits on uncompleted contracts do not represent a direct outflow of cash. The Company expects that with its cash, liquidity position, the proceeds available from the strategic investment and access to capital markets it will be able to finance its operations for the foreseeable future. The Company’s term loan balance at December 31, 2023 was $404,079, and varied only slightly since December 31, 2022. The increase from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, was mainly attributable to the accretion on the Economic Development Agency of Canada loan, which is interest free and will remain so, until the balance is paid over the 60-month period ending March 2029. In July 2023, the Company closed a brokered private placement for $3,030,000, bearing interest at 10%. During December 31, 2023, the Company closed a non-brokered private placement of a convertible loan for gross proceeds of $1,250,000, and bears interest at 3%. The average interest expense on the other term loans and convertible debenture is approximately 10%. The Company does not expect changes to the structure of term loans and convertible debentures and loans in the next twelve-month period. The Company maintained one credit facility which bears interest at a variable rate of prime plus 1%, therefore 8.20% at December 31, 2023. The Company will continue to reimburse the existing credit facility in 2024. OUTLOOK Consistent with the Company’s past practice, and in view of the early stage of market adoption of our core lines of business, the Company is not providing specific revenue or net income (loss) guidance for 2024. Overall Strategy PyroGenesis provides technology solutions to heavy industry that leverage the Company’s expertise in ultra-high temperature processes. The Company has evolved from its early beginnings of being a specialty-engineering firm to being a provider of a robust technology eco-system for heavy industry that helps address key strategic goals. The Company believes its strategy to be quite timely, as multiple heavy industries are committing to major carbon and waste reduction programs at the same time as many governments are increasingly funding environmental technologies and infrastructure projects – all the while both are making it a strategy to ensure the availability of critical minerals during the coming decades of increased output demand. While there can be no guarantees, the Company believes the evolution of its strategy beyond greenhouse gas emission reduction, to an expanded focus that encapsulates the key verticals listed in the section “Q4 Production Highlights”, both (i) improves the Company’s chances for success while (ii) also providing a clearer picture of how the Company’s wide array of offerings work in tandem to support heavy industry goals. PyroGenesis’ market opportunity is significant, as major industries such as aluminum, steelmaking, manufacturing, cement, chemicals, defense, aeronautics, and government require factory-ready, technology-based solutions to help steer through the paradoxical landscape of increasing demand and tightening regulations and material availability. As more of the Company’s offerings reach full commercialization, PyroGenesis will remain focused on attracting influential customers in broad markets while at the same time ensuring that operating expenses are controlled to achieve profitable growth. For 2024, the Company will continue to sharpen the focus on the strategy that structures the Company’s solution ecosystem under the three verticals noted previously: (i) energy transition & emission reduction, (ii) commodity security & optimization, and (iii) waste remediation, while introducing new solutions within each category – some self-initiated, and some in conjunction with (or at the behest of) industry partners. Cost Controls and Efficiencies PyroGenesis is competing hard while closely scrutinizing both potential and existing projects to ensure that the utilization of our labour and financial resources are optimized. As we have shown in the past, we will only engage in projects if the potential benefits to PyroGenesis is significant and well-understood. We continue to intensify our focus on project and budgetary clarity during this persistent period of elevated global inflationary pressures, by sourcing alternative suppliers and constantly adjusting project resources. We have also refined our early-stage project assessment process to allow for faster “go / no-go” decisions on project viability. Enhanced Sales and Marketing Against the backdrop of this 3-tiered strategy, the Company has been increasing sales, marketing, and R&D efforts in-line with – and in some cases ahead of – the growth curve for industrial change related to greenhouse gas reduction efforts. Macroeconomic Conditions With some continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, including ambiguity in the banking sector with regard to interest rate adjustments, and the continued inflationary pressures causing shifting demand dynamics across various industries at different times, it may be difficult to assess the future impact these events and conditions will have on our customer base, the end markets we serve and the resulting effect on our business and operations, both in the short term and in the long term. Despite these uncertainties, we continue to believe there is an accelerated need for our solutions in the industries we serve as heavy industry looks to continue the now global trends to decarbonization / energy transition, manufacturing utilizing both lighter metals (such as aluminum) and additive manufacturing, and tightening regulations around hazardous waste. We expect the uncertainties or other macroeconomic conditions in the various geographies in which we operate to continue to cause variability in our revenue quarter to quarter; however, we believe our diversity in both customer base and solution set will continue to be a strong asset of the business. The various military conflicts in the middle east and Eastern Europe continue to create some level of global economic uncertainty, as well as supply chain disruptions that can change at any time. However, it’s important to note that the Company does not have any operations, customers or supplier relationships in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, and as such are not directly impacted at a customer level in these countries. The Company does have customer relationships and projects in Poland and will continue to monitor the situation in the region regarding challenges to the completion of current projects, which at this time are not inhibited. As always, the Company monitors the impact of macroeconomic events and conditions on the business, operations, and financial or potential financial conditions. Generally, the Company believes that broad-based threats to global supply chains can afford the Company additional prominence, especially to the minerals and metals industries, as manufacturers seek alternatives to off-shore suppliers as well as technology that can optimize output or regain critical material or minerals from byproducts or waste – solutions that the Company currently offers. Business Line Developments The upcoming milestones which are expected to confirm the validity of our strategies are outlined below (please note that these timelines are estimates based on information provided to us by the clients/potential clients, and while we do our best to be accurate, timelines can and will shift, due to protracted negotiations, client technical and resource challenges, or other unexpected situations beyond our or the clients’ control): Business Line Developments: Near Term (0 – 3 months) Energy Transition & Emission Reduction Aluminum Remelting Furnaces: As mentioned in the Q2 2023 Outlook, the Company has been working on the development of aluminum remelting furnace solutions using plasma, for use by secondary aluminum producers or any manufacturer of aluminum components that uses recycled or scrap aluminum. With gas-fired furnaces responsible for much of the scope 1 emissions of secondary aluminum production, aluminum companies have been searching for solutions that can help in the decarbonization efforts of aluminum remelting and cast houses. The Company has two concepts: the retro-fitting of plasma torches in existing remelting and cast house furnaces that currently use other forms of heating, such as natural gas; and the manufacturing and sale of a PyroGenesis produced furnace based off the Company’s existing Drosrite™ metal recovery furnace design, which has been in use commercially for several years. Also as mentioned in the Q2 2023 and Q3 2023 Outlooks, the Company has been working with a number of different companies over the past few years towards these goals. The results from the conclusion of recent major tests, conducted in conjunction with these companies, have been very positive, and negotiations are underway for next step deployments and/or sales, with more detailed announcements on these projects expected during Q2 2024. Aluminum Furnace Tests: The Company is in final discussions with two (2) major aluminum companies for live furnace tests of plasma as a process heat source in melting and holding furnaces. If confirmed, these companies will each ship aluminum furnaces to PyroGenesis for installation at PyroGenesis’ factory, where plasma will be tested within the furnaces as a potential replacement for natural gas. These tests are similar to furnace tests that occurred during 2023 on site at PyroGenesis with another client, but these new potential tests will be conducted using larger furnaces. Steel Industry Energy Transition: the Company has received notice from one of the top 5 largest steelmakers globally of its intent to engage the Company in respect of a fuel transition study, to examine the potential use of plasma torches as a heat source at a major steel production facility. Contractual discussions in this regard are set to commence in the short term. New Industry Contract for Plasma Torches: as noted in the Q3 Outlook, the Company has been negotiating a large first-phase contract with a client (whose name is being withheld at present) in excess of $10 million that would signal PyroGenesis’ resumption of work in an industry that previously showed promise. Important players in this industry, which shall remain confidential at present, had previously heralded the potential use of plasma torches in conducting its primary objective, due to the increased speed and other advanced criteria at which the projects could be completed by using plasma torches compared to traditional approaches. In January 2024, the Company announced the signing of a framework master agreement with this client, which included the payment to the Company of a non-refundable downpayment of $667,000. Negotiations of a first substantial statement of work are ongoing and remain positive but depend in large part on the client’s ability to secure funding in a timely manner. While there is no guarantee this statement of work will be completed, if successful the Company foresees the potential for a multi-phase, multi-year partnership with the client that may result in many additional plasma torch orders over the next few years. Iron Ore Pelletization Torch Trials: as mentioned in previous Outlooks, the commissioning of the plasma torch systems – for use in the pelletization furnaces of a client previously identified as Client B – was underway, with the Company’s engineers onsite at Client B’s iron ore facility. The commissioning process includes installation, start-up, and site acceptance testing (SAT). The Company previously announced that it had shipped four 1 MW plasma torch systems for use in Client B’s iron ore pelletization furnaces, for trials toward potentially replacing fossil-fuel burners with plasma torches in the Client’s furnaces. As mentioned in the Q3 2023 Outlook, this project continues to move forward, however the commissioning suffered a series of unforeseeable delays caused by, among other things, damaging regional torrential rainstorms that flooded and damaged the facility’s electrical system and furnace components. Client B has informed the Company that they continued to experience technical challenges of its own at different stages during Q4, and the SAT was not completed as expected during the quarter. While frustrating, Client B has assured the Company that the project is not in jeopardy, and it remains committed to the trials. As of the date of this MD&A, Client B has indicated that they were continuing to move forward in resolving their own technical issues, and that the acceptance testing, and full trials will regain momentum. Although the timeframe remains uncertain, it is moving forward, and the Company believes the series of stops and starts are indicative of most if not all paradigm-shifting innovations within complex heavy industry factory settings, where the effects of existing atmospheric pollutants on new technology installations are unknown until attempted. In short, the factory settings of these trials are by nature extremely dirty and hazardous, which can cause a variety of unplanned, unforeseen challenges, each of which are dealt with by the committed group of scientists and engineers of both Client B and PyroGenesis. The client previously identified as Client A, a large international mining company which has also purchased a full plasma torch system for use in trials in its pelletization furnaces, continues its plasma torch initiative at its own pace, with no recent developments to report as per project timing or completion. Pyro Green-Gas: The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Pyro Green-Gas, is in advanced discussions with an international steel company for a project with a value of approximately $1.1 million. Aluminum Cast House Decarbonization: The Company is part of a tendered bid process for the testing of plasma within an aluminum cast house of a leading global aluminum company. Mining Industry Parts Manufacturer Decarbonization: The Company is in advanced discussions with a global parts manufacturer that supplies the metals and mining industries, to test plasma as a heat source in the client’s cast furnaces. Commodity Security & Optimization New Laser Cut Titanium Metal Powder Order: the Company has received notice from a global organization for a potential initial order of titanium metal powder “laser cut” that, if completed, is expected to occur in Q2 2024. Additive for Green Cement: the Company had previously announced a project with client Progressive Planet, for the development of amorphous silica from crystalline silica, for use as an additive to replace fly ash in cement, thereby creating green cement. With recent results announced by the Client showing promise, the Company expects additional information and next steps to be announced in Q2 2024. Product Qualification Process for Global Aerospace Firm: As mentioned in the Q3 2023 Outlook, based on information flow between the Company and the aerospace client previously announced, the Company believes that the 2-year long qualification process to approve the Company’s titanium metal powers for use by a global aerospace firm and their suppliers, will conclude in the near term. The Company continues to have strong confidence in this endeavour and that the final decision from the client is slated for the very near future. Of note, the Company previously confirmed that the qualification process includes both PyroGenesis’ “coarse cut” titanium metal powder, in addition to the “fine cut” titanium metal powder that had been previously discussed as undergoing the qualification process. The Company has some expectations that the course cut may receive qualification first, which would be advantageous to the Company, as the course cut has been produced and stockpiled in large amounts at the PyroGenesis facility, so delivery readiness would be enhanced. “FSR” Project: Fumed Silica (also known as Pyrogenic Silica) is a particle-size food-safe additive with a large surface area, used worldwide as a thickening agent in thousands of products such as milkshakes, adhesives, powdered foods, paints, inks, cosmetics, and beverages, to increase strength, viscosity, and flow control. PyroGenesis, on behalf of its client HPQ Silicon Inc., developed the Fumed Silica Reactor (“FSR”), a plasma-based process that creates fumed silica from quartz in a single and eco-friendly step. By eliminating the use of harmful chemicals generated by conventional fumed silica production methods, the groundbreaking FSR approach, if successful, will help contribute to the repatriation of silica production to North America while lowering the CO2 emissions and carbon footprint of the process. In a major step towards commercial-scale production, PyroGenesis successfully deployed [news release dated Oct 3, 2023] the FSR on a laboratory scale to produce fumed silica. A subsequent independent analysis [news release dated Nov 9, 2023] of the material conducted by McGill University confirmed the commercial-quality and thickening efficiency of the fumed silica produced by the FSR. The build of a pilot plant has commenced for pre-commercial sample batch production, for launch in Q2 2024. In addition to being the engineering services provider and developer of the forthcoming pilot plant, PyroGenesis owns a 10% royalty of client HPQ’s eventual fumed silica sales, with set minimums. This royalty stream, can, at any time, be converted by PyroGenesis into a 50% ownership in HPQ Silica Polvere Inc., the wholly owned subsidiary of HPQ Silicon that controls the fumed silica initiative and rights. Waste Remediation SPARC Refrigerant Waste Destruction System: The Company is in the final phase of a tendered bid process for the safe destruction of hazardous end-of-life refrigerants, such as CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, for a contract amount of approximately $6.5 million. The Company’s Steam Plasma Refrigerant Cracking (SPARC) system is a finalist for this Asian client’s initiative. Financial Payments for Outstanding Major Receivables: The Company has remained in continuous discussions with Radian Oil and Gas Services Company regarding the outstanding receivable of approximately US$8.0 million under the Company’s existing $25 million+ Drosrite™ contract. As previously announced, PyroGenesis agreed to a strategic extension of the payment plan, by the customer and its end-customer, geared to better align the pressures on the end-user’s operating cash flows created by increased business opportunities. These discussions have been positive, both in regard to the ongoing payment plan, and in regard to a potential new order of additional Drosrite™ systems, as the client’s cash flow situation and their new business opportunities move closer to resolution. The Company now expects payment of this receivable to be received in full within Q2 2024. Innovation Grants: as mentioned in the Q1 and Q2 Outlooks, the Company has applied for grants tailored to technology innovation and/or carbon reduction and expects to have results regarding these applications. Indications are positive and the Company expects to be in a position to make an announcement on these grants in Q2 2024. These grants are in the order of $1-2 million. Business Line Developments: Mid Term (3 – 6 months) Energy Transition & Emission Reduction Pyro Green-Gas: The Company previously announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pyro Green-Gas, is expected to sign a contract with a value of approximately between $10-15 million. The Company has significant doubts that, if the project commences, Pyro Green-Gas will participate. This project is not reflected in the stated backlog of either the financial statement or the MD&A. Commodity Security & Optimization Drosrite™ Factory Trials: The Company is in discussions with multiple aluminum manufacturers to conduct paid tests of its Drosrite™ aluminum dross processing systems within client factories, as a first step towards potential purchase of Drosrite™ systems. These potential clients are in France, the United States, southern Europe and Central Europe. Drosrite™ Systems: Separately, the Company is in various stage discussions with multiple aluminum manufacturers for potential purchase of Drosrite™ aluminum dross processing systems. Waste Remediation Plasma Resource Recovery System (PRRS): The Company is in early-stage discussions for the sale of a PRRS system, to a European entity, to transform municipal solid waste (MSW) into both energy and chemical products. PyroGenesis’ PRRS system is designed to process MSW, industrial waste, and hazardous waste, transforming them into commercially valuable products. These products include gaseous fuel for electricity and heat generation, slag, aggregates suitable for construction, and recoverable metals for recycling. The value for this potential contract is between approximately $25 to $30 million. Potential PAWDS Order: The Company is in initial negotiations with a company that conducts cleanup and destruction of waste from seawater. It has also indicated interest in carrying out similar initiatives on land in remote locations. Negotiations for a PyroGenesis Plasma Arc Waste Destruction System (PAWDS), similar to the type the Company designed and built for several of the U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, are in early stage. While there is no guarantee this contract is completed, if successful the Company may be contracted for multiple PAWDS systems over time. ** Please note that projects or potential projects previously announced that do not appear in the above summary updates should not be considered as at risk.

A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. Announces Withdrawal of Proposed Public Offering,2024-04-02T03:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. withdraws public offering, opts for direct offering and private placement. Anticipated total raise up to $7 million.","A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. Announces Withdrawal of Proposed Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. withdraws public offering, opts for direct offering and private placement. Anticipated total raise up to $7 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. to withdraw its proposed public offering and proceed with a registered direct offering and a private placement represents a significant shift in the company's capital-raising strategy. This pivot could imply a reassessment of market conditions or a strategic move to retain greater control over the offering process. The anticipated amount of up to $7,000,000 in combined offerings is relatively modest, which suggests that the company may be targeting specific investments or operational needs rather than a large-scale expansion.Investors should consider the implications of the company not using a placement agent. While this could reduce fees, it also means the company takes on the full responsibility of marketing and selling the offering, which could impact the effectiveness and reach of the distribution. The market's reception to this news will likely depend on the perceived reasons for the strategy shift and the company's ability to execute the direct offering successfully. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, A2Z Smart Technologies Corp.'s strategic shift to a direct offering without a placement agent is unusual but not unprecedented. It could be seen as a response to a more selective and cautious investment climate, particularly for tech companies. The direct offering approach may appeal to a specific subset of investors who are looking for potentially lower-priced entry points into the company's equity, as direct offerings can sometimes be priced more attractively than public offerings.However, the lack of a placement agent could also be a red flag for some investors, as it removes a layer of due diligence typically provided by such agents. The company's ability to close on these offerings will be a key indicator of investor confidence. If successful, it could signal a certain level of investor trust in the company's management and future prospects. Legal Expert The legal implications of A2Z Smart Technologies Corp.'s withdrawal of its public offering and the move to a registered direct offering are noteworthy. The company must navigate securities regulations carefully to ensure compliance with both the registered direct offering and the subsequent private placement. The timing and structure of these offerings will be critical to avoid any regulatory pitfalls.Furthermore, the company's clear statement that this press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities is a standard disclaimer aimed at compliance with securities law. It's a reminder to stakeholders that until the securities are registered or qualified under the relevant laws, the offering is not official and carries certain legal limitations on marketing and discussions with potential investors. 04/01/2024 - 11:00 PM TEL AVIV, ISRAEL / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / A2Z Smart Technologies Corp.

Reports Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. reports financial results for 2023, highlighting a positive net cash flow, Breakeven Cost per Bitcoin of $18,200, and plans to expand its self-mining hashrate. Despite a net loss of ($28.6) million, the company aims for operational efficiency and sustainability. With a current self-mining hashrate of 0.9 exahash, Gryphon targets reaching 10 exahash to establish itself as a key industry player. Positive Positive financial results for 2023 include total mining revenue of $21.1 million, Breakeven Cost per Bitcoin of $18,217, and an Adjusted EBITDA of $4.8 million. Gryphon's management team comprises former executives from Marathon and Riot, enhancing industry experience and success potential. The company aims for industry leadership, operational efficiency, and strategic expansion to deliver long-term shareholder value. Assets as of December 31, 2023, include $915,000 in cash and cash equivalents, 67.2 Bitcoin, totaling assets at $18.8 million. Gryphon projects a gross profit of approximately $16.6 million in 2024 based on an average Bitcoin price of $70,000 and network hashrate of 550 exahash. The company filed a motion for prejudgment attachment against Sphere 3D to secure $10 million in equity proceeds due to contract breaches, aiming for damages of $30 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Breakeven Cost are provided as non-GAAP measures, supplementing financial performance evaluation. Conference call details for April 2, 2024, are available for further insights on Gryphon's financial outlook and operational strategies. Negative The net loss of ($28.6) million in 2023 is a significant negative financial aspect for Gryphon. Non-cash expenses of $36.5 million impacted the company's financial performance, contributing to the net loss. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $4.8 million in 2023 from $7.4 million in the prior year, indicating a decline in operational earnings. The motion for prejudgment attachment against Sphere 3D reflects ongoing legal challenges and potential financial risks for Gryphon. Gryphon's Breakeven Cost per Bitcoin increased to $18,217 in 2023 from $14,964 in 2022, signaling higher operational costs. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. reflects a challenging fiscal year, marked by a slight decrease in mining revenue from the previous year and a significant net loss. The reported net loss of $28.6 million, despite being largely attributed to non-cash expenses, signals a substantial deviation from the net income of $3.5 million in 2022. This reversal from profit to loss may raise concerns among investors about the company's current profitability and future financial stability.Furthermore, the increase in Breakeven Cost per Bitcoin from $14,964 to $18,217 could indicate rising operational costs or decreased mining efficiency. In a highly competitive and volatile cryptocurrency market, maintaining low production costs is essential for profitability, especially post-halving when miner rewards are reduced. Gryphon's focus on renewable energy and operational efficiency, while commendable, must translate into tangible financial outcomes to reassure stakeholders of its long-term viability.The balance sheet presents a liquidity challenge with cash and equivalents of only $915,000 and an increase in cash holdings to $1.4 million by February 2024 does not significantly alter this perspective. The company's total liabilities equalling its total assets suggests a precarious financial position that could limit its ability to fund ambitious expansion plans or weather market downturns. Investors should monitor Gryphon's ability to manage its liabilities and improve its liquidity to ensure financial resilience. Market Research Analyst Gryphon's strategic goal to escalate its self-mining hashrate from 0.9 to 10 exahash is a bold move that could potentially transform the company's market standing. However, the execution of such expansion in the face of current financial losses requires careful scrutiny. The market's response to this announcement will likely hinge on investor confidence in Gryphon's capacity to achieve this tenfold increase efficiently and profitably.On the legal front, Gryphon's litigation against Sphere 3D could have a substantial financial impact. The pursuit of $30 million in damages for breach of contract could provide a financial windfall or become a protracted legal battle, incurring significant costs. Investors will need to consider the potential for recovery of damages against the risks and expenses associated with the lawsuit.The projected gross profit of $16.6 million for 2024, based on assumptions about Bitcoin's average price and network hashrate, suggests optimism about future performance. However, the cryptocurrency market's notorious volatility means that these projections are inherently uncertain. Gryphon's sensitivity analysis in their investor presentation may offer valuable insights into how changes in Bitcoin's price or mining difficulty could affect their financial outcomes. Legal Expert The legal action against Sphere 3D indicates Gryphon's proactive stance on contract enforcement and asset protection. The motion for prejudgment attachment to secure $10 million in equity proceeds is a strategic legal maneuver to safeguard potential judgment satisfaction. This reflects Gryphon's assertive approach to risk management, which is a positive signal to shareholders regarding the company's commitment to defending its interests.However, the outcome of such litigation is uncertain and can be a double-edged sword. A favorable ruling could result in a substantial financial gain for Gryphon, but an unfavorable outcome could mean additional losses. The acknowledgment of Sphere's financial troubles could also complicate the recovery of any awarded damages, adding another layer of risk for Gryphon and its investors.The mention of an independent third-party security firm confirming that Gryphon's systems were not compromised adds credibility to their claims and demonstrates due diligence in cybersecurity, an increasingly important aspect of digital asset management. 04/01/2024 - 04:45 PM LAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Gryphon Digital Mining, Inc. (Nasdaq:GRYP) (""Gryphon"" or the ""Company""), a bitcoin mining company that is independently certified to be 100% renewable and pursuing a negative carbon strategy, today reported financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.Rob Chang, CEO of Gryphon, commented, ""2023 and the year to date has been a transformational period for Gryphon, culminating in our Nasdaq listing in February. Our positive net cash flow in 2023 and Breakeven Cost (as defined below) per Bitcoin of approximately $18,200 demonstrate our industry leading operational efficiency. Our current self-mining hashrate stands at 0.9 exahash, and we have ambitious plans to expand. Our aim is to quickly reach 10 exahash, propelling us from a smaller player to a significant industry presence - all the while leading the way in financial sustainability and efficiency.""Mr. Chang added, ""Gryphon's management team, featuring former c-suite executives from industry giants Marathon and Riot, brings industry leading experience and a proven track record of success. With such pedigreed experience, we think we are well-equipped to achieve our goals and establish ourselves as a premier player in the market. In sum, with our strong foundation, operational efficiency, and strategic expansion plans, Gryphon believes it is well-positioned to navigate the challenges of the post-halving landscape, achieve a position as an industry leader, and deliver long-term value to our shareholders.""Financial Highlights of Fiscal Year 2023Total mining revenue for 2023 of $21.1 million, compared to the prior year $21.4 million in 2022.Breakeven Cost[1] per Bitcoin in 2023 was $18,217, compared to $14,964 in 2022. The company is focused on Breakeven Costs, which we believe is the best measure of what it costs to mine bitcoin on an operating basis. Some of our peers only focus on electricity costs and leave out the other costs to mine. We believe that a focus on the Breakeven Costs to produce a bitcoin at the mine level has the potential to offer the transparency needed to compare operations on an apples-to-apples basis.The Company recognized a net loss for the year of ($28.6) million, which includes non-cash expenses of $36.5 million. Non-cash expenses mainly consisted of depreciation, non-cash machine impairment and the non-cash notional valuation of the company's BTC loan. This compares to net income in 2022 of $3.5 million, which was also subject to non-cash expenses, and benefited from $24.5 million in non-cash gains due to a non-cash gain on the extinguishment of debt and the non-cash notional valuation of the company's BTC loan.Adjusted EBITDA[2] was $4.8 million, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year.[1] The Company defines Breakeven Cost per Bitcoin as (a) Cost of Revenues (excluding depreciation) divided by (b) total bitcoin generated and received from the hashrate contributed to the mining pool operator. The Company mined approximately 739 and 815 Bitcoin, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.[2] The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as (a) GAAP net income (loss) plus (b) adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense (benefit) and (4) adjustments for non-cash and non-recurring items which currently include (i) stock compensation expense, (ii) impairments of miners pursuant to ASC 360, (iii) impairments of digital currency pursuant to ASC 350 (iv) realized gain from use of digital assets as it relates to the bitcoin denominated note payable and (v) gain/loss on debt extinguishment.Balance Sheet Highlights as of December 31, 2023AssetsCash and cash equivalents: $915,000Bitcoin: 67.2Total current assets: $5.4 millionTotal mining assets (including deposits & intangible assets): $13.4 millionTotal assets: $18.8 millionLiabilities and Stockholders' EquityCurrent liabilities: $19.4 millionTotal liabilities: $19.4 millionAs of February 29, 2024, the Company had cash holdings of $1.4 million, Bitcoin holdings of approximately 60.4 Bitcoin with a fair market value of $3.7 million and 330.3 Bitcoin of Bitcoin denominated debt.2024 OutlookBased on an average price of Bitcoin of $70,000 and an average network hashrate of 550 exahash for 2024, we are currently projecting gross profit of approximately $16.6 million from mining operations. We have posted a gross profit sensitivity analysis in our investor presentation, which can be found on slide 14 of our investor deck on our company website.Sphere 3D LitigationOn March 25, 2024, Gryphon filed a motion with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking permission to file a motion for prejudgment attachment, seeking to secure $10 million in equity proceeds that Sphere recently received from a settlement related to Core Scientific's bankruptcy exit. We want to ensure that the funds are available to satisfy any judgment we may receive due to Sphere's breach of contract, where it entered into at least four hosting agreements with other providers, violating the exclusivity clause of its agreement with Gryphon. We are seeking damages amounting to at least $30 million. Over the last four months, Sphere has revealed its growing financial troubles. On November 28, 2023, in a filing in the Core Bankruptcy Action, Sphere's counsel acknowledged that the company was operating with a $200 million net loss and that recent losses had overtaken revenue by a two-to-one margin. Sphere's stated rationale for terminating the contract - that a malicious actor had diverted bitcoin transfers from Sphere to a third party - was not only unfounded, but was, in fact, evidence of gross negligence on the part of Sphere that allowed activities from malicious actors where Gryphon became the victim. Gryphon engaged an independent third-party security firm who confirmed that Gryphon's systems were not compromised.Conference Call InformationDate: April 2, 2024Time: 9:00am ETToll Free: 888-506-0062International: 973-528-0011Participant Access Code: 949507Webcast Link: https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/3030/50238Conference Call Replay InformationToll Free: 877-481-4010International: 919-882-2331Replay Passcode: 50238Webcast Replay: https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/3030/50238Non-GAAP FiguresIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides adjusted EBITDA and Breakeven Costs which are non-GAAP measures. Each of these are not financial measures of performance under GAAP and, as a result, these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Interim Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Breakeven Cost as a means of understanding, managing, and evaluating business performance and to help inform operating decision making. The Company relies primarily on its condensed consolidated financial statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our financial performance and uses the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.

The Fund's net asset value is $11.46, with distributions payable on specific dates. Investors should be aware of risks associated with the Fund, including exposure to below-investment grade investments and fluctuations in net asset value. Positive The Fund announces monthly distributions of $0.105 per common share. The annualized distribution rate is 10.99% based on the Fund's current net asset value of $11.46. Distributions are payable on specific dates in May, June, and July 2024. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including potential loss of investment and exposure to below-investment grade investments. Fluctuations in net asset value may occur due to factors like market spread, interest rates, and leverage. Shareholders may receive Form 1099-DIV in early 2025 for tax reporting purposes. Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in the Fund. Negative Investing in the Fund may result in little or no return or potential loss of investment. Exposure to below-investment grade investments (junk bonds) poses a risk to investors. Fluctuations in net asset value may be magnified due to the Fund's use of leverage. Shares of closed-end investment companies may trade at a discount from their net asset value. Financial Analyst The declaration of monthly distributions at an annualized rate of 10.99% by Principal Real Estate Income Fund is a significant indicator of the Fund's current performance and strategy. This distribution rate is notably high, which could imply a robust income-generating capability of the Fund's underlying real estate assets or potentially a strategic distribution policy to attract income-focused investors. However, the sustainability of such a high payout ratio should be scrutinized, especially in the context of the real estate market's cyclical nature and interest rate environment.Investors should also consider the Fund's use of leverage, which may magnify fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). While leverage can enhance returns when underlying assets perform well, it equally increases the risk of amplified losses during downturns. The Fund's exposure to 'junk bonds' adds another layer of risk, as these below-investment-grade securities carry a higher risk of default. The potential for trading at a discount to NAV in the secondary market is another aspect that investors must consider, as it can lead to capital erosion if shares are sold when the market valuation is below the NAV. Market Risk Analyst Investors in Principal Real Estate Income Fund should be aware of the specific risks associated with securities backed by commercial real estate assets. Market risks, such as declines in property values and occupancy rates, could directly impact the Fund's performance. Additionally, general and local economic conditions can significantly influence the real estate market, affecting the Fund's ability to maintain its distribution rate.It is also important to note the Fund's policy of not seeking to return the initial investment to investors, which indicates a focus on long-term capital appreciation rather than capital preservation. Given the Fund's investment strategy and the inherent volatility of real estate and credit markets, the distributions may include a return of capital, which essentially reduces the invested principal over time. This could be a concern for investors seeking to maintain or grow their initial investment. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the Fund's distributions can have varying characterizations, such as ordinary income, long-term capital gains, or return of capital, which have different tax implications for investors. The Fund's practice of providing a Section 19(a) notice offers an estimate of distribution sources, but the final tax characterization will only be confirmed after the fiscal year ends. Investors should plan for potential tax liabilities and consult with tax professionals to understand the implications of these distributions on their personal tax situation.Moreover, the Fund's status as a closed-end fund means shares are not issued continuously and the secondary market trading could lead to discrepancies between share price and NAV. This aspect may affect the tax treatment of gains or losses on the shares if sold. Understanding the tax considerations and the timing of distributions is important for shareholders in optimizing their investment strategy in relation to their tax liabilities. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM DENVER, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Principal Real Estate Income Fund (the ""Fund""), which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""PGZ,"" announced the declaration of monthly distributions of $0.105 per common share, payable on the dates noted below. Based on the Fund's current net asset value share price of $11.46 (as of market close on March 27, 2024), the distributions represent an annualized distribution rate of 10.99%. The following dates apply to the distributions declared: Ex Date Record Date Payable Date May 15, 2024 May 16, 2024 May 31, 2024 June 13, 2024 June 13, 2024 June 28, 2024 July 17, 2024 July 17, 2024 July 31, 2024 RISKS This press release is not for tax reporting purposes but is being provided to announce the amount of the Fund's distributions. In early 2025, after definitive information is available, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV, if applicable, specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return (e.g., ordinary income, long-term capital gain or return of capital). An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or even all of your investment and exposure to below-investment grade investments (i.e., ""junk bonds""). The Fund's net asset value will vary and its distribution rate may vary and both may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the market spread over a specified benchmark, market interest rates and performance of the broader equity markets. Fluctuations in net asset value may be magnified as a result of the Fund's use of leverage. Therefore, before investing you should carefully consider the risks that you assume when you invest in the Fund's common shares. Securities backed by commercial real estate assets are subject to market risks similar to those of direct ownership of commercial real estate assets including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, declines in rental or occupancy rates and risks related to general and local economic conditions. The Fund's investment objectives and policies are not designed to seek to return the initial investment to investors that purchase shares. Sources of distributions to shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and return of capital. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. If a distribution includes anything other than net investment income, the fund provides a Section 19(a) notice of the best estimate of its distribution sources at that time, available at www.principalcef.com. These estimates may not match the final tax characterization (for the full year's distributions) contained in shareholders' 1099-DIV forms after the end of the year. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain an annual report or semi-annual report which contains this and other information visit www.principalcef.com or call 855.838.9485. Please read them carefully before investing. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value and initial offering prices. NOT FDIC INSURED | May Lose Value | No Bank Guarantee The Fund is a closed-end fund and does not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker.

Terran Orbital Reports Record 2023 Financial Results,2024-04-01T20:31:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,"Terran Orbital  (NYSE: LLAP) reported record 2023 revenue of $135.9 million, up 44% year-over-year, with a gross profit of $8.6 million.

The company signed over $2.7 billion in new awards, manufactured 78 satellites for Lockheed Martin, and introduced seven new standard bus designs. Despite a net loss of $151.8 million, Terran Orbital's CEO remains optimistic about the company's position in the market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in revenue by 44% year-over-year to $135.9 million is a strong indicator of Terran Orbital's growth trajectory. This is particularly noteworthy given the capital-intensive nature of the aerospace and defense industry. The ability to secure over $2.7 billion in new awards, which translates into a significant backlog, provides visibility into future revenue streams. However, the net loss of $151.8 million, despite an improvement from the previous year, raises questions about the company's path to profitability. The cash balance of $71.7 million, juxtaposed with $313.8 million in gross debt obligations, indicates a substantial leverage position that investors should monitor closely. The capital expenditure increase to $23.1 million reflects ongoing investments in growth, yet it's essential to evaluate whether these expenditures are translating into sustainable profit margins. Aerospace Market Analyst The introduction of seven new standard bus designs and the launch of the Responsive Space Initiative suggest that Terran Orbital is actively innovating to meet market demands for quicker satellite deployment. The emphasis on responsiveness in space aligns with current industry trends towards faster and more flexible satellite services. The commissioning of new facilities and expansion efforts indicate a strategic move to scale operations and capacity. However, the estimated $6.1 million negative impact from EAC adjustments on firm fixed price programs could signal issues with cost estimation or project management that need to be addressed to maintain profitability and competitive pricing. Defense Industry Analyst Manufacturing 78 satellites for Lockheed Martin for Space Development Agency programs places Terran Orbital at the center of significant defense and space initiatives, potentially increasing its strategic importance to national security interests. The long-term implications of such partnerships could lead to more stable revenue streams and an enhanced industry reputation. However, the defense sector is known for its rigorous contracting and potentially volatile funding, subject to political and budgetary constraints. The reliance on a few large contracts, such as the $2.4 billion related to Rivada Space Networks, may expose the company to risks if these contracts face delays or reductions. Diversification of the customer base and contract portfolio would be a prudent strategy to mitigate such risks. 04/01/2024 - 04:31 PM Record 2023 revenue of $135.9 million up 44% year-over-year Record 2023 gross profit of $8.6 million improved $25.8 million over prior year Manufacturing 78 satellites for Lockheed Martin for Space Development Agency programs Signed over $2.7 billion in new awards in 2023 representing more than 360 satellites Introduced seven new standard bus designs, spanning multiple size classes of satellites Launched new Responsive Space Initiative to deliver standard buses in 30 days, with integrated payloads in 60 days Commissioned new 50 Tech facility and broke ground on Goodyear expansion facility $71.7 million cash balance as of December 31, 2023 BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Terran Orbital Corporation (NYSE: LLAP) (""Terran Orbital"" or the ""Company""), a leading manufacturer of satellite products primarily serving the aerospace and defense industries, today announced financial results and operational highlights for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Generated record revenue of $135.9 million up 44% year-over-year Gross profit of $8.6 million compared to $17.3 million loss in 2022 Adjusted gross profit(1) of $19.4 million compared to $2.2 million loss in 2022 Net loss of $151.8 million improved from a net loss of $164.0 million in prior year Marc Bell, Co-Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Terran Orbital said, “I am pleased to report our company’s strong results for 2023. Our revenue growth and gross margin improvement affirm the strength of our strategy and execution. The future of space is responsive, and Terran Orbital is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing market segment. We're focused on sustainable growth, achieving profitability, and delivering solutions that meet evolving customer needs. Terran Orbital isn't just keeping pace with disruption, we're at the forefront, shaping the future of the space economy through responsive space.” Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $31.6 million, compared to $31.9 million for the same quarter in 2022, and $135.9 million for the full year, up 44% over the prior year. The increase in annual revenue was primarily due to the continued and increased level of progress made in satisfying our customer contracts and reflects the ongoing favorable impact from significant contract wins and modifications in recent periods. Revenue for 2023 was negatively impacted by an estimated $6.1 million of EAC adjustments on certain firm fixed price programs. EAC represents the total estimated cost-at-completion and is comprised of direct material, direct labor and manufacturing overhead applicable to a performance obligation. Cost of sales for the quarter was $32.1 million compared to $42.7 million in the same period in the prior year, and $127.4 million for the full year, compared to $111.5 million for the prior year. The increase in cost of sales for the full year was primarily due to an increase of $25.8 million in direct and indirect program costs and $2.5 million in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a decrease of $6.8 million in share-based compensation expense, $3.9 million loss reserve, and $2.1 million in scrap and obsolete materials and services. Cost of sales for the full year included an estimated negative impact of $2.1 million due to EAC adjustments on certain programs and non-recurring changes in estimates related to inventory. Gross (loss) profit was $(0.5) million for the quarter, compared to $(10.8) million in the same period in the prior year, and $8.6 million for the full year, compared to $(17.3) million for the prior year. Excluding share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization included in cost of sales, Adjusted Gross (Loss) Profit(1) was $2.2 million for the quarter, compared to $(7.3) million for the same period in the prior year, and $19.4 million for the full year, compared to $(2.2) million in the prior year. EAC adjustments negatively impacted gross profit and Adjusted Gross Profit by an estimated $4.0 million during 2023. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $27.2 million for the quarter, compared to $27.6 million for the same period in the prior year, and $117.5 million for the full year, compared to $111.9 million for prior year. The increase for the full year was primarily driven by increases in salaries and wages, research and development expenses, business development expenses, depreciation and amortization, and other operating costs, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expense and accounting, legal, and other professional fees. Net loss was $42.8 million in the quarter, compared to a net loss of $33.0 million for the same period in the prior year, and $151.8 million for the full year, compared to $164.0 million for the prior year. The improvement in annual net loss was driven by the net positive impact of the items noted above as well as the absence of debt extinguishment in 2023, partially offset by the change in the fair values of warrant and derivative liabilities and higher interest expense in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $(20.6) million for the quarter 2023, compared to $(26.1) million in the same period in the prior year, and $(77.4) million for the full year, compared to $(69.5) million for the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was primarily due to an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a result of our growth initiatives, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted Gross Profit. Capital expenditures totaled $23.1 million in 2023, up from $22.5 million in 2022. Balance Sheet and Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, Terran Orbital had $71.7 million of cash on hand and approximately $313.8 million in gross debt obligations. The Company’s debt included $16.9 million in connection with an obligation under one of its PIPE investment subscription agreements, which is payable in cash or equity at the Company’s option, subject to certain limitations. Backlog Backlog represents the estimated dollar value of executed contracts, including both funded (firm orders for which funding is authorized and appropriated) and unfunded portions of such contracts, for which work has not been performed. The unfunded portion of enforceable contracts is accounted for as variable consideration and is reported at our estimate of the most likely amount to which the Company is expected to be entitled. Although backlog reflects business associated with contracts that are considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or contract cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog.

Exploration drilling results added new resources. The Company's Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource estimates remained relatively stable. Inferred Mineral Resource estimates increased, driven by successful drilling programs and modeling. Positive Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve estimates at the three producing assets decreased in silver and gold ounces. Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource estimates for the four assets remained stable in tonnes but decreased in silver ounces and increased in gold ounces. Exploration drilling added new Mineral Resources and identified additional mineralized areas. Inferred Mineral Resource estimates increased in gold ounces. Metal price assumptions for Mineral Reserve and Resource estimates were higher in 2023 compared to 2022. The Company focused on exploration, definition, and expansion of mineral resources, along with mine planning and plant operations optimization. The Company's Annual Information Form for 2023 has been filed on SEDAR+ and the Annual Report on Form 40-F with the SEC. Negative None. Mining Engineer The disclosed estimates of Mineral Reserves and Resources are pivotal for understanding the operational longevity and financial sustainability of First Majestic Silver Corp. A 2% decrease in Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves in tonnes, alongside a 9% and 14% decrease in silver and gold ounces respectively, could signal a reduction in future production capacity, potentially impacting the company's revenue streams. Conversely, the increase in Measured and Indicated Resources, especially the 207,000 ounces of gold added at Jerritt Canyon, suggests a positive outlook for long-term resource availability. This mixed picture reflects the dynamic nature of mining operations where ongoing exploration and resource definition play important roles in replacing depleted reserves and sustaining production levels.Investors should note that the modifications in cut-off grades, driven by updated economic parameters, indicate a recalibration of the company's operational strategy to align with market conditions. The increased metal price assumptions for both silver and gold used in estimating the December 31, 2023, Mineral Reserves and Resources, compared to the previous year, suggest an optimistic outlook on metal prices. This could have implications for the company's profitability, assuming these price levels are realized in the market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the exploration efforts and drilling results of First Majestic are significant. The company's strategic focus on near-mine or brownfield targets, which constitute approximately 85% of their exploration drilling, is indicative of a prudent approach aimed at enhancing the value of existing assets. This exploration strategy can be more cost-effective and carry lower risk compared to greenfield exploration, which is typically more speculative in nature.The reported production figures, with a record annual production of 9.6 million AgEq ounces, reflect operational efficiency and could be a positive driver for the company's stock performance. However, the decrease in Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves may raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain such production levels in the future. Investors should consider the balance between short-term production success and the implications of reserve depletion on long-term sustainability. Market Research Analyst The mining sector is sensitive to changes in commodity prices and First Majestic's updated metal price assumptions are a testament to this. The increase in assumed prices for silver and gold could be interpreted as an optimistic market outlook, which may influence investor sentiment. It is important to monitor how these assumptions compare with actual market trends, as discrepancies could lead to adjustments in future reserve and resource estimations.Furthermore, the temporary suspension of mining activities at the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine, with a focus on exploration and optimization, could be viewed as a strategic move to enhance the value of the asset before resuming production. The addition of significant gold ounces to the Inferred Mineral Resources at Jerritt Canyon is promising and may contribute to future production growth. Stakeholders should consider the potential of these resources to offset the reported reserve decreases and contribute to the company's market valuation. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - April 1, 2024) - First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE: AG) (TSX: FR) (FSE: FMV) (the ""Company"" or ""First Majestic"") is pleased to announce the 2023 Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates for its four material mineral properties with an effective date of December 31, 2023. Three material properties are currently in production: the San Dimas Silver/Gold Mine, the Santa Elena Silver/Gold Mine, and the La Encantada Silver Mine. The fourth material property, the Jerritt Canyon Gold Mine, is currently in temporary suspension in respect of mining activities, with the Company currently focused on exploration, definition, and expansion of the mineral resources, and the optimization of mine planning and plant operations.During 2023, the Company completed a total of 143,454 metres of exploration drilling. Approximately 85% of this drilling was focused on near-mine or brownfield targets while the remainder was focused on greenfield targets exploring for new discoveries. In 2023, the Company's Measured and Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource estimates remained relatively unchanged in contained silver equivalent (""AgEq"") ounces; exploration results also successfully offset of Reserve depletion following record annual production of 9.6 million AgEq ounces. 2023 HIGHLIGHTS (compared to prior Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates on December 31, 2022) Proven and Probable (""P&P"") Mineral Reserve estimates at the Company's three producing material assets totalled 122.5 million AgEq ounces consisting of 56.1 million ounces of silver and 671,000 ounces of gold, which represents a 2% decrease in tonnes, a 9% decrease in silver ounces and a 14% decrease in gold ounces. Measured and Indicated (""M&I"") Mineral Resource estimates (inclusive of Mineral Reserves) for the four material assets totalled 346.6 million AgEq ounces consisting of 95.9 million ounces of silver and 2.9 million ounces of gold, which represents a 1% increase in tonnes, a 6% decrease in silver ounces and a 3% increase in gold ounces, respectively. The changes to Mineral Resource estimates reflect mining depletion and updated cut-off grades from new economic parameters including costs, metal recoveries and metal prices. Exploration drilling results added new Mineral Resources and identified additional mineralized areas. Jerritt Canyon added 207,000 ounces of gold to its M&I Mineral Resource estimates.Inferred Mineral Resource estimates for the Company's four material assets totalled 283.8 million AgEq ounces consisting of 65 million ounces of silver and 2.6 million ounces of gold, which represents a 6% increase in tonnes, a 12% decrease in silver ounces and a 10% increase in gold ounces. Jerritt Canyon added 360,000 ounces of gold to its Inferred Mineral Resource driven by a combination of expansionary drilling results, modelling of additional mineralized areas and a decreased cut-off grade.2023 PRODUCTION TABLEUnitsSANDIMASSANTA ELENALA ENCANTADAJERRITT CANYONTOTALOre ProcessedTonnes875,345882,592 966,392177,643 2,901,972Material from Reserves Mined and ProcessedTonnes764,444882,592 152,259 -- 1,799,295Material Mined from Areas Not in ReservesTonnes110,900--814,134 177,643 1,102,677 Silver Produced Ounces 6,355,308 1,176,5912,718,856 --10,250,755Gold Produced Ounces 76,964 100,535321 21,101 198,921 Silver-Equivalent Produced from Gold Ounces 6,434,6128,395,20126,7661,767,08316,623,662Silver-Equivalent Produced Ounces 12,789,9209,571,7922,745,6221,767,08326,874,417 Silver‐equivalent ounces are estimated considering metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery for the corresponding mineral type/mineral process and the metal payable of the corresponding contract of each mine. Details as to the method of calculation can be found in the applicable tables in each mine section of the Company's Annual Information Form dated April 1, 2024 (the ""AIF"").Metal price assumptions used to estimate the December 31, 2023 Mineral Reserves were $22.50/oz for silver and $1,850/oz for gold. This compares to the previous metal price assumptions of $21.50/oz for silver and $1,750/oz for gold used to calculate the Company's 2022 Mineral Reserve estimates.Metal price assumptions used to estimate the December 31, 2023 Mineral Resources were $24.50/oz for silver and $2,000/oz for gold. This compares to the previous metal price assumptions of $23.00/oz for silver and $1,900/oz for gold used to calculate the Company's 2022 Mineral Resources estimates.MINERAL RESERVE AND MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATESAs of December 31, 2023, P&P Mineral Reserve estimates at the Company's three producing material assets totalled 56.2 million ounces of silver and 671,000 ounces of gold, which represents a total of 122.5 million AgEq ounces. Santa Elena's P&P Mineral Reserve estimates remained relatively unchanged despite record production of 9.6 million AgEq ounces from Ermitaño. At La Encantada, P&P Mineral Reserves estimates increased mainly due to mine design updates in the Milagros ore body. At San Dimas, P&P Mineral Reserve estimates decreased due to a combination of depletion, cost driven increase of cut-off grade and the exclusion of low tonnage pillars.

Inferred Mineral Resources were not considered to be converted into Mineral Reserve estimates.AgEq is estimated considering metal price assumptions, metallurgical recovery for the corresponding mineral type/mineral process and the metal payable of the selling contract. (a) The AgEq grade formula used was: AgEq Grade = Ag Grade + Au Grade * (Au Recovery * Au Payable * Au Price) / (Ag Recovery * Ag Payable * Ag Price).(b) Metal prices considered for Mineral Reserve estimates were $22.5/oz Ag and $1,850/oz Au for all sites.(c) Other key assumptions and parameters include: metallurgical recoveries; metal payable terms; direct mining costs, processing costs, indirect and G&A costs and sustaining costs. These parameters are different for each mine and mining method assumed and are presented in each mine section of the AIF.A two-step constraining approach has been implemented to estimate Mineral Reserves for each mining method in use: A General Cut-Off Grade (""GC"") was used to delimit new mining areas that will require development of access, infrastructure and all sustaining costs. A second Incremental Cut-Off Grade (""IC"") was considered to include adjacent mineralized material which recoverable value pays for all associated costs, including but not limited to the variable cost of mining and processing, indirect costs, treatment, administration costs and plant sustaining costs but excludes the access development assumed to be covered by the block above the GC grade.The cut-off grades, metallurgical recoveries, payable terms and modifying factors used to convert Mineral Reserves from Mineral Resources are different for all mines and are presented in each mine section in the AIF.Modifying factors for conversion of resources to reserves include consideration for planned dilution which is based on spatial and geotechnical aspects of the designed stopes and economic zones, additional dilution consideration due to unplanned events, materials handling and other operating aspects, and mining recovery factors. Mineable shapes were used as geometric constraints.Tonnage is expressed in thousands of tonnes; metal content is expressed in thousands of ounces. Metal prices and costs are expressed in USD.Numbers have been rounded as required by reporting guidelines. Totals may not sum due to rounding.The technical reports from which the above-mentioned information is derived are cited under the heading ""Technical Reports for Material Properties"" in the AIF.M&I Mineral Resource estimates for the four material assets totalled 346.6 million AgEq ounces consisting of 95.9 million ounces of silver and 2.9 million ounces of gold. The M&I tonnes increased by 1% compared to 2022. M&I Mineral Resources at Jerritt Canyon increased by 207,000 gold ounces primarily due to successful drilling programs at the SSX and Smith mines that expanded the mineralization, combined with an overall decrease in gold cut-off grade from assumptions related to increased gold prices and lower costs due to self-performed mining instead of third-party contractor mining. M&I Mineral Resource estimates are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserve estimates. Inferred Mineral Resource estimates for the Company's four material properties totalled 283.8 million AgEq ounces consisting of 65 million ounces of silver and 2.6 million ounces of gold. Successful exploration drilling at Jerritt Canyon outlined new Inferred Resource estimates, additional mineralized areas were modeled, and a reduction of the gold cut-off grade all contributed to an increase in Inferred Resources totalling 360,000 ounces of gold.

Positive Revenue for 2023 increased by $2M (29%) to $9.1M compared to the previous year. SG&A expenses were reduced by $2.1M (22%) in 2023, contributing to improved financial performance. Net cash used in operating activities decreased by $2.5M in 2023, reflecting better cash management. A $2.8M reserve was set against slow-moving inventory for Africa in Q4'23 and 2023. A $1.5M cash payment was received in Q1'24 for a 2-year extension/expansion of a biometric technology license. CEO Mike DePasquale highlighted the company's progress towards profitability in 2023, driven by revenue growth and cost-cutting initiatives. BIO-key aims to focus on top-line growth and cost reduction in 2024 to achieve profitability in the coming quarters. The company anticipates increased deployment of enhanced IAM solutions as enterprises shift to the cloud and address cybersecurity concerns. BIO-key plans to launch Passkey:YOU, a passwordless authentication solution, to capitalize on the growing trend of passkey authentication embraced by tech giants like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. The company's business model is predominantly SaaS or subscription-based, with a focus on leveraging channel partners for sales. BIO-key remains committed to pursuing cost reduction initiatives in 2024 to enhance cash flow and profitability. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 29% revenue growth and the reduction in SG&A expenses by $2.1M (22%) indicates a positive trajectory towards profitability for BIO-key International, Inc. This is significant in the context of investor sentiment, as companies demonstrating effective cost management alongside revenue expansion are often rewarded with increased investor confidence. The ability to trim costs while growing top-line revenue is a strong signal of management's operational efficiency.However, the mention of a $2.8M non-cash reserve against slow-moving inventory, specifically for African initiatives, raises a flag regarding the company's inventory management and regional sales strategy. Inventory write-downs can be a concern as they reflect on the demand forecasting and market penetration capabilities of a company. It's essential to monitor how the company addresses this issue to prevent recurring write-downs, which could impact future profitability.The cash payment of $1.5M received for the extension/expansion of a biometric technology license is an immediate positive for liquidity. Yet, investors should consider the sustainability of such payments and whether they represent recurring revenue or are one-off boosts to cash flow. Market Research Analyst BIO-key's focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions and specifically on passwordless and token-less authentication, positions the company within a growing cybersecurity market. The transition to cloud services and the increasing regulatory requirements for robust security practices, such as multi-factor authentication, suggest a rising demand for BIO-key's product offerings. The launch of Passkey:YOU could be a strategic move to capture market share in the evolving landscape of digital security.With the IAM market expected to grow, the company's strategic partnerships with over 150 Channel Alliance Partners and its SaaS-based business model may provide a competitive edge. The company's 65% blended gross margin on annually recurring services and license fee revenues (ARRs) is impressive, as it indicates a healthy profitability potential from core operations. The focus on asset-light go-to-market strategies is also prudent in maintaining operational flexibility. Cybersecurity Expert The increasing prevalence of cybersecurity incidents and the subsequent regulatory changes are creating a fertile ground for companies like BIO-key that offer enhanced IAM solutions. The shift towards passwordless authentication, supported by industry giants like Google and Microsoft, underscores the relevance of BIO-key's new product, Passkey:YOU. Their approach to solving authentication challenges, such as roving users and unauthorized account sharing, addresses specific pain points within the cybersecurity landscape.However, the effectiveness of BIO-key's solutions in a competitive market hinges on their ability to integrate seamlessly with existing IT ecosystems and support emerging security standards. The company's ability to convert its slow-moving hardware inventory into cash will also be critical in maintaining a healthy balance sheet and funding ongoing innovation and market expansion efforts. 04/01/2024 - 04:45 PM HOLMDEL, N.J., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BIO-key® International, Inc. (Nasdaq: BKYI), an innovative provider of workforce and customer Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions featuring passwordless, phoneless and token-less Identity-Bound Biometric (IBB) authentication, announced preliminary results for its fourth quarter (Q4’23) and year ended December 31, 2023 (2023). The independent audit of BIO-key’s 2023 financial statements has not yet been completed and, therefore, the figures included herein are subject to change. BIO-key will host an investor call tomorrow at 10:00am ET (details below). Preliminary Results Highlights: 2023 revenue rose $2M (29%) to $9.1M2023 SG&A trimmed by $2.1M (22%)Net cash used in operating activities was reduced by $2.5M in 2023Q4’23 & 2023 cost of hardware reflects $2.8M reserve against slow moving inventory for Africa$1.5M cash payment received in Q1’24 for 2-year extension/expansion of biometric technology license CEO CommentaryBIO-key CEO, Mike DePasquale commented, “BIO-key made solid progress on our path to profitability in 2023, driven by 29% revenue growth and cost cutting initiatives that trimmed SG&A expense by $2.1M, largely in the second half of the year. We look to build on this record in 2024, focusing on top-line growth opportunities balanced with further efforts to reduce costs. We believe our growing global distribution and customer base puts us in a strong position to reach profitability over the next several quarters. “Looking forward, we expect increased deployment of enhanced IAM solutions as enterprises transition to the cloud and respond to a growing array of security incidents that highlight potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This trend is further supported by regulatory requirements and increasingly stringent Cyber Insurance underwriting standards that mandate enhanced multi-factor authentication and/or passwordless security solutions that are at the core of our offerings. “As passwordless authentication gains traction, our solutions are well positioned to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities with technologies they already use, while also supporting their future needs with a cost-effective platform. We also expect that passkey authentication, which has been embraced by Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, will continue to expand its penetration in 2024. To capitalize on this opportunity, BIO-key will soon launch, Passkey:YOU, a unique passwordless authentication solution that does not require the use of phones or hardware tokens, with planned enhancements expected later in the year. Outlook“The current climate of broad enterprise adoption of MFA to replace passwords presents opportunities for us to leverage our unique differentiators and exploit gaps in existing IAM approaches. Gaps include challenges of authenticating users that ‘rove’ among workstations and preventing unauthorized account sharing and delegation. “Today BIO-key has more than 600 customers globally. Our business is predominately SaaS or subscription based, and most of our new business is sold through channel partners. We remain focused on an asset light go-to-market plan that leverages more than 150 Channel Alliance Partners, along with our targeted internal sale team. Together, we believe these channels position BIO-key for meaningful top- and bottom-line improvement in 2024, building on our base of annually recurring services and license fee revenues (ARRs) with a blended gross margin of approximately 65%. “We will also continue to pursue cost reduction initiatives in 2024, to help accelerate our path to positive cash flow and profitability. Our Q4’23 bottom line included a $2.8M non-cash reserve on slow moving hardware inventory purchased for our Africa initiatives. We continue to explore opportunities to convert this inventory into cash. Importantly, during the first quarter of 2024 we enhanced our financial position with the execution of a $1.5M, 2-year license extension for a long-time customer and receipt the full license payment. We also continue to pursue large enterprise opportunities through our direct sales channel. For these and other reasons, we are particularly excited about BIO-key’s outlook for 2024.” Preliminary Financial ResultsPlease note that the audit of our 2023 financial statements has not been completed by our independent registered public accounting firm as of the date of this press release and are, therefore, subject to change. 2023 revenues increased 29% to $9.1M from $7.0M in 2022, driven by increases in license fees (of $1.1M), hardware sales (of $0.5M); and services revenue (of $0.4M). Service revenue benefitted from custom services for new customer installations, Swivel Secure service fees, and conversions from on-premises deployments of PortalGuard to our PortalGuard IDaaS cloud platform. Hardware revenue benefitted from fourth quarter sales to an international defense agency in 2023. Likewise, Q4’23 revenue grew 26% over Q4’22, also driven by the aforementioned hardware sales to an international defense agency. The Company took a $2.8M reserve on inventory due to slow moving inventory purchased for large projects in Nigeria in Q4’23. This reserve was included in cost of hardware, which caused a decline in gross profit to $3.3M in 2023, from $4.6M in 2022 and a decline in gross margin to 36.5% in 2023 from 65.2% in 2022. BIO-key continues to explore opportunities to sell the product, including other markets, to convert inventories to cash.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/01/2024 - 04:55 PM KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVRG) today filed its triennial Integrated Resource Plan with the Missouri Public Service Commission. This outlines the plan to meet customer electricity needs over the next 20 years. It includes additional renewable and dispatchable generation to meet growing customer demand driven by economic development and increased capacity requirements established by the Southwest Power Pool. Companywide over the next 20 years, Evergy projects it will need to add 5,100 megawatts of renewable energy from wind and solar and 5,200 MW of firm, dispatchable generation – including 2,500 MW of new, hydrogen-capable natural gas generation across 2029-2032 – as its service area is experiencing record-setting economic development. The 2024 plan includes 1,900 MW of additional generation over what was anticipated in its 2023 update filing. Evergy evaluates the costs for operating existing plants, adding new supply-side generation, and expanding demand-side programs to develop a plan that has the lowest risk-adjusted cost compared to alternative plans. Reflecting this analysis and consistent with previous plans, the company’s 2024 plan calls for the retirement of more than 4,500 MW of coal-based generation and the continued growth of demand-side programs over that period. View a timeline of the plan. In the first five years, the plan includes 143 MW of natural gas generation added to Evergy’s portfolio in 2024 and the addition of 600 MW of solar energy in 2027 and 450 MW in 2028. “Economic development opportunities in Missouri and Kansas are at historic levels and our plan reflects the generation needed to support that growth while maintaining affordable and reliable service for our customers,” Evergy President and Chief Executive Officer David Campbell said. “We will invest in renewable energy resources and dispatchable generation to serve the growing electricity load in our region, maintaining the diverse energy mix that has served our customers well.” Evergy serves its customers with a balanced generation portfolio that includes approximately 4,600 MW of renewable energy. Later this year, the company expects to surpass a milestone of generating 150 million megawatt hours of wind energy since the inception of its wind portfolio in the early 2000s. With a commitment to a responsible transition to more sustainable energy sources, to date the company has retired 2,400 MW of fossil-fuel generation. Today, roughly half of the energy that serves Evergy customers comes from carbon-free sources, including the Wolf Creek nuclear plant and renewable energy sources. The company has reduced its carbon emissions by more than 50 percent since 2005. Evergy’s goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 70 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. A combination of supportive policies and ongoing technology advancements will be needed to achieve net-zero by 2045. “A diverse energy portfolio positions Evergy well for the responsible transition of our generation fleet,” Campbell said. “We remain committed to advancing reliability, affordability and sustainability as we replace older, higher-cost plants with newer technologies. Firm, dispatchable generation resources will provide the capacity needed to ensure reliability for our customers while our continued investment in renewables supports our carbon reduction goals. Many large commercial and industrial customers specifically require access to affordable renewable energy, and we are well positioned to deliver on that requirement.” The Integrated Resource Plan filed today at the Missouri Public Service Commission is a triennial filing that includes details related to the Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West resource plans. A similar filing will be made in Kansas in May, which will include details related to the Evergy Kansas Central portion of the plan. About Evergy Evergy, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVRG), serves 1.7 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. Evergy’s mission is to empower a better future. Our focus remains on producing, transmitting and delivering reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy for the benefit of our stakeholders. Today, about half of Evergy’s power comes from carbon-free sources, creating more reliable energy with less impact to the environment.

Market Research Analyst Eastside Distilling's recent financial report indicates a mixed performance in the past quarter, with a notable decrease in gross sales from $2.4 million to $2.1 million. However, this has been partially offset by growth in their digital can printing segment, which suggests a strategic pivot towards this area of operation. The company's focus on profitable segments within the Spirits business is evident from the stable gross margin and the improved spirits margins.From a market perspective, the growth in digital can printing is particularly interesting as it demonstrates adaptability and innovation in a competitive market. The company's expectation of record can printing results in the first quarter of 2024 could signal an emerging growth driver, potentially attracting investor interest. Financial Analyst The significant reduction in net loss from $9.7 million to $2.1 million, with a notable decrease in operating costs, reflects Eastside's efforts in restructuring and cost management. The reduction in headcount and professional fees, combined with a strategic realignment towards the most profitable spirits brands and regions, is a positive sign for operational efficiency.However, investors should be cautious about the liquidity position, given the sale of over 300,000 shares to fund operations, which could be indicative of cash flow challenges. The reverse stock split also suggests a previous attempt to stabilize the stock price, a move that often raises concerns about a company's long-term value proposition. Legal Expert When evaluating the financial statements, it is important to consider the use of non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA. While these measures can provide additional insights into a company's operational performance, they are not standardized and can vary significantly between companies. Investors should understand the specific adjustments Eastside is making when they report these figures, as these adjustments can sometimes be used to present a more favorable view of the company's financial health.The reverse stock split is another area that requires careful legal scrutiny, as it can affect shareholder value and the market's perception of the company. It's essential to understand the legal implications and how it aligns with shareholder interests. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM Company to Host Conference Call at 8:30 am ET Tuesday, April 2, 2024 PORTLAND, Ore., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eastside Distilling, Inc. (NASDAQ: EAST) (""Eastside"" or the ""Company""), a consumer-focused beverage company that builds craft inspired experiential brands and high-quality artisanal products around premium spirits, digital can printing, co-packing and mobile filling, reported fourth quarter and year end financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights: Craft digitally printed a record 14.1 million cans in 2023Company expecting record can printing in the first quarter of 2024 of over 4.7 million cans; an 88% increase year over yearSpirits operating losses improved by 74% and expects continued improvement in the first quarter of 2024""The Company finished the year with substantially improved results in both businesses, most notably in our Spirits business,"" said Geoffrey Gwin, Eastside's CEO. ""In addition, we are excited to report we expect record digital can printing results in the first quarter—we are off to a great start."" Financial Results Gross sales for the three months ending December 31, 2023 decreased to $2.1 million from $2.4 million for the three months ending December 31, 2022, as both mobile canning and spirits sales were down, offset by an increase in digital can printing. Year over year results are not directly compatible given the large sales of bulk spirits in 2022. Gross profit for both the three months ending December 31, 2023 and 2022 was flat at $(0.1) million. Gross margin was (6)% for both the three months ending December 31, 2023 and 2022. Spirits margins increased as the Company has focused on profitable segments. Operating costs for the three months ending December 31, 2023 decreased to $1.4 million from $1.8 million for the three months ending December 31, 2022 primarily due to decreased headcount, professional fees and sponsorship costs. The Company has undertaken a broad restructuring in spirits which has lowered sales and realigned investment to focus on the most profitable spirits brands and regions. Net loss for the three months ending December 31, 2023 decreased to $2.1 million from $9.7 million, which included $0.4 million and $7.5 million resulting from an impairment loss during the three months ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company reported adjusted EBITDA of $(1.3) million and $(1.6) million for the three months ending December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (See description of adjusted EBITDA in ""Use of Non-GAAP Measures"" below.) During the year ending December 31, 2023, the Company sold 304,305 shares of common stock in at-the-market public placements, with the proceeds used primarily to fund the operations of its digital can printing business. Reverse Stock Split The Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse common stock split on May 12, 2023. All share quantities and per share information in this earnings release have been adjusted to give effect to this reverse stock split. The Company will give further updates on its earnings conference call. Use of Non-GAAP Measures Eastside Distilling's management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various financial metrics. In addition to the Company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP results. Management believes this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's operating results and assists investors in comparing the Company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other one-time items. The final table below provides a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Shares,2024-04-01T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. (AZ) announces a public offering to sell common shares for business development and working capital purposes.,"A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. Announces Proposed Public Offering of Common Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. (AZ) announces a public offering to sell common shares for business development and working capital purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by A2Z Smart Technologies Corp. regarding their public offering to sell common shares and potentially pre-funded warrants represents a strategic move to raise capital. The success of such an offering largely hinges on investor confidence in the company's growth prospects and the perceived value of the investment. The role of ThinkEquity as the sole placement agent signals a targeted approach to the placement of shares, potentially indicating a more tailored and possibly efficient capital raising process.From a financial perspective, the use of net proceeds for the expansion of existing business and acceleration of new client onboarding is a positive sign. It suggests that A2Z is experiencing demand for its smart cart technology and is actively working to capitalize on its contracted backlog. Investors should consider the company's track record in fulfilling orders and onboarding new clients as a measure of its operational efficiency and potential for future revenue growth.Additionally, the reference to a shelf registration statement indicates that A2Z had previously filed documentation with the SEC, allowing them to issue securities in a more expedited manner. This can be a double-edged sword; while it enables quick access to capital markets, it also means that the company could dilute existing shareholders' equity if not managed properly. Investors should weigh the potential for dilution against the benefits of the capital infusion to the company's growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst Within the technology sector, especially for companies like A2Z Smart Technologies that focus on smart cart solutions, the ability to continuously innovate and scale operations is key to maintaining a competitive edge. The market for smart carts is growing, driven by the retail industry's pursuit of efficiency and improved customer experience. A2Z's move to secure additional funding suggests that they are aiming to seize a larger share of this market.Investors should monitor the response of the market to this offering, as it could serve as a barometer for the company's perceived market position and the industry's growth potential. The effectiveness of the funds' usage, particularly in fulfilling backlog orders, will be critical in assessing whether the company can convert its investments into tangible revenue streams. Market trends towards automation and smart technology in retail will also play a role in determining the long-term success of A2Z's expansion efforts.It's important to note that the timing and pricing of the offering will affect market perception. If the offering is priced attractively and is well-timed with market demand, it could lead to a favorable outcome for A2Z. Conversely, a misstep in timing or pricing could dampen investor enthusiasm and impact the stock's performance. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the involvement of pre-funded warrants in the offering is noteworthy. Pre-funded warrants are an alternative to traditional stock offerings, providing investors with the option to purchase shares at a later date, typically for a nominal price. This mechanism can be attractive to investors who are interested in a longer-term commitment to the company but seek to minimize immediate capital outlay.The reliance on a shelf registration statement is a common practice that allows companies to streamline the securities offering process. However, investors should be aware that the details of the offering, as outlined in the preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, are crucial. These documents contain information about the terms of the offering, risks and the company's financial position, which are essential for making an informed investment decision.Moreover, the SEC's role in declaring the shelf registration effective should provide a level of assurance regarding the regulatory compliance of the offering. Still, investors are advised to conduct their own due diligence, reviewing the documents filed with the SEC and understanding the implications of the offering's terms and conditions. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM TEL AVIV, ISRAEL / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / A2Z Smart Technologies Corp.

The offer is tied to a transaction with EchoStar Real Estate Holding L.L.C. for property in Littleton, Colorado. The Company's Board of Directors has endorsed the offer, but no specific recommendation is made to stockholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by CONX Corp. of a tender offer to purchase its own shares is a strategic financial move that can have several implications for the company's stock performance and capital structure. The tender offer price is slightly below the recent closing price, which suggests a cautious approach by the company to not significantly overpay for its shares. This could be seen as a signal that the company believes its stock is fairly valued or potentially undervalued, prompting them to repurchase shares as an investment.From a financial perspective, share repurchases can be positive for remaining shareholders as it may lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS), assuming the reduction in share count offsets the cash outlay. However, it's important to note that the funding of the tender offer will come from the company's trust account, which may have been allocated for other strategic purposes. The opportunity cost of this capital deployment should be considered, especially if it could have been used for growth initiatives or debt reduction.Furthermore, the waiver of redemption rights by the company's sponsor, officers and directors could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. This alignment of interests with public shareholders might be viewed favorably by the market. However, investors should be cautious and evaluate the underlying reasons for the tender offer, including the potential impact on the company's liquidity and future growth potential. Market Research Analyst The tender offer by CONX Corp. is a noteworthy event for market observers as it may influence investor sentiment and market dynamics for the company's stock. The timing of the tender offer, in relation to the sale and leaseback transaction with EchoStar Real Estate Holding L.L.C., suggests a strategic reallocation of capital within the company's balance sheet. This type of transaction is often undertaken to unlock the value of real estate assets and improve liquidity.Market participants should monitor the uptake of the tender offer, as a high level of participation could indicate that investors are eager to liquidate at the offered price, perhaps reflecting a lack of confidence in the company's short-term growth prospects. Conversely, low participation might signal that investors expect future appreciation in the stock's value and prefer to retain their shares. Additionally, the outcome of the tender offer could affect the stock's liquidity and volatility post-transaction.It is also essential to consider the broader market conditions and sector performance when evaluating the potential success and impact of such a tender offer. Market trends and investor appetite for risk in the sector that CONX Corp. operates in could significantly influence the response to the tender offer. Legal Expert In the context of CONX Corp.'s tender offer, several legal and regulatory considerations come into play. The tender offer process is governed by securities laws and regulations, which require detailed disclosure to ensure that shareholders have sufficient information to make an informed decision. The Offer to Purchase document and related filings with the SEC are important in this regard, providing the terms, conditions and legal implications of the tender offer.Shareholders should be aware of their rights in the tender offer process, including the ability to withdraw tendered shares before the expiration date. The legal framework is designed to protect shareholders from coercive tactics and to ensure fair treatment. The waiver of redemption rights by the company's insiders is also significant from a legal standpoint, as it demonstrates compliance with fiduciary duties and mitigates potential conflicts of interest.It is important for shareholders to review all legal documents associated with the tender offer carefully, including any potential risks outlined by the company. The legal language used in these documents can be complex and shareholders may benefit from seeking independent legal advice to fully understand the implications of participating or not participating in the tender offer. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM LITTLETON, Colo., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CONX Corp.

Net cash used in operating activities increased to $3.3 million in FY 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Other income and expense expected to be volatile based on share price. Potential risks associated with volatile other income and expense. Financial Analyst The reported financials of Airship AI Holdings, Inc. indicate a substantial increase in backlog to $11.8 million, which is a positive indicator of future revenue. The validated pipeline of approximately $140 million suggests a strong future order book, potentially translating into sustained revenue streams. The company's gross margin of 47% is notable, albeit influenced by a higher mix of third-party hardware sales. However, the operating loss of $6.6 million, driven by stock-based compensation, raises concerns about the company's current expense management and profitability.The net income of $16.4 million, bolstered by other income primarily from changes in warrant and earnout liabilities, can be misleading as it is non-recurring and not from core operations. Investors should be cautious of this as it does not reflect operational performance. The increase in net cash used in operating activities to $3.3 million underscores the need for the company to manage its cash flow effectively to sustain operations and capitalize on its growth strategy.Looking at the 2024 outlook, the expectation of triple-digit revenue growth and positive cash flow is promising but hinges on successful execution and conversion of the backlog and pipeline into actual sales. The strategic positioning as a public company could indeed provide more visibility and opportunities for growth. However, investors should monitor the company's ability to manage costs and improve operating efficiency to ensure long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst Airship AI's focus on advanced technologies for enhanced border protection aligns with increasing global demand for AI-driven security solutions. The contracts awarded by U.S. federal agencies, such as the DHS and DOJ and international governments, like Singapore, indicate a strong market presence and credibility. The company's strategic moves, including the release of next-generation Outpost AI edge appliances and the transition to a new cloud business management suite, demonstrate a commitment to innovation and operational improvement.However, the competitive landscape in AI-driven video, sensor and data management surveillance is rapidly evolving, with numerous players vying for government and enterprise contracts. Airship AI's brand awareness initiatives and engagement in new verticals are important for capturing market share. The company's ability to innovate and release new product offerings will be key to staying ahead of the competition and penetrating commercial markets, especially in areas like organized retail crime (ORC).The company's improvement in delivery and gross margin through supplier transitions and potential supply chain optimizations can be a differentiator in a market where cost efficiency and reliability are highly valued by clients. The focus on margin expansion is critical in a sector with high R&D costs and will be a factor to watch in assessing the company's long-term profitability. Legal Expert The recent merger and Nasdaq listing provide Airship AI with a new level of scrutiny and regulatory compliance requirements. The financial transparency resulting from public listing can improve stakeholder confidence and potentially lead to more government and enterprise contracts. However, the company must navigate the complexities of public reporting, maintain strict compliance with securities laws and manage the expectations of a broader investor base.The contracts with government agencies suggest that Airship AI has successfully passed rigorous vetting processes, which speaks to the company's compliance and operational standards. The legal landscape for AI technologies, particularly in surveillance, is continually evolving, with considerations around privacy and data protection becoming more stringent. Airship AI's ability to adapt to these legal frameworks and ensure its products meet all regulatory requirements will be essential for its sustained growth and avoidance of potential legal challenges. 04/01/2024 - 04:44 PM FY 2023 Revenue of $12.3 Million with Pipeline of $140 Million Expected to Drive Triple-Digit Revenue Growth and Positive Cash Flow in FY 2024 Backlog Increased to $11.8 Million Driven by Demand from Fortune 500 Customers, and U.S. Federal Government and Department of Defense Agencies with Strong Focus on Advanced Technologies for Enhanced Border Protection Completed Merger and Began Trading as a Public Company on Nasdaq Under “AISP” on December 22, 2023 REDMOND, Wash., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Airship AI Holdings, Inc.

Management Commentary “The fourth quarter of 2023 was highlighted by our Nasdaq listing in late December,” said Paul Allen, President of Airship AI. “This transition from a private to public company is expected to provide the financial transparency that many of our customers are looking for relative to the health of our business, as well as provide opportunities for growth outside of our traditional organically funded operations. “Our robust enterprise and edge AI platform is well positioned to meet the surging demand for artificial intelligence-based solutions supporting real-time intelligence requirements in the homeland security and law enforcement space. Our efforts over the last several years have positioned us to be where we need to be for the customers who need it most. “In the government and law enforcement space, we are excited about several pilot opportunities we implemented with large federal agencies in late 2023, many of which we are already seeing rapid progression around, including the transition of operations from on-premises to the FedRAMP cloud and the push of significant workflow to the edge, leveraging our edge AI appliance Outpost AI. “These capabilities on their own are just part of the solution to the challenges many of our customers are facing. The ability to support operations across a customer’s entire eco-system and leveraging artificial intelligence from the edge to the cloud is our competitive differentiation. Combined with our sensor agnostic approach to integrations and simplified deployment model, agencies can realize substantial cost savings in addition to increased operational efficiency when transitioning to Airship AI. “While the focus over the last several years has been integrating sensors and solutions and leveraging artificial intelligence to fuse the collective data in real-time, our commercial business remains robust, with an increasing number of nexus opportunities for solutions in the commercial marketplace that can leverage these tailored integrations and workflow designed for law enforcement. “Specifically, customer opportunities are rapidly expanding due to growing private-public partnerships between law enforcement and commercial entities, namely around ORC and loss prevention challenges. These problems require partnerships at every level to be successful. Airship AI is that partner. “In a world that is rapidly changing with new threats emerging daily, these collective efforts uniquely position Airship AI to solve challenges others cannot solve, at a speed others cannot match. Whether it is a retailer struggling with theft and shrinkage, a Fortune 500 enterprise focused on employee safety in the workplace, or a federal agency tasked with stopping illegal human trafficking across borders, Airship AI is ready to help tackle these challenges. “We look forward to providing updates in the months to come, including those attending our Institutional Investor Day, by invitation, in Montana on April 26th,” concluded Mr. Allen.

Financial Analyst The adjustment of the ADS ratio by Steakholder Foods Ltd. indicates a strategic move to consolidate their share structure. By increasing the nominal value per ADS, the company is aiming to attract a broader investor base, including institutional investors who may prefer stocks with higher per-share prices. This approach can potentially reduce share price volatility, as stocks with higher nominal values often have a more stable investor base.From a financial perspective, a reverse split like this can be a double-edged sword. While it may indeed lead to a higher stock price and better compliance with exchange listing requirements, it can also be perceived as a cosmetic improvement, especially if the underlying fundamentals of the company do not support a higher valuation. Investors often scrutinize such moves for the long-term implications on shareholder value.It is also essential to consider the liquidity aspect. In theory, higher share prices can lead to improved liquidity, but they can also reduce the number of shares traded, potentially making the stock less liquid. The net effect on liquidity will depend on how the market perceives the reverse split. Market Research Analyst In the field of alternative protein, particularly in the niche of 3D-printed meat, the market is still relatively nascent with significant growth potential. A company like Steakholder Foods positioning itself to meet Nasdaq's listing requirements suggests a forward-looking strategy to maintain its appeal to investors. The reverse split could be part of a broader plan to enhance the company's market image and attract investment as the industry matures.However, the success of such a strategy hinges on the broader market's acceptance of 3D-printed meat technology. If the market trends favor alternative protein sources and Steakholder Foods can capitalize on this shift, the reverse split could be seen as a positive step in aligning the company's stock market presence with its growth trajectory.It's important to monitor consumer adoption rates, regulatory changes and competitive landscape shifts to fully understand the potential impact of this corporate action on the company's market position. Compliance Specialist Steakholder Foods' decision to adjust their ADS ratio to comply with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a proactive measure to avoid delisting. Delisting can significantly affect a company's ability to raise capital and damage its reputation. By undertaking a reverse split, the company is addressing compliance issues without diluting existing shareholders' equity, which is a positive aspect of this strategy.However, it is important for the company to maintain its focus on core business performance metrics and not solely on stock price management. Regulatory compliance should go hand in hand with operational success. Investors should be aware that while this move may satisfy stock exchange requirements in the short term, the long-term value is fundamentally tied to the company's performance in the competitive landscape of alternative proteins. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM REHOVOT, Israel, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Steakholder Foods Ltd. (Nasdaq: STKH), a leading innovator in 3D-printed meat and fish technology and cultivated cell innovation, today announced its plan to adjust the ratio of the company's American Depositary Shares (ADSs) in relation to its ordinary shares. The adjustment will change the current ratio from one (1) ADS representing ten (10) ordinary shares to a new ratio of one (1) ADS representing one hundred (100) ordinary shares, effective on April 4, 2024. Steakholder Foods' ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker ""STKH,"" with an updated CUSIP Number of 583435201. This ratio adjustment will essentially serve as a one-for-ten reverse ADS split for ADS holders, requiring no action on their part. The Bank of New York Mellon, serving as the depositary bank for Steakholder Foods' ADS program, will arrange for the exchange of every ten (10) existing ADSs held for one (1) new ADS on the effective date. Arik Kaufman, CEO of Steakholder Foods, commented: ""Our aim is to make Steakholder Foods' shares more attractive to a broader range of potential institutional and retail investors with an eye toward lower volatility, better liquidity, and upholding Nasdaq's continued listing requirements."" There will be no issuance of new ADSs in connection with the adjustment. Any fractional shares resulting from the adjustment will be aggregated and the depositary bank will attempt to sell them and distribute the net proceeds to the respective ADS holders. Following receipt of a notification from the Nasdaq Stock Market on October 31, 2023 regarding non-compliance with its minimum bid price requirements, Steakholder Foods anticipates that this adjustment will lead to a proportional increase in the price of its ADSs, potentially satisfying Nasdaq's minimum bid price criteria. However, it is important to note that future price performance cannot be guaranteed.

Decrease in management fees due to lower revenue from oil and gas operations. Operating expenses and general administrative expenses increased year over year. growth in interest income compared to previous year. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of New Concept Energy, Inc. for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 show a shift from a modest net income in the previous year to a net loss. This transition from profit to loss is noteworthy for investors as it indicates a downturn in the company's profitability. The consistency in rental revenue, with no year-over-year growth, suggests a static market position in the real estate segment. However, the decline in management fees from oil and gas operations, attributed to lower oil and gas prices, reflects the sensitivity of NCE's revenue streams to commodity price fluctuations.On the expense side, a slight increase in general and administrative expenses could be a concern as it may indicate rising operational costs that are not being offset by revenue growth. The steady operating expenses for real estate properties show controlled costs in that segment. The increase in interest income is a positive note, yet it's not sufficient to counterbalance the revenue shortfall from the core business activities.Investors may view the absence of 'other income' in 2023, which in 2022 included a one-time gain from an investment collection and equipment sale, as a return to normal operations without exceptional items. This is critical for evaluating the company's sustainable earning potential. The overall financial health of NCE might be questioned due to its inability to maintain profitability and stakeholders might be concerned about the company's future revenue and profit outlook, especially if commodity prices continue to be volatile. Energy Sector Analyst The performance of New Concept Energy, Inc. in the energy sector, specifically in managing oil and gas operations, reveals the impact of external market forces on the company's financial outcomes. The reduction in management fees due to the decline in oil and gas prices highlights the company's exposure to market risks associated with the energy sector. This correlation between NCE's fee structure and the underlying commodity prices is important for understanding the company's revenue volatility.Given the current dynamics of the energy market, with fluctuating oil and gas prices driven by geopolitical tensions, supply chain constraints and global energy transition trends, it is imperative for NCE to adapt its strategy to mitigate these risks. Diversification of revenue streams or hedging strategies could be potential approaches to stabilize income. The company's performance must be carefully monitored against industry benchmarks, as its financial resilience will be tested by its ability to navigate the inherently cyclical nature of the energy sector. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the reported financials of New Concept Energy, Inc. provide insights into the company's market position and strategic challenges. The stagnant revenue from rental properties may suggest limited growth opportunities in the company's real estate portfolio or a saturated market. The company's dependency on the performance of the oil and gas sector is evident and the reduction in revenue from this segment may concern investors looking for diversified and stable income sources.Further, the absence of significant 'other income' in 2023 as compared to 2022 could reflect a normalization of financial results, offering a clearer picture of the company's operating performance without the distortion of one-off events. Market participants may scrutinize the company's future projections and strategies, such as potential expansion, cost management and investment in technology, to enhance operational efficiency and generate sustainable growth. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Concept Energy, Inc.

Reports Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGS) reports strong financial results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2023, with significant increases in rental revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The company's rental fleet utilization also improved, reflecting a successful year in the energy industry. Positive Full year 2023 rental revenue surged by 43% to $106.2 million, with fourth quarter rental revenue up by 54% year over year to $31.6 million. GAAP net income for full year 2023 stood at $4.7 million, translating to $0.39 per basic share and $0.38 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 rose by 57.0% to $45.8 million, with fourth quarter 2023 seeing a 110% increase year over year to $16.3 million. Rental fleet utilization showed improvements on both a horsepower basis (80.8% at year-end 2023 vs. 74.8% at year-end 2022) and a unit basis (66.5% at year-end 2023 vs. 65.3% at year-end 2022). Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in rental revenue for Natural Gas Services Group is a substantial development, indicating a robust demand for their gas compression equipment and services. A 43% year-over-year growth in full-year rental revenue, coupled with a 54% increase in the fourth quarter, suggests that the energy sector, particularly natural gas, may be experiencing a surge in activity. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as higher energy prices, increased exploration and production activities, or a shift towards natural gas as a cleaner energy alternative.Furthermore, the improvement in rental fleet utilization both in terms of horsepower and unit basis reflects operational efficiency and effective asset management. With an 80.8% utilization rate based on horsepower, NGS is effectively capitalizing on its assets, which is commendable given the capital-intensive nature of the industry. Investors should note that higher utilization rates can lead to improved margins and profitability over time.However, while the reported GAAP net income and Adjusted EBITDA growth are positive, stakeholders should assess the sustainability of these figures in the context of the broader energy market trends and potential regulatory changes affecting the natural gas industry. Investors should also be aware of the company's leverage levels, despite the CEO's assurance of prudence, as the energy sector can be cyclical and sensitive to external shocks. Market Research Analyst The performance of Natural Gas Services Group can be indicative of underlying market trends within the energy sector. The significant increase in rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA may point to a broader recovery in the energy sector, which has been volatile in recent years. The increase in fleet utilization suggests that NGS's services are in high demand, which could be driven by an increase in drilling and production activities as companies seek to capitalize on favorable market conditions.From a market perspective, NGS's financial results could reflect positively on its stock performance in the short term. Investors often react favorably to strong revenue growth and profitability indicators like EBITDA. However, it's essential to consider the long-term outlook, as the energy sector's performance is closely tied to fluctuating commodity prices, geopolitical events and environmental policies.As the industry moves towards more sustainable energy solutions, companies like NGS that provide essential services to the natural gas industry may be well-positioned to benefit from the transition. Nonetheless, there is a risk that shifts towards renewable energy sources could eventually dampen growth prospects for natural gas services, so monitoring industry trends and regulatory developments is important for stakeholders. Energy Sector Analyst The detailed financial results presented by NGS, especially the marked increase in Adjusted EBITDA, highlight the company's ability to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which is a key indicator of a company's operational profitability. An Adjusted EBITDA increase of 57.0% for the full year and an impressive 110% for the fourth quarter signals strong operational execution and cost management.It's also noteworthy that the company has maintained a 'prudent level of leverage.' In the energy industry, where capital expenditures can be high, maintaining a manageable debt level is essential for financial stability and flexibility. This could be particularly advantageous if the industry faces a downturn or if capital is needed for unexpected opportunities or investments.Investors should also consider the potential impact of environmental regulations on the natural gas industry. While current demand is high, long-term prospects could be affected by policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Companies like NGS may need to adapt their business models or find new growth areas as the energy transition progresses. The ability to navigate these changes will be critical for sustained success. 04/01/2024 - 04:49 PM Midland, Texas, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:NGS) (the ""Company"" or ""NGS""), a leading provider of gas compression equipment, technology and services to the energy industry, announces its financial results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023. Financial results contained herein reflect the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-K that will be filed on April 1, 2024. 2023 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Highlights Full year 2023 rental revenue increased 43% to $106.2 million; fourth quarter 2023 rental revenue increased 54% year over year to $31.6 millionFull year 2023 GAAP net income was $4.7 million or $0.39 per basic share and $0.38 per diluted shareFull year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 increased 57.0% to $45.8 million; fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA1 increased 110% year over year to $16.3 millionRental fleet utilization increased on both a horsepower basis (80.8% at year-end 2023 vs. 74.8% at year-end 2022) and a unit basis (66.5% at year-end 2023 vs. 65.3% at year-end 2022) “Our fourth quarter of 2023 was the best quarter of the year in what was a historic year for the Company. I would like to thank our Chairman, Steve Taylor, and the entire NGS team, for their hard work and dedication in driving these results for our shareholders,” said Justin Jacobs, Chief Executive Officer. “We finished the year with approximately 420,000 of rented horsepower while generating adjusted EBITDA of $45.8 million all while maintaining a prudent level of leverage. I’m excited about the coming years for NGS to generate even more earnings from our existing assets as well as expanding the size of our fleet.” Financial and Operating Details for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue: Total revenue increased by 43% to $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $84.8 million for year ended in December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to a 43% increase in rental revenue to $106.2 million from $74.5 million during the same period. In addition, sales revenues increased by 4% to $8.9 million in 2023 compared to $8.6 million in 2022. Total revenue increased 61% to $36.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $22.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily related to a $11.1 million increase in rental revenue driven by new unit set activity, rental rate increases, and surcharges. Total revenue increased 15% to $36.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $31.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was primarily related to a $3.9 million or 14% increase in rental revenue. Gross Margin: Total gross margin increased to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Total adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation, increased to $58.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $38.5 million for the same period ended December 31, 2022. Total gross margin increased to $13.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $4.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Total adjusted gross margin, exclusive of depreciation, increased to $20.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $10.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Sequentially, total gross margin increased to $13.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Sequentially, total adjusted gross margin increased to $20.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. All of these increases are primarily attributable to increased rental revenues in excess of increased costs of rentals. Please see discussions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Gross Margin, below. Operating Income: The Company posted operating income for the year ended December 31, 2023, of $10.5 million, compared to operating income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This improvement in operating income is primarily due to an increase in gross margin of $17.9 million driven by increased rental revenues. The improvement in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 2022 operating income was primarily driven by a $6.9 million increase in rental gross margin. Sequentially, total operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $4.4 million compared to $4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to an inventory allowance of $4.0 million related to our decision to cease new unit fabrication at our Midland, Texas fabrication facility. Net Income (Loss): The Company reported net income of $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The improvement in 2023 annual net income, when compared to the full year 2022 results, is primarily due to our increased operating income, as discussed above, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in income tax expense in 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net income of $1.7 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income, as discussed above. Sequentially, the Company's net income decreased $0.5 million to $1.7 million from $2.2 million primarily due to the inventory allowance of $4.0 million offset by higher rental and sales gross margins. Earnings (loss) per share: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported earnings per basic share of $0.39 and per diluted share of $0.38, compared to loss per basic and diluted share of $0.05 for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.14 compared to a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.06 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, and earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA1: Adjusted EBITDA increased $16.6 million to $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased rental adjusted gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $16.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in rental adjusted gross margin (including higher than expected adjusted gross margin percentage) but also from an increase in sales adjusted gross margin. Sequentially, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $16.3 million from $11.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in rental adjusted gross margin (including higher than expected adjusted gross margin percentage) but also from an increase in sales adjusted gross margin. Please see discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA, below. Cash flow: At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $2.7 million, while working capital was $43.6 million with $164.0 million of outstanding bank borrowings. Cash flow from operating activities was $18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. A significant build in accounts receivable materially reduced cash flow from operations; we expect this build to reduce over the course of 2024. Cash flow used in investing activities (consisting of our capital expenditures) was $153.9 million during 2023. Cash flow provided by financing activities was $135.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which included $139.0 million of net borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 2024 Outlook NGS’s full year 2024 Outlook is as follows: FY 2024 OutlookAdjusted EBITDA$58 million - $65 millionNew Unit Capital Expenditures$40 million - $50 millionTarget Return on Invested CapitalAt least 20% Our current outlook for 2024 Fiscal Year Adjusted EBITDA is a range of $58 million to $65 million, a material increase from our previously announced outlook. The low end of this range reflects our current view as to the approximate amount of fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA that is “run-rate” or likely to recur, then annualized for a full year number. After a substantial capital expenditure program in 2023, we have a lower but still significant amount of capital expenditures for new units in 2024. Of the total current expected range of $40 million to $50 million, approximately $15 million relates to holdover from the 2023 new unit plan that will be completed and installed in 2024; the balance is the 2024 new unit plan that is expected to be completed and installed in late 2024 and/or early 2025. We are reviewing our capital plans to see if we will further increase new unit capital expenditures in 2024 although no decision has been made. Overall, our target is to generate at least a 20% return on growth capital expenditures. Selected data: The tables below show, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 revenues and percentage of total revenues, along with our gross margin and adjusted gross margin (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), as well as, related percentages of revenue for each of our product lines. Adjusted gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Adjusted Gross Margin: We define “Adjusted Gross Margin” as total revenue less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense). Adjusted gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary measure used by management as it represents the results of revenue and cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), which are key operating components. Adjusted gross margin differs from gross margin in that gross margin includes depreciation expense. We believe adjusted gross margin is important because it focuses on the current operating performance of our operations and excludes the impact of the prior historical costs of the assets acquired or constructed that are utilized in those operations. Depreciation expense reflects the systematic allocation of historical property and equipment values over the estimated useful lives. Adjusted gross margin has certain material limitations associated with its use as compared to gross margin. Depreciation expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenue. Management uses this non-GAAP measure as a supplemental measure to other GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the company's performance. As an indicator of operating performance, adjusted gross margin should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted Gross margin may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company because other entities may not calculate adjusted gross margin in the same manner.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management, analysts and investors as an indicator of operating cash flow since it excludes the impact of movements in working capital items, non-cash charges and financing costs. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA gives the investor information as to the cash generated from the operations of a business. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for other financial measures of performance. Adjusted EBITDA as calculated by NGS may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA as calculated and reported by other companies. The most comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net (loss) income.

Core & Main Completes Acquisition of ACF West Inc.,2024-04-01T20:51:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Core & Main Inc. (CNM) successfully completes the acquisition of ACF West Inc., a prominent distributor of geosynthetic materials and soil stabilization solutions across multiple states.","Core & Main Completes Acquisition of ACF West Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Core & Main Inc. (CNM) successfully completes the acquisition of ACF West Inc., a prominent distributor of geosynthetic materials and soil stabilization solutions across multiple states. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of ACF West Inc. by Core & Main Inc. represents a strategic expansion of their current offerings in the geosynthetic materials market. This move could potentially increase Core & Main's market share and customer base in the Pacific Northwest, which is a region with considerable infrastructure development needs. Geosynthetics are essential in civil engineering projects, serving functions such as soil reinforcement, erosion control and drainage. The demand for these materials is often linked to public and private sector investments in infrastructure.From a market perspective, this acquisition may signal Core & Main's intent to consolidate its position in the infrastructure supply chain, which could lead to improved economies of scale and bargaining power with suppliers. However, it's important to monitor how well Core & Main integrates ACF West's operations to realize the expected synergies. The success of this acquisition will largely depend on the company's ability to maintain ACF West's established customer relationships while leveraging Core & Main's national presence for growth. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the financial implications of Core & Main's acquisition of ACF West. The deal's impact on Core & Main's balance sheet and cash flows will be an area to watch in the coming quarters. Acquisitions can lead to short-term financial strain but may offer long-term revenue growth and cost efficiencies. It will be important to evaluate the acquisition price relative to ACF West's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to understand the financial rationale behind the deal.Another key factor is the potential for revenue synergies, which could arise from cross-selling opportunities and expanded service offerings. If Core & Main can effectively cross-sell ACF West's products to its existing customer base, there could be a positive impact on the company's top-line growth. Additionally, investors should look for any signs of cultural and operational integration challenges that could affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Construction Industry Expert The integration of ACF West into Core & Main's business model is likely to have implications for the construction industry, particularly within the geosynthetics segment. ACF West's expertise in soil stabilization solutions could complement Core & Main's infrastructure focus, potentially leading to innovative product offerings. The construction industry often faces challenges related to sustainability and environmental impact and geosynthetic materials are increasingly viewed as a solution to these challenges.Moreover, the presence of six ACF West locations across key states could enhance Core & Main's logistical capabilities, enabling faster delivery times and better service for projects in the region. This could be especially beneficial in areas prone to environmental concerns such as erosion or landslides, where timely access to geosynthetic materials is critical. For contractors and project managers, the acquisition might mean a wider range of products and solutions from a single supplier, which could streamline procurement processes and reduce project complexity. 04/01/2024 - 04:51 PM ST.

The project aims to increase production to 800 million gallons per year by Q2, 2022, positioning Phillips 66 as a leader in renewable fuels. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The transformation of Phillips 66's San Francisco refinery into the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex marks a critical pivot towards renewable energy sources within the traditional oil and gas industry. The completion of this project and the commencement of renewable diesel production is a strategic move that aligns with the global shift towards sustainability and carbon footprint reduction. The company's ability to produce 30,000 barrels per day (BPD) of renewable diesel, with plans to scale up to 50,000 BPD, indicates a significant increase in capacity which could potentially meet a growing demand for cleaner fuels.Moreover, the production of renewable jet fuel, a component of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), is a forward-thinking initiative that may capture a share of an emerging market, especially given the aviation industry's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The facility's premium geographic location and flexible logistics enhance its competitive advantage, potentially leading to favorable market positioning.From an investor's standpoint, this development could signal long-term growth opportunities for Phillips 66, especially as governments and corporations increasingly incentivize and mandate the use of renewable energy sources. However, it is important to monitor the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the new complex, as these factors will be important in determining the project's ultimate financial success. Environmental Policy Expert Phillips 66's initiative to convert an existing refinery into a renewable energy complex is a significant step in the energy sector's transition towards more sustainable practices. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex's focus on renewable diesel and future production of renewable jet fuel positions the company as a proactive participant in the reduction of lifecycle carbon emissions. This aligns with current environmental policies and regulatory trends that favor low-carbon energy sources.Investments in renewable energy infrastructure are often encouraged by policy incentives such as tax credits and grants, which could be beneficial for Phillips 66's financials. However, the regulatory landscape is complex and subject to change, which could impact the long-term viability of such projects. Stakeholders should be aware of the potential policy shifts that could affect the demand for renewable fuels and the company's ability to capitalize on these changes.Additionally, the company's commitment to renewable energy may enhance its public image and brand value, potentially leading to increased support from environmentally conscious consumers and investors. The challenge lies in balancing the financial aspects of the transition with the environmental benefits, ensuring that the shift to renewable fuels does not come at the expense of economic performance. Renewable Energy Financial Analyst The financial implications of Phillips 66's Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex are multi-faceted. On one hand, the initial capital expenditure for such a project is substantial, yet the long-term returns may justify the investment if the demand for renewable fuels continues to rise. The company's strategic positioning in a premium geographic location with existing infrastructure and logistics capabilities could lead to cost efficiencies and a strong market presence.Investors should consider the potential revenue streams from the production of renewable diesel and jet fuel against the backdrop of volatile oil prices and the increasing competitiveness of the renewable energy market. The ability to produce at a commercial scale is a positive indicator, but it is essential to evaluate the production costs relative to traditional fossil fuels and other renewable energy sources.It is also important to assess the company's risk management strategies in the face of potential technological advancements and market saturation. The renewable energy sector is rapidly evolving and Phillips 66 will need to maintain flexibility and adaptability to sustain profitability. Furthermore, the anticipated increase in production capacity by the end of the second quarter could have a near-term positive impact on the company's stock performance, provided that market conditions for renewable fuels remain favorable. 04/01/2024 - 04:39 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) today announced a major milestone in its conversion of the San Francisco refinery into the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex, expanding commercial scale production of renewable diesel. The Rodeo Renewed project has progressed, with the facility now processing only renewable feedstocks and producing approximately 30,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. The Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex is on track to increase production rates to more than 800 million gallons per year (50,000 BPD) of renewable fuels by the end of the second quarter, positioning Phillips 66 as a leader in renewable fuels. “We are proud to announce this significant achievement at our Rodeo facility,” said Rich Harbison, Phillips 66 executive vice president of Refining. “The project advances Phillips 66’s long-held strategy to expand our renewable fuels production, lower our carbon footprint, and provide reliable, affordable energy while creating long-term value for our shareholders.” Harbison added, “We’ve had strong execution to-date and are fully focused on finalizing the project in the second quarter.” The Rodeo Renewed project design also provides the capability of producing renewable jet, a key component of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), expected to start production in the second quarter of 2024.

Financial highlights reveal significant growth in cash position and operating expenses, reflecting the company's strategic growth initiatives. Negative Total operating expenses have significantly increased, impacting the company's financial performance. Delays in production of Block 1 BlueBird satellites due to supplier issues may affect overall project timelines. Increased research and development costs contribute to higher adjusted operating expenses, potentially impacting profitability. Non-GAAP financial measures may have comparability and usefulness to investors, as they are not standardized under U.S. GAAP. Telecommunications Analyst The recent business update from AST SpaceMobile highlights a significant milestone in the telecommunications industry, particularly in the expansion of satellite-based cellular broadband services. The strategic financing and commercial agreements with major entities like AT&T, Google, Vodafone and the United States Government underscore the market's confidence in AST SpaceMobile's technology and business model. The approval by the FCC to utilize terrestrial spectrum for satellite direct-to-device services is a pivotal regulatory development, potentially setting a precedent for other countries and streamlining global expansion efforts.From an investment perspective, the company's progress in producing and testing its Block 1 and Block 2 satellites is key to its future revenue streams. The shift towards in-house manufacturing and ownership of intellectual property for satellite subsystems could enhance AST's control over its supply chain and reduce future costs. However, the reported delays due to supplier issues may raise concerns about the company's ability to meet its projected timelines, potentially impacting investor confidence.The financial highlights indicate a substantial increase in operating expenses year-over-year, which is not uncommon for companies in growth phases investing heavily in research and development. The increase in cash and cash equivalents suggests successful capital raising efforts, but investors should closely monitor the burn rate and the timeline for revenue generation to assess the sustainability of AST's financial position. Financial Analyst AST SpaceMobile's business update provides a comprehensive overview of their financial health and operational progress. The company's cash reserves, as of the end of 2023, coupled with the additional liquidity from the Senior Secured Credit Facility, offer a solid financial cushion for near-term activities. However, the increase in operating expenses, particularly in R&D, is a double-edged sword. While it reflects investment in innovation, it also contributes to a higher burn rate, which investors must weigh against the potential for future revenues.The non-GAAP financial measures presented, such as Adjusted operating expenses, offer an alternative view of the company's financial performance by excluding certain non-cash expenses and one-time costs. While these metrics can provide a clearer picture of operational efficiency, investors should also consider GAAP measures for a complete understanding of financial health. The upcoming launch of Block 1 and Block 2 satellites will be a critical test of the company's ability to execute on its strategic plan and begin generating revenue, a key driver for future valuation. Aerospace Industry Analyst The update from AST SpaceMobile is significant for the aerospace sector, particularly in light of their planned launches of the Block 1 and Block 2 BlueBird satellites. The successful deployment of these satellites, which are set to be some of the largest commercial phased arrays in low Earth orbit, could be transformative for global broadband connectivity. The custom ASIC development, in collaboration with TSMC, suggests a technological edge that could offer AST a competitive advantage in satellite data processing capabilities.However, the aerospace industry is notoriously complex and risky, with high barriers to entry and significant regulatory hurdles. The FCC's approval is a positive step, but global regulatory alignment is important for AST's success. Additionally, the orbital launch market is competitive and subject to delays. AST's ability to navigate these challenges will be critical to their long-term success and impact on the stock market. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM MIDLAND, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AST SpaceMobile, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PTIX) transitions to the Clinical Stage in FY 2023, initiating Phase 1/2a trial for neuropeptide drug PT00114 targeting Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Plans to enroll final two cohorts soon.","Protagenic Therapeutics Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTIX) transitions to the Clinical Stage in FY 2023, initiating Phase 1/2a trial for neuropeptide drug PT00114 targeting Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Plans to enroll final two cohorts soon. Positive None. Negative None. Biopharmaceutical Analyst The transition of Protagenic Therapeutics from a pre-clinical to a clinical-stage company is a pivotal development. This transition often signals a material advancement in a biotech company's life cycle and can have a significant impact on its valuation. The initiation of Phase 1/2a trials is a critical step in drug development, as it marks the first time a drug candidate is tested in humans. The success of these trials is essential for the company to proceed to later stages of clinical development and eventually seek regulatory approval.Investors often view the progression of a drug candidate into clinical trials positively, as it reduces the uncertainty surrounding the company's research and development efforts. However, the risks associated with clinical trials are high and the majority of drug candidates fail to make it past this stage. The focus on stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Treatment-Resistant Depression and PTSD, targets a market with a high unmet need, potentially offering a substantial opportunity if the drug proves to be safe and effective. Healthcare Market Analyst Entering the clinical trial phase for PT00114 positions Protagenic Therapeutics in a competitive segment of the healthcare market that is increasingly receiving attention due to the rising prevalence of mental health disorders. The potential addressable market for Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Addiction withdrawal is significant and a successful treatment could disrupt the current market, which is characterized by limited effective options.From a market perspective, the successful development of PT00114 could lead to strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their neuropsychiatric portfolios. However, the long-term impact on the company's financials will depend on the clinical trial outcomes, regulatory hurdles and the ability to commercialize the drug effectively in a competitive landscape. Clinical Trial Expert The design of the Phase 1/2a trial for PT00114, which includes both healthy volunteers and patients with specific neuropsychiatric disorders, is tailored to gather early safety and efficacy data. The enrollment of the final two cohorts in the single-dose portion of the Phase 1 trial will provide initial insights into the drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. These insights are important for dose optimization and planning subsequent trial phases.For stakeholders, the outcome of these early trials will be a key indicator of the drug candidate's potential. It is important to note that the journey from Phase 1 to regulatory approval is long and fraught with challenges. The data collected will not only influence the company's strategic decisions but also inform investors about the potential risks and rewards associated with the drug's development pathway. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM Transitioned from Pre-Clinical to Clinical Stage company in FY 2023Phase 1/2a trial, designed to assess both healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD or Generalized Anxiety Disorder, progressing through Phase 1 portionPlans to enroll final two out of five cohorts into the single dose portion of the Phase 1 trial within the next monthNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Protagenic Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:PTIX), a leader in biopharmaceutical innovation, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023.""In 2023, Protagenic Therapeutics achieved a significant milestone as we began enrolling patients for our neuropeptide drug candidate, PT00114,"" said Dr. Garo Armen, Executive Chairman. ""Our primary focus lies in advancing this drug candidate, designed to address the substantial unmet needs across a spectrum of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, including Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Addiction withdrawal.""2023 Highlights about PT00114First Clinical Trial: PT00114, the company's synthetic version of the stress-regulating peptide TCAP, began the single ascending dose (S.A,D,) portion of a Phase 1 clinical trial. Notably, PT00114 has shown excellent tolerability with no adverse safety findings during these ongoing Phase 1 studies. With promising preclinical efficacy in anxiety, depression, PTSD, and addiction models, PT00114 is moving forward in clinical evaluation, representing a key step toward transformative therapies.Safety Validation: Building on the low dose safety validation announced February 13th, as announced on March 27th, PT00114 has now demonstrated safety at a medium dose of 500 micrograms administered subcutaneously in the third of five planned cohorts of subjects in the single dose portion of the Phase I trial. No adverse reactions were observed among subjects, consistent with the two lower dose cohorts (125 micrograms and 250 micrograms), with no reported injection site reactions or tolerability issues in the week following dosing. Based on preclinical pharmacology, PT00114 is expected to be administered once weekly via subcutaneous injection.Clinical Protocol Progress: This marks progress in the ongoing Phase 1/2a trial, designed to assess both healthy volunteers and patients diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression, PTSD, or Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The company plans to enroll the final two cohorts into the single dose portion of the Phase 1 trial within the next month.Comprehensive Approach: In addition to monitoring disease status, the trial incorporates biomarker assessments, including circulating cortisol levels, to measure initial treatment response. Dr. Maurizio Fava, Psychiatrist-in-Chief at Massachusetts General Hospital, serves as the Principal Investigator in Protagenic's Phase 1/2a clinical trial with a basket design.Strategic Collaboration: Axiom Real-Time Metrics, a CRO/Data Analytics firm, manages the clinical program.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsOur financial results reflect an increase in research & development spending to pursue our primary objective of developing and commercializing PT00114 during FY 2023, particularly during the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we spent $1.0 million on R&D, an increase of 301% over our $258,000 R&D spend in the fourth quarter of 2022. This significant increase in R&D expenditures was entirely due to the clinical trial that is now in progress for PT00114, which commenced just as Q4 was starting. Our G&A spend for the fourth quarter of 2023 was just $201,000, down 50% from our G&A spend in the comparable quarter a year ago. Our net loss for Q4 was $1.2 million, compared to a net loss of $656,000 in the year-ago quarter.For the full year 2023, we spent $3.3 million on R&D, up 109% from the $1.6 million we spent on R&D for the full year 2022. Our full-year G&A of $1.2 million was, similar to the quarter, down almost 40% from the amount spent in the year-ago period.For full year net income, we lost $4.5 million, which is 27% more loss than we had in 2022, driven primarily by our higher R&D spend because of our clinical trial activities.For cash, we ended the year with $4.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, down from the $8.0 million we had as of Dec 31, 2022.

CMS to update fee schedule after April 1. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Financial Analyst Understanding the financial implications of CMS decisions on reimbursement rates is pivotal for companies like Lifeward. The establishment of a final payment rate for ReWalk Personal Exoskeletons by CMS is a significant development. This decision can lead to increased adoption of exoskeleton technology in rehabilitation, as it may reduce the financial burden on patients and healthcare facilities. In the short term, this could potentially drive up the company's revenue and market share in the medical devices sector. However, investors should monitor the long-term impact, considering the costs associated with production and potential market saturation.It is also essential to assess the company's current financial health and how this CMS decision aligns with its revenue forecasts and growth strategy. If Lifeward's financials are robust and the CMS rate is favorable, it could be a strong positive signal to the market. Conversely, if the rate is lower than expected or if the company's cost structure is high, it might not translate into significant bottom-line growth. Medical Device Market Analyst The market dynamics of medical devices, particularly exoskeletons, are influenced by regulatory decisions such as payment rates set by entities like CMS. A favorable payment rate can boost market growth by making the technology more accessible. This could also encourage competitors to innovate and seek similar or more advanced approvals, leading to a more competitive landscape.Investors should also consider the potential for international expansion, as regulatory decisions in the US often set precedents for other markets. A positive outcome with CMS could pave the way for Lifeward to negotiate similar terms in other countries, expanding its global footprint and diversifying its revenue streams. Rehabilitation Technology Specialist The clinical impact of exoskeleton technology on rehabilitation is profound. The ability for patients with physical limitations to access such devices can significantly improve their quality of life. A finalized payment rate from CMS could lead to broader clinical adoption, which in turn may result in more data on the efficacy of exoskeletons. This data could be important for Lifeward in refining its products and maintaining its position as a market leader.However, it's important to consider that widespread adoption hinges not only on payment rates but also on the training and support required for healthcare providers to integrate exoskeletons into their practice. Lifeward's ability to scale up these services in tandem with increased demand will be an essential factor in realizing the full potential of this CMS decision. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM Collaboration with CMS on final payment rate focuses on commercial transaction values for the latest generation of ReWalk Exoskeleton CMS indicates that recently issued fee schedule which omitted exoskeletons can be updated after April 1 to include the final payment rate once it is established MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILLIT, Israel, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (DBA Lifeward™), (Nasdaq: LFWD) (“Lifeward” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering life-changing solutions to revolutionize what is possible in rehabilitation, recovery, and the pursuit of life’s passions in the face of physical limitation or disability, today issued an open letter from Larry Jasinski, Chief Executive Officer, to shareholders discussing the Company’s progress with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to establish a payment rate for ReWalk Personal Exoskeletons. The full letter is published below: Dear Shareholders, As we communicated in Lifeward’s March 1 press release, a final payment rate for exoskeletons was deferred in CMS’ Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) final determination released on February 29, so the agency could obtain more information about pricing for our latest generation exoskeleton. As a result of the deferral, the payment rate is not included in CMS’ April 2024 Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) fee schedule of Medicare payment rates that are effective April 1. Since the HCPCS final determination was released, we have worked very closely with the agency to review the invoice and transaction information that we had previously submitted and provide supplemental data or explanations as additional questions arise. While the latest development is a temporary delay, we are encouraged that CMS has indicated to us that once it determines a final payment rate, the agency can amend the April 2024 DMEPOS fee schedule so that the payment rate for exoskeletons can be established for the rest of 2024. This is important because it means that the establishment of a payment rate does not need to be delayed until the next HCPCS cycle six months from now. Our active engagement with CMS is ongoing and we work to establish the payment rate as soon as possible. Until a payment rate for exoskeletons is added to the DMEPOS schedule, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) still have authority to approve and pay claims on a case-by-case basis with discretion to set the payment rate. As we discussed on our Q4’23 earnings call, we have submitted 35 Medicare claims for payment which are eligible for reimbursement under the existing authority of the MACs. So far, one claim has been paid with the remaining ones in various stages of the claim review process. Lifeward intends to submit an additional 60-75 additional Medicare claims by the end of 2024 to accelerate its momentum in expanding access for qualified Medicare beneficiaries. The Lifeward team is working tirelessly to make broader access to exoskeletons a reality for people with SCI. The health benefits and freedom that this technology provides to these individuals are well documented and truly life changing. We appreciate our investors for their shared vision about the transformation that this technology can bring to many lives. We also thank our investors for their patience because, as for many new technologies that drive revolutionary change, the path to achieving our goal is long with many challenges along the way. We have overcome the hurdles in the past and we are confident that, with the continued engagement on the issue by CMS, the resolution of the payment rate can reach a positive conclusion. Sincerely, Larry JasinskiLifeward CEO About LifewardLifeward designs, develops, and commercializes life-changing solutions that span the continuum of care in physical rehabilitation and recovery, delivering proven functional and health benefits in clinical settings as well as in the home and community.

Announces $195 Million Ultra-Deepwater Drillship Contract Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Transocean (NYSE: RIG) extends the contract for the Deepwater Asgard in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with a total value of $195 million, including extra services and a lump sum payment of $10.9 million. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The extension of the Deepwater Asgard's contract in the Gulf of Mexico represents a significant commitment from both Transocean and the independent operator. With a total contract value of approximately $195 million, this deal not only solidifies Transocean's backlog but also provides a clear revenue stream for the next year. The inclusion of additional services may suggest an expansion of Transocean's offerings or a customized solution tailored to the operator's needs, which could set a precedent for future contracts.From a financial perspective, the $10.9 million lump sum payment is an upfront cash infusion that could improve Transocean's liquidity. However, it's essential to assess how this payment affects the overall profitability of the contract. The estimated backlog of approximately $184 million, excluding the lump sum, will be recognized over the contract's duration, smoothing out revenue recognition and potentially providing a more stable financial outlook for investors. Offshore Drilling Consultant The Deepwater Asgard's continued operation in the Gulf of Mexico is indicative of the region's ongoing attractiveness for hydrocarbon exploration and production. The rig's specific capabilities, likely including advanced drilling and safety technology, make it a valuable asset in a competitive industry. The extension of its contract suggests that the operator is confident in the rig's performance and Transocean's operational expertise.It's important to consider the operational implications of the additional services included in the contract. These services could range from logistical support to advanced analytics, which can improve efficiency and safety on the rig. For stakeholders, the key questions revolve around how these services will impact operational costs and whether they will lead to improved margins or simply maintain the status quo. Environmental Compliance Advisor Operating in the Gulf of Mexico requires stringent adherence to environmental regulations and safety standards. Transocean's ability to secure a contract extension suggests a strong track record in these areas. For investors, the long-term implications of this contract must be evaluated in the context of environmental risk management. A single incident can have far-reaching financial and reputational consequences.While the contract's value is substantial, it's critical to monitor Transocean's investment in environmental compliance and safety measures. These investments are not just cost centers but also serve to mitigate risk and enhance the company's reputation in the industry. The additional services may include environmental monitoring or spill response capabilities, which would further underscore the importance of these considerations in offshore drilling operations. 04/01/2024 - 04:24 PM STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) (“Transocean”) today announced a 365-day contract extension for the Deepwater Asgard with an independent operator in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The program is expected to commence in June 2024 in direct continuation of the rig’s current program and includes additional services. The total contract value of approximately $195 million includes a $10.9 million lump sum payment, which is not included in the estimated backlog of approximately $184 million.

Negative The company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(715) thousand for Q4 2023 and $8.3 million for full year 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results released by FlexShopper, Inc. demonstrate significant growth in key financial metrics such as gross profit, which saw an increase of 315.8% and adjusted EBITDA, which turned from a negative figure to a positive $8.1 million. These figures suggest improved operational efficiency and a stronger ability to generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. However, the net loss attributable to common stockholders indicates that despite these improvements, there are still challenges to be addressed, possibly including interest expenses or non-operational factors.The refinancing of obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement and the establishment of the 2024 Credit Agreement with Computershare Trust Company indicates FlexShopper's active management of its debt profile. The new terms, including the ability to borrow up to $150 million, provide the company with substantial liquidity to support operations. The interest rate of SOFR plus 9% per annum is relatively high, reflecting the risk profile of the company and the current interest rate environment. Investors should monitor how this debt restructuring will affect the company's interest expenses and overall financial health in the long term. Market Research Analyst FlexShopper's reported increase in total fundings and net lease and loan revenues indicates an expanding market presence, likely driven by a combination of increased consumer demand and strategic initiatives. The lease-to-own sector typically serves customers with limited access to traditional credit, which may expand the company's customer base during economic fluctuations as consumers seek alternative financing options.The significant growth in gross profit also suggests that FlexShopper is benefiting from economies of scale or has improved its cost management, both of which can enhance competitive positioning. However, the stock market's reaction to these financial results will depend on how these figures align with investor expectations and the company's forward-looking guidance. Legal Expert The termination of the 2015 Credit Agreement and the entry into the 2024 Credit Agreement are critical legal events that reflect FlexShopper's strategic financial management. It is essential to understand the terms of the new agreement, particularly the events of default and the security interest granted in certain leases and loans as collateral. These terms will have legal implications for the company's operational flexibility and financial obligations.Investors should note that while the restructuring of debt can provide immediate liquidity relief, it also imposes new covenants and obligations that the company must adhere to. Any failure to comply with these terms could have legal repercussions that impact the company's financial stability and stock performance. 04/01/2024 - 04:30 PM BOCA RATON, Fla., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FlexShopper, Inc.

The lead program passed interim futility analysis milestone, completed enrollment, and expects topline data by first half of 2025. Recent achievements include raising $4.0 million in a public offering, appointing Amy Mahery to the Board of Directors, and reaching key clinical development milestones. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by CNS Pharmaceuticals regarding the progression of their lead program, Berubicin, in a potentially pivotal study for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) marks a significant milestone. The GBM market is one with high unmet medical needs due to the aggressive nature of the disease and limited effective treatments. The successful completion of the interim futility analysis and the recommendation from the DSMB to proceed without modification potentially indicate a positive risk-benefit profile for Berubicin.From a medical research perspective, the continuation of the trial is a positive indicator of Berubicin's potential efficacy. The primary endpoint of Overall Survival is a critical measure in oncology trials, particularly for GBM, where the average survival post-diagnosis is relatively short. If Berubicin can demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in survival, it could become a significant player in the GBM treatment landscape. However, it is essential to remain cautious as the final topline data will provide the definitive efficacy and safety profile. Financial Analyst Investors in CNS Pharmaceuticals will be closely monitoring the development of Berubicin. The successful interim analysis and the advancement of the trial are likely to be received positively by the market, as they reduce some of the clinical development risks associated with the drug. The $4.0 million raised through a public offering provides the company with additional capital to continue its research efforts, but it's important to note the burn rate and future financing needs as the trial progresses towards its completion.Given that CNS Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on brain and central nervous system cancers, the success of Berubicin could have a substantial impact on the company's valuation. However, investors should consider the inherent risks of biotech investing, including the possibility of negative trial results, regulatory hurdles and the challenges of commercialization. The appointment of a biotech commercialization expert to the Board could be strategic in navigating these challenges post-approval. Market Research Analyst The GBM treatment market is characterized by a strong demand for innovative therapies, given the poor prognosis associated with the disease. With the completion of enrollment for the Berubicin study, CNS Pharmaceuticals is positioning itself as a potential key player in this space. The market opportunity for effective GBM treatments is significant and CNS's progress could attract partnership opportunities or even make it a potential acquisition target.It is important to understand the competitive landscape, as other pharmaceutical companies are also developing GBM treatments. The unique selling proposition of Berubicin, should it be approved, will depend on its efficacy, safety profile and how it compares to other treatments in the pipeline. CNS Pharmaceuticals' strategy to expand its board with industry leaders may provide insights into the market dynamics and help the company to effectively position Berubicin, should it reach the market. 04/01/2024 - 04:26 PM Lead program, Berubicin, successfully passed pre-planned interim futility analysis milestone with recommendation from DSMB to proceed without modification in potentially pivotal GBM studyBerubicin study enrollment completed; Topline data expected in first half of 2025Clinical progress represents important steps towards Berubicin potentially addressing the most aggressive type of brain cancer with an average survival of only 14 to 16 months after diagnosis and no cureHOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNSP) (""CNS"" or the ""Company""), a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel treatments for primary and metastatic cancers in the brain and central nervous system, today reported its financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023 and outlined recent corporate and clinical development highlights.John Climaco, CEO of CNS Pharmaceuticals, stated, ""There remains a tremendous unmet medical need for an effective treatment for GBM, and we are dedicated to advancing this important program forward to bring much needed hope for patients. Over the course of 2023 we made significant progress with our lead development program, Berubicin, having recently achieved four primary objectives toward which we were actively working: maintain a rapid pace of enrollment to reach our pre-planned interim analysis; complete planned enrollment; bolster buy-in from investigators; and expand our board indicating a strong support system from industry leaders.""""In addition to reaching complete enrollment we have also successfully completed the interim futility analysis and received a recommendation from the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to continue the study without modification, which we believe is a monumental step towards our objective of seeing Berubicin approved. Additionally, we have added noteworthy members to our Board who have the knowledge and expertise to help drive our efforts forward. With these achievements behind us, we are closer to fulfilling our mission and promise to patients and shareholders to bring Berubicin across the finish line towards approval,"" concluded Mr. Climaco.Recent AchievementsClosed a public offering for gross proceeds of $4.0 million;Appointed biotech commercialization leader Amy Mahery to the Company's Board of Directors;Announced successful outcome to the pre-planned interim futility analysis of efficacy and safety in the Company's ongoing global, potentially pivotal trial of Berubicin for the treatment of GBM; andReached full enrollment in study of Berubicin for the treatment of GBM.Berubicin Clinical Development ProgressThe trial design of our potentially pivotal trial of Berubicin included a pre-planned, non-binding interim futility analysis. The Company reached the criteria required by the study protocol to conduct this interim futility analysis, which an independent DSMB is responsible for conducting. The DSMB's charter mandated that they review the primary endpoint, Overall Survival, as well as secondary endpoints and safety data to determine whether the efficacy data for the risk-benefit profile warrants modification or discontinuation of the study. On December 18, 2023, the Company released the DSMB's recommendation which was to continue the study without modification. Management remains blinded to the data underlying the recommendation of the DSMB.The Company expects to report topline data from its study of Berubicin in the first half of 2025, although it is impossible to accurately predict how long patients on the study may survive, which could impact the timing of the release of topline data.For more information about Berubicin clinical trial, visit clinicaltrials.gov and reference identifier NCT04762069.Summary of Financial Results for the Full Year 2023The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $18.9 million compared to approximately $15.3 million for the comparable period in 2022. The change in net loss is primarily attributable to increased research and development costs.The Company reported research and development expenses of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $9.3 million for the comparable period in 2022. The increase in research and development expenses during the period were mainly attributed to the timing of research organization (CRO) expenses and patient treatment costs related to continued progress with our clinical trial for Berubicin.General and administrative expenses were approximately $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $6.0 million for the comparable period in 2022. This change is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately $792,000 in professional expenses, $488,000 in employee compensation, $141,000 in stock-based compensation and $92,000 in insurance expenses. These changes were offset by increases of approximately $145,000 in travel expenses, board of director compensation of $96,000, advertising and marketing of $68,000 and other general and administrative expenses of $7,000.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of approximately $0.5 million. Subsequent to the end of 2023, the Company closed a $4.0 million public offering with participation from healthcare-focused institutional investors, retail investors, and certain officers and directors of the Company. Management anticipates that its cash on hand as of December 31, 2023, combined with capital raised subsequent to December 31, 2023, is sufficient to fund its planned operations into but not beyond the latter half of the second quarter of 2024.About BerubicinBerubicin is the Company's novel anthracycline and the first anthracycline to appear to cross the blood-brain barrier, for the treatment of GBM, an aggressive and incurable form of brain cancer.Berubicin is currently being evaluated in a potentially pivotal, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study in adult patients with recurrent GBM (WHO Grade IV) after failure of standard first-line therapy and compared to Lomustine. The study has enrolled 252 patients across 46 clinical trial sites in the U.S., Italy, France, Spain, and Switzerland. The primary endpoint of the study is Overall Survival (OS), a rigorous endpoint the FDA has recognized as the basis for approval of oncology drugs when a statistically significant improvement can be shown relative to a randomized control arm.The FDA has granted CNS Pharmaceuticals Fast Track Designation for Berubicin which enables more frequent interactions with the agency for guidance on expediting the development and review process. Additionally, the Company has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, which may provide seven years of marketing exclusivity upon approval of an NDA.About CNS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.CNS Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of anti-cancer drug candidates for the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the brain and central nervous system. The Company's lead drug candidate, Berubicin, is a novel anthracycline and the first anthracycline to appear to cross the blood-brain barrier. Berubicin is currently in development for the treatment of a number of serious brain and CNS oncology indications including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive and incurable form of brain cancer.For more information, please visit www.CNSPharma.com, and connect with the Company on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.Forward-Looking StatementsSome of the statements in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.

Renewed line of credit, extended bridge notes, and terminated ATM equity facility to enhance liquidity needs. Negative Net sales declined in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to discontinuation of non-profitable accounts and rationalization of low-quality revenue. Gross profit loss in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower volumes and increased trade accruals. Operating loss increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year. Net loss per share increased in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year. Market Research Analyst Examining Stryve Foods' reported increase in retail sales velocity, which is a critical measure of a brand's performance at the point of sale, the data is indicative of the company's successful rebranding and packaging strategies. The 31.7% year-over-year rise in this metric for the Stryve brand suggests that the new packaging has been well received by consumers, potentially leading to increased shelf turnover and higher revenue per store.Furthermore, the company's focus on core revenue streams and the rationalization of underperforming SKUs and accounts are strategic moves aimed at improving unit economics. This could lead to a more sustainable business model with the potential for increased profitability over the long term. The guidance for fiscal year 2024 implies a significant growth in net sales, which might attract investor interest as it suggests confidence in the company's strategic direction and market positioning. Financial Analyst The reported 52.9% improvement in Adjusted EBITDA Loss is a strong indicator of Stryve Foods' enhanced financial discipline and operational efficiency. This turnaround is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the snack food industry, where margins can be thin and competition is intense. Investors should note the company's strategic decision to prioritize quality over quantity in its revenue streams, which appears to be paying off in terms of margin improvement.Additionally, the extension of the asset-based line of credit and the strategic extension of maturing bridge notes provide the company with financial flexibility. This maneuvering enhances Stryve's ability to pursue growth opportunities without the immediate pressure of refinancing. The termination of the ATM equity facility also suggests a shift towards less dilutive financing strategies, which could be favorable for current shareholders. Food Industry Analyst Within the competitive landscape of the healthy snacking sector, Stryve Foods' operational pivot to focus on high-quality growth and operating leverage is noteworthy. The air-dried meat snack industry is a niche but growing segment and Stryve's positioning as a leader in this space is reinforced by its reported market share increase. The emphasis on product innovation and strategic market penetration is essential for maintaining a competitive edge and Stryve's efforts here could lead to increased brand loyalty and market share.However, the reported net sales decline due to the discontinuation of non-profitable accounts and rationalization of revenue streams must be carefully managed to ensure that the pursuit of quality does not overly constrain the volume necessary for sustained growth. The balance between quality and volume will be critical for Stryve's continued success in the industry. 04/01/2024 - 04:20 PM Improved Full-Year Adj. EBITDA Loss by 52.9% Year-over-Year3New Stryve Brand Packaging Driving 31.7% Increase in Retail Sales Velocity Year-over-Year1FY 2024 Guidance Implies Growth in Net Sales of Approximately 35% to 70% PLANO, Texas, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stryve Foods, Inc. (“Stryve” or “the Company”) (NASDAQ: SNAX), an emerging healthy snacking platform and leader in the air-dried meat snack industry in the United States, today reports financial and operating results for the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Retail PerformanceIn measured channels, the Company’s retail brands in the aggregate continue to outperform the overall meat snack category and that trend appears to be accelerating. The most recent 12-Week SPINS data reflects meaningful year-over-year improvement in measured channels for the Stryve family of brands with retail dollar sales increasing 18.9%, total dollar velocities increasing 12.5%, and market share increasing 8.3bps1. Each of those year-over-year measures was exceeded in the most recent 4-Week SPINS data, which reflects an increase in retail dollar sales of 24.4%, and increase in total dollar velocities of 23.7%, and an increase in market share of 9.7bps2. Management believes that this acceleration is a sign of the impact of the Company’s transformation efforts, and in particular the new packaging and refreshed branding as well as the significant improvements in quality that have been achieved. An example of this can be most clearly seen in the Stryve brand, which has experienced the largest year-over-year increases in retail sales velocities with 31.7% and 39.3% increases in the 12-week and 4-week periods, respectively. Retail sales velocity is a measure of the amount of sales per store per week of the brand(s) across all of the brand(s)’ distribution in measured channels. Retail sales velocity and other retail metrics are derived from check-out register scan data reported by retailers and management believes they are indicative that the Company’s strategy is resonating with consumers and retailers alike. 2023 – A Year of TransformationThe Company has made great strides in its strategic transformation in 2023 showing meaningful year-over-year improvements in the quality of revenue with higher gross margins, lower operating expenses, and significantly narrowed losses. Management’s strategy, executed in 2023, was to transform the business to put it in a position to reap the benefits of high-quality growth and operating leverage. The Company reduced its topline considerably year-over-year in an effort to focus on quality core revenue streams, rationalize underperforming SKUS and accounts. In doing so, it has strengthened its unit economics and looks to move into the last phase of the overall transformation in 2024, accelerating quality growth. Chris Boever, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2023 marked a year of strategic transformation for Stryve, underpinned by our commitment to operational excellence and market expansion. We're thrilled to see our efforts translate into robust retail performance and strengthened relationships with our retail partners. As we move into 2024, we are energized to continue this momentum, focusing on product innovation and strategic market penetration to further solidify our leadership in the healthy snacking sector.” Fiscal Year 2024 OutlookFor fiscal year 2024, Stryve Foods sets its net sales guidance in the range of $24 million to $30 million, with expectations for volume acceleration contributing to substantial year-over-year gross margin improvement and increasing each quarter as more volume comes online. Alex Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Our financial and operational discipline in 2023 has led to a 52.9% reduction in our Adj. EBITDA Loss for the year and has laid a strong foundation for operating leverage as we grow. Further, our gross profit improvement of $3.1 million year-over-year is a great reflection of transformed unit economics, especially when considering the absorption effects of our strategic rationalization of revenue. As we continue into 2024, we expect to see meaningfully reduced losses each quarter, accelerating as we scale. At the high end of our sales guidance range, would expect to see a breakeven point from an Adj. EBITDA standpoint during fourth quarter, absent any significant externality or significant change in beef prices. We have worked tirelessly to ensure that 2023 was our year of transformation and to transition into 2024 with a renewed emphasis on quality growth while remaining disciplined in everything we do.” Line of Credit Renewal, Bridge Note Extensions, and At-the-Market (ATM) Equity Facility Termination The Company is pleased to announce the renewal of its asset-based line of credit with Alterna Capital on the same terms for the next two years. That facility, with $8.0 million in committed borrowing capacity, was set to mature in September 2024 and is now contracted through March 2026. Additionally, in January of 2024, the Company successfully negotiated the strategic extension of $4.1 million of maturing bridge notes, providing Stryve with up to another 12 months of time before maturity. Lastly, the Company has terminated its ATM equity facility with Craig Hallum Capital as it looks to secure less dilutive means to augment its liquidity needs. “These extensions help to create some breathing room for us to operate with focused discipline on driving value in the business. Further, we believe that all of our shareholders will be pleased that we’ve stepped away from the ATM facility as we seek to secure more attractive means of financing to support our growth needs,” Hawkins concluded. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Net sales of $2.9 million, compared to $5.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Net sales declined in part due to the Company’s discontinuation of non-profitable accounts, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and margin losing items some of which was still present in the prior year period. Further, the Company’s packaging transitions at certain key customers created a dynamic in the fourth quarter of 2023 where the old-packaging items were phased out of retailer inventories in advance of a January 2024 launch of the new items.Gross profit loss of ($0.1) million compared to gross profit of $1.2 million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2023 performance is primarily attributable to lower volumes leading to under absorption of costs in the Company’s manufacturing facilities compounded by increased trade accruals affecting net realized price, and liquidation sales of rationalized, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory in the quarter to support the Company’s packaging transition and phase-out of legacy items.Operating loss of ($4.2) million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to operating loss of ($4.3) million in the 2022 fourth quarter. Interest expense of $1.2 million for the 2023 fourth quarter includes approximately $0.5 million of non-cash interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants connected to the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023.Net loss of ($5.3) million, or ($2.19) per share, compared to a net loss of ($4.5) million, or ($2.17) per share, in the 2022 fourth quarter. Adjusted loss per share3 of ($1.90) for the fourth quarter of 2023, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($2.01) for the year-ago period.Adjusted EBITDA loss3 of ($3.4) million for the 2023 fourth quarter, compared to ($3.5) million in the prior year quarter. Full Year 2023 Highlights Net sales of $17.7 million, compared to $29.9 million in the year-ago comparable period. Net sales declined primarily due to the Company’s discontinuation of non-profitable accounts, rationalization of low-quality revenue, which included the discontinuation of slow-moving and lower margin items.Gross profit of $2.4 million, or 13.7% of net sales, compared to negative gross profit of ($0.7) million in the 2022 period. This improvement is attributable to the pricing actions taken as part of the Company’s transformation, manufacturing efficiencies and productivity achieved throughout the year, and enhanced procurement strategies, offset partially by reduced volumes stemming from the strategic rationalization of revenue.Operating loss of ($15.4) million, compared to operating loss of ($32.1) million in the 2022 period. This improvement was driven by a $3.1 million of increased gross profit as well as an overall reduction in operating expenses of $13.6 million year-over-year. Interest expense of $3.6 million for the 2023 year includes approximately $1.4 million of non-cash interest expense related to the accounting treatment of the warrants connected to the promissory notes issued on April 19, 2023.Net loss of ($19.0) million, or ($8.59) per share, compared to a net loss of ($33.1) million, or ($16.18) per share, in 2022.Adjusted loss per share3 of ($7.34) for the 2023 full year, which compares favorably to adjusted loss per share of ($13.58) for the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA loss3 of ($11.8) million for the 2023 full year, compared to ($25.0) million in the prior year period. 1 Source: SPINS data for the 12-week period ending February 25th, 2024.2 Source: SPINS data for the 4-week period ending February 25th, 2024.3 Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share are a non-GAAP financial measure as defined and reconciled to GAAP below.

High-resolution Earth observation satellites equipped with AI can significantly enhance our ability to detect and respond to natural disasters, potentially saving lives and reducing economic losses. The NEONSAT-1 satellite's focus on the Korean Peninsula could provide critical data for disaster preparedness and climate change studies in the region.Furthermore, the technology demonstrated by NASA's ACS3 mission could contribute to more sustainable space exploration by utilizing solar sail propulsion. This has environmental benefits, as it reduces the need for chemical propellants that can be harmful to the Earth's atmosphere. The long-term impact of such technologies could transform how we approach space travel and Earth observation, with positive implications for environmental sustainability and disaster management practices. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM This latest mission will see Rocket Lab perform multiple in-space engine burns to deploy two payloads to separate orbits several hundred kilometres apart. LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a global leader in launch services and space systems, today announced it has set the launch window for its next Electron launch. The ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ mission is scheduled to launch from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 in Mahia, New Zealand during a 14-day launch window that opens on April 24th. Electron will carry two satellites for two separate customers: NEONSAT-1, an Earth observation satellite for the Satellite Technology Research Center (SaTReC) at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), and NASA’s Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3). The primary payload for this mission, NEONSAT-1, is an Earth observation satellite with a high-resolution optical camera designed to monitor for natural disasters along the Korean Peninsula by pairing its images with artificial intelligence. NEONSAT-1 is the first satellite developed under the NEONSAT program by SaTReC and KAIST, Korea’s leading university in science and technology, which developed and operated Korea’s very first satellite KITSAT-1 more than 30 years ago. Other NEONSAT satellites are planned to be launched in 2026 and 2027 to build out the NEONSAT constellation. The program is a collaboration across multiple Korean academic, industry, and research institutions including SaTReC in KAIST, which is leading the program’s system design and engineering; the SaTReC Initiative, a Korean satellite manufacturer that has successfully developed seven previous remote sensing satellites for low Earth orbit; and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), which is managing the mission’s ground segments and technology supervision for the NEONSAT program. NEONSAT is funded by the Koren government’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT). NASA’s ACS3 is a technology demonstration of new materials and deployable structures for solar sail propulsion systems that use sunlight to propel the spacecraft. Much like a sailboat is powered by wind pushing against a sail, solar sails employ the pressure of sunlight for propulsion, eliminating the need for conventional rocket propellant. The mission plans to test the deployment of new composite booms that will unfurl the solar sail to measure approximately 30 feet per side, or about the size of a small apartment in total. Flight data obtained during the demonstration will be used for designing future larger-scale composite solar sail systems for space weather early warning satellites, asteroid and other small body reconnaissance missions, and missions to observe the polar regions of the sun. The ACS3 was designed and built at NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and the technology demonstration is managed and funded by the Small Spacecraft Technology program at and with NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley. NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, interested in larger solar sail missions in the future, is funding an extended operations component to execute a series of maneuvers to raise and lower the spacecraft’s orbit, demonstrating the practicality of solar sailing. The capability of Electron’s Kick Stage to perform multiple engine burns in space and deploy individual satellites to unique orbits is critical to this mission. The Kick Stage will first ignite its Curie engine to deploy NEONSAT-1 to its target 520km circular Earth orbit. After the payload’s separation, it will ignite its Curie engine again to perform an apogee raise to 1,000km. Once in this phasing orbit, the Curie will ignite a third time to circularise before deploying the solar sail demonstration spacecraft. The Kick Stage will then ignite Curie a fourth and final time to perform a deorbit burn that returns the Kick Stage closer to Earth, speeding up its eventual deorbit and removal from space to support a more sustainable space environment. Rocket Lab has demonstrated similar orbit raises, inclination changes, and deorbit maneuvers across previous Electron missions and most recently with its successful spacecraft re-entry for Varda on February 21, 2024. ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ will be Rocket Lab’s fifth mission of 2024 and the 47th Electron launch overall. ‘Beginning Of The Swarm’ details: Launch window: opens no-earlier-than April 24, 2024. Customers: The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and NASA. Satellites: NEONSAT-1 for SaTReC/KAIST and the Advanced Composite Solar Sail System (ACS3) for NASA. Target orbits: NEONSAT-1 to 520km circular Earth orbit, ACS3 to 1,000km circular Earth orbit.

(NYSE: NYC) reported its financial results for Q4 2023 and full-year 2023. Revenue for Q4 was $15.4 million, with a net loss of $73.9 million. Full-year revenue was $62.7 million, with a net loss of $105.9 million. The CEO highlighted a 86.7% portfolio occupancy and new leasing activity. The company's debt structure is fixed-rate with a 4.4% interest rate. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by American Strategic Investment Co. reveals a significant net loss for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023. Notably, the company reported a net loss of $73.9 million for the quarter and $105.9 million for the year. The negative Funds from Operations (FFO) and Core FFO, which stand at negative $1.5 million and negative $1.2 million for the quarter, respectively, are indicators that the company's operational performance is below expectations. FFO and Core FFO are critical metrics for real estate investment trusts (REITs), as they measure the cash generated by the company's operations, which is essential for covering dividends to shareholders.Moreover, the reported net loss per share of $32.27 for the quarter and $47.57 for the year, after adjusting for a reverse stock split, suggests that shareholders are facing a substantial dilution in value. The company's strategy of owning commercial real estate in New York City's boroughs is facing challenges, as seen by the non-cash impairment on an office property. This impairment reflects the potential overvaluation of assets or a decrease in their market value, which is a concern for investors eyeing asset performance and valuation.Despite the negative financial results, the company has made some progress in leasing activities and boasts a portfolio occupancy rate of 86.7% as of the end of 2023. However, investors should be wary of the short-term liquidity position, with the company holding $5.3 million in cash against a backdrop of $394.2 million in net debt. The balance sheet does show a conservative net leverage of 47.0%, but the weighted-average interest rate on debt stands at 4.4%, which could be a pressure point if interest rates rise. Real Estate Market Analyst ASIC's portfolio performance, with a year-end occupancy rate of 86.7% and a weighted-average remaining lease term of 6.5 years, indicates stability in tenancy, which is a positive sign for potential revenue streams. The fact that 79% of annualized straight-line rent comes from investment-grade or implied investment-grade tenants provides a degree of creditworthiness to the company's rental income. However, the real estate market, particularly in New York City, is subject to fluctuations due to economic conditions, regulatory changes and market saturation.The office property sector, which constitutes 72% of ASIC's portfolio based on annualized straight-line rent, has been experiencing a transformation, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, with trends shifting towards remote work and flexible office spaces. The impairment on an office property recognized by ASIC could be indicative of these broader market trends affecting property valuations and demand. Additionally, the increase in portfolio occupancy and new lease signings is encouraging, but it must be weighed against the overall net losses and negative FFO figures, which raise questions about the profitability and sustainability of the company's growth trajectory.Investors should also consider the implications of the company's 100% fixed-rate debt in an environment of changing interest rates. While fixed-rate debt provides predictability in debt servicing costs, it can also mean missed opportunities to benefit from potential decreases in interest rates, depending on the direction of the economic cycle. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, ASIC's financial results highlight several areas of concern. The substantial net loss and negative FFO figures suggest that the company is currently not generating sufficient operational cash flow to sustain its dividend payments, a key factor for REIT investors. The impairment on an office property also points to potential overvaluation risk in the company's asset portfolio, which could lead to further write-downs if the market conditions deteriorate.The company's debt profile, with all debt being fixed-rate and a weighted-average maturity of 3.2 years, presents both stability and refinancing risk. While the fixed interest rate shields the company from short-term interest rate volatility, the relatively short debt maturity horizon means that ASIC will need to address refinancing risk in the near term, which could be challenging if the credit market tightens or if the company's financial position does not improve.ASIC's liquidity position, with $5.3 million in cash, is constrained, especially considering the minimum liquidity covenants under some of its mortgage loans. This may limit the company's flexibility to respond to unforeseen expenses or investment opportunities. Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to improve its cash position and manage its debt obligations to mitigate liquidity risk. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Strategic Investment Co.

Accounting Treatment of Rent Deferrals The majority of the concessions granted to our tenants as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are rent deferrals or temporary rent abatements with the original lease term unchanged and collection of deferred rent deemed probable. As a result of relief granted by the FASB and the SEC related to lease modification accounting, rental revenue used to calculate Net Income, NAREIT FFO and Core FFO have not been, and we do not expect it to be, significantly impacted by these types of deferrals.

While NOI is a property-level measure, Core FFO is based on our total performance and therefore reflects the impact of other items not specifically associated with NOI such as, interest expense, general and administrative expenses and operating fees to related parties. A description of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), is provided above. Because we elected to be taxed as a REIT through the taxable year ending on December 31, 2022, we did not change any of the non-GAAP metrics that we have historically used to evaluate performance. Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures FFO, Core FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, NOI, Cash NOI and Cash Paid for Interest should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), an industry trade group, definition (as we do), or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do, or may calculate Core FFO differently than we do. Consequently, our presentation of FFO and Core FFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We consider FFO and Core FFO useful indicators of our performance. Because FFO and Core FFO calculations exclude such factors as depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), FFO and Core FFO presentations facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other REITs in our peer group. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO and Core FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provide a more complete understanding of our performance, including relative to our peers and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities. However, FFO and Core FFO are not indicative of cash available to fund ongoing cash needs, including the ability to pay cash dividends. Investors are cautioned that FFO and Core FFO should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance excluding these activities, as they exclude certain costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in which these costs are incurred. Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations Funds from Operations Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the NAREIT, an industry trade group, has promulgated a performance measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP and FFO is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined under GAAP. We calculate FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards established over time by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as restated in a White Paper and approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT effective in December 2018 (the “White Paper”). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gain and losses from change in control and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities (including our New York City Operating Partnership L.P.) and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates are made to arrive at our proportionate share of FFO attributable to our stockholders. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT’s definition. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, among other things, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. Core Funds from Operations Beginning in the third quarter 2020, following the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, we began presenting Core FFO as a non-GAAP metric. We believe that Core FFO is utilized by other publicly-traded REITs although Core FFO presented by us may not be comparable to Core FFO reported by other REITs that define Core FFO differently. In calculating Core FFO, we start with FFO, then we exclude the impact of discrete non-operating transactions and other events which we do not consider representative of the comparable operating results of our real estate operating portfolio, which is our core business platform. Specific examples of discrete non-operating items include acquisition and transaction related costs for dead deals, debt extinguishment costs, non-cash equity-based compensation and costs incurred for the 2022 proxy that were specifically related to the portion of our 2022 proxy contest materials. We add back non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred with the early extinguishment of debt which are included in net income but are considered financing cash flows when paid in the statement of cash flows. We consider these write-offs and prepayment penalties to be capital transactions and not indicative of operations. By excluding expensed acquisition and transaction dead deal costs as well as non-operating costs, we believe Core FFO provides useful supplemental information that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management’s analysis of the investing and operating performance of our properties. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results. Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, Net Operating Income, Cash Net Operating Income and Cash Paid for Interest. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for acquisition and transaction-related expenses, fees related to the listing related costs and expenses, other non-cash items such as the vesting and conversion of the Class B Units, equity-based compensation expense and including our pro-rata share from unconsolidated joint ventures, is an appropriate measure of our ability to incur and service debt. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of our liquidity or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating activities. Other REITs may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently and our calculation should not be compared to that of other REITs. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by us to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. NOI is equal to total revenues, excluding contingent purchase price consideration, less property operating and maintenance expense. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income (loss). We believe NOI provides useful and relevant information because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents such items on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operations of the properties. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss). NOI excludes certain items included in calculating net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property’s results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or our ability to pay dividends. Cash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is intended to reflect the performance of our properties. We define Cash NOI as NOI excluding amortization of above/below market lease intangibles and straight-line adjustments that are included in GAAP lease revenues. We believe that Cash NOI is a helpful measure that both investors and management can use to evaluate the current financial performance of our properties and it allows for comparison of our operating performance between periods and to other REITs. Cash NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indication of our financial performance, or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund all needs. The method by which we calculate and present Cash NOI may not be directly comparable to the way other REITs present Cash NOI. Cash Paid for Interest is calculated based on the interest expense less non-cash portion of interest expense and amortization of mortgage (discount) premium, net. Management believes that Cash Paid for Interest provides useful information to investors to assess our overall solvency and financial flexibility. Cash Paid for Interest should not be considered as an alternative to interest expense as determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Reports 2023 Fourth Quarter Revenue and Earnings Above Guidance and Provides 2024 Outlook Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary PVH Corp. reports strong financial performance in 2023 with flat revenue in Q4, exceeding guidance, and EPS growth. The company projects a decrease in revenue for 2024 but maintains a positive outlook. PVH announces a $2 billion increase to its stock repurchase program. Positive PVH Corp. reported flat revenue of $2.490 billion in Q4 2023, exceeding guidance of a 3-4% decrease. Full-year revenue increased by 2% to $9.218 billion compared to the prior year period. Q4 EPS on a GAAP basis was $4.55, surpassing guidance of $3.48, and full-year EPS was $10.76, exceeding guidance of $9.75. PVH projects a 6-7% decrease in revenue for 2024, inclusive of factors like the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business and the 53rd week in 2023. Operating margin for 2024 is expected to remain flat at approximately 10.1%. EPS for 2024 is projected to be in the range of $10.75 to $11.00. The Board authorized a $2.0 billion increase to the stock repurchase program, reflecting confidence in long-term growth potential. Negative PVH projects a decrease in revenue for 2024, which may impact shareholder returns. The company experienced a decrease in wholesale revenue in North America in Q4 2023. Heritage Brands revenue decreased by 41% compared to the prior year period, including a 30% decrease from the sale of the women's intimates business. Market Research Analyst Increasing the stock repurchase program by $2 billion suggests a strong balance sheet and confidence in future cash flows. This can be seen as a positive indicator for investors, signaling potential undervaluation or a strategic move to consolidate ownership. However, the projected revenue decline for 2024, including the effects of divestitures and a shorter fiscal year, might raise concerns about growth prospects, particularly in the context of a challenging macroeconomic environment.While the gross margin improvement indicates effective cost management and pricing power, the focus should be on the sustainability of these margins in the face of potential economic headwinds. The company's emphasis on direct-to-consumer channels, as evidenced by a 9% growth in this segment, aligns with broader retail trends towards digital transformation and may buffer against wholesale volatility. Financial Analyst The reported EPS exceeding guidance for both Q4 and the full year provides a short-term positive outlook for investors, reflecting operational efficiency and possibly better-than-expected sales performance. The flat operating margin projection for 2024, despite a revenue decline, suggests a continued focus on cost control and operational efficiency. However, investors should consider the long-term implications of the revenue decline forecast and monitor the company's strategic initiatives under the PVH+ Plan to assess their effectiveness in driving long-term profitability.It's important to note the use of non-GAAP measures, which exclude certain items to provide what may be considered a clearer picture of the company's operating performance. Investors should understand these adjustments and consider both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when evaluating the company's financial health. Retail Industry Analyst The strategic initiatives outlined by the CEO, including the PVH+ Plan, aim to enhance brand desirability and market execution, which are critical in the highly competitive fashion industry. The focus on a demand-driven supply chain and inventory management, as evidenced by a 21% inventory reduction, is a proactive approach to maintaining stock freshness, which is vital for consumer appeal and can lead to reduced markdowns and improved profitability.However, the projected revenue decrease for 2024, partly due to divesting the Heritage Brands women's intimates business, indicates a narrowing of the company's portfolio. This strategic shift may allow for a more focused brand strategy but could also limit diversification benefits. Stakeholders should closely watch the company's performance in Asia and North America, where growth is expected, against the backdrop of a 'more challenged' European market. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM BOARD AUTHORIZES $2 BILLION INCREASE TO STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM 2023 fourth quarter and full year revenue: Fourth quarter revenue of $2.490 billion was flat as compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) and exceeded guidance of a decrease of 3% to 4% Full year revenue increased 2% to $9.218 billion compared to the prior year period (increased 1% on a constant currency basis); guidance was an increase of approximately 1% 2023 fourth quarter and full year EPS exceeded guidance: GAAP basis: $4.55 (fourth quarter) compared to guidance of approximately $3.48 and $10.76 (full year) compared to guidance of approximately $9.75 Non-GAAP basis: $3.72 (fourth quarter) compared to guidance of approximately $3.45 and $10.68 (full year) compared to guidance of approximately $10.45 2024 full year outlook Revenue: Projected to decrease 6% to 7% (decrease 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis) as compared to 2023, inclusive of a 2% reduction resulting from the sale of the Heritage Brands women’s intimates business in November 2023 and a 1% reduction from the 53rd week in 2023 Operating margin: Projected to be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023 EPS: Projected to be $10.75 to $11.00 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PVH Corp. [NYSE: PVH] today reported its 2023 fourth quarter and full year results and provided its 2024 outlook. Stefan Larsson, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We delivered a strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, generating high single-digit direct-to-consumer growth, with growth in both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger and all regions. We significantly expanded our gross margins, drove strong pricing power, and are beginning to realize the benefits from the early buildout of our demand-driven supply chain, which allowed us to decrease inventory 21% to last year with much better stock freshness to start the new spring season.” Mr. Larsson added, “Looking ahead to 2024, we will continue to build momentum with our PVH+ Plan, driving brand desirability for both Calvin and Tommy in product, consumer engagement and marketplace execution, powered by our demand-driven underlying operating engine. This will directly translate into growth in Asia and North America, while in Europe where the macro has become more challenged, our focus is on quality of sales to further strengthen our market-leading position. We see big, value-creating upside through the compounded effect of our consistency in PVH+ Plan execution and strong brand-building focus as we drive long-term, profitable, brand-accretive growth.” Zac Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, said, “Our disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan drove strong gross margin expansion and EPS growth for 2023. In a tougher macroeconomic backdrop in 2024, we are leaning into the next level of PVH+ Plan execution across the Company to create value by increasing quality of sales, driving gross margin improvements and cost efficiencies to deliver significant cash flow and attractive returns for our shareholders. Reflecting confidence in our long-term growth potential, the Board authorized a $2.0 billion increase to the Company’s stock repurchase program.” Non-GAAP Amounts: Amounts stated to be on a non-GAAP basis exclude the items that are defined or described in greater detail near the end of this release under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions.” Amounts stated on a constant currency basis also are deemed to be on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to amounts on a non-GAAP basis are presented after the Non-GAAP Exclusions section and identify and quantify all excluded items. Fourth Quarter Review: Revenue was flat compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). Overall revenue in the Company’s international businesses increased 4% over the prior year period as strong growth in the Asia Pacific region across all markets more than offset a continued challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, particularly impacting the wholesale business. In North America, revenue in the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses combined was down 2% compared to the prior year period, as strong growth in the direct-to-consumer business was more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, as wholesale customers continue to take a cautious approach. The benefit from the 53rd week in the fourth quarter of 2023 was largely offset by a reduction related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business that closed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 9% compared to the prior year period (increased 9% on a constant currency basis), with growth in all regions in both the Company’s owned and operated stores and digital commerce business. Owned and operated digital commerce revenue increased 10% compared to the prior year period (increased 9% on a constant currency basis). Wholesale revenue decreased 10% compared to the prior year period (decreased 12% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 3% reduction related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business, as wholesale customers continue to take a cautious approach. Total digital revenue increased 1% compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) as the strong growth in the Company’s digital commerce business discussed above was partially offset by a decrease in wholesale sales to traditional retailers’ ecommerce businesses and pure players. Total digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 20%. Gross margin was 60.3% compared to 55.9% in the prior year period. The increase reflects benefits from lower freight costs, a favorable shift in regional and channel mix and lower product costs. Inventory decreased 21% compared to the prior year period, in line with expectations, as the Company continues to proactively manage its inventory levels. Fourth Quarter Consolidated Results: Revenue of $2.490 billion was flat compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). The benefit from the 53rd week in 2023 was largely offset by the revenue reduction related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 1% compared to the prior year period (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis). Tommy Hilfiger International revenue decreased 1% (decreased 3% on a constant currency basis). Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 4%. Calvin Klein revenue increased 4% compared to the prior year period (increased 3% on a constant currency basis). Calvin Klein International revenue increased 12% (increased 10% on a constant currency basis). Calvin Klein North America revenue decreased 8% driven by a decrease in the wholesale business. Heritage Brands revenue decreased 41% compared to the prior year period, which included a 30% decrease resulting from the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) on a GAAP basis was $357 million, inclusive of a $5 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $297 million in the prior year period. Included in the fourth quarter and the prior year period were recognized actuarial gains on retirement plans of $46 million and $78 million, respectively. EBIT on a GAAP basis for these periods also includes the other amounts for the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $301 million, inclusive of the $5 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $215 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven by the gross margin improvement discussed above. The Company continued to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses and driving cost efficiencies, while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives. Earnings per share (“EPS”) GAAP basis: $4.55 compared to $2.18 in the prior year period. Non-GAAP basis: $3.72 compared to $2.38 in the prior year period. EPS on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2023 includes the positive impact of $0.06 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for these periods also included the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. Interest expense decreased to $20 million from $22 million in the prior year period. Effective tax rate was 19.3% on a GAAP basis as compared to 49.7% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the prior year period included the negative impact resulting from a $417 million pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-deductible for tax purposes and factored into the Company’s annualized effective tax rate. The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for these periods also includes pre-tax amounts and related tax effects for the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. The effective tax rate was 21.1% on a non-GAAP basis as compared to 21.7% in the prior year period. Full Year 2023 Consolidated Results: Revenue increased 2% to $9.218 billion compared to 2022 (increased 1% on a constant currency basis). The benefit from the 53rd week in 2023 was largely offset by the revenue reduction related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. Tommy Hilfiger revenue increased 4% compared to 2022 (increased 2% on a constant currency basis). Tommy Hilfiger International revenue increased 3% (increased 1% on a constant currency basis). Tommy Hilfiger North America revenue increased 6%. Calvin Klein revenue increased 3% compared to 2022 (increased 3% on a constant currency basis). Calvin Klein International revenue increased 10% (increased 9% on a constant currency basis). Calvin Klein North America revenue decreased 7% driven by a decrease in the wholesale business. Heritage Brands revenue decreased 18% compared to 2022, including a 7% decrease resulting from the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. EBIT on a GAAP basis was $929 million, inclusive of an $11 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $471 million in 2022. These results include the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excludes these amounts. EBIT on a non-GAAP basis was $931 million, inclusive of the $11 million positive impact due to foreign currency translation, compared to $857 million in 2022. The increase was driven by a 140 basis point improvement in gross margin, partially offset by higher expenses, including an increase in marketing and other investments to drive the Company’s strategic growth initiatives compared to 2022. The Company continued to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses and driving cost efficiencies, while making targeted investments to drive its strategic initiatives. EPS GAAP basis: $10.76 compared to $3.03 in 2022. Non-GAAP basis: $10.68 compared to $8.97 in 2022. EPS on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for 2023 includes the positive impact of $0.13 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for 2022 and 2023 also include the amounts for the applicable period described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for these periods excluded these amounts. Interest expense increased to $88 million from $83 million in 2022 primarily due to higher interest rates. Effective tax rate was 21.1% on a GAAP basis as compared to 48.4% in 2022. The effective tax rate was 21.9% on a non-GAAP basis as compared to 23.3% in 2022. Stock Repurchase Program: Delivering on its commitment under the PVH+ Plan to return excess cash to stockholders, the Company repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock for $282 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, bringing total share repurchases for the full year 2023 to 5.7 million shares for $550 million. On March 27, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a $2.0 billion increase to the stock repurchase program and extended it through July 2028. 2024 Outlook: Full Year 2024 Guidance Revenue is projected to decrease 6% to 7% as compared to 2023 (decrease 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a 2% reduction related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women’s intimates business and a 1% reduction from the 53rd week in 2023. Operating margin is projected to be approximately flat compared to 10.1% in 2023. EPS is projected to be in a range of $10.75 to $11.00 compared to $10.76 on a GAAP basis and $10.68 on a non-GAAP basis in 2023. The 2024 EPS projection includes the estimated negative impact of approximately $0.10 per share related to foreign currency translation. EPS on a GAAP basis for 2023 included the amounts described under the heading “Non-GAAP Exclusions” later in this release. EPS on a non-GAAP basis for 2023 excluded these amounts. Interest expense is projected to be relatively flat as compared to $88 million in 2023. Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 21%. First Quarter 2024 Guidance Revenue is projected to decrease approximately 11% as compared to the first quarter of 2023 (decrease approximately 10% on a constant currency basis), inclusive of a reduction of 3% related to the sale of the Heritage Brands women's intimates business. EPS is projected to be approximately $2.15 compared to $2.14 in the first quarter of 2023. The first quarter 2024 EPS projection includes the estimated negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share related to foreign currency translation. Interest expense is projected to decrease to approximately $20 million compared to $22 million in the first quarter of 2023. Effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 21%. Please see the section entitled “Full Year and Quarterly Reconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP Amounts” at the end of this release for further detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts discussed in this section. Non-GAAP Exclusions: The discussions in this release that refer to non-GAAP amounts exclude the following: Pre-tax gain of $46 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 related to the recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans. Pre-tax net gain of $13 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the sale of the Company’s Heritage Brands women's intimates business, which includes a gain on the sale, less costs to sell, and severance and other termination benefits associated with the transaction. Pre-tax restructuring costs of $61 million incurred in 2023 consisting principally of severance related to actions taken in the second and third quarters of 2023 under the plans initially announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, of which $39 million was incurred in the second quarter, $19 million was incurred in the third quarter and $4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax gain of $78 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to the recognized actuarial gain on retirement plans. Pre-tax noncash goodwill impairment charge of $417 million recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and primarily driven by a significant increase in discount rates. Pre-tax restructuring costs of $20 million incurred in 2022, consisting principally of severance related to initial actions under the plans announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023, of which $17 million was incurred in the third quarter and $4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax net costs of $43 million recorded in 2022 in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its Russia business, primarily consisting of noncash asset impairments and a gain on contract terminations, of which $50 million of charges were recorded in the second quarter and an $8 million gain was recorded in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax gain of $16 million recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V. Estimated tax effects associated with the above pre-tax items, which are based on the Company’s assessment of deductibility. In making this assessment, the Company evaluated each item that it had identified above as a non-GAAP exclusion to determine if such item was (i) taxable or tax deductible, in which case the tax effect was taken at the applicable income tax rate in the local jurisdiction, or (ii) non-taxable or non-deductible, in which case the Company assumed no tax effect. The Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues and can have a significant impact on the Company’s reported revenues. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period). The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures, including constant currency revenue information, as a supplement to its GAAP results. The Company believes presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of non-recurring and non-operational amounts and the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, and (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding non-recurring and non-operational amounts are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies. Please see tables 1 through 8 and the section entitled “Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue” later in this release for reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts.

(v) the levels of sales of the Company’s apparel, footwear and related products, both to its wholesale customers and in its retail stores and its directly operated digital commerce sites, the levels of sales of the Company’s licensees at wholesale and retail, and the extent of discounts and promotional pricing in which the Company and its licensees and other business partners are required to engage, all of which can be affected by weather conditions, changes in the economy (including inflationary pressures like those currently being experienced globally), fuel prices, reductions in travel, fashion trends, consolidations, repositionings and bankruptcies in the retail industries, consumer sentiment and other factors; (vi) the Company’s ability to manage its growth and inventory; (vii) quota restrictions, the imposition of safeguard controls and the imposition of new or increased duties or tariffs on goods from the countries where the Company or its licensees produce goods under its trademarks, any of which, among other things, could limit the ability to produce products in cost-effective countries, or in countries that have the labor and technical expertise needed, or require the Company to absorb costs or try to pass costs onto consumers, which could materially impact the Company’s revenue and profitability; (viii) the availability and cost of raw materials; (ix) the Company’s ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations and the migration and development of manufacturers (which can affect where the Company’s products can best be produced); (x) the regulation or prohibition of the transaction of business with specific individuals or entities and their affiliates or goods manufactured in (or containing raw materials or components from) certain regions, such as the listing of a person or entity as a Specially Designated National or Blocked Person by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the issuance of Withhold Release Orders by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection; (xi) changes in available factory and shipping capacity, wage and shipping cost escalation, and store closures in any of the countries where the Company’s or its licensees’ or wholesale customers’ or other business partners’ stores are located or products are sold or produced or are planned to be sold or produced, as a result of civil conflict, war or terrorist acts, the threat of any of the foregoing, or political or labor instability, such as the current war in Ukraine that led to the Company’s exit from its retail business in Russia and the cessation of its wholesale operations in Russia and Belarus, and the temporary cessation of business by many of its business partners in Ukraine; (xii) disease epidemics and health-related concerns, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in (and, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, did result in some of the following) supply-chain disruptions due to closed factories, reduced workforces and production capacity, shipping delays, container and trucker shortages, port congestion and other logistics problems, closed stores, and reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, or governments implement mandatory business closures, travel restrictions or the like, and market or other changes that could result in shortages of inventory available to be delivered to the Company’s stores and customers, order cancellations and lost sales, as well as in noncash impairments of the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets, operating lease right-of-use assets, and property, plant and equipment; (xiii) actions taken towards sustainability and social and environmental responsibility as part of the Company’s sustainability and social and environmental strategy may not be achieved or may be perceived to be falsely claimed, which could diminish consumer trust in the Company’s brands, as well as the Company’s brands’ value; (xiv) the failure of the Company’s licensees to market successfully licensed products or to preserve the value of the Company’s brands, or their misuse of the Company’s brands; (xv) significant fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which the Company transacts significant levels of business; (xvi) the Company’s retirement plan expenses recorded throughout the year are calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions, and differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses, which can be significant, that are recorded immediately in earnings, generally in the fourth quarter of the year; (xvii) the impact of new and revised tax legislation and regulations; and (xviii) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

PVH CORP. Non-GAAP Measures The Company believes it is useful to investors to present its results for the periods ended February 4, 2024 and January 29, 2023 on a non-GAAP basis by excluding (i) the recognized actuarial gains on retirement plans in the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022; (ii) the gain recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the sale of the Company’s Heritage Brands women's intimates business (the ""Heritage Brands intimates transaction""), which includes a gain on the sale, less costs to sell; (iii) the costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the Heritage Brands intimates transaction, consisting of severance and other termination benefits; (iv) the restructuring costs incurred in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2023 and the third and fourth quarters of 2022 related to actions taken under the plans initially announced in August 2022 to reduce people costs in the Company’s global offices by approximately 10% by the end of 2023 (the “2022 cost savings initiative”), consisting principally of severance; (v) the net costs incurred in connection with the Company’s decision to exit from its retail business in Russia and the cessation of its wholesale operations in Russia and Belarus (the “Russia business exit”), consisting of noncash asset impairments, contract termination and other costs, and severance recorded in the second quarter of 2022, partially offset by a gain on contract terminations recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022; (vi) the gain recorded in the second quarter of 2022 in connection with the sale of the Company’s equity investment in Karl Lagerfeld Holding B.V. (the “Karl Lagerfeld transaction”); (vii) the noncash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022, which was non-operational and primarily driven by a significant increase in discount rates, as a result of then-current economic conditions; and (viii) the tax effects associated with the foregoing pre-tax items. The Company excludes these amounts because it deems them to be non-recurring or non-operational and believes that their exclusion (i) facilitates comparing the results being reported against past and future results by eliminating amounts that it believes are not comparable between periods, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company, and (ii) assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company believes that investors often look at ongoing operations of an enterprise as a measure of assessing performance. The Company uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s Board of Directors and others. The Company’s results excluding the items described above are also the basis for certain incentive compensation calculations. The non-GAAP measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, the Company’s operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The information presented on a non-GAAP basis may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table presents the non-GAAP measures that are discussed in this release. Please see Tables 1 through 8 for the reconciliations of the GAAP amounts to amounts on a non-GAAP basis.

PVH CORP. Reconciliations of Constant Currency Revenue (In millions) As a supplement to the Company’s reported operating results, the Company presents constant currency revenue information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company presents results in this manner because it is a global company that transacts business in multiple currencies and reports financial information in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect the amounts reported by the Company in U.S. dollars with respect to its foreign revenues. Exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on reported revenues. The Company believes presenting constant currency revenue information provides useful information to investors, as it provides information to assess how its businesses performed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and assists investors in evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. The Company calculates constant currency revenue information by translating its foreign revenues for the relevant period into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior year period (rather than at the actual exchange rates in effect during the relevant period). Constant currency performance should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or as superior to, the Company’s operating performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The constant currency revenue information presented may not be comparable to similarly described measures reported by other companies.

The addition of MIM Software's offerings strengthens GE HealthCare's response to provider needs, simplifying, streamlining, and automating essential tasks to enhance workflows. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of MIM Software by GE HealthCare introduces a strategic expansion in the digital healthcare space, particularly in imaging analytics and workflow solutions. This move aligns with the broader industry trend towards digitalization and personalized healthcare, which aims to enhance patient outcomes and operational efficiency. The integration of MIM Software's capabilities with GE HealthCare's existing portfolio is likely to address the growing demand for advanced imaging and workflow automation in response to increasing procedure complexity and staffing challenges in healthcare.From a market perspective, the transaction can be seen as a competitive maneuver to solidify GE HealthCare's market position against other major players in the medical technology field. The focus on precision care and the incorporation of AI-enabled tools across multiple care areas could potentially open new revenue streams and provide cross-selling opportunities within existing customer bases. The emphasis on end-to-end standardization may also resonate with large healthcare systems seeking comprehensive solutions, potentially leading to larger contracts and partnerships.However, the financial impact remains speculative as the details of the transaction have not been disclosed and the expected neutrality to Adjusted EBIT in the first year indicates a short-term investment phase before realizing gains. Investors should monitor the integration process and the subsequent market adoption of the new offerings to gauge the long-term financial implications. Healthcare Technology Analyst The acquisition of MIM Software by GE HealthCare is significant in the context of healthcare technology, particularly for the advancement of precision care. MIM Software's suite of tools, including MIM SurePlan and MIM Symphony, are designed to integrate seamlessly with existing healthcare systems, providing clinicians with enhanced capabilities in image analysis and patient management. The focus on oncology, urology, neurology and cardiology—key areas of medical treatment—underscores the potential for these technologies to impact patient care directly.For instance, the integration of MIM Software's radiation oncology solutions with GE HealthCare's imaging portfolio could streamline treatment planning in cancer care, which is critical given the high prevalence of radiation therapy in cancer treatment protocols. Similarly, the combination of MIM Software's neuro imaging products with GE HealthCare's solutions could lead to more confident diagnoses and treatment plans for neurodegenerative diseases, an area of growing concern due to an aging population.The transaction also suggests an investment in the future of Theranostics, an emerging field combining therapy and diagnostics, which could revolutionize personalized medicine. The potential for these integrated solutions to support the development of new treatments, including alpha therapies, may have far-reaching implications for medical research and the healthcare industry. Financial Analyst The financial implications of GE HealthCare's acquisition of MIM Software are multifaceted. While the immediate financial details remain undisclosed, the expectation set by the company for the acquisition to be neutral to Adjusted EBIT in the first year suggests that there will not be an immediate boost to profitability. This is not uncommon for acquisitions of this nature, as the initial integration costs and investments in scaling up operations can offset initial revenue gains.However, the potential for the acquisition to be accretive thereafter indicates confidence in the long-term synergy and revenue growth. The focus should be on how effectively GE HealthCare can integrate MIM Software's technologies into its portfolio and capitalize on the growing demand for advanced digital healthcare solutions. Investors should consider the potential for market expansion, cost savings from streamlined operations and the ability to maintain a competitive edge through innovation when evaluating the long-term value of this acquisition.Additionally, the use of cash on hand to fund the transaction suggests a strong liquidity position for GE HealthCare, which could be reassuring for investors concerned about the financial stability of the company post-acquisition. 04/01/2024 - 06:13 PM With the addition of MIM Software, GE HealthCare aims to provide clinicians and healthcare systems with increasingly integrated and automated solutions, meeting the evolving needs of providers, and reinforcing a shared legacy of advanced patient care solutions Portfolio additions include AI-enabled image analysis and workflow tools spanning multiple care areas, including oncology, urology, neurology, and cardiology CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Less than three months after signing an agreement to acquire MIM Software Inc. (“MIM Software”), GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (“GE HealthCare” or the “Company"") (Nasdaq: GEHC) is proud to announce the acquisition’s close and addition of MIM Software’s imaging analytics and digital workflow solutions as a part of its leading global medical technology, pharmaceutical diagnostics, and digital portfolio. The availability of these offerings – including the MIM SurePlan and MIM Symphony families, MIM Maestro, MIM Encore, and more – is in alignment with GE HealthCare’s precision care strategy, which aims to deliver innovative digital solutions across care pathways for more precise, connected, and efficient care across disease states. ""We are thrilled to welcome MIM Software, known for driving innovation in multimodal image analytics and workflow, to our global GE HealthCare team,” said Peter Arduini, President & CEO, GE HealthCare. “These new capabilities align with our precision care strategy to personalize care, enhance hospital efficiency and clinician effectiveness, and appeal to new and existing GE HealthCare and MIM Software users who see this as an opportunity to better serve patients and help improve outcomes."" As patient procedures grow in number and complexity throughout a variety of care areas, today’s staffing shortages and other clinical challenges are expected to become more significant. The increasing availability of novel therapies and pace of change in healthcare further challenge healthcare leaders to drive operational efficiency, simplify patient management, and provide precise and accurate quantitative analysis of imaging data amid growing demand. These conditions make the provision of critical information from advanced imaging, workflow and digital solutions even more essential to help enable faster, more effective treatment plans and healthcare systems. The addition of MIM Software to GE HealthCare’s portfolio will strengthen the Company’s response to provider needs, supplying established solutions that are designed to help simplify, streamline, and automate essential tasks to enhance workflows. This includes continuing to grow MIM Software’s offerings for end-to-end standardization across large healthcare system fleets. The result is an innovative offering of digital solutions that provide a variety of beneficial features across care areas: Oncology: MIM Software's clinical tools – paired with GE HealthCare's imaging solutions – bring improved flexibility, automation, and efficiency to clinicians.

There is also special focus on radiation therapy and Theranostics. Radiation therapy – a type of treatment given alone or in combination with surgery and/or chemotherapy – is administered to nearly two-thirds of all cancer patients.i The addition of MIM Software’s radiation oncology solutions to GE HealthCare’s portfolio is designed to provide clinicians with complementary interoperable solutions that can help simplify complex planning, delivering high quality while helping to reduce time to treatment. In Theranostics, the combined portfolio aims to enhance medical research and clinical workflows to help clinicians improve patient stratification and selection, response prediction, and support the development of new treatments, including alpha therapies. Urology: GE HealthCare’s ultrasound guidance technology combined with MIM Software’s post-processing and fusion expertise yield’s an integrated suite of prostate fusion solutions with the ability to address needs across the care pathway to support a patient's personal prostate cancer journey. This already includes GE HealthCare’s bkFusion,ii an MRI-ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy solution powered by MIM Software technology. bkFusion helps clinicians deliver effective detection rates,iii and provides fast and simple workflows designed for urologists, and flexibility to choose from a range of options for transperitoneal and transrectal prostate biopsies. Additionally, MIM Symphony provides solutions across precision prostate cancer management – helping radiologists review and report prostate MRI, and urologists and radiation oncologists plan ablation and brachytherapy treatments. Neurology: GE HealthCare, already providing a range of solutions for neuro degenerative diseases – like Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, and more – will enhance its digital workflows with MIM Software’s neuro imaging products. This includes MIMneuro, which offers quantification solutions for dopamine transporter imaging and amyloid imaging. Collectively, this joint portfolio aims to boost clinicians’ confidence in image interpretation to support diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring, while supporting consistent and efficient workflows. Cardiology: GE HealthCare has a broad presence in the cardiology care area, from imaging, patient care solutions, ultrasound, surgery, and radiopharmaceuticals in both PET and SPECT imaging. MIM Software’s cardiac solutions offer additional tools with advanced reconstruction and quantitative analysis for both PET and SPECT. “Today marks an exciting new chapter for our team and technology,” adds Andy Nelson, CEO, MIM Software at GE HealthCare. “For the past two decades, our commitment to innovative, vendor-neutral solutions and high-quality services has earned the trust of our customers -- a principle that remains unchanged. As part of GE HealthCare, we look forward to expanding the development of advanced digital solutions and addressing complex needs today and in the future.

The size ranges for S&P 500, MidCap 400, and SmallCap 600 have been adjusted to ensure they reflect current market conditions.","S&P Dow Jones Indices Announces Update to S&P Composite 1500 Market Cap Guidelines Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary S&P Dow Jones Indices updates market capitalization eligibility criteria for S&P Composite 1500 Indices, effective April 1, 2024. The size ranges for S&P 500, MidCap 400, and SmallCap 600 have been adjusted to ensure they reflect current market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The revision of market capitalization eligibility criteria by S&P Dow Jones Indices represents a significant adjustment that reflects shifts in market dynamics and economic conditions. It's important to note that the increases in capitalization thresholds can potentially influence the composition of the S&P 500, MidCap 400 and SmallCap 600 indices. Companies on the cusp of these new thresholds may need to reassess their market strategies and investor relations efforts to maintain or achieve the visibility that comes with index inclusion.Index inclusion can lead to increased demand for a company's stock, as funds tracking the indices adjust their portfolios. This often results in what is known as the 'index effect,' where stocks added to an index typically experience positive returns. Conversely, companies that fail to meet the new thresholds might see reduced investor interest and potential selling pressure from index funds. This recalibration of the indices will necessitate vigilance from investors, as market capitalizations of companies will need to be monitored more closely for potential inclusion or exclusion from these indices. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the updated market capitalization eligibility criteria have implications for liquidity and market stability. Larger market capitalizations often correlate with greater liquidity, which can reduce transaction costs and price volatility. As such, the new criteria could lead to a more stable trading environment for index constituents. Moreover, the adjustment in capitalization thresholds may reflect an attempt by S&P DJI to ensure that the indices more accurately represent the current state of the market, especially considering inflationary pressures and market growth over time.Investors should be aware that these changes could affect the weightings of current index constituents, potentially leading to rebalancing of portfolios that track these indices. It's also worth considering the impact on active fund managers, who may need to adjust their benchmarks and strategies in response to these changes. Long-term, the market cap adjustments may signal a recalibration of what constitutes 'small-cap,' 'mid-cap,' and 'large-cap' in the evolving market landscape. 04/01/2024 - 06:20 PM NEW YORK, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Dow Jones Indices (""S&P DJI"") is updating the market capitalization eligibility criteria for additions to the S&P Composite 1500 Indices. Effective April 1, 2024, the size ranges will be updated as follows: Previous Market Capitalization Eligibility Criteria Updated Market Capitalization Eligibility Criteria Unadjusted company market capitalization of: • US$ 15.8 billion or more for the S&P 500 • US$ 5.8 billion to US$ 15.8 billion for the S&P MidCap 400 • US$ 900 million to US$ 5.8 billion for the S&P SmallCap 600 Unadjusted company market capitalization of: • US$ 18.0 billion or more for the S&P 500 • US$ 6.7 billion to US$ 18.0 billion for the S&P MidCap 400 • US$ 1 billion to US$ 6.7 billion for the S&P SmallCap 600 These market capitalization ranges are reviewed at the beginning of every calendar quarter, updated as needed to ensure they reflect current market conditions, and are expressed in dollar ranges. These minimum market capitalization guidelines are designed to capture the three-month average cumulative total company level market capitalization of the S&P Total Market Index (""TMI"") universe at approximately the following cumulative percentiles: S&P 500 – 85th percentileS&P MidCap 400 index – 85th-93rd percentileS&P SmallCap 600 index – 93rd-99th percentileCompanies passing the total company-level market capitalization criteria must also have a security level float-adjusted market capitalization (FMC) that is at least 50% of the respective index's total company-level minimum market capitalization threshold. As a reminder, the market capitalization eligibility criteria are for additions to an index, not for continued membership. As a result, an index constituent that appears to violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change. A history of market cap ranges dating back to 2007 can be found in Appendix A of the U.S. Indices methodology. The U.S. Indices methodology document will be updated soon to reflect the changes.

The fund also updates on direct investments and provides details on its top 10 holdings. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported asset coverage ratio of 923% for Ecofin Sustainable and Social Impact Term Fund (TEAF) is significantly higher than the minimum 300% required for investment companies by the 1940 Act. This suggests a strong protective cushion for creditors and implies a conservative leverage strategy. Such a high ratio may also indicate that TEAF is not aggressively utilizing debt, which could be seen as a missed opportunity to enhance returns through leverage. Investors might weigh the potential for lower risk against the possibility of lower returns compared to more leveraged peers.Moreover, the disclosure of net asset value (NAV) per share provides an immediate sense of the fund's performance. The NAV is a critical figure for investors as it represents the value of their shares in the fund. A stable or increasing NAV per share is typically a positive indicator, while a declining NAV can be a sign of concern. In this case, an analysis of the historical NAV trend would be necessary to assess the fund's performance trajectory. Market Research Analyst TEAF's emphasis on sustainable and social impact investments aligns with a growing trend in the investment community towards Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. Investors are increasingly considering the social and environmental impact of their investments, alongside financial returns. TEAF's strategy could attract investors who are looking to align their portfolios with their values. However, the fund's performance must be evaluated against comparable ESG funds to determine its competitive position in the market.The fund's commitment to reach a target of 60% in direct investments is an interesting strategy that may offer higher control and potentially higher returns on these investments. However, it also carries higher risks and requires thorough due diligence. Investors should monitor the fund's progress towards this target and the performance of these direct investments over time. 04/01/2024 - 06:00 PM OVERLAND PARK, KS / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / The following unaudited balance sheet information and asset coverage ratio update is provided for Ecofin Sustainable and Social Impact Term Fund (NYSE:TEAF).As of March 28, 2024, the company's unaudited total assets were approximately $225.2 million and its unaudited net asset value was $199.9 million, or $14.82 per share.As of March 28, 2024, the company's asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness was 923%.

Gritstone bio Announces Pricing of $32.5 Million Underwritten Public Offering,2024-04-02T03:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Gritstone bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: GRTS) announced a $32.5 million public offering of common stock and warrants, aiming to raise capital for its vaccine development efforts.","Gritstone bio Announces Pricing of $32.5 Million Underwritten Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Gritstone bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: GRTS) announced a $32.5 million public offering of common stock and warrants, aiming to raise capital for its vaccine development efforts. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Gritstone bio's public offering announcement is a strategic move to raise capital, indicative of the company’s need for funding to progress its clinical-stage vaccine development. The structure of the offering, which includes both common stock and warrants, is somewhat complex and warrants a closer look. The warrants provide investors with the right to purchase additional shares at a set price, which can be a future source of capital for the company if the warrants are exercised.The pricing of the offering at $1.50 per share, with an exercise price for the warrants at $1.65, suggests a discount to the current market price, which is common in such offerings to incentivize immediate investment. However, this could potentially lead to short-term dilution of the stock, as the market adjusts to the increased number of shares. Investors will need to weigh the immediate dilutive impact against the potential for long-term growth fueled by the capital raised. Biotech Market Analyst From a biotech industry perspective, Gritstone bio's decision to raise funds through a public offering is a critical step in vaccine development, which is typically capital-intensive. The funds raised will likely be allocated to clinical trials, research and development, which are pivotal for the company to bring its product to market. The accompanying warrants could also serve as a future price stabilizer, as they might be exercised when the stock price exceeds the exercise price, providing additional capital inflow at a later stage.However, the relatively low exercise price of the warrants could indicate that the company expects its stock price to remain stable or grow modestly in the near term. Investors in the biotech sector often look for high-growth potential and the pricing strategy here might reflect a conservative growth outlook, which could influence investor sentiment. Legal Expert The legal framework of this public offering, including the use of pre-funded warrants, is designed to provide flexibility for investors and the company. Pre-funded warrants are an attractive option for investors who wish to secure a future equity position at a minimal initial investment. They also allow the company to potentially avoid the immediate issuance of a large number of new shares, which can help manage dilution more effectively.It is important for investors to understand the terms and conditions associated with the warrants, such as the exercise price and expiration date, as these will affect the potential return on investment. The legal structuring of such offerings is important in ensuring compliance with securities laws and providing transparency to investors. It is also worth noting that the offering's closing is subject to customary closing conditions, which adds a layer of uncertainty until the transaction is finalized. 04/01/2024 - 11:00 PM EMERYVILLE, Calif., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gritstone bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: GRTS), a clinical-stage biotechnology company working to develop the world’s most potent vaccines, today announced the pricing of an approximately $32.5 million underwritten public offering of its common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof) and accompanying common warrants to purchase common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock in lieu thereof), before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The offering consists of (i) 8,333,333 shares of common stock and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 8,333,333 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.65 (provided, however, that the purchaser may elect to exercise the common warrants for pre-funded warrants in lieu of shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.65 minus $0.0001, the exercise price of each pre-funded warrant), at a combined public offering price of $1.50 per share and accompanying common warrant and (ii) to a certain investor in lieu of common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 13,334,222 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $0.0001 and accompanying common warrants to purchase up to 13,334,222 shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $1.65 (provided, however, that the purchaser may elect to exercise the common warrants for pre-funded warrants in lieu of shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.65 minus $0.0001, the exercise price of each pre-funded warrant) at a combined public offering price of $1.4999 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying common warrant, which represents the per share combined purchase price for the common stock and accompanying common warrants less the $0.0001 per share exercise price for each such pre-funded warrant. The accompanying common warrants will be immediately exercisable for shares of common stock or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof, and will expire on the twelve-month anniversary of the date of issuance. All of the shares of common stock, accompanying common warrants and pre-funded warrants are being offered by Gritstone bio.

Please refer to the 19(a)-1 Source of Distribution Notice on the NexPoint Asset Management website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the Fund's distributions, which should not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. No assurance can be given that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Closed-End Fund Risk. The Fund is a closed-end investment company designed primarily for long-term investors and not as a trading vehicle. No assurance can be given that a shareholder will be able to sell his or her shares on the NYSE when he or she chooses to do so, and no assurance can be given as to the price at which any such sale may be affected. Credit Risk. The Fund may invest all or substantially all of its assets in Senior Loans or other securities that are rated below investment grade and unrated Senior Loans deemed by NexPoint to be of comparable quality. Securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as ""high yield securities"" or ""junk securities."" They are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company's continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments. Non-payment of scheduled interest and/or principal would result in a reduction of income to the Fund, a reduction in the value of the Senior Loan experiencing non-payment and a potential decrease in the NAV of the Fund. Investments in high yield Senior Loans and other securities may result in greater NAV fluctuation than if the Fund did not make such investments. Real Estate Industry Risk: Issuers principally engaged in real estate industry, including real estate investment trusts, may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including: (i) changes in general economic and market conditions; (ii) changes in the value of real estate properties; (iii) risks related to local economic conditions, overbuilding and increased competition; (iv) increases in property taxes and operating expenses; (v) changes in zoning laws; (vi) casualty and condemnation losses; (vii) variations in rental income, neighborhood values or the appeal of property to tenants; (viii) the availability of financing and (ix) changes in interest rates and leverage. Illiquidity of Investments Risk. The investments made by the Fund may be illiquid, and consequently the Fund may not be able to sell such investments at prices that reflect the Investment Adviser's assessment of their value or the amount originally paid for such investments by the Fund. Ongoing Monitoring Risk. On behalf of the several Lenders, the Agent generally will be required to administer and manage the Senior Loans and, with respect to collateralized Senior Loans, to service or monitor the collateral. Financial difficulties of Agents can pose a risk to the Fund.

Highland Global Allocation Fund Declares Monthly Distributions of $0.081 Per Share,2024-04-01T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Highland Global Allocation Fund (HGLB) declares monthly distributions of $0.081 per share for April through June 2024, based on a level distribution policy. The annual distribution rate is set at 8.5% of the average NAV per share for the final five trading days of 2023.","Highland Global Allocation Fund Declares Monthly Distributions of $0.081 Per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Highland Global Allocation Fund (HGLB) declares monthly distributions of $0.081 per share for April through June 2024, based on a level distribution policy. The annual distribution rate is set at 8.5% of the average NAV per share for the final five trading days of 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Highland Global Allocation Fund regarding their monthly distributions represents a strategic approach to shareholder returns. The distribution rate of 8.5% is notably higher than the average money market yield, which has lingered around 2-3% in recent years. This could indicate a substantial cash position or a strategy to attract and retain investors seeking steady income streams. However, it's also important to consider the sustainability of such distributions. If the fund's performance does not support the payouts, it might erode the net asset value over time.Investors should evaluate the fund's underlying assets and performance to determine whether the distribution is supported by earned interest, dividends, or capital gains, as opposed to a return of capital. Additionally, the fund's decision to set the distribution rate based on the average NAV for the last five days of the previous year provides a predictable income, yet it may not reflect the current year's market conditions. This could impact the fund's share price if the distributions are perceived as unsustainable. Market Research Analyst Highland Global Allocation Fund's distribution policy might be a tactical move in response to investor demand for higher yield investments in a low-interest environment. By resetting their annual distribution rate to 8.5%, they position themselves competitively against other income-focused funds and fixed-income securities. This move could potentially drive demand for HGLB shares, leading to a price increase as investors chase the yield.However, market dynamics are also at play. A high distribution rate can sometimes signal to the market that a fund is reaching for yield, which may carry higher risk. It's critical for investors to analyze the fund's portfolio for the quality and diversity of income-generating assets. A well-diversified portfolio can mitigate risk, but overexposure to high-yield assets can be a red flag. The fund's strategy will need to be monitored closely for signs of strain or overextension in pursuit of maintaining its distribution rate. Economist From an economic perspective, the distribution policy of Highland Global Allocation Fund reflects broader economic trends. In a low-interest-rate environment, retirees and other income-dependent investors are particularly attracted to such high-yield opportunities. However, the broader implications of a high distribution rate must be considered in the context of economic cycles. If the economy faces a downturn or if interest rates rise significantly, high distribution funds like HGLB might struggle to maintain their payouts without dipping into capital, which could lead to a reduction in the fund's NAV and potentially its share price.Furthermore, the fixed distribution policy based on past NAV levels may not be flexible enough to adapt to rapid changes in the market. This rigidity can be a double-edged sword, providing stability in the short term but potentially leading to issues if the fund cannot adjust quickly to economic shifts. Investors should keep an eye on economic indicators and market trends that could affect the sustainability of HGLB's distributions. 04/01/2024 - 06:00 PM DALLAS, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Highland Global Allocation Fund (NYSE: HGLB) (""the ""Fund"") today announced the declaration of monthly distributions of $0.081 per share, payable on the dates noted below. Under the Fund's level distribution policy, the annual distribution rate has been reset to an amount equal to 8.5% of the average of the Fund's net asset value (""NAV"") per share, as reported for the final five trading days of the 2023 calendar year. The Fund is declaring distributions of $0.081 per month for April through June 2024. The following dates apply to the distributions declared: Ex-Date Record Date Payable Date April 22, 2024 April 23, 2024 April 30, 2024 May 23, 2024 May 24, 2024 May 31, 2024 June 20, 2024 June 21, 2024 June 28, 2024 About the Level Distribution Policy In March 2019, the Fund's Board of Trustees (the ""Board"") approved a level distribution policy (the ""Level Distribution Policy"") under which the Fund makes monthly distributions to stockholders at a constant and fixed (but not guaranteed) rate that will reset annually to a rate calculated based on the average of the Fund's NAV per share (the ""Distribution Amount""), as reported for the final five trading days of the month preceding the announcement of distributions. The Distribution Amount applicable to Q2 2024 was reset based upon the results of the distribution rate calculation. The Distribution Amount applicable for future periods may be reset based upon the results of the distribution rate calculation. There can be no guarantee that the Level Distribution Policy will be successful in its goals. The Fund's ability to maintain a stable level of distributions to shareholders will depend on a number of factors, including changes in the financial market, market interest rates, and performance of overall equity and fixed-income markets. As portfolio and market conditions change, the ability of the Fund to continue to make distributions in accordance with the Level Distribution Policy may be affected. Shareholders have the option of reinvesting distributions in additional common shares through the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan, or electing to receive cash by contacting AST, their financial adviser or their brokerage firm. Shareholders who wish to receive their distribution in cash must opt out of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. For further information, shareholders should carefully read the description of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in the prospectus. The Board may amend the Level Distribution Policy, the Distribution Amount or distribution intervals, or the Fund may cease distributions entirely, at any time, without prior notice to shareholders. The announcement of, amendment to, or later termination of this Level Distribution Policy may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares of common stock. The Fund may at times, in its discretion, pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any particular period and may at times pay out such accumulated undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned in other periods in order to permit the Fund to maintain a stable level of distributions. As a result, the dividend paid by the Fund to shareholders for any particular period may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the Fund during such period. The Fund intends to distribute all realized net long-term capital gains, if any, no more than once every twelve months. To the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the Fund's distributions may consist of return of capital in order to maintain the distribution amount. A return of capital occurs when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the Fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income.' Any such returns of capital will decrease the Fund's total assets and, therefore, could have the effect of increasing the Fund's expense ratio. In addition, the Level Distribution Policy may require the Fund to sell its portfolio securities at a less than opportune time to meet the distribution amount. Shareholders should not make any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of the Fund's distributions or the Fund's Level Distribution Policy. With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the Fund will issue a notice to shareholders that will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution and other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the distributions for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send individual shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for each calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Please consult your tax advisor about any tax implications applicable to you in light of your particular circumstances.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Interactive Strength Inc. indicate a significant reduction in net loss year-over-year, from $18.8 million to $11.4 million. This narrowing of losses, particularly a decrease in loss per diluted share from $27.80 to $0.80, suggests an effective cost management strategy and could be a positive signal to investors about the company's operational efficiency. Moreover, the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, despite it still being a loss, is noteworthy and reflects a $5.5 million betterment compared to the previous quarter.The conversion of liabilities into equity is a strategic move that often aims to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce financial leverage. This action can be appealing to investors as it typically leads to a more robust equity position and may reduce interest expenses. However, it's important to consider the potential dilution of existing shareholders' interests due to the increase in the number of shares outstanding.The acquisition of CLMBR and the subsequent large purchase order from WOODWAY could be a catalyst for future revenue growth. The anticipated positive Adjusted EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2024 could signal a turnaround, but investors should be cautious and consider the execution risks associated with integrating acquisitions and realizing projected synergies. Market Research Analyst Interactive Strength Inc.'s focus on specialty fitness equipment and virtual personal training services places it within a competitive and rapidly evolving market. The fitness industry has seen a significant shift towards home-based and technology-driven solutions, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. The strategic acquisition of CLMBR, a company known for its vertical climbing machines, aligns with the growing consumer demand for innovative and interactive workout options.The mention of a large purchase order from WOODWAY, a premium treadmill manufacturer, could indicate a strengthening of B2B relationships and an expansion of market reach. It's important to monitor consumer and industry responses to these new product offerings and partnerships, as they will greatly influence the company's market share and growth trajectory.Investors should also be aware of the competitive landscape, including the presence of established players and emerging startups in the fitness technology space. Market reception to the integrated offerings post-acquisition will be a key factor in assessing the long-term viability of the company's growth strategy. Legal Expert The conversion of liabilities into equity, as reported by Interactive Strength Inc., can have legal implications, particularly in terms of shareholder rights and corporate governance. It is essential that such conversions are conducted in compliance with securities laws and with transparency to shareholders. This process can affect shareholder voting power and the value of their investment.Additionally, acquisitions like that of CLMBR involve complex legal processes, including due diligence, regulatory approvals and the harmonization of corporate policies. Ensuring legal compliance throughout these transactions is critical to prevent future litigation or regulatory issues that could impact the company's financials and reputation.Prospective and current investors should pay attention to the company's disclosures and filings for any material changes that could affect their holdings. It is also advisable to consider the legal expertise and track record of the company's management in navigating such financial restructuring and acquisition processes. 04/01/2024 - 09:17 PM Net Loss and Earnings per Diluted Share of $11.4 million and $0.80 Adjusted EBITDA was a $3.5 million loss, a $5.5 million improvement versus fourth quarter of 2022 The Company confirms it expects to be run-rate Adjusted EBITDA positive as early as the fourth quarter of 2024 AUSTIN, TX, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Interactive Strength Inc. (NASDAQ: TRNR) (the ""Company"", or “TRNR”), maker of innovative specialty fitness equipment and provider of virtual personal training services, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company incurred a net loss of $11.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, or a loss of $0.80 per diluted share, as compared with a net loss of $18.8 million, or a loss of $27.80 per diluted share for the same period in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was a $3.5 million loss for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter reflects $6.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" and ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below. CEO Comments Trent Ward, Co-Founder and CEO of TRNR, said: “The fourth quarter of 2023 showed continued improvement in expense control, with total operating expenses, less the non-cash items of stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, of $2.8 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.5 million when compared to the third quarter of 2023. We expect to see a further reduction in adjusted operating expenses in 2024 despite the acquisition of CLMBR, which was completed in February. As a result of the expected revenue from CLMBR, and the lower adjusted operating expenses, we expect to reach run-rate Adjusted EBITDA positive as early as in the 4th quarter of 2024.” Mr. Ward continued, “In addition to the completion of the CLMBR acquisition, and the resulting large purchase order from WOODWAY that could result in more than $7 million in net revenue, the Company was also able to convert nearly $10 million in liabilities into equity during the first quarter of 2024, which significantly improves the stockholder’s equity and better positions the business to achieve financial stability.” The Company will announce financial results that also include the CLMBR business on a pro forma basis later this month.

The Company believes the above adjusted financial measures help facilitate analysis of operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, other expense (income), net, and provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; andAdjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and may also facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA, or any other non-GAAP financial measures we may use in the future, is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered as a substitute for, or in isolation from, our financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are, or may in the future be, as follows: Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment charges for fixed assets and capitalized content, and gains (losses) on disposals for fixed assets;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains associated with debt extinguishments.Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains associated with vendor settlements.Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect IPO readiness costs and expenses that do not qualify as equity issuance costs.Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect transaction-related expenses from CLMBR acquisition.Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect non-cash fair value gains (losses) on convertible notes, warrants and unrealized currency gains (losses).Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect expenses related to the Asset Purchase Agreement and potential acquisition; Further, the non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. For example, the expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. Because companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, their usefulness as comparative measures is limited. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Consumer insights revenue was approximately $8.9 million, creative services revenue was approximately $1.7 million, and media services revenue was approximately $526,000 during the fourth quarter of 2023. Cost of revenue was $11.1 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 299%, compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is a result of new costs associated with our new revenue offerings from the Big Village Acquisition, inclusive of direct salary and labor cost of approximately $2.2 million for employees that work directly on customer projects, and direct project costs of approximately $4.2 million for payments made to third-parties that are directly attributable to completion of projects to allow for revenue recognition, $2.4 million for non-direct project cost and legacy publisher cost of $2.2 million which increased by 17%.General and administrative expense was $6.3 million, an increase of 75%, compared to $3.6 million in the same period of 2022.Gross margin was $4.1 million, an increase of 71%, compared to $2.4 million in the same period of 2022.Net loss was $5.9 million, an increase of 156%, compared to a $2.3 million net loss in the same period of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA loss was $616,000 compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $694,000 in the same period of 2022. See the below section on Non-GAAP Financial Measure for a reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue was $44.5 million, an increase of $25.0 million, or 128%, compared to $19.6 million for the same period of 2022, which was driven by the Big Village Acquisition, and was partially offset by macroeconomics factors, coupled with an overall reduction in spending by some customers due to inflationary concerns, which has led to lower than normal rates and lower earnings. The new offerings we acquired as part of the Big Village Acquisition were consumer insights, creative services, and media services. Advertising technology revenue was approximately $9.5 million, digital publishing revenue was approximately $4.1 million, consumer insights revenue was approximately $23.9 million, creative services revenue was approximately $5.1 million, and media services revenue was approximately $2.0 million during 2023. Cost of revenue was $31.8 million, an increase of $21.3 million, or 203%, compared to $10.5 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is a result of new costs associated with our new revenue offerings from the Big Village Acquisition, inclusive of direct salary and labor cost of approximately $7.4 million for employees that work directly on customer projects, and direct project costs of approximately $10.2 million for payments made to third-parties that are directly attributable to completion of projects to allow for revenue recognition, $6.4 million for non-direct project cost and legacy publisher cost of $5.9 million which decreased by 2% .General and administrative expense was $22.5 million, an increase of 59%, compared to $14.2 million in the same period of 2022.The Company performed an assessment of its goodwill and intangible assets for the Ad Network, Owned & Operated, and Insights reporting units.

There was no such charge for the same period in 2022.Gross margin was $12.8 million, an increase of 41%, compared to $9.1 million in the same period of 2022.Net loss was $35.6 million, an increase of 338%, compared to a $8.1 million net loss in the same period of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA loss was $3.9 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $2.5 million in the same period of 2022.

RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO NON-GAAP EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA(in thousands) Non-GAAP Financial Measure Non-GAAP results are presented only as a supplement to the financial statements and for use within management's discussion and analysis based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The non-GAAP financial information is provided to enhance the reader's understanding of the Company's financial performance, but non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All of the items included in the reconciliation from net loss before taxes to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA are either (i) non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization of purchased intangibles, stock-based compensation, etc.) or (ii) items that management does not consider to be useful in assessing the Company's ongoing operating performance (e.g., M&A costs, income taxes, gain on sale of investments, loss on disposal of assets, etc.). In the case of the non-cash items, management believes that investors can better assess the Company's operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because, unlike cash expenses, these adjustments do not affect the Company's ability to generate free cash flow or invest in its business. We use, and we believe investors benefit from the presentation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance because it provides us and our investors with an additional tool to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. We believe that EBITDA is useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, and depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. However, these measures can still be useful in evaluating the Company's performance against its peer companies because management believes the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of GAAP financial disclosures. A reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is as follows: Three Months Ended Year Ended ($ in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net loss before tax plus: $(5,931) $(2,321) $(35,564) $(8,125)Depreciation expense 41 14 125 38 Amortization of intangibles 547 386 2,490 1,558 Impairment of goodwill and intangibles 812 — 17,070 — Amortization of debt discount 636 276 2,074 1,199 Other interest expense 8 3 27 14 Interest expense – Centre Lane Senior Secured Credit Facility and Convertible Promissory Notes – related party 2,334 908 7,088 3,050 EBITDA (1,553) (734) (6,690) (2,266)Stock compensation expense 74 18 196 233 Nonrecurring professional fees 483 — 1,462 657 Nonrecurring legal fees 313 — 711 — Gain on forgiveness of PPP loan — — — (1,137)Non-restructuring severance expense 67 22 389 50 Adjusted EBITDA $(616) $(694) $(3,932) $(2,463) What was the revenue growth percentage for Bright Mountain Media in 2023?

(CSE: GDNS; OTCQX: GDNSF), please note the contact information has been updated. The corrected release follows: ACE Ventures, LLC (“Ace”), a minority-owned business in the State of New York, Ace’s corporate partner, Ace Venture Enterprises, Inc. and Goodness Growth Holdings, Inc. (""Goodness Growth"") (CSE: GDNS; OTCQX: GDNSF), today announced that they have executed a binding term sheet whereby Ace plans to acquire assets of Goodness Growth Holdings subsidiary, Vireo Health of New York (“VireoNY”), pending the satisfaction of closing conditions, including secured capital commitments and regulatory approval. Founded by life-long New Yorker, Steven Acevedo, a television and film producer who has worked with some of the world’s most recognizable entertainers, Ace’s mission is to bring New York the quality and affordable cannabis its regulated market deserves, while investing in communities that have been disproportionately affected by the War on Drugs. Ace Venture Enterprises, Inc. shareholder, Arthur Isagholian, has over 25 years of experience within various sectors of the cannabis value chain, and has recruited, developed and managed highly-skilled teams, both plant touching and ancillary, across cultivation, manufacturing, marketing and retail operations. Terms of the transaction include a purchase price between $3.0 and $5.0 million for Vireo Health of New York’s licenses, inventory and assets, as well as Ace’s assumption of the lease agreement with Innovative Industrial Properties (“IIP”) for the Johnstown, NY cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus. Ace has agreed to assume VireoNY’s financial liabilities, including its operating losses, beginning on April 1, 2024. These activities are expected to be supported initially by a $2.5 million unsecured loan from Goodness Growth to VireoNY. In addition, the parties are committed to a collaborative advisory agreement that retains Goodness Growth’s management and compliance oversight in return for an approximate 15 percent share of net profits. Goodness Growth and Ace anticipate regulatory approval for the transfer of the New York licenses, as well as closing of the VireoNY transaction, to occur by June 30, 2024. Lease Amendment for Johnstown, NY Cultivation and Manufacturing Campus Goodness Growth also announced in conjunction with the VireoNY transaction that it has executed an eighth amendment to its lease with IIP for the Johnstown, NY cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus. The amendment to the Johnstown campus lease extends a lease termination option until June 30, 2024, and adds a purchase option of the facility for the tenant. Ace Venture Enterprises, Inc. is committed to providing an investment of $20.0 million to fund the development of the license and support the transfer of the IIP lease, and intends to acquire the Johnstown cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus from IIP by executing the two-year purchase option. Management Commentary Steven Acevedo commented, “We are thrilled to reach this agreement with Goodness Growth and are excited to enter New York’s cannabis industry. We are prepared to showcase the strength of our team and to support a thriving industry in New York that benefits both consumers and communities that have been impacted by the failed War on Drugs. With more stores opening regularly, our timing feels impeccable and we’re pleased to have Goodness Growth’s continued involvement in the management of our operations. After spending considerable time with their team and observing the success they've had with renewed operational focus in Maryland and Minnesota, we see great benefit to a collaborative relationship that helps ensure long-term success for both of our organizations.” Goodness Growth Interim Chief Executive Officer Josh Rosen said, “We're excited to support the Ace team as they bring the benefits of a tremendous legacy within the industry and a deep network of relationships that we believe can help both Ace and Goodness Growth thrive moving forward. Execution in New York is the first priority, and we are eager to support Ace’s entry into New York’s wholesale market as soon as practicable following regulatory approval of our Registered Organization Non-Dispensing (ROND) license.

(NYSE American: AINC) (""Ashford"" or the ""Company"") today announced that a Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors has recommended, and its Board of Directors has approved, a plan to terminate the registration of the Company's common stock under the federal securities laws following the completion of a proposed reverse stock split transaction (the ""Reverse Stock Split"") immediately followed by a forward stock split transaction and to delist its shares of common stock from trading on the NYSE American LLC (the ""NYSE American"") (the ""Proposed Transaction""). It is expected that this plan would be initiated in the summer of 2024, subject to Ashford's stockholders approving the Proposed Transaction at a Special Meeting of Stockholders to be held for that purpose, as described below. Ashford is taking these steps to avoid the substantial cost and expense of being a public reporting company and to focus the Company's resources on enhancing long-term stockholder value. The Company anticipates savings exceeding $2,500,000 on an annual basis as a result of the Proposed Transaction. The proposed reverse stock split is a 1-for-10,000 split, in which holders of less than 10,000 shares of the Company's common stock in any one account immediately prior to the reverse stock split would be cashed out at a price of $5.00 per each pre reverse stock split share. Such price represents a 125.2% premium above the common stock's closing price on April 1, 2024 and is supported by a fairness opinion provided by Oppenheimer and Co. Inc. (""Oppenheimer""), whom the Special Committee engaged for such purpose. Stockholders owning 10,000 or more shares of the Company's common stock in any one account immediately prior to the reverse stock split would not have any shares cashed out and would remain stockholders in Ashford, which would no longer be encumbered by the expenses and distraction of being a public reporting company. The number of shares they would own following the Proposed Transaction would be unchanged, as immediately after the reverse stock split, a forward split of 10,000-for-1 would be applied to the continuing stockholders, negating any effects to the number of shares held by them. Ashford estimates that approximately 1.1 million shares (representing approximately 31% of the shares of common stock currently outstanding) would be cashed out in the Proposed Transaction and the aggregate cost to the Company of the Proposed Transaction would be approximately $5.5 million, plus transaction expenses, which are estimated to be approximately $6.7 million. Ashford intends to fund such costs using cash-on-hand. Ashford's Special Committee and its Board of Directors have determined that the costs of being a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") reporting company outweigh the benefits and, thus, it is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, including its unaffiliated stockholders (consisting of stockholders other than executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 10% of the Company's outstanding common stock) for Ashford to remain an SEC reporting company. Without its public company status, Ashford would have an ongoing cost structure befitting its current and foreseeable scale of operations, and its management would be able to focus on long-term growth without an undue emphasis on short-term financial results. The purpose of the reverse stock split is to (i) help Ashford reduce and maintain below 300 record holders of its common stock, which is the level at which SEC public reporting obligations are required, (ii) offer liquidity to smaller stockholders at $5.00 per share without a brokerage commission, and (iii) provide all stockholders the opportunity to vote on this matter. Among the factors considered by Ashford's Board of Directors were: the significant ongoing costs and management time and effort involved in the Company remaining a public company, including the preparation and filing of periodic and other reports with the SEC and compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other applicable requirements;the limited trading volume and liquidity of the Company's common stock;the business and operations of the Company are expected to continue substantially as presently conducted, except without the burden of public company costs;enabling the Company's stockholders with the smallest holdings, who represent a large number of the record holders of Company's common stock, to liquidate their holdings in the Company's common stock and receive a premium over current market prices without incurring brokerage commissions;the determination of Oppenheimer, independent fairness opinion provider to the Special Committee, that the Proposed Transaction consideration for the fractional shares is fair from a financial point of view to the unaffiliated stockholders; andas a result of the deregistration and delisting, the ability of the Company's management and employees to focus their time, effort and resources on the Company's long-term growth and increasing long-term stockholder value.Subject to regulatory clearance of the Company's proxy statement to be filed relating to the Proposed Transaction and stockholder approval thereof, it is anticipated that the Company would initiate its plan to terminate the registration of its common stock shortly after the Special Meeting of Stockholders, which is expected to be held in the summer of 2024. Approval of the Reverse Stock Split requires a majority vote cast of the Company's common stock (taking into account the Company's Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis) at the Special Meeting. (A ""majority vote"" means that more votes have been cast for a proposal than against it, and abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be considered as votes cast.) A ""Rule 13e-3 transaction"" is any transaction or series of transactions (involving a securities purchase, tender offer, or specified proxy solicitation) by an issuer or an affiliate of the issuer, which has a reasonable likelihood or purpose of directly or indirectly (i) causing any registered class of equity securities to be eligible for termination of registration, or eligible for termination or suspension of reporting obligations; or (ii) causing any listed class of equity securities to cease to be listed on a national securities exchange. Because the Proposed Transaction constitutes a Rule 13e-3 transaction, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve a waiver of the prohibition on Rule 13e-3 transactions contained in Section 3.03 of a certain Investor Rights Agreement entered into as of November 6, 2019 by and among the Company, Archie Bennett, Jr., Monty J. Bennett and certain other parties. As of March 25, 2024, the Company's directors and executive officers owned approximately 37.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company's common stock (including the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis and the associated accrued and unpaid dividends) and are expected to vote ""FOR"" the Proposed Transaction. After the Special Meeting, the Company expects to terminate the registration of its common stock with the SEC and delist its common stock from the NYSE American. As a result, subject to applicable waiting periods for deregistration under the federal securities laws, (i) the Company will cease to file annual, quarterly, current and other reports and documents with the SEC, and stockholders will cease to receive annual reports and proxy statements, and (ii) the Company's common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE American. If consummated, the Proposed Transaction would apply directly to record holders of the Company's common stock. Persons who hold shares of common stock in ""street name"" are encouraged to contact their bank, broker or other nominee for information on how the Proposed Transaction may affect any shares of the Company's common stock held for their account. If you hold in ""street name"" fewer than 10,000 shares in any one account, the Proposed Transaction may apply indirectly to your shares as described in the proxy statement to be filed in connection with this Proposed Transaction. The Board reserves the right to change the ratios of the reverse stock split and forward stock split to the extent it believes it is necessary or desirable in order to accomplish the Company's goal of reducing and maintaining below 300 record holders. The Board may also abandon the Proposed Transaction at any time prior to the completion of the Proposed Transaction if it believes the Proposed Transaction is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Additional Information and Where to Find ItTHIS PRESS RELEASE IS ONLY A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR OR SOLICITATION OF A PROXY OR AN OFFER TO ACQUIRE OR SELL ANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO FILE A PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER REQUIRED MATERIALS, INCLUDING A SCHEDULE 13E-3, WITH THE SEC CONCERNING THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION.

Information concerning such participants will be set forth in the proxy statement to be filed by the Company in connection with the special meeting of stockholders to vote on the Proposed Transaction.

Positive Assignment agreement between SNDL and Nova for the transfer of four Dutch Love stores. Nova to issue $8.179 million worth of shares to SNDL based on the 20-day VWAP of Nova shares.

Addition of Dutch Love Stores to increase Nova's store count to 100 and SNDL's total cannabis store count to 190. Extension of SNDL's Revolving Credit Facility with Nova for an additional 24 months. Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility to remove SNDL's right to demand repayment prior to the maturity date. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by SNDL Inc. to assign rights of four Dutch Love stores to Nova Cannabis Inc. signals a significant shift in the retail landscape of the cannabis industry in British Columbia. The transaction not only increases Nova's store count to a milestone of 100 but also consolidates SNDL's influence in the market with a total of 190 stores under its umbrella. This expansion is indicative of the growing competitiveness and maturity of the cannabis retail sector.From a market research perspective, the issuance of $8.179 million of Nova shares to SNDL as part of the agreement reflects a valuation strategy based on the 20-day VWAP, which is commonly used to ensure a fair exchange rate based on recent trading history. This move could potentially be seen as a vote of confidence in Nova's market position and future growth prospects. The extension and amendment of the revolving credit facility further demonstrate SNDL's commitment to supporting Nova's financial stability and operational expansion.Investors should note that the success of such expansions could lead to increased market share and revenue growth for Nova, while also providing SNDL with a diversified income stream through its equity stake. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the effective integration of the new stores and the companies' ability to capitalize on economies of scale and increased bargaining power with suppliers. Financial Analyst The financial implications of SNDL's assignment of the Dutch Love stores to Nova and the extended credit facility are multifaceted. The deal structure, which includes the issuance of shares and the extension of a credit facility, allows SNDL to maintain a vested interest in Nova's success without immediate cash outlay, aligning both companies' interests.For investors, the key factors to consider include the impact on Nova's earnings per share (EPS) due to the dilution of existing shares. The issuance of shares may also affect Nova's stock price in the short term as the market absorbs the new equity. Furthermore, the extended credit facility's terms, notably the removal of SNDL's right to demand early repayment, provide Nova with a more predictable capital structure and may reduce financial risk.However, it is essential to monitor how the additional stores contribute to Nova's operational cash flow and whether the anticipated synergies translate into financial performance. The transaction's success will also hinge on regulatory approvals, including the TSX's listing of the new shares, which could introduce delays or additional scrutiny. Legal Expert The assignment of the Dutch Love stores from SNDL to Nova involves a complex legal arrangement that requires the navigation of various regulatory approvals. The mention of court approval and TSX listing approval for the Nova shares to be issued indicates that the deal is subject to legal due diligence and compliance with securities regulations.Investors should be aware of the legal risks associated with such transactions, including potential delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or conditions imposed by the regulatory bodies that could affect the final terms of the deal. The legal framework governing cannabis retail operations is also subject to change, which could impact the future operations of the acquired stores.The role of legal counsel from firms like McCarthy Tétrault LLP and Bennett Jones LLP is critical in ensuring that the transaction adheres to all legal requirements and in mitigating any associated risks. Their involvement provides a level of assurance to stakeholders regarding the legal soundness of the transaction. 04/01/2024 - 07:29 PM This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the prospectus supplement of Nova Cannabis Inc. dated July 22, 2022, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated June 27, 2022.

Additional book-running managers and co-managers are also appointed for the proposed offering. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Rubrik, Inc. about its planned initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company, indicating its readiness to enter the public market and expand its investor base. As a market research analyst, examining the competitive landscape of data management and cloud services is essential. Rubrik's entry into the public domain through the NYSE will likely increase its visibility and potentially attract new partnerships and customers, which can be critical for growth in this sector.Furthermore, the involvement of high-profile financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs and Barclays as lead book-running managers suggests confidence in Rubrik's business model and future prospects. These institutions typically support IPOs that they believe have strong potential for growth and are well-received by the market. However, investors should be mindful of the volatility and risk associated with IPOs, as initial performance can be influenced by broader market sentiments and not just company fundamentals. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the lack of details on the number of shares to be offered and the price range is not uncommon at this stage of an IPO. This information will be determined based on market conditions and investor interest during the roadshow process. The IPO pricing will be a critical factor in determining the company's market capitalization and the funds raised, which can be used to fuel further expansion, research and development and potentially acquisitions.Investors should evaluate Rubrik's financial health by analyzing the prospectus once it's available. Key metrics to assess would include revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow statements. It's important to understand how Rubrik stacks up against its competitors in terms of financial performance and market share. The company's long-term strategy and its execution will be vital in assessing the potential return on investment. Legal Expert The legal process of an IPO is complex and involves rigorous scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rubrik's filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 is just the beginning of this process. The statement will include detailed information about the company's business, financials and risks associated with the investment. Potential investors should pay close attention to the risk factors and management's discussion and analysis sections for insights into the challenges the company might face.Since the registration statement has not yet become effective, there is a mandatory waiting period during which the SEC reviews the document for completeness and accuracy. This is a critical step to protect investors and ensure transparency. The fact that the offering will be made only by means of a prospectus reinforces the importance of due diligence. It is essential for investors to wait for the SEC's approval before any investment decisions can be made, as premature commitments could lead to legal and financial repercussions. 04/01/2024 - 05:50 PM PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rubrik, Inc. today announced that it has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to a proposed initial public offering of its Class A common stock.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent filings by FSD Pharma provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and operational performance over the past year. The audited annual financial results and management's discussion offer investors a detailed breakdown of revenue streams, expenditure, profit margins and cash flow. These data points are critical for assessing the company's ability to sustain operations, fund research and development and manage debt. Particularly for biopharmaceutical companies, the burn rate and runway are key indicators of how long they can continue to operate at current spending levels without additional funding.Investors should note the trends in operating expenses, especially as they relate to research and development costs. For biopharmaceutical firms, heavy R&D investment is often necessary before any products reach the market. However, this also implies a higher risk profile, as the success of these investments is contingent upon clinical and regulatory success. The company's ability to manage these costs while advancing its pipeline is essential for long-term sustainability.

The company aims to ensure uninterrupted patient access to INBRIJA and AMPYRA. The sale process is expected to conclude in June 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing for Chapter 11 by Acorda Therapeutics represents a strategic move to manage its financial obligations while attempting to preserve shareholder value through the sale of its assets. The agreement with Merz Therapeutics, particularly with a $185 million bid as the baseline, sets a floor price for the auction process. This could potentially attract higher bids, creating a competitive environment that may lead to better recovery for creditors and investors.The debtor-in-possession financing of $20 million ensures that Acorda can maintain operations and product supply, which is critical for minimizing disruption in the market and preserving the value of the assets on sale. The involvement of established advisory firms like Baker McKenzie, Ernst & Young and investment bankers suggests a well-structured and professionally managed bankruptcy process, which can be reassuring for stakeholders.For potential investors, the key interest lies in the outcome of the auction and the final sale price, which will determine the extent of recovery from their investment in Acorda's convertible notes. The restructuring support agreement with note holders indicates a collaborative approach to the bankruptcy, potentially expediting the process and reducing legal uncertainties. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst Acorda's product portfolio, including INBRIJA and AMPYRA, caters to niche markets in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Merz Therapeutics' interest in these assets aligns with its focus on neurology and movement disorders, suggesting a strategic fit that could enhance Merz's market position.The uninterrupted supply of medication is important for patient retention and market stability. Acorda's commitment to maintaining supply continuity throughout the bankruptcy process will help in preserving the brand equity and patient trust in its products, which are important factors during the asset sale.Furthermore, the potential acquisition by Merz could lead to expanded resources and a more robust distribution network for these treatments, potentially increasing market penetration and benefiting patients through improved access to therapies. Legal Expert Chapter 11 proceedings provide a mechanism for companies like Acorda to reorganize debt and sell assets under court supervision, which can maximize asset value and creditor recovery. The 'stalking horse' bid by Merz establishes a minimum acceptable bid for the assets, which can prevent low-ball offers and set the stage for a competitive bidding process.The involvement of legal and financial advisors indicates a complex negotiation landscape, with various stakeholders' interests needing to be balanced. The Restructuring Support Agreement with note holders suggests that a significant portion of the secured debt is being addressed cooperatively, which can streamline the Section 363 sale process.It is also noteworthy that the court-supervised auction process is expected to conclude by June 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution. This transparency can be beneficial for the market as it reduces the uncertainty typically associated with bankruptcy durations. 04/01/2024 - 06:35 PM Acorda Files for Voluntary Chapter 11 Protection to Facilitate Orderly Sale Acorda Enters into a Restructuring Support Agreement with over 90% of the Secured Convertible Noteholders Patient Access to INBRIJA® (levodopa inhalation powder) and AMPYRA® (dalfampridine) to Continue Uninterrupted PEARL RIVER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACOR) (“Acorda” or “the Company”) today announced that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Merz Therapeutics to purchase substantially all of the assets of Acorda, including the rights to INBRIJA, AMPYRA, and FAMPYRA for $185 million. Merz Therapeutics, a leader in the field of neurotoxins, is a business of the global family-owned company Merz, headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. To facilitate an orderly sale process, and in an effort to maximize the value for the Company's assets through a competitive auction process, with Merz serving as the ""stalking horse"" bidder, Acorda and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions to commence Chapter 11 proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The decision to file for Chapter 11 protection follows a lengthy strategic review during which the Company explored a wide range of strategic options. The sale will be conducted through a court-supervised process under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which will provide potential buyers the opportunity to submit offers and is expected to conclude in June 2024. Ron Cohen, M.D., Acorda’s CEO and President, said, ""Acorda’s management team and board have evaluated all of our strategic options, and following an exhaustive process believe that this option is in the best interest of stakeholders. One of our top priorities is to ensure an uninterrupted supply of our medications to people with multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. We are confident that Merz Therapeutics, if they are the ultimate acquirer, will be able to seamlessly continue serving these patients’ needs, given Merz’s longstanding dedication to improving the lives of people who suffer from movement disorders and other neurological conditions."" Acorda will continue operations while it works to complete the sale process. To enable this, the Company has filed motions with the court seeking to ensure the continuation of normal operations during this process. Upon court approval, Acorda expects to minimize the impact of the bankruptcy process on its employees, customers, patients, and other key stakeholders. Acorda entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with the holders of over 90% of its 6.00% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2024, which sets out certain milestones and conditions relating to the Section 363 sale process. In addition, in order to fund the continued operations of the Company during the bankruptcy process, Acorda and certain noteholders entered into a Debtor-in-Possession Financing Agreement to provide a term loan facility in the aggregate amount of $20 million in new money, which is also subject to court approval. Acorda is being advised by Baker McKenzie as legal counsel, Ernst & Young as financial advisor, and Ducera Partners and Leerink Partners as the investment bankers. Merz is being advised by Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP as legal counsel, Morgan Stanley as investment banker, and Deloitte as financial and tax advisors. Senior Convertible Noteholders are being advised by King & Spalding as legal counsel and Perella Weinberg Partners as investment banker.

Non-cash impairments impacting financial results. Decrease in Gross Profit and Gross Margin compared to previous years. Financial Analyst The disclosure by OMNIQ Corp. regarding its full year and fourth quarter 2023 financial results indicates a challenging period for the company. A significant reduction in revenue from $100.8 million in 2022 to $81.1 million in 2023, alongside a decrease in gross profit, suggests a contraction in business operations or loss of market share. The reduction in General and Administrative (G&A) expenses and headcount could be viewed as a positive cost control measure, but when coupled with a substantial net loss and non-cash Goodwill impairment of $14.7 million, it raises concerns about the company's asset valuation and future profitability.From an investor's perspective, the improved cash position and decreased current liabilities might provide some reassurance of financial stability. However, the working capital deficit and accumulated deficit are red flags that could impact the company's ability to sustain operations without further capital infusion. The shift in revenue concentration, where no single customer accounts for more than 10% of revenues, could be interpreted as a diversification strategy to reduce dependency on major clients, but it also necessitates an analysis of the impact on profit margins.The Adjusted EBITDA loss increasing year-over-year indicates operational challenges that are not solely attributable to non-cash items. This metric often serves as a proxy for operational cash flow and a widening loss could signal underlying issues in core business efficiency. The strategic focus on high-margin products and services, as well as the equity raise and new line of credit, are steps towards financial recovery, but the effectiveness of these measures will need to be closely monitored in subsequent quarters. Market Research Analyst OMNIQ's recent contracts and orders in various sectors such as logistics, airport services, fintech and retail indicate an expansion of its product portfolio and entry into new markets. The adoption of AI and IoT technologies in industries like fast-food chains and sporting goods stores showcases the company's ability to innovate and adapt to different market needs. However, the decrease in gross margin from 17% to 13% raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of these ventures and whether they can sustainably contribute to the company's bottom line.The diversification of OMNIQ's customer base is a strategic move that could mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a few large customers. However, it's important to assess whether this diversification is also leading to profitable growth or simply spreading resources thin across less lucrative contracts. The multi-year contract for Israel's largest logistics center and orders from high-profile clients such as Nestle and a U.S.-owned restaurant chain are promising developments, but the true impact on the company's financial health will depend on the profitability and execution of these contracts.Investors should consider the competitive landscape and the company's ability to deliver on its value proposition in a cost-effective manner. The recent acquisition of Codeblocks suggests a strategic move into fintech, which could offer new revenue streams, but also requires careful consideration of the integration costs and potential cannibalization of existing services. Legal Expert The non-cash impairment charge of $14.7 million is a critical accounting item that reflects a devaluation of the company's goodwill. This could indicate that previous acquisitions or valued intangible assets are not generating the expected returns, or there has been a change in market conditions affecting their valuation. Investors should be aware of the implications of such impairments as they can affect the company's creditworthiness and investor confidence.Furthermore, the equity raise and new line of credit finalized by management are essential for providing the necessary capital to fund operations and pursue growth. However, these financial maneuvers also increase shareholder dilution and financial leverage, which could impact shareholder value in the long term. It is imperative to scrutinize the terms of these financial arrangements and their alignment with shareholder interests.While the company's proactive approach to cost reduction and strategic focus on prime customers and profitable product lines is commendable, the legal and regulatory risks associated with such rapid changes should not be overlooked. The company must ensure compliance with securities regulations, especially in light of the financial restructuring and strategic shifts being undertaken. 04/01/2024 - 05:11 PM SALT LAKE CITY, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OMNIQ Corp.

Shareholder update The Company dealt with the challenge of the need to conduct cost cuts mainly attributable to the temporary weakness in the market conditions combined with the need to maintain and improve its position in the huge markets it is involved with to support future growth and profitability. So far, management has taken, and is still taking, aggressive measures reducing annual SG&A costs by $4.7M and working on further measures to achieve profitability as soon as practically possible. Ultimately, we plan to prioritize timely and cost-effective development and business with the highest margins, while continuing cost reductions. One challenge is that we are experiencing a working capital deficit of $45 million and an accumulated deficit of $114 million. We have also seen a year-over-year decrease in sales and a reduction of goodwill. To mitigate this, we have placed a strategic focus on increasing sales with prime customers. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the revenues in 2023 vs year end 2022 when one customer accounted for 30% of the Company’s revenues. Additionally, our sales efforts are focused on the most profitable product lines. To ensure we have sufficient working capital, in October 2023, management finalized an equity raise which resulted in $2.5 million in net cash received from investors. Management also finalized a new line of credit with a new financial institution. “In navigating through the complex landscape shaped by global and market events, it has provided us with a valuable opportunity to reflect deeply on our core operations and values. It's like looking in a mirror, not to critique what we see with harshness, but to understand where our strengths lie and where we need to evolve. These insights are now guiding us toward making significant, forward-thinking changes. We are not just addressing the immediate issues at hand; we are laying down the foundation for a healthier, more robust future for our company. This period of transformation, though demanding, is an investment in our collective future, ensuring we emerge not just intact but stronger and more aligned with our mission than ever before.” – Shai Lustgarten, CEO OMNIQ Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call Details Tuesday, April 02, 2024 - 9:00 AM Eastern Time Participant Numbers: Toll Free: 888-506-0062International: 973-528-0011Participant Access Code: 102048 Participants will be greeted by an operator and asked for the access code.

The company incurred a net loss of $11.0 million, including restructuring charges and transaction fees. The Technology segment saw growth to 27% of total revenue. XBP won a significant $48 million TCV contract in 2023, the largest in five years, and expanded solutions with Reaktr.ai and XBP Omnidirect. Positive Revenue for 2023 was $166.6 million, down 7.7% year-over-year. Net loss for 2023 was $11.0 million, including restructuring charges of $6.7 million and transaction fees of $3.0 million. Technology segment grew to 27% of total revenue in 2023 compared to 24% in 2022. XBP won a ~$48 million TCV contract in 2023, the largest in the past five years. Won ~$58 million of ACV in 2023 and expanded solutions with Reaktr.ai and XBP Omnidirect. Negative Operating loss in 2023 was $4.2 million compared to $2.0 million in 2022. Net loss for 2023 was $11.0 million compared to $7.9 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $11.6 million, a decrease of 20.0% compared to $14.5 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2023 was 7.0%, a decrease of 100 basis points from 8.0% in 2022. Financial Analyst The reported revenue decline of 7.7% for XBP Europe Holdings indicates a contraction in the company's core business operations year-over-year. This is a critical factor for investors as revenue trends can signal the company's market position and demand for its services. The decline was attributed to the completion of one-time projects and client contract ends, which may suggest a need for diversification and more stable recurring revenue streams. The increase in technology segment revenue, however, points to a strategic pivot towards higher-margin offerings, which could improve profitability over time.Furthermore, the net loss widening to $11.0 million, up from $7.9 million the previous year, partly due to restructuring charges, raises questions about the company's cost management and operational efficiency. While such restructuring can be a sign of a company positioning itself for future growth, it's imperative to analyze whether these changes will lead to sustainable improvements in performance.The decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin by 100 basis points to 7.0% suggests that profitability is under pressure. For long-term investors, the company's ability to reverse this trend will be important in assessing its financial health. Capital expenditures decreasing to 1.6% of revenue could indicate a cautious approach to spending, which might be prudent given the company's current financial situation. However, this could also imply a slower pace of investment in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the largest contract win in five years at approximately $48 million TCV reflects positively on XBP's potential to secure significant deals in the public sector. This could signal underlying strength in the company's sales pipeline and its ability to compete for large-scale projects. The growth of the high margin Technology segment to 27% of total revenue also suggests a strategic shift towards more profitable lines of business, which may enhance the company's value proposition.Investors should also consider the launch of new solutions like Reaktr.ai and XBP Omnidirect. These expansions into new technologies indicate that XBP is adapting to market demands and investing in innovation. While these developments could drive future revenue growth, the market's reception of these new products and their contribution to the company's financial performance will be critical to monitor.Lastly, the reduction in capital expenditures and the current portion of long-term debt indicates a conservative financial strategy. The use of a Secured Borrowing Facility to fund growth initiatives shows a reliance on external financing, which could introduce financial risk if not managed effectively. Stakeholders will need to evaluate the balance between leveraging such facilities for growth and maintaining financial stability. Debt Market Analyst The reduction in the current portion of long-term debt from $5.0 million to $3.9 million at year-end 2023 suggests that XBP is making efforts to manage its debt obligations. This could be perceived as a positive development for debt investors concerned with the company's creditworthiness. However, the reliance on a Secured Borrowing Facility with a funding limit of €15.0 million to finance growth introduces additional layers of financial risk, particularly if the company's revenue streams do not stabilize.Given the net loss and restructuring charges incurred, it is essential to scrutinize the company's cash flow statements and future earnings guidance to assess the sustainability of its debt servicing capabilities. The ability to generate positive cash flows in the future will be a key determinant of the company's capacity to meet its financial obligations without diluting shareholder value or incurring unsustainable levels of debt. 04/01/2024 - 05:00 PM Full Year Highlights 2023 revenue of $166.6 million, down 7.7% year-over-year (8.4% on a constant currency basis)Net loss of $11.0 million includes restructuring charges of $6.7 million and transaction fees of $3.0 millionHigh margin Technology segment grows year-over-year to 27% of total revenue in 2023 compared to 24% in 2022Gross margin at 23%, which is inclusive of the restructuring chargesWon a ~$48 million TCV contract in 2023, the largest contract win of the past five yearsWon ~$58 million of ACV in 2023 and expanded solutions launching Reaktr.ai and XBP Omnidirect LONDON and SANTA MONICA, Calif., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XBP Europe Holdings, Inc. (“XBP” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: XBP), a pan-European integrator of bills and payments and related solutions and services seeking to enable the digital transformation of its clients, announced today its financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023. “We start the year as a newly listed public company, having completed our long-awaited business combination towards the very end of 2023. In 2024, we are focusing on growth, investing in sales of our existing solution suite as well as the expansion into new solutions, most notably Reaktr.ai and XBM Omnidirect. In line with our growth objectives, we are expanding the use of cloud in order to be agile, while remaining nimble. We will keep our employees and the investor community apprised of our progress in the coming weeks and months,” said Andrej Jonovic, Chief Executive Officer of XBP. Full Year Highlights Revenue: Revenue for 2023 was $166.6 million, a decline of 7.7% compared to $180.5 million in 2022 due to completion of one-time projects, lower volumes and client contract ends, offset by positive impact of new business. Revenue for the Bills & Payments segment was $121.9 million, a decline of 11.0% year-over-year, primarily due to completion of projects, lower volumes and client contract ends, offset by positive impact of newly won business, some of which is in early stage of rampTechnology segment revenue was $44.7 million, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year, led by higher volume of software licenses sold and an increase in technology implementation and professional services revenueAnnounced the win of a large public sector project totaling ~$48 million of TCV (“Total Contract Value”)Won ~$58 million of ACV (“Annual Contract Value”)We are investing in sales and business development functions to expand our focus on winning large tech and digital transformations Operating loss: Operating loss in 2023 was $4.2 million, compared with operating loss of $2.0 million in 2022. In 2023, we incurred a restructuring charge of $6.7 million. The year over year change was due to the gross profit decline of $4.7 million which is inclusive of the restructuring expense, offset by a reduction in related party expense of $3.6 million. This related party expense reduction is primarily driven by the modification of the services provided when the merger agreement was entered into on October 9, 2022. Net Loss: Net loss for 2023 was $11.0 million, compared with a net loss of $7.9 million in 2022. The year over year increase was materially driven by a restructuring charge of $6.7 million. Adjusted EBITDA(1): Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $11.6 million, a decrease of 20.0% compared to $14.5 million in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2023 was 7.0%, a decrease of 100 basis points from 8.0% in 2022. Capital Expenditures: Capital expenditures for 2023 were 1.6% of revenue compared to 3.5% of revenue in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2022 were higher due to purchase of the Company’s Irish headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Adequate Liquidity: Received a total of $5.2 million in net proceeds from the business combination with CF Acquisition Corp. VIII. Current portion of long-term debt was $3.9 million at year-end 2023 compared to $5.0 million at year-end 2022. To fund our growth, our Secured Borrowing Facility (amended factoring agreement) provides for sale of new receivables up to a funding limit of €15.0 million. Below is the note referenced above: (1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA is attached to this release.

For more information, please visit: www.xbpeurope.com. About Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes constant currency, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which is a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). XBP Europe believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity and allows investors to better understand the trends in our business and to better understand and compare our results. XBP Europe’s board of directors and management use constant currency, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to assess XBP Europe’s financial performance, because it allows them to compare XBP Europe’s operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of XBP Europe’s capital structure (such as varying levels of debt and interest expense, as well as transaction costs resulting from the combination with CF Acquisition Corp. VIII. on November 29, 2023 (the “Business Combination”) and capital markets-based activities). Adjusted EBITDA also seeks to remove the effects of restructuring and related expenses and other similar non-routine items, some of which are outside the control of our management team. Restructuring expenses are primarily related to the implementation of strategic actions and initiatives related to right sizing of the business. All of these costs are variable and dependent upon the nature of the actions being implemented and can vary significantly driven by business needs. Accordingly, due to that significant variability, we exclude these charges since we do not believe they truly reflect our past, current or future operating performance. The constant currency presentation excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We calculate constant currency revenue on a constant currency basis by converting our current-period local currency revenue using the exchange rates from the corresponding prior-period and compare these adjusted amounts to our corresponding prior period reported results. XBP Europe does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to liquidity or financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in XBP Europe’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures and therefore the basis of presentation for these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures are not required to be uniformly applied, are not audited and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Net loss is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to the non-GAAP measures presented here. For reconciliation of the comparable GAAP measures to these non-GAAP financial measures, see the schedules attached to this release.

The Company is in an exciting phase right now with the build-out of our Sangdong Mine being in full swing towards completion of construction, with drawdowns on our KfW US$75.1 million loan facility being received on time and as planned and with the 7th drawdown about to be called imminently. The remarkable construction progress achieved throughout 2023 marks a significant milestone for the Almonty Korea Tungsten Project. With the successful arrival of over 90% of the required machinery and equipment, the project is steadily taking shape. The cornerstone of Plant Construction serves as a testament to our commitment to excellence and reinforces our dedication to meeting project milestones on schedule. We are resolute in upholding the highest standards of safety, quality, and environmental responsibility, ensuring that every aspect of the project is executed with utmost care and precision. As our 3 years of pilot plant testing both in Portugal and Korea have shown us, we fully expect to hit the ground running in regard to processing. Additionally, mine development for phase one will be completed by September 2024 and we will then move without interruption into phase two of our mine development for our increased throughput. We already have inventory of ore on surface which has been generated by the mine development and our approach means that as the plant is commissioned, we have full access to ore tonnage and grades as contemplated by our mine plan. This level of feed consistency is an important element in minimizing ramp up time. We remain focused on achieving our goals, and with the collective effort and commitment, we are confident in realizing the full potential of the Almonty Korea Tungsten Project. Together, we will create a lasting legacy and set new benchmarks in the industry with the ongoing support and partnership to continue this journey towards excellence”. About Almonty The principal business of Toronto, Canada-based Almonty Industries Inc. is the mining, processing and shipping of tungsten concentrate from its Los Santos Mine in western Spain and its Panasqueira mine in Portugal as well as the development of its Sangdong tungsten mine in Gangwon Province, South Korea and the development of the Valtreixal tin/tungsten project in north western Spain. The Los Santos Mine was acquired by Almonty in September 2011 and is located approximately 50 kilometres from Salamanca in western Spain and produces tungsten concentrate. The Panasqueira mine, which has been in production since 1896, is located approximately 260 kilometres northeast of Lisbon, Portugal, was acquired in January 2016 and produces tungsten concentrate. The Sangdong mine, which was historically one of the largest tungsten mines in the world and one of the few long-life, high-grade tungsten deposits outside of China, was acquired in September 2015 through the acquisition of a 100% interest in Woulfe Mining Corp. Almonty owns 100% of the Valtreixal tin-tungsten project in north-western Spain.

(1) Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are not recognized measures under IFRS, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

Non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of Almonty’s financial information reported under IFRS. Almonty uses non-GAAP financial measures, including “EBITDA”, to provide investors with supplemental measures of its operating performance and to eliminate items that have less bearing on operating performance or operating conditions, and thus highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Almonty defines “EBITDA from mining operations” as gross revenue less mine production costs. Almonty believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-GAAP financial measures in the evaluation of issuers. Almonty’s management also uses non-GAAP financial measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period.

Net income per diluted share improved for both periods. Successful separation from M-tron Industries, Inc. mentioned by the company. Plans to reinvest capital in aerospace and defense, consumer products, and industrial companies. Strong liquidity metrics with investments totaling $40.7 million. Consolidated results showed higher net income driven by increased investment income and gains, partially offset by lower sales and increased expenses. Negative None. Financial Analyst The LGL Group's financial results for Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 indicate a notable turnaround, with total revenues and income from continuing operations before taxes showing significant improvement. This positive shift is a result of strategic decisions such as the divestiture of M-tron Industries, Inc. and a keen focus on investments yielding higher returns. The company's ability to maintain net income per diluted share at $0.02 for Q4 across both years, despite various market fluctuations, reflects a stable earnings capacity.An increase in net investment income and net gains from the sale of investments highlights the company's adept capital allocation and investment strategies. The current ratio's increase from 67.0 to 87.7 signals a robust liquidity position, which is critical for future acquisitions or investments. Investors should note the company's agility in reducing operating expenses, as seen in the lower Engineering, selling and administrative costs, which directly contributes to the bottom line.However, the decrease in net sales and income from discontinued operations raises questions about the company's core operational growth. While the financial engineering aspects are commendable, the long-term sustainability of the business will depend on its ability to generate and increase sales from its core businesses. The reported increase in income tax expense is also a factor to consider, as it may impact future net income. Market Research Analyst LGL Group's financial results reflect a strategic pivot post the separation from M-tron Industries, Inc. The company's industry-agnostic approach, with an affinity for aerospace, defense, consumer products and industrial companies, positions it well to capitalize on diverse market opportunities. The emphasis on cash flow positive businesses with distinct competitive advantages is a prudent strategy that could lead to sustainable growth.The company's investments, particularly in U.S. Treasury money market funds, have proven beneficial given the higher yields in 2023. This suggests a conservative investment approach during a period of market uncertainty, which may appeal to risk-averse investors. The reduction in operating expenses indicates a lean operational model, which could provide a competitive edge in a challenging economic environment.For stakeholders, the significant increase in working capital and the current ratio are indicative of a strong balance sheet, which is essential for weathering economic downturns and pursuing growth initiatives. The company's ability to redeploy capital effectively will be critical in driving future revenue growth and market share expansion. Tax Consultant The increase in income tax expense for LGL Group reflects higher income from continuing operations, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it signifies the company's improved profitability; on the other, it points to a higher tax liability that could affect net income. The company's tax strategy should be closely monitored, as it will play a significant role in future earnings and cash flows available for reinvestment or distribution to shareholders.Given the company's investment activities and the potential for acquisitions, understanding the tax implications of these moves is crucial. A well-structured tax strategy can enhance shareholder value by optimizing the tax burden and ensuring compliance with evolving tax regulations. Investors should consider the company's tax position as a key factor in evaluating its financial health and strategic direction. 04/01/2024 - 05:48 PM Fourth Quarter 2023Total revenues increased $417,000 to $995,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $578,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2022Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and after non-controlling interests increased $466,000 to $303,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from ($163,000) for the three months ended December 31, 2022Net income per diluted share remained flat at $0.02 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022Fiscal Year 2023Total revenues increased $6,357,000 to $3,678,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from ($2,679,000) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and after non-controlling interests increased $7,004,000 to $598,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from ($6,406,000) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022Net income (loss) per diluted share increased $0.61 to $0.05 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 from ($0.56) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022Orlando, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - April 1, 2024) - The LGL Group, Inc.

The decrease vs prior year is mostly the result of a continuing slowdown in retail impulse purchases seen in the last two years due to inflation concerns across all sectors, as well as inventory adjustments at several retailers and base business segment. The decline vs prior year was partially alleviated in Q4, 2023 with 52% growth in e-commerce platform sales compared with Q4, 2022. Net sales when compared to Q3, 23 were up 12%.Mace reported a gross profit rate for the quarter of 22% vs 33%, or $325,000 lower than the prior year for the same quarter last year due to lower revenues, customer mix and inventory shrink. Increasing component and freight costs and the impact of lower sales were partially offset by price increases and lower manufacturing overhead. SG&A expense of $1,107,000 when adjusted for non-recurring legal and financing cost, expenses related primarily to the ongoing strategic alternatives project, and non-cash stock compensation costs was $942,000 in the fourth quarter 2023, compared with similarly adjusted SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of 2022 of $945,000. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of ($533,000) compared with a loss of ($194,000) in the same period 2022.Sanjay Singh, Chairman and CEO commented, ""The fourth quarter was a tough quarter for the Company. The decline in revenues in the quarter was due primarily to two customers that accounted for most of the decrease. E-commerce revenues continue to increase and is very much the Company's white horse now. Although sales are lower quarter over quarter, retail sales are stabilizing. There are six new ventures that are expected to bring in new revenues in 2024. Gross profit margins were lower than our usual 45% rate. One of the factors was fixed cost leverage. Since then, the Company reduced costs and has improved manufacturing efficiencies by 246 basis points when compared to Q4, 2023. The Company raised $300,000 in Q1, 2024 from the Board to help fund the new sales initiatives while cash is tight.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial HighlightsNet sales were $1,683,000, down (21%) from the fourth quarter of 2022 net sales of $2,118,000. The decline from prior year was due to the continuing slowdown in retail sales in several of the Company's large retail customers as impulse sales were impacted by a slowing economy and the highest U.S. inflation rate experienced in decades. Mace achieved significant growth of 52% in e-commerce platform sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with the fourth quarter of 2022.Gross profit rate of 22% decreased 11% from the same period in 2022 on decreased sales volume and higher freight and component costs. The modifications implemented to its operational cost structure during Q4, 2023 led to a 19% reduction in four-wall manufacturing costs on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This bodes well for margin improvement as revenue recovers. Product margins decreased over the fourth quarter of 2022 due to increasing component prices and lower manufacturing efficiency.Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $325,000, or 46%, from the fourth quarter of 2022, due primarily to the decline in sales volume and lower operating efficiencies.SG&A when adjusted for (a) non-recurring legal and financing costs of $62,000, (b) $60,000 related to the ongoing strategic alternatives project and (c) non-cash stock compensation expense of $43,000 was $942,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to SG&A when adjusted for $84,000 of expenses related primarily to transition payroll/temporary labor costs associated with the Company optimizing its headcount, and $51,000 of non-cash stock compensation expense was $945,000 in the same period in 2022. SG&A in both periods contains expenditures in support of the Company's commitment to its growth plan and the related cost for digital advertising.Based on the Company's annual valuation of goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis at December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that the carrying amount for goodwill and long-lived assets was impaired. The Company determined the fair value of its property and equipment to be $54,000, resulting in a $250,000 impairment of property and equipment. Intangible assets were impaired $965,000, and goodwill was impaired $292,000, for a total asset impairment charge of $1,507,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023.Net loss of ($2,285,000) in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with net loss of ($468,000) in the same quarter in 2022.Cash and cash equivalents increased to $239,000 as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $177,000 over the $62,000 on hand on December 31, 2022. $1,329,000 was drawn against the Company's $2,000,000 line of credit at December 31, 2023.Working capital decreased by $1,870,000 compared to December 31, 2022, with an increase in debt of $1,374,000 and a $350,000 decrease in accounts receivable on lower sales. Inventories decreased $740,000, and accounts payable increased $57,000. Inventory converted to finished goods ready for shipping as sales volume picks up increased $226,000, while raw material inventory declined $966,000, compared with December 31, 2022.Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2023 was a loss of ($533,000) and excludes nonrecurring legal and financing costs, of expenses related primarily to the ongoing strategic alternatives project, non-cash stock compensation expense, and gain on derivative liability. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2022 was a loss of ($194,000).Fourth Quarter 2023 Operational HighlightsThe modifications implemented to its operational cost structure during the second half of 2021 partially offset the decrease in Q4 2023 gross margin driven by higher freight and component cost and lower sales and efficiencies, compared with Q4 2022. The Company will continue to invest in manufacturing process improvements and new product development as these are instrumental components of management's strategic vision for growth. This gross margin improvement was offset by inflationary increases in freight and component costs.Year-to-Date December 2023 Financial HighlightsNet sales of $6,595,000 decreased by $2,163,000, or 25%, versus same period 2022 net sales of $8,758,000 due to the slowdown in retail sales in several of the Company's large retail customers as impulse sales were impacted by a slowing economy and the highest U.S. inflation rate experienced in decades.Gross profit rate decreased to 27% for 2023, compared to 38% for the same period in 2022.

Lawsuit claiming US$3,205,276.96 against GreenBank for alleged involvement in Freeway scam. Cease Trade Order issued by Ontario and British Columbia Securities Commissions affecting share trading. Uncertainty regarding the proposed sale of The Substantia Group due to recent developments. 04/01/2024 - 05:55 PM TORONTO, ON / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / GreenBank Capital Inc.Staminier Future Fund loan extension request rejected.Staminier Limited (in which the Company holds a 48.5% shareholding) has been notified by the Future Fund, administered by the British Business Bank, that is has rejected Staminier's request to extend the term of its loan from the Future Fund made under the Convertible Loan Agreement (CLA) dated 31 March 2021 beyond its original 3-year term which expired on 31 March 2024. The Future Fund have also stated that they intend to serve a demand for repayment of the total of £11.2m which is now due to them. This figure includes a redemption premium of £5m. GreenBank is currently contemplating whether to serve Staminier with a demand for payment of the £11.194m which is due to the Company under the CLA. If either of these demands is made it seems likely that Staminier will not be able to avoid going into insolvent liquidation. If that does happen then the amount of $418,215 and £2,489,096 which is owed by GreenBank to Staminier in relation to loans made by Staminier to GreenBank will automatically be set off against the £11,194,000 payable by Staminier thus eliminating the debt owed by GreenBank and reducing the amount for which GreenBank can claim from the liquidation of Staminier approximately £4,611,000 Prior to receipt of the notice from the Future Fund, GreenBank was carrying its shareholding in Staminier at a value of zero and the loan owed to it under the CLA at a value of $4,611,347 The Company has now written down the convertible loan due from Staminier to be equal to the amount due to Staminier.In the light of these developments, it is unclear whether the proposed sale of The Substantia Group will still proceed as announced on November 28h 2023.LawsuitThe Company has been served with proceedings claiming US$ $3,205,276.96 initiated in Wyoming which are based on the assertion that Greenbank is liable to certain investors in Freeway Tokens on the basis that it is a controlling seed investor and financial services advisor which invested in and distributed the original tokens underpinning what the claimants assert was ""the Freeway scam"" and that Greenbank promoted Freeway and allowed its images to be used in pitch books and other marketing materials of Freeway and its ""affiliates,"". Staminier invested in Freeway Tokens. GreenBank has never invested in Freeway Tokens or provided any advice to Freeway, distributed its tokens or given permissions for its images to be used in pitch books for Freeway. Richard Beresford, a director of the Company, is also named as a defendant to the proceedings. The Directors believe that the proceedings have no prospect of success against either GreenBank or Richard Beresford and are merely a speculative exercise on the part of the plaintiffs.Cease Trade Order (CTO)As announced on the 20 November 2023, the company expected to have delays in the filings of its accounts.

Softening market led to reduced revenues. Lower production year anticipated for 2024. Market challenges in the US, Europe, and China. Impairment loss on property, plant, and equipment. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. reflects a contraction in sales revenue and Adjusted EBITDA year-over-year, which is indicative of the broader challenges faced by the diamond industry in 2023. The net loss reported, including a significant impairment loss on property, plant and equipment, suggests a revaluation of assets in light of market conditions. The reduction in carat price realization from $146 to $121 per carat is a critical factor in revenue decline, despite a marginal increase in carats recovered. This price drop could be attributed to softening retail activity and consumer demand in key markets, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions.The repayment of US$18 million in debt, while commendable, falls short of more aggressive debt reduction that might be expected in a year following record financial performance. The strategic decision to limit discretionary spending and maintain underground mining optionality reflects a cautious approach to capital allocation in an uncertain market.Investors should note the company's efforts to decrease cash costs of production per tonne treated and per carat recovered, which may help mitigate the impact of lower diamond prices on margins. However, the reported net loss and the substantial impairment charge raise concerns about the company's future profitability and asset valuation. Market Research Analyst The diamond market in 2023 experienced a downturn, as evidenced by Mountain Province Diamonds' performance. The key takeaway is the softening of consumer demand in the US and Europe, likely tied to global inflation and geopolitical unrest. The strategic stockpiling of goods and postponed sales by major producers, including Mountain Province Diamonds, indicate a defensive response to unfavorable market conditions. The temporary import ban by India's Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council further highlights the industry's attempt to stabilize prices through supply control.Looking forward, the G7 sanctions on Russian-origin rough diamonds and the subsequent focus on origin tracing could benefit Canadian diamond producers like Mountain Province Diamonds. As supply chains adjust to new regulations, there could be an increased demand for ethically sourced diamonds, potentially providing a competitive edge to the company. However, the extent of this benefit remains to be seen and will depend on the effectiveness of origin tracing measures and consumer response. Mining Operations Expert Operational efficiency is a bright spot in Mountain Province Diamonds' report, with a 5% increase in tonnes treated year-over-year. This reflects an improvement in operational throughput post the mid-2023 plant shutdown. However, a 7% decrease in ore tonnes mined and a lower recovered grade of 1.71 carats per tonne, down from 1.78, suggest challenges in mining efficiency and ore quality.The anticipated lower production year due to mine sequencing and grade profile changes is a normal part of the mining lifecycle, but it will require careful management to ensure that production targets are met without compromising cost efficiency. The company's focus on maintaining the optionality of underground mining is a strategic move to potentially extend the mine's life and secure future production, albeit with associated capital requirements and risks. 04/01/2024 - 08:59 PM TSX and OTC: MPVD TORONTO, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Mountain Province Diamonds Inc.

After a record-breaking previous year, 2023 was more challenging for the diamond industry. Retail activity and consumer demand softened in the US and Europe amid global inflation concerns and ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. Chinese retail remained persistently quiet. Towards the end of the third quarter, major producers postponed or cancelled sales until more favourable market conditions prevailed. The Company elected to strategically stock select categories of goods to defend prices. In October, India's Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, representing Indian manufacturers, introduced a two-month self-imposed import ban. These supply-tightening measures reduced manufacturers' inventories and moved polished goods downstream for the retail holiday season and anticipated restocking. By year end, diamond prices had steadied, and the Company sold most of its strategic stock at a premium to withdrawn prices. Mountain Province Diamonds President and CEO Mark Wall commented: ""Coming from record 2022 where multiple Company financial records were broken, 2023 saw reduced revenues primarily due to a softening market. Driven by this softening, the Company, along with its JV partner De Beers Group, made the prudent decision to limit discretionary spending, including continuing internal studies on a potential transition to underground mining at Gahcho Kué to extend mine life. The Company intends to take all reasonable steps to maintain the underground mining optionality. Despite the challenging market in H2, during 2023 the Company paid down US$18 million in senior secured second lien notes. While we would have preferred to pay down more, this is aligned with our strategy to pay down debt principal as cash flows allow, to maintain financial flexibility. Operationally, 2023 saw improvements on certain key metrics, including an increase in tonnes treated of 3.25 million tonnes in 2023 vs 3.10 million tonnes in 2022, primarily driven by improvement post the mid-2023 major plant shut-down. Moving into 2024, the Company faces a lower production year due to the effects of mine sequencing and grade profile changes, all normal occurrences in open pit diamond mining. This lower production year was anticipated, and the mine remains on-track to achieve the previously stated 2024 production guidance of 4.2 - 4.7 million carats at the JV level and 2.3 - 2.6 million carats sold at the Company level. On the rough diamond market, we continue to monitor developments closely as many factors are integrated in the market dynamic. Initial stages of a recent G7 sanction banning imports of Russian-origin rough diamonds have increased efforts through the diamond pipeline to track and promote diamond's origin tracing.

NON-IFRS MEASURES The MD&A refers to the terms ""Cash costs of production per tonne of ore processed"" and ""Cash costs of production per carat recovered"", both including and net of capitalized stripping costs and ""Operating Income"", ""Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)"" and ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin"". Each of these is a non-IFRS performance measure and is referenced in order to provide investors with information about the measures used by management to monitor performance. These measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. They do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Cash costs of production per tonne of ore processed and cash costs of production per carat recovered are used by management to analyze the actual cash costs associated with processing the ore, and for each recovered carat. Differences from production costs reported within cost of sales are attributed to the amount of production cost included in ore stockpile and rough diamond inventories. Operating (loss) income is used by management to analyze the profitability of the Company that is generated during the regular course of its mining operations. It excludes income and expenses that are derived from activities not related to the Company's core business operations such as finance expenses, derivative gains (losses), and foreign exchange revaluation gains (losses). Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to analyze the operational cash flows of the Company, as compared to the net income for accounting purposes. It is also a measure which is defined in the Notes documents. Adjusted EBITDA margin is used by management to analyze the operational margin % on cash flows of the Company. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin with the net income on the consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss) income: Three months ended Three months ended Year ended Year ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net (loss) income for the year $ (75,792) $ 9,421 $ (43,671) $ 49,195 Add/deduct: Non-cash depreciation and depletion 19,019 17,805 70,803 57,159 Impariment loss on property, plant and equipment 104,593 - 104,593 - Net realizable value adjustment included in production costs - - 9,706 - Share-based payment expense 228 496 1,363 1,923 Fair value gain of warrants (1,842) (391) (4,816) (6,242) Finance expenses 12,672 19,861 41,918 47,812 Derivative (gains) losses (12,013) (2,627) (11,790) 2,513 Deferred income taxes (610) 5,520 1,980 21,200 Current income taxes 150 - 1,200 - Unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses (6,638) (25,882) (6,237) 5,049 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and depletion (Adjusted EBITDA) $ 39,767 $ 24,203 $ 165,049 $ 178,609 Sales 79,778 96,315 328,630 388,853 Adjusted EBITDA margin 50 % 25 % 50 % 46 % The following table provides a reconciliation of the cash costs of production per tonne of ore processed and per carat recovered and the production costs reported within cost of sales on the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income: Three months ended Three months ended Year ended Year ended (in thousands of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Cost of sales production costs $ 33,415 38,449 138,383 131,596 Timing differences due to inventory and other non-cash adjustments $ (12,026) 2,507 (7,802) 4,105 Cash cost of production of ore processed, net of capitalized stripping $ 21,389 40,956 130,581 135,701 Cash costs of production of ore processed, including capitalized stripping $ 38,721 64,858 204,927 185,536 Tonnes processed kilo tonnes 419 406 1,593 1,520 Carats recovered 000's carats 770 794 2,723 2,704 Cash costs of production per tonne of ore, net of capitalized stripping $ 51 101 82 89 Cash costs of production per tonne of ore, including capitalized stripping $ 93 160 129 122 Cash costs of production per carat recovered, net of capitalized stripping $ 28 52 48 50 Cash costs of production per carat recovered, including capitalized stripping $ 50 82 75 69 About the Company Mountain Province Diamonds is a 49% participant with De Beers Canada in the Gahcho Kué diamond mine located in Canada's Northwest Territories.

Adjusted EBITDA ‎is included as supplemental disclosure ‎because management believes that such measurement is ‎useful to useful to securities analysts, ‎investors and other interested parties in evaluating ‎operating performance by presenting the results of ‎the Company which excludes the impact of ‎certain non-operational items and certain non-cash and ‎nonrecurring items, such as share based ‎payment expense. The most directly comparable measure to ‎Adjusted EBITDA calculated in ‎accordance with IFRS is net income (loss).

The Company has granted underwriters an option to purchase additional shares. The shares are approved for listing on Nasdaq under the symbol 'ZBAO.' The offering is expected to close on April 3, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Zhibao Technology Inc.'s initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company, signaling a transition from a private to a public entity. This move allows for greater capital inflow, which can be pivotal for expansion and increased market penetration. The pricing of shares at $4.00, leading to a $6 million gross proceeds, is relatively modest, suggesting a conservative approach that might appeal to investors wary of volatility, especially in the tech sector.The inclusion of a 45-day option for underwriters to cover over-allotments is standard practice, providing a buffer for additional demand and potential price stabilization post-IPO. The approval for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market indicates ZBAO's compliance with financial and corporate governance requirements, which can be reassuring for investors. As a high growth InsurTech company, ZBAO is positioned in a market with significant potential, given the increasing reliance on digital solutions in the insurance industry. Financial Analyst Investors will be keen to scrutinize ZBAO's financials, given that the IPO proceeds are critical for its growth strategy. The $6 million raised will likely be allocated towards technology development, market expansion, or operational scalability. It is essential to compare this capital infusion with ZBAO's burn rate to assess sustainability. The pricing of the IPO also sets a benchmark for the company's valuation, which will be closely monitored for post-IPO performance.EF Hutton LLC's role as the sole book-running manager is noteworthy, as their reputation and expertise can influence investor confidence. The effectiveness of the registration statement by the SEC is also a green light for investors, indicating regulatory compliance. However, given the volatility in the tech sector, the long-term return on investment will depend on ZBAO's ability to maintain growth and profitability in a competitive InsurTech landscape. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the IPO process involves rigorous scrutiny by the SEC, ensuring that all necessary disclosures are made. ZBAO's filing of a Form F-1, which is specific to foreign issuers, indicates its international status and the need to comply with both U.S. and Chinese regulations. The final prospectus will be a key document for investors, containing detailed information about ZBAO's business, financials and risk factors.Investors should be aware of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in Chinese companies, including regulatory changes and trade tensions that could impact ZBAO's operations. The 45-day over-allotment option also carries legal implications, as it must be exercised in accordance with SEC regulations and within the stipulated timeframe. 04/01/2024 - 08:18 PM Shanghai, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zhibao Technology Inc.

These non-GAAP and other financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Non-GAAP and other financial measures should not be considered to be more meaningful than GAAP measures which are determined in accordance with IFRS. The disclosure under the section ""Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures"" including non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures in the Company's Condensed consolidated interim financial statements and MD&A are incorporated by reference into this news release.This press release uses the terms ""adjusted EBITDA"", ""adjusted funds flow"", ""free funds flow"" and ""net debt"" which are capital management measures. See the disclosure under ""Capital Management"" in our audited consolidated financial statements for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2023, for an explanation and composition of these measures and how these measures provide useful information to an investor, and the additional purposes, if any, for which management uses these measures.Supplemental Information Regarding Product TypesReferences herein to boe/d include gas or natural gas and NGLs which refer to conventional natural gas and natural gas liquids product types, respectively, as defined in National Instrument 51-101, Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101""), except where specifically noted otherwise.The following tables are intended to provide the product type composition for each of the production figures provided herein, where not already disclosed within tables above for average production of the Deer Mountain Block for the month of March 2024, and for Saturn's revised corporate production for 2024:Deer Mountain BlockMarch 2024 AverageLight and Medium Crude Oil (bbl/d)633Natural Gas Liquids (boe/d)113Conventional Natural Gas (Mcf/d)323Total (boe/d)800 Revised Corporate GuidanceMidpoint of 2024E AverageLight and Medium Crude Oil (bbl/d)18,800Natural Gas Liquids (boe/d)2,217Conventional Natural Gas (Mcf/d)32,900Total (boe/d)26,500 Abbreviations and Frequently Reoccurring TermsSaturn uses the following abbreviations and frequently recurring terms in this press release: ""WTI"" refers to West Texas Intermediate, a grade of light sweet crude oil used as benchmark pricing in the United States; ""MSW"" refers to the mixed sweet blend that is the benchmark price for conventionally produced light sweet crude oil in Western Canada; ""AECO"" refers to Alberta Energy Company, a grade or heating content of natural gas used as benchmark pricing in Alberta, Canada; ""bbl"" refers to barrel; ""bbl/d"" refers to barrels per day; ""GJ"" refers to gigajoule; ""NGLs"" refers to Natural Gas Liquids; ""Mcf"" refers to thousand cubic feet.Boe PresentationBoe means barrel of oil equivalent. All boe conversions in this news release are derived by converting gas to oil at the ratio of six thousand cubic feet (""Mcf"") of natural gas to one barrel (""Bbl"") of oil. Boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A Boe conversion rate of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio of oil compared to natural gas based on currently prevailing prices is significantly different than the energy equivalency ratio of 1 Bbl: 6 Mcf, utilizing a conversion ratio of 1 Bbl : 6 Mcf may be misleading as an indication of value.Forward-Looking Information and StatementsCertain information included in this press release constitutes forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation. Forward-looking information typically contains statements with words such as ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""expect"", ""plan"", ""intend"", ""estimate"", ""propose"", ""project"", ""scheduled"", ""will"" or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information in this press release may include, but is not limited to, the timing of closing of the disposition, use of proceeds therefrom, updated production and guidance information as well as the business plan, cost model and strategy of the Company.The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by Saturn, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the timing for completion of the sale of the Deer Mountain Block, the use of proceeds from the sale of the Deer Mountain Block, the timing of and success of future drilling, development and completion activities, the performance of existing wells, the performance of new wells, the availability and performance of facilities and pipelines, the ability to allocate capital to pay down debt and grow or maintain production, the geological characteristics of Saturn's properties, the application of regulatory and licensing requirements and the availability of capital, labour and services.Although Saturn believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Saturn can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

These and other risks are set out in more detail in Saturn's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2023.Forward-looking information is based on a number of factors and assumptions which have been used to develop such information but which may prove to be incorrect. Although Saturn believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking information are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information because Saturn can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

Bard, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AngioDynamics, Inc. (ANGO) has settled all outstanding patent litigation with Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) through a settlement agreement, involving licensing agreements and a $7 million lump sum payment. The agreement includes annual payments to BD and potential additional payments based on net sales. The settlement resolves a multi-year patent dispute, providing clarity and allowing AngioDynamics to focus on innovation and growth. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the settlement between AngioDynamics and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) marks the end of a resource-intensive patent litigation process. Litigation, especially in the medical technology sector, can often be a drain on a company's finances and management attention. By resolving the dispute, AngioDynamics can reallocate funds that were previously earmarked for legal expenses towards other areas of the business, such as research and development or marketing.The licensing agreements allow both companies to continue to innovate without the threat of further legal action, which can be seen as a positive development for the industry. It's important to note that such settlements often involve careful negotiation to ensure that the terms are favorable and do not adversely affect the company's competitive position or financial health. The structured payment plan and the potential for additional payments based on sales performance are indicative of a strategic approach to financial management in the face of legal obligations. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications, the one-time lump sum payment of $7 million, with $3 million due immediately and the remainder over the next 12 months, will impact AngioDynamics' short-term cash flow. However, spreading the cost over time, along with the six annual payments of $2.5 million through February 2029, provides a more manageable financial outlook for the company.Investors should consider the effect of these payments on the company's balance sheet and future earnings potential. The contingent payment of $3 million, dependent on the Federal Circuit's decision, introduces an element of uncertainty. However, the settlement brings financial predictability in the long term, which can be appealing to shareholders. The agreement's impact on net sales and earnings should be monitored closely, as it may influence the company's stock performance and valuation. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the resolution of patent disputes can have a positive effect on a company's reputation and its relationships with partners and customers. By securing a license to BD's port patents and granting a license to its catheter patents, AngioDynamics ensures continuity in its product offerings and may even open up opportunities for new product development.Additionally, the settlement could be perceived as a commitment to ethical business practices and respect for intellectual property, which can enhance AngioDynamics' brand image. It is also beneficial for the medical technology market as a whole, as it encourages companies to collaborate rather than engage in costly legal battles. This collaborative environment could potentially lead to innovations and improvements in patient care. 04/01/2024 - 05:26 PM LATHAM, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AngioDynamics, Inc.

The company's long-term investments were primarily in Midstream Energy Companies. Positive Net assets of $1.9 billion and net asset value per share of $11.52 as of March 31, 2024. Asset coverage ratios of 661% for senior securities and 469% for total leverage under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Long-term investments focused on Midstream Energy Companies. Investment objective to provide high after-tax total return with cash distributions to stockholders. Registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company on NYSE. Negative None. Financial Analyst The net asset value (NAV) per share is a vital indicator for investors in closed-end funds like Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. It represents the value of one share of the fund after liabilities are subtracted from assets and divided by the number of shares outstanding. A high NAV can imply that the investments held by the fund have performed well, although it is also important to consider the market conditions and the specific assets within the fund's portfolio.The asset coverage ratios reported are significantly above the 300% requirement set by the 1940 Act for senior securities, indicating a strong buffer against potential declines in asset values. This could be reassuring to investors concerned about the fund's ability to cover its debt obligations. However, the focus on Energy Infrastructure Companies, particularly Midstream Energy Companies, suggests a concentration risk, which could be a double-edged sword, depending on sector performance. Market Research Analyst The energy sector, specifically midstream companies, is subject to volatility in commodity prices, regulatory changes and shifts in supply and demand dynamics. The fund's significant exposure to this sector, with top holdings in major midstream entities, suggests a strategy betting on the continued demand for energy transportation and storage. While this can offer potential for high yields, especially in a high-demand environment, it also exposes the fund to sector-specific risks such as geopolitical tensions, environmental regulations and energy transition trends.Investors should be aware that the fund's performance is closely tied to the health of the energy infrastructure market. Diversification—or lack thereof—within the portfolio is a critical factor to consider, as it can affect the fund's resilience to sector downturns. The energy sector's performance and consequently the fund's results, could significantly sway investor sentiment and impact the stock's market performance. Economist From an economic standpoint, the energy infrastructure is a cornerstone of industrial and economic activity. The fund's investment in this area might benefit from macroeconomic trends such as increasing global energy consumption and infrastructure development. However, it's also susceptible to economic cycles and energy policy shifts, which can affect profitability and valuations of the underlying investments.Furthermore, the fund's after-tax total return objective is particularly relevant given the current tax environment and potential legislative changes affecting investment income. The emphasis on cash distributions aligns with income-seeking investors' preferences, but the sustainability of these distributions depends on the underlying assets' performance and the broader economic context. 04/01/2024 - 07:30 PM HOUSTON, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc.

Positive None. Negative The company reported a significant increase in net loss from 2022 to 2023, reflecting challenges in the operating environment. The losses were primarily attributed to fixed price new construction contracts signed before inflation and supply chain issues escalated. 04/01/2024 - 06:38 PM MORGAN CITY, La., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Conrad Industries, Inc. (OTC Pink: CNRD) today announced its 2023 results and backlog. The Company reported net loss of $27.0 million and loss per diluted share of $5.39 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to net loss of $17.4 million and loss per diluted share of $3.47 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The Company's financial reports are available at www.otcmarkets.com. Our backlog as of December 31, 2023 was $253.8 million, compared to $244.1 million at December 31, 2022, and $148.5 million at December 31, 2021. Johnny Conrad, Chairman and CEO stated, ""Our results for 2023 reflect a continued challenging operating environment, including challenges associated with continued high steel prices, inflationary price increases in other materials and equipment, supply chain disruptions, a tight labor market resulting in difficulties in retaining and hiring direct labor and rising interest rates during 2022 and 2023. A significant portion of our 2023 losses were related to fixed price new construction contracts that were signed prior to the substantial increases in inflation, higher labor costs and supply chain issues. These factors, along with the complexity of the new construction projects, were the primary drivers of the losses in 2023."" Mr. Conrad continued, ""Although we face substantial uncertainties in our markets, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities as market fundamentals improve, due to our shipyard capacity, our investments in improving our shipyards' capabilities and efficiencies, and our experienced team. Bid activity has been good and we believe the jobs we have recently signed include lessons learned on previous jobs, are not as complex and are better priced. We believe some delayed customer orders will move forward as steel prices stabilize or our customers' business opportunities or fleet replacement needs require new vessels. We also remain optimistic about opportunities in our repair and conversions segment."" Mr. Conrad concluded, ""Despite the many challenges we have confronted, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for our business. We believe that our ability to provide products and services to a variety of customers and to respond to demand for new types of vessels is a competitive strength. The infrastructure, government, pressurized barge, offshore wind and other markets are presenting us with exciting opportunities. We are intently focused on executing our backlog effectively, obtaining new profitable projects and returning our Company to profitability, in order to benefit our stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers and our community.""

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Cenntro Inc. (CENN) reported impressive financial and operational results for Q4 2023, with net revenue up 376% to $8.6 million and vehicles sold increasing by 148% to 1,135. Despite an EBITDA loss, the company showcased growth in sales volume and revenue, expanding distribution and receiving certifications for European markets. Positive Net revenue for Q4 2023 surged by 376% to $8.6 million compared to the same period in 2022. Sales volume saw a significant increase of 148% to 1,135 vehicles in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was a loss of $13.7 million, showing improvement from the previous year. Full-year 2023 net revenue rose by 147% to $22.1 million, with sales volume increasing by 148% to 1,135 vehicles. Cenntro delivered over 250 autonomous vehicles in China and received certifications for the European market, enhancing market penetration. The company redomiciled to the U.S. in February 2024, aiming for strategic growth and market share capture. Despite the EBITDA loss, Cenntro remains optimistic about sales momentum in 2024, focusing on geographic expansion and value creation for shareholders. Negative The company reported a net loss of $13.0 million in Q4 2023. Operating expenses increased in Q4 2023, impacting the overall financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA showed a negative trend, with a loss of $13.7 million in Q4 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased significantly from $154.0 million in December 2022 to $29.4 million in December 2023. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $54.2 million, reflecting challenges in financial performance. Financial Analyst The reported net revenue growth of 376% and the increase in vehicles sold by 148% are indicative of strong demand and successful market penetration for Cenntro Inc.'s electric commercial vehicles. Despite this, the gross profit margin remains low at 2.3%, which is a concern for long-term sustainability. The loss of Adjusted EBITDA, although reduced from the previous year, suggests that the company is still in a growth phase, investing heavily in expansion and not yet profitable. The strategic move to redomicile to the U.S. could be beneficial for accessing a larger market and potentially better financing terms, but it also comes with increased competition and regulatory scrutiny.Investors should note the company's reliance on government incentives, such as the HVIP in California, which can be subject to policy changes. The certifications received for the European market are a positive step, but the impact on sales will depend on the company's ability to compete with established players in the EU.Finally, the cash position has decreased significantly from the previous year, which raises questions about the company's liquidity and the need for additional financing. This, coupled with the ongoing net losses, indicates a potentially high-risk investment profile at this stage. Market Research Analyst The electric vehicle (EV) market is rapidly expanding and Cenntro's growth in sales volume reflects this trend. However, the company's sales are concentrated in specific regions, such as California and the EU, which could be a risk if market conditions change in these areas. The approval from CARB and the participation in HVIP are competitive advantages that can drive sales in the short term.The mention of the delivery of autonomous vehicles in China is a significant development, showing Cenntro's involvement in the cutting-edge technology sector. However, it is important to assess how this aligns with the company's core competencies and whether it can capitalize on this market without diverting too much focus from its main product lines.While the gross margin improvements are a positive sign, they are still relatively low for the industry, which typically sees higher margins for EVs. This could suggest scale inefficiencies or pricing strategies that may need to be addressed for long-term profitability. Automotive Industry Analyst The transition to electric vehicles is a significant trend in the automotive industry and Cenntro's increasing sales volume indicates that they are capturing market share. However, the low gross profit margin and continued Adjusted EBITDA losses highlight the challenges of scaling production and achieving profitability in the competitive EV space.The certifications for cybersecurity and software updates are critical for operating in the EU, which is moving towards more stringent regulations for vehicle safety and emissions. Cenntro's compliance with these regulations is a step in the right direction, but the company must continue to innovate and improve its technology to stay ahead.The strategic expansion into the European market and the development of charging solutions are promising, but it's important to monitor how these initiatives will affect the company's cost structure and whether they can achieve the economies of scale necessary to compete with larger automotive manufacturers. 04/01/2024 - 05:02 PM Q4 2023 Net Revenue Increased 376% to $8.6 million Q4 Number of Vehicles Sold Increased by 148% to 1,135 Vehicles Q4 Gross Profit Margin Increased 2,500 bps to 2.3% from a loss of -22.7% FREEHOLD, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cenntro Inc. (NASDAQ: CENN) (“Cenntro” or “the Company”), a leading electric vehicle technology company with advanced, market-validated electric commercial vehicles, has reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial and Operating Highlights Fourth Quarter 2023 Net revenue of $8.6 million increased 376% year over year. Sales volume increased by 827% year over year and 58.7% sequentially quarter over quarter to 473 vehicles. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is a loss of $13.7 million compared to a loss of $18.3 million for Q4 2022. Full Year 2023 Net revenue of $22.1 million increased 147% year over year.

Delivered more than 250 autonomous delivery vehicles in China to Zelos (Suzhou) Technology Co., Ltd, which sells and operates autonomous driving vehicles for urban delivery throughout various cities in China. LS400 received approval from the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to participate in California’s Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”) in the state of California, providing a $60,000 point-of-sale voucher for the Company’s customers. Received a Certificate of Compliance for Cybersecurity Management System (UN Regulation number: R155) and a Certificate of Compliance for Software Update Management System (UN Regulation number: R156). Both certifications are required for vehicle sales in the European Union beginning in the second quarter of 2024. In February 2024, Cenntro redomiciled from Australia to the United States of America to provide more opportunities to pursue future corporate development and strategic growth initiatives. Peter Z. Wang, Chief Executive Officer explained, “The fourth quarter of 2023 was highlighted by a continuation of the year’s sales momentum and distribution expansion. In the fourth quarter we sold 473 vehicles compared to 298 vehicles in Q3 2023 and 51 in Q4 2022. We experienced positive sales momentum for our iChassis, having sold 199 units in Q4, though these 199 units are not inclusive of the number of vehicles sold because iChassis is not considered a complete vehicle. During the quarter we delivered more than 250 autonomous delivery vehicles in China to Zelos (Suzhou) Technology Co. powered by iChassis and utilizing autonomous driving software developed by Zelos. More importantly, to date the demand for some of our newly launched vehicle models in Europe such as the LS260® continued to outpace our estimates. Sales momentum in 2023 continued to build quarter to quarter with the effectiveness of our sales process.” “Throughout the quarter we continued to benefit from government incentives in both the United States and the European Union for our vehicles. In California, we received approval to participate in the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (“HVIP”), providing a $60,000 point-of-sale voucher for our LS400 customers. HVIP approval not only accelerates our commercialization of the LS400, but makes the model more affordable and attractive to our customers by offering point-of-sale vouchers. In the EU, we received a Certificate of Compliance for Cybersecurity Management and a Certificate of Compliance for Software Update Management System. Both certifications are required for vehicle sales in the European Union beginning in the second quarter of 2024, stemming from the growing technological complexity and interconnectedness of today’s vehicles.” “In California, with the LS400’s approval now for the HVIP, Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) certification, and Zero-Emission Powertrain Certification (“ZEP”), we remain highly focused on scaling production at our U.S. assembly and manufacturing facility in Ontario, California. The facility has the capability to assemble and distribute the TeeMak, Metro and Logistar series models with a focus on the Logistar 400® and future models. We believe Ontario will also support strategic growth and sales on the west coast and the entire western region of the United States. California remains a strong market for EV sales and infrastructure development, as such we believe Cenntro’s dealer and distributor partnerships will strengthen sales and aftermarket support. In addition, from a supply chain standpoint, we believe California will serve as a very cost-effective point of entry for our products from China to serve our customers on the West Coast.” “Our footprint in the European market continues to build in scale with our EVC customer base looking for competitive products to complete their local commerce needs and allowing them to participate in Zero Emission initiatives. We have also determined that providing a compatible charging solution to our customers that is available for sale along with our product line is vital. We have begun to develop relationships that will allow us to provide a charging solution as part of the sales transaction.” “Based on these developments, we are optimistic that our sales momentum will continue to build in 2024 and beyond. With our recent re-domicile to the U.S., we are now well positioned to capture market share with our diverse and innovative lineup of all-electric vehicles that are benefiting from a variety of government incentives in the U.S. and Europe. Our focus in 2024 will be on expanding our geographic footprint for production, distribution, and service infrastructure, we believe this will position us to efficiently scale as we enter the next phase of growth and create additional value for our shareholders,” concluded Mr. Wang. Edward Ye, Acting Chief Financial Officer, added, “Sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2023 for our electric commercial vehicles increased 827% year-over-year to 473 from 51 in the same period of 2022. At the same time, we achieved an increase of net revenue of 376% to approximately $8.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.8 million in the same period of 2022. For the full year 2023, sales volume of commercial vehicles increased 148% year-over-year to 1,135 from 458 in 2022. 2023 revenue increased 147% to $22.1 million from $8.9 million in the prior year. The increase in net revenue is mainly attributable to an approximate $12.1 million increase in vehicle revenue in 2023. More importantly, we continue to experience quarter-to-quarter revenue growth in 2023 as fourth quarter revenue grew 49% from the third quarter of 2023 to $8.6 million and grew 376% from the prior year’s quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that the growth momentum will continue in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting our investment in expanding our product offerings and strengthening our global distribution capabilities.” “We continue to benefit from the transition to an in-country direct sales model and our launch of new models, particularly the LS260 as mentioned by Peter. Also, our overall vehicles gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately 11.7% and -0.27%, respectively. The increase in our overall gross profit was the result of (i) the decrease in inventory write-down of approximately $1.5 million; and (ii) the realized gross margin of Logsitar®100 and our newly introduced Logsitar®260 was approximately 25.4% and 18.8%, respectively, in 2023 compared with 2022.” “As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $29.4 million in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We also had $6.5 million in accounts receivable, $43.9 million in inventory which consisted of approximately $28.4 million in finished goods inventory, and approximately $26.2 million in investments in equity securities as of December 31, 2023,” concluded Mr. Ye.

MindMed Announces Voluntary Delisting from Cboe Canada,2024-04-01T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ: MNMD) has decided to voluntarily delist its common shares from Cboe Canada to focus on its Nasdaq listing, citing cost savings and increased shareholder value as key reasons. The delisting will be effective on April 10, 2024, with trading continuing on Nasdaq, providing shareholders with ample liquidity.","MindMed Announces Voluntary Delisting from Cboe Canada Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ: MNMD) has decided to voluntarily delist its common shares from Cboe Canada to focus on its Nasdaq listing, citing cost savings and increased shareholder value as key reasons. The delisting will be effective on April 10, 2024, with trading continuing on Nasdaq, providing shareholders with ample liquidity. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The decision by Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. to delist from Cboe Canada is a strategic move that reflects the company's evaluation of cost versus benefit in maintaining multiple listings. The concentration of trading volume on Nasdaq, which stands at about 95%, indicates that the liquidity provided by Nasdaq is more than adequate for the company's needs. This move can be seen as a cost-saving measure, as it eliminates the expenses related to a dual listing, which includes exchange fees, legal costs and administrative burdens.From a market perspective, the reallocation of resources towards initiatives that could potentially enhance shareholder value is a positive step. It shows that the company is actively managing its operational expenses and prioritizing its financial strategy. This could be seen favorably by investors who often look for companies with prudent financial management. However, the impact on the stock price will likely be minimal, as the delisting doesn't affect the company's fundamentals or its presence on a major exchange like Nasdaq. Financial Analyst For current and prospective investors, the key takeaway from MindMed's delisting from Cboe Canada is the expected improvement in operational efficiency. By focusing on a single primary listing, the company can streamline its reporting and compliance processes, potentially resulting in better allocation of management's time and company resources. The savings from reduced listing fees and other associated costs can be redirected towards research and development, which is critical for a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company.Investors should monitor how these savings are invested back into the company's core business activities, such as advancing clinical trials or expanding its product pipeline. The long-term value creation from these investments could outweigh any short-term inconveniences faced by Canadian shareholders. It's important to note that the company's continued status as a reporting issuer in Canada ensures that Canadian securities laws and protections remain in place for investors. Securities Compliance Expert MindMed's voluntary delisting from Cboe Canada while maintaining its Nasdaq listing is compliant with the Cboe Canada Listing Manual, which does not require shareholder approval given the existence of an alternative market. This compliance with regulatory standards is essential for maintaining investor confidence. The company's assertion that most Canadian brokers can trade securities listed on Nasdaq suggests that the delisting should not significantly impact Canadian shareholders' ability to trade MindMed's common shares.However, shareholders should be proactive in ensuring their brokerage accounts are equipped to handle trades on Nasdaq. It is also essential for MindMed to maintain transparent communication with its shareholders throughout this transition to mitigate any potential confusion or concern. The continued reporting under Canadian securities laws indicates a commitment to transparency and regulatory adherence, which is reassuring for stakeholders. 04/01/2024 - 05:00 PM All Common shares will remain listed on Nasdaq NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc. (NASDAQ: MNMD) (Cboe Canada: MMED) (the “Company” or “MindMed”), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel product candidates to treat brain health disorders, today announced that it has elected to voluntarily delist its common shares from Cboe Canada, effective at the close of markets on April 10, 2024, and the notice of voluntary delisting has been accepted by Cboe Canada. MindMed’s common shares will continue to be listed and tradable on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “MNMD” and Canadian shareholders can continue to trade their shares on Nasdaq. The Company believes that the trading volume of its common shares on Cboe Canada no longer justifies the expense and administrative requirements associated with maintaining this dual listing. MindMed’s Nasdaq listing provides its shareholders with sufficient liquidity, as Nasdaq accounts for approximately 95% of its trading volume. The substantial savings in exchange fees, legal fees, and managerial time and effort to maintain a dual listing can be redirected to initiatives intended to generate shareholder value. The board of directors of the Company has approved the voluntary delisting from Cboe Canada. In accordance with the Cboe Canada Listing Manual, Cboe Canada does not require shareholder approval of the voluntary delisting of MindMed’s common shares, as an acceptable alternative market will exist for the common shares on the date of delisting. Following delisting from Cboe Canada, MindMed’s shareholders can trade their common shares through their brokers on Nasdaq. As most brokers in Canada, including many discount and online brokers, have the ability to buy and sell securities listed on Nasdaq, MindMed’s Nasdaq listing will continue to provide shareholders with the same accessibility to trade the Company's common shares. Shareholders holding shares in Canadian brokerage accounts should contact their brokers to confirm how to trade MindMed’s common shares on Nasdaq. MindMed will continue to be a reporting issuer under applicable securities laws in all provinces and territories of Canada following the delisting of the common shares from Cboe Canada.

Growth During the quarter, K92 announced its updated Kora and Judd resource estimates. The updated Kora resource estimate reported a Measured and Indicated Resource of 2.3 million ounces at 10.24 g/t AuEq and an Inferred Resource of 3.9 million ounces at 8.60 g/t AuEq, representing increases of +8% and +58% from the previous resource estimate respectively. The updated Judd resource estimate reported a Measured and Indicated Resource of 0.35 million ounces at 8.68 g/t AuEq and Inferred Resource of 0.56 million ounces at 7.72 g/t AuEq, representing increases of +167% and +211% respectively.Subsequent to year end, results from the first two holes from K92’s maiden drill program at the Arakompa project recorded significant near-surface mineralization, with 4 high-grade lodes intersected in hole KARDD0002. Between the high-grade lodes, the tonalite to dioritic host rock is overprinted with porphyry style mineralization increasing the potential for bulk mining. The target size of Arakompa is very large, with mineralization demonstrated from drill holes, rock samples and surface workings for at least 1.7 km of strike, hosted within a ~150-225 m wide mineralized intense phyllic altered package, and exhibits a vertical extent of +500 m. Arakompa is sparsely drilled, with K92’s maiden drill results representing the first drilling on the project completed in 32 years. A total of 18 holes were drilled historically, with the vast majority shallow. Highlights from the maiden drill program include: KARDD0002 recording 7.20 m at 24.76 g/t AuEq, 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq, 5.30 m at 6.06 g/t AuEq and 3.60 m at 3.38 g/t AuEq (4).KARDD0002 recording a bulk intersection of 219.8 m at 1.59 g/t AuEq with a higher grade core of 149.4 m at 2.12 g/t AuEq, starting at 5.2 m from surface.Other historic highlights reported include:004DA92 recording 4.00 m at 32.03 g/t AuEq013AD92 recording 4.00 m at 20.21 g/t AuEq016AD92 recording 6.30 m at 14.96 g/t AuEq010AD92 recording 9.20 m at 10.67 g/t AuEq The twin incline is now effectively complete, with incline #2 (6m x 6.5m) advanced to 2,863 metres and #3 (5m x 5.5m) advanced to 2,838 metres as at December 31, 2023. Overall mine development during the fourth quarter was 2,649 metres, an increase of 19% from Q4 2022 and a quarterly record. The Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and associated management’s discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 are available for download on the Company’s website and under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca). All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. See Figure 1: Quarterly Production, Cash Cost and AISC ChartSee Figure 2: Quarterly Total Ore Processed, Development Metres Advanced and Total Mined Material ChartSee Figure 3: Process Plant Throughput Performance, Daily Records and Near-Records John Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, stated, “In 2023, K92 once again took a major step forward in numerous areas, delivering a strong finish to the year with multiple records achieved both financially and operationally, including, but not limited to, record production, development, material movements, earnings per share, cash flow per share, and revenue. With the strong fourth quarter, K92 exceeded the top end of its updated production guidance range and delivered better cash costs and all-in sustaining costs than the original guidance range. 2023 also delivered a significantly expanded resource base, with the combined Measured and Indicated resource at Kora and Judd increasing by +13% to 2.6 Moz AuEq at 10.0 g/t AuEq and the Inferred resource increasing by +70% to 4.5 Moz AuEq at 8.5 g/t AuEq, firmly placing Kainantu in an elite category of large high-grade gold systems globally. Looking ahead, we are very excited for 2024 as we continue to advance the transformation of Kainantu and K92 into a Tier 1, mid-tier producer in 2025. Concurrent with our transformative expansion works, we also remain focused on exploration, both near-mine and regionally, with very encouraging results to date, particularly from Arakompa in late-February reporting high-grade drill results including 7.20 m at 24.76 g/t AuEq, 5.70 m at 9.94 g/t AuEq, 5.30 m at 6.06 g/t AuEq and 3.60 m at 3.38 g/t AuEq and a bulk intersection of 219.8 m at 1.59 g/t AuEq with a higher grade core of 149.4 m at 2.12 g/t AuEq, starting at 5.2 m from surface. Importantly, this is the first time that any drilling has been completed on Arakompa in 32 years with only very limited and shallow drilling completed historically. The second drill rig has already commenced drilling at Arakompa and we look forward to providing exploration updates on our various targets in due course.” Mine Operating Activities Three months endedDecember 31, 2023Twelve months endedDecember 31, 2023Operating data Gold head grade (Au g/t)7.46.8Copper grade (%)0.87%0.75%Gold equivalent head grade (AuEq g/t)8.77.9Gold recovery (%)91.7%91.5%Copper recovery (%)93.6%92.8%Gold ounces produced33,309100,533Gold ounces equivalent produced(1)(2)39,101117,607Tonnes of copper produced1,2383,488Silver ounces produced56,502160,628 Financial data (in thousands of dollars) Gold ounces sold33,27397,355Revenues from concentrate and doré salesUS$75,316US$200,255Mine operating expensesUS$11,692US$40,038Other mine expensesUS$13,684US$39,473Depreciation and depletionUS$10,563US$31,877 Statistics (in dollars) Average realized selling price per ounce, netUS$1,898US$1,869Cash cost per ounce(2)US$430US$585All-in sustaining cost per ounce(2)US$1,062US$1,162 Notes: (1)Gold equivalent in 2023 is calculated based on: gold $1,950 per ounce; silver $23.37 per ounce; and copper $3.83 per pound.

(BLBX) announces financial results for Q4 and year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue declined in Q4 but increased annually. Operating expenses decreased. Executed LOI and Share Exchange Agreement with Evtec. Adjusted EBITDA improved. Plans to acquire Evtec Automotive and launch StockNanny in Q2. Positive outlook for future growth and shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The year-over-year decline in total revenue for Blackboxstocks Inc., with a drop from approximately $4.95 million in the previous year to $3.1 million, indicates a substantial contraction in the company's revenue-generating ability. This decrease is a red flag for investors, as it could suggest a weakening market position or competitive disadvantages that the company might be facing. However, the sequential increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4 of 2023 shows some resilience and possibly the beginning of a turnaround, which could be attributed to strategic initiatives.On the expense side, the reduction in operating expenses and the improvement in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year are positive signs of cost management and operational efficiency. The decrease in net loss, as mentioned by the CFO, may be a result of these cost-cutting measures. The stock-based compensation included in the operating expenses is a non-cash expense that investors should consider when evaluating the company's cash flow situation.Regarding the acquisition of Evtec, such strategic moves can be double-edged swords. They offer potential for growth and market expansion but come with integration risks and costs. The Share Exchange Agreement with Evtec Aluminum and the equity retention implies a significant strategic shift, which requires careful consideration of the synergies and financial impact on Blackboxstocks' balance sheet post-merger. The mention of SEC and Nasdaq approval is a reminder of the regulatory hurdles that such transactions must clear, which could affect the timeline and final terms of the deal. Market Research Analyst The financial technology and social media sectors are highly competitive, with constant innovation required to maintain and grow market share. Blackboxstocks' development of a new product, StockNanny, suggests an attempt to innovate within their niche. The success of this product will depend on its market fit and the effectiveness of its launch strategy in Q2. The strategic marketing partnership mentioned could be a significant lever to boost the company's market presence and drive adoption of both StockNanny and the core Blackbox product.Investors should also consider the broader market trends, such as the increasing demand for real-time analytics and trading tools, which could play in favor of Blackboxstocks if their offerings align with customer expectations. However, the decline in revenue raises questions about the company's current market strategy and execution. The planned merger with Evtec and the potential strategic partnership must be evaluated in terms of their ability to reposition Blackboxstocks within the market and catalyze a return to revenue growth. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Expert The binding LOI and subsequent Share Exchange Agreement with Evtec are key strategic moves that could redefine Blackboxstocks' business model and market approach. Mergers and acquisitions can provide access to new technologies, markets and customers, which could be the catalyst Blackboxstocks needs to reverse its revenue decline. However, the associated costs, such as the $575,000 in extension fees and the potential $400,000 in working capital, must be weighed against the long-term benefits of the merger.Investors should scrutinize the 26.7% equity retention in the combined company, as it will dilute current shareholders' stakes but could also be indicative of the value Blackbox perceives in the merger. The success of such a deal will largely depend on the post-merger integration process, the cultural and technological compatibility of the two companies and the ability to realize projected synergies. The mention of late-stage discussions for a strategic marketing partnership also indicates that Blackboxstocks is seeking to enhance its market position through alliances, which is a common post-M&A strategy to maximize the potential of new assets. 04/01/2024 - 05:30 PM Acquisition of Evtec Progressing Toward ClosingDALLAS, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blackboxstocks Inc. (NASDAQ: BLBX), (“Blackbox” or the “Company”), a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics for stock and options traders of all levels, today announced the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

These forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations, estimates and projections about our business, and reflect our beliefs and assumptions based upon information available to us at the date of this press release. In some cases, you can identify these statements by words such as “if,” “may,” “might,” “will, “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continue,” and other similar terms. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, plans for proposed operations, descriptions of our strategies, our product and market development plans, and other objectives, expectations and intentions, the trends we anticipate in our business and the markets in which we operate, and the competitive nature and anticipated growth of those markets.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statement for any reason. Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). However, management believes the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and that when GAAP financial measures are viewed in conjunction with the non-GAAP financial measures, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance. For all non-GAAP financial measures in this release, we have provided corresponding GAAP financial measures for comparative purposes in the report. We refer to the term “EBITDA” in various places of our financial discussion. EBITDA is defined by us as net income (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization expense and certain non-cash expenses including stock-based compensation. EBITDA is not a measure of operating performance under GAAP and therefore should not be considered in isolation nor construed as an alternative to operating profit, net income (loss) or cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities, each as determined in accordance with GAAP. Also, EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of liquidity. Moreover, since EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, and thus is susceptible to varying interpretations and calculations, EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

(the ""Company"" or ""DEFI"") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: R9B) (OTC: DEFTF), a financial technology company and the first and only publicly traded company that bridges the gap between traditional capital markets, Web3 and decentralised finance, announces its financial performance for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (all amounts in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise stated). Key Highlights of Q4 2023: The Company reported a cash balance at December 31, 2023 of $6.7 million compared to $4.9 million at December 31, 2022.The Company's venture portfolio investments were valued at $44.1 million by the end of the year.Assets Under Management (""AUM"") grew 476% to approximately $508 million as of December 31, 2023, up from $106 million as of December 31, 2022. Valour Inc. and Valour Digital Securities Limited's (""Valour's"") current AUM stands at C$880 million.Total revenues were $10.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 (""Fiscal 2023""). A significant improvement from the revenues of $(14.2) million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (""Fiscal 2022"").This notable improvement is especially significant considering that the majority of this revenue was generated in Q4, particularly in December, as digital assets prices underlying the Company's ETPs —and consequently AUM — saw substantial increases from the end of November through December.The Company's management fees increased in Q4 2023 driven by the increase in the Company's exchange traded product's (""ETP's"") net asset values with October, November and December 2023 management fee revenue being $114,362 $240,956 and $402,737 respectively.The Company's commitment to prudent financial management is evident from its lower operating, general, and administrative costs in 2023. Operating, general, and administration costs for Fiscal 2023 was $10 million, down from $14.7 million in Fiscal 2022.Total expenses for Fiscal 2023 stood at $30.5 million, a decrease of 41% YoY (being $51.7 million for Fiscal 2022) and is broken down as follows:Operating and G&A – $10 millionShare based comp – $3 millionAmortization – $2 millionInterest costs on debt – $4.2 millionTransaction on ETP issuance and digital assets trading fees - $1 millionMark to market FX loss – $10 millionDeFi Technologies Inc. and Neuronomics AG entered into a landmark Joint Venture Agreement to develop AI-based digital asset exchange traded products, actively managed certificates, and asset-backed tokens for global distribution.DeFi Technologies Inc. announced the launch of Valour Inc.'s Ripple (XRP) ETP, which was listed in February 2024 DeFi Technologies' subsidiary Valour Inc. announced the launch of a physical backed ETP for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Token in collaboration with DFINITY Foundation, which was listed in February 2024DeFi Technologies Inc. announced the strategic acquisition of leading Solana trading systems IP, completed in January 2024""Despite a prolonged period of challenges in the digital assets sector, DeFi Technologies has navigated these difficulties and achieved significant growth, especially in the fourth quarter of 2023,"" stated Olivier Roussy Newton, CEO of DeFi Technologies. ""Our success underscores the resilience of our infrastructure and the increasing demand for trustworthy and transparent digital asset offerings. As we look to 2024, we are enthusiastic about the prospects for continued expansion, highlighted by the substantial growth of our ETPs and the introduction of innovative products and offerings. Our commitment is to enhance our market presence through strategic partnerships, geographic expansion, and diversification of our product lineup, aiming to maximize AUM."" ETPs/Valour: Valour's ETP business had AUM of $508 million as of December 30, 2023, a 476% increase from December 31, 2022's AUM of $106 million. Valour's current AUM stands at $880 million. Liquidity: The Company ended Fiscal 2023 with a cash balance of $6.7 million, compared to $4.9 million at the end of Fiscal 2022. Financial Performance: For Fiscal 2023: Revenues were $10.4 million compared to $(14.2) million reported for Fiscal 2022.Net loss was $(20.3) million, an improvement from the net loss of $(65.9) million Fiscal 2022.The Company continues to emphasise fiscal responsibility and growth, evident from the reduced operating costs and the enhanced ETP products portfolio.Outlook for 2024: The Company has experienced significant revenue growth since the end of 2023, continuing rapidly through the first quarter of 2024. Valour's ETPs have witnessed an 800% increase in AUM from the market lows in late 2022, alongside growth in trading volumes. As of March 28, 2024, Valour's AUM stood at approximately C$880 million (US$650 million), with daily trading volumes exceeding C$20.3 million (US$15 million). Staking and lending income, as well as management fees, are closely correlated with Valour's product capital inflow and the price of digital assets underlying Valour's ETPs, which has grown substantially in the last few months. Revenue from arbitrage and liquidity provision is highly linked to overall market activity and turnover in Valour's listed ETPs. Given the current AUM, price of digital assets and activity level in the digital asset market, the Company's annualized top-line revenue is forecasted to be approximately C$63.3 Million (USD 46.8 million) for 20241. Growth in AUM is expected to lead to proportional increases in revenue. Since there is a strong correlation between the Company's revenues and the digital asset market's price levels and activity, revenue trajectories will fluctuate with market conditions, while costs remain stable, reflecting Valour's business' scalability. Furthermore, the continuous improvement in product mix is a crucial driver of monetization levels. The ETP business aims to maximize AUM through increased ETP launches and geographical expansion. The Company plans on launching approximately 15 ETP products in 2024 and an additional 30 in 2025 as the Company continues to take advantage of extremely positive macro fundamentals for the ecosystem in general. ____________________________ 1This projection is based on the assumption that no new ETPs are introduced and that AUM remains constant at current levels throughout 2024. Should AUM increase, revenues are expected to rise accordingly; conversely, a decrease in AUM would lead to a reduction in revenues. Restatement of Fiscal 2022 Financial ResultsFurther to the press release of the Company dated January 8, 2024 with respect to the Company's change of auditor from BF Borgers CPA PC (the ""Former Auditor"") to HDCPA Professional Corporation (the ""Successor Auditor""), the Company also announces that it has filed its financial statements of the Company for fiscal-year 2023 with restated comparative information for fiscal 2022 and the corresponding management's discussion and analysis.

(MVST) reported a significant 49.9% year-over-year revenue increase to $306.6 million in FY 2023, with a record quarterly revenue of $104.6 million in Q4 2023. The gross margin surged from 4.4% to 18.7%, a 14.3 percentage point improvement. The company aims for revenue growth in APAC and EMEA regions, with a focus on reducing operating losses and improving liquidity positions. Positive Revenue increased by 49.9% year over year to $306.6 million in FY 2023 Record quarterly revenue of $104.6 million, up 61.4% year over year in Q4 2023 Gross margin improved from 4.4% to 18.7%, with Q4 2023 gross margin at 22.0% APAC and EMEA regions show promising revenue growth Adjusted net loss reduced significantly due to revenue growth and margin improvement Focus on securing financing for Clarksville Phase 1A completion and expanding customer contracts Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial year-over-year revenue growth of 49.9% and the 61.4% increase in Q4 2023 for Microvast Holdings, Inc. reflects a robust expansion in the lithium-ion battery sector, which is likely driven by the acceleration of the electric vehicle (EV) market and the growing demand for energy storage solutions. The growth in gross margin from 4.4% to 18.7% indicates a significant improvement in operational efficiency and cost management. However, the company's net loss, despite narrowing, suggests that it is still in a growth phase where investments in capacity expansions, such as those in Huzhou, China and Clarksville, Tennessee, are substantial. The decline in cash reserves is a point of concern, which underscores the importance of securing financing for future expansion projects like Clarksville Phase 1A.Investors should note the potential for increased financial stability as the company's operations in APAC become self-funding and profitable. The EMEA region's revenue growth and the goal of reaching breakeven this year are also positive indicators. However, the significant capital expenditures and the need for financing solutions may pose risks to liquidity if not managed carefully. The company's forward-looking statements about targeting a revenue growth of 40% to 60% for Q1 2024 and improving gross margins suggest confidence in its business model and market position, yet these targets will require close monitoring to see if they materialize as projected. Market Research Analyst The impressive revenue figures reported by Microvast align with the broader trends in the energy sector, where there is a clear shift towards electrification and renewable energy sources. The company's focus on regional efficiencies and the expansion of its customer base in APAC and EMEA regions reflect a strategic move to capitalize on these trends. The mention of new customer wins and expansion into differentiated commercial vehicle markets suggests that Microvast is diversifying its portfolio, which could mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations.However, the competitive landscape in the lithium-ion battery market is fierce, with several large players and new entrants vying for market share. Microvast's ability to secure long-term domestic customer contracts will be critical for its sustained growth and financial health. Additionally, the company's strategy to increase utilization and maintain strong revenue growth will be essential in the face of potential headwinds such as raw material price volatility and supply chain disruptions. The company's performance in the upcoming quarters will be a significant indicator of its ability to execute its strategic initiatives amidst these market dynamics. Economist The data presented by Microvast provides insight into the economic forces at play within the niche market of lithium-ion battery manufacturing. The company's growth in revenue and gross margin improvement reflects a strong demand for battery technology, likely fueled by policy incentives for clean energy and the adoption of EVs globally. However, the substantial capital expenditures and reduced cash position raise questions about the sustainability of Microvast's growth in the absence of additional financing.From an economic perspective, the company's investment in manufacturing capacity is a positive sign for job creation and economic activity in the regions of Huzhou and Clarksville. Yet, the risk of overextension cannot be ignored, especially if the anticipated revenue growth and gross margin targets are not met. The company's future financial health will depend on its ability to manage costs, optimize production and navigate the economic challenges of inflationary pressures and potential shifts in consumer demand and regulatory environments. The strategic focus on regional efficiencies and the pursuit of long-term contracts are prudent in this context, but the success of these initiatives will be key to Microvast's long-term economic viability. 04/01/2024 - 05:00 PM Revenue increased 49.9% year over year to $306.6 million in FY 2023Record quarterly revenue of $104.6 million, up 61.4% year over year in Q4 2023Gross margin increased from 4.4% to 18.7%, a 14.3 percentage point improvement year over year, with Q4 2023 gross margin of 22.0% compared to 3.4% in Q4 2022 STAFFORD, Texas, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Microvast Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:MVST) (“Microvast” or the “Company”), a technology innovator that designs, develops and manufactures lithium-ion battery solutions, announced today its consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (“Q4 2023” and “FY 2023,” respectively). “We achieved record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 bringing our full year revenue growth to 49.9% and we delivered these revenues at a gross margin close to our targeted level. The revenue growth achieved in EMEA is really encouraging and we would expect this to continue into 2024, with the possibility of this region also hitting breakeven this year.” said Yang Wu, Microvast’s Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer. “In APAC, with the Huzhou Phase 3.1 expansion now in full operation since Q3 of last year, we anticipate another year of steady revenue growth from mature operations that are now self funding and profitable. To get the U.S. to the same mature and steady state requires us to secure financing to complete Clarksville Phase 1A. This remains a key initiative that we hope to bring to a successful close as early as possible.” “The combination of growing revenues, gross margin improvement of 14.3 percentage points, and keeping our adjusted operating costs increase to 11% allowed us to achieve a meaningful reduction in our adjusted net loss this year.” said Craig Webster, Microvast’s Chief Financial Officer. “Maintaining the strong revenue growth and gross margin profiles generated by our APAC and EMEA operations will be a key focus for us in 2024, whilst also providing the foundations to improve our overall liquidity position and make further headway in reducing our operating losses.” Full Year 2023 Highlights Record revenue of $306.6 million, compared to $204.5 million in 2022, an increase of 49.9% Gross margin increased to 18.7% from 4.4% in 2022; Non-GAAP adjusted gross margin increased to 20.7%, up from 8.2% in 2022 Operating expenses of $165.9 million, compared to $170.7 million in 2022; Adjusted operating expenses of $107.1 million, compared to $96.5 million in 2022 Net loss of $106.4 million, compared to net loss of $158.2 million in 2022; Non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $41.6 million, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $77.3 million in 2022 Net loss per share of $0.34 compared to net loss per share of $0.52 in 2022; Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share of $0.13, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share of $0.25 in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of negative $19.6 million, compared to adjusted EBITDA of negative $56.7 million in 2022 Capital expenditures of $186.8 million, compared to $150.9 million in 2022, and were driven by investments in manufacturing capacity expansions in Huzhou, China and Clarksville, Tennessee Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investment of $93.8 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $327.7 million as of December 31, 2022; decrease largely due to significant capital expenditure towards PP&E in the U.S. and Huzhou, China.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, Microvast has disclosed in this earnings release non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP adjusted gross profit (loss), non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the rules of the SEC. These are intended as supplemental measures of our financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, gross profit (loss) and net income (loss), are contained in tabular form in the unaudited financial statements below. Non-GAAP adjusted gross profit (loss) is GAAP gross profit (loss) as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in cost of revenues. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss is GAAP net loss as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and change in valuation of warrant liabilities. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss per common share is GAAP net loss per common share as adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense and change in valuation of warrant liabilities per common share. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss excluding depreciation and amortization, non-cash settled share-based compensation expense, interest expense, interest income, changes in fair value of our warrant liability and income tax expense or benefit. We use non-GAAP adjusted gross profit (loss), non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We consider them to be important measures because they help illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with their most directly comparable GAAP measures, gross profit (loss) and net income (loss), provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, our calculation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies, or our peer companies may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore our use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The principal limitation of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining this non-GAAP financial measure. In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents non-GAAP financial measures in connection with GAAP results. In addition, such financial information is unaudited and does not conform to SEC Regulation S-X and, as a result, such information may be presented differently in our future filings with the SEC. For example, with respect to the warrant liability resulting from the merger, we now exclude changes in fair value from net loss in our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net loss calculation, which had not been done in prior periods.

The company shows positive financial progress. Positive The company sold 68 assets in 2023, generating gross proceeds of $842.7 million. Seritage Growth Properties paid down $670 million of debt during the year. The majority of the company's remaining assets have identified counterparties or are in the market for sale. Positive financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disposal of 68 assets by Seritage Growth Properties, resulting in gross proceeds of $842.7 million, is a significant liquidity event that has allowed the company to reduce its debt load by $670 million. This strategic move is likely aimed at improving the company's balance sheet and reducing financial risk. The debt paydown is substantial, considering the proceeds and it indicates a prioritization of financial health over expansion or other investments.For investors, this could signal a more conservative approach by management, potentially leading to a more stable but slower growth trajectory. The market's response to such news typically hinges on the balance between debt reduction and future growth prospects. In this case, the emphasis on deleveraging could reassure investors who are concerned about the company's leverage levels.It's also worth noting the mention of 'identified counterparties' for the majority of remaining assets, suggesting that the company is actively managing its portfolio and could be preparing for further divestitures. This could have implications for future revenue streams and the company's asset base, affecting both short-term liquidity and long-term strategic positioning. Real Estate Market Analyst Seritage's sale of numerous assets and the subsequent debt reduction reflect broader trends in the real estate market. Given the company's focus on retail, residential and mixed-use properties, these moves could be indicative of a strategic shift in response to changes in consumer behavior and the retail landscape. The successful sale of assets also suggests that there is healthy demand in the market for such properties, which could be a positive indicator for the sector.However, the reduction of the company's asset base could also mean a future decrease in rental income, which is a key revenue stream for real estate investment trusts (REITs). Investors should consider the potential impact of these sales on the company's future earnings potential. Additionally, the reference to the majority of remaining assets having identified counterparties could imply that the company is nearing the end of a sell-off phase, which might lead to a period of consolidation or a pivot in strategy.The long-term impact of these strategic choices will depend on how effectively Seritage can reinvest the proceeds from these sales into higher-yielding opportunities or improve its operational efficiency with a leaner portfolio. 04/01/2024 - 06:20 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Seritage Growth Properties (NYSE: SRG) (the “Company”), a national owner and developer of retail, residential and mixed-use properties today reported financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023. “In 2023, we sold 68 assets for gross proceeds of $842.7 million and paid down $670 million of debt. As of today, the overwhelming majority of our remaining assets have identified counterparties, are in the market or about to be launched. With respect to the remaining properties in our portfolio, these are assets for which we need to overcome important hurdles and/or achieve specific objectives prior to launching these assets for sale. We have a line of sight into a significantly more simplified portfolio of primarily premier development sites in prime markets. This along with our low run rate corporate overhead and significant tax losses may position the Company for potential strategic transactions as an alternative to continuing our Plan of Sale,” said Andrea L. Olshan, Chief Executive Officer and President. Sale Highlights: Generated $99.5 million of gross proceeds during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 from sales including: $27.5 million in gross proceeds from one income producing Multi-Tenant Retail asset reflecting a 6.4% capitalization rate; $15.3 million in gross proceeds from three income producing Non-Core assets reflecting a 7.0% blended capitalization rate; and $56.7 million in gross proceeds from two vacant / non-income producing Non-Core assets sold at $54.95 PSF eliminating $2.5 million of carry costs.

As of March 22, 2024, the Company has four assets under contract for anticipated gross proceeds of $53.6 million. All assets for sale are subject to customary closing conditions. Of these four assets, one is an income producing Non-Core asset for sale with no due diligence contingencies for total anticipated gross proceeds of $3.8 million reflecting a 7.8% capitalization rate. In addition, of these four assets, three are under contract for sale subject to customary due diligence for total anticipated gross proceeds of $49.8 million, including: $28.0 million in gross proceeds from one income producing Multi-Tenant Retail asset reflecting a 5.3% capitalization rate; $17.1 million in gross proceeds from one vacant / non-income producing Non-Core asset priced at $87.43 PSF eliminating $0.5 million of carry costs; and $4.7 million in gross proceeds from monetizing one unconsolidated entity interest. As of March 22, 2024, the Company has accepted offers on, and is currently negotiating definitive purchase and sale agreements on one unconsolidated equity interest for total gross proceeds of approximately $7.1 million and one income producing Non-Core asset for total gross proceeds of approximately $8.1 million. The Company currently has two assets in active auction processes with aggregate reserve prices of $10.0 million. Financial Highlights: For the year ended December 31, 2023: As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash on hand of $149.7 million, including $15.7 million of restricted cash.

Subsequent to year end, the Company made an additional $30 million principal repayment reducing the balance of the Term Loan Facility to $330 million as of March 22, 2024. Other Highlights Signed six leases covering 25 thousand square feet in the fourth quarter at an average projected annual net rent of $66.96 PSF. Three ground floor leases covering approximately 4.2 thousand square feet at a Premier asset at a projected annual net rent of $103.75 PSF; and Three upper floor leases covering approximately 20.7 thousand square feet at a Premier asset at a projected annual net rent of $59.57 PSF.

The availability of funding from sales of assets is subject to various conditions, and there can be no assurance that such transactions will be consummated.

Strategic Review At the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on October 24, 2022, Seritage shareholders approved the Company’s Plan of Sale. The strategic review process remains ongoing as the Company executes the Plan of Sale, and the Company remains open minded to pursuing value maximizing alternatives, including a potential sale of the Company. There can be no assurance regarding the success of the process. Market Update As the Company has previously disclosed, the Company, along with the commercial real estate market as a whole, has experienced and continues to experience challenging market conditions as a result of a variety of factors. These conditions have applied and continue to apply downward pricing pressure on all of our assets. In making decisions regarding whether and when to transact on each of the Company’s remaining assets, the Company will consider various factors including, but not limited to, the breadth of the buyer universe, macroeconomic conditions, the availability and cost of financing, as well as corporate, operating and other capital expenses required to carry the asset. If these challenging market conditions persist, then we expect that they will impact the Plan of Sale proceeds from our assets and the amounts and timing of distributions to shareholders. Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company makes references to NOI and Total NOI which are financial measures that include adjustments to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Neither of NOI or Total NOI are measures that (i) represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP; (ii) are indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions; (iii) are alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity; or (iv) should be considered alternatives to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating the Company’s operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the respective GAAP measures the Company deems most comparable have been provided in the tables accompanying this press release. Net Operating Income (""NOI”) and Total NOI NOI is defined as income from property operations less property operating expenses. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly the Company’s depiction of NOI may not be comparable to other real estate companies. The Company believes NOI provides useful information regarding Seritage, its financial condition, and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level. The Company also uses Total NOI, which includes its proportional share of unconsolidated properties. This form of presentation offers insights into the financial performance and condition of the Company as a whole given the Company’s ownership of unconsolidated properties that are accounted for under GAAP using the equity method. The Company also considers NOI and Total NOI to be a helpful supplemental measure of its operating performance because it excludes from NOI variable items such as termination fee income, as well as non-cash items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles. Forward-Looking Statements This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” ""will,"" ""approximately,"" or ""anticipates"" or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to historical matters. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, which may cause actual results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: declines in retail, real estate and general economic conditions; risks relating to redevelopment activities; contingencies to the commencement of rent under leases; the terms of the Company’s indebtedness and other legal requirements to which the Company is subject; failure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels within the projected time frame or at all; the impact of ongoing negative operating cash flow on the Company’s ability to fund operations and ongoing development; the Company’s ability to access or obtain sufficient sources of financing to fund the Company’s liquidity needs; environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations; and possible acts of war, terrorist activity or other acts of violence or cybersecurity incidents. For additional discussion of these and other applicable risks, assumptions and uncertainties, see the “Risk Factors” and forward-looking statement disclosure contained in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and any subsequent Form 10-Qs. While the Company believes that its forecasts and assumptions are reasonable, the Company cautions that actual results may differ materially. The Company intends the forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time made and do not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available, except as required by law.

Dover Completes Sale of DESTACO Business Unit,2024-04-01T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Dover  (DOV) successfully finalizes the sale of De-Sta-Co business to Stabilus SE.,"Dover Completes Sale of DESTACO Business Unit Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Dover (DOV) successfully finalizes the sale of De-Sta-Co business to Stabilus SE. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of De-Sta-Co from Dover Corporation represents a strategic repositioning that could potentially streamline Dover's operations and focus on core businesses. Historically, such sales can impact a company's stock by either signaling a sharpening of business focus or raising concerns about shedding profitable units. For stakeholders, the key interest lies in how the proceeds will be used - whether for debt reduction, reinvestment in core areas, or shareholder returns - and how the sale affects Dover's revenue streams and profit margins moving forward.Stabilus SE's acquisition of De-Sta-Co might indicate an expansion strategy, aiming to diversify its portfolio or enhance its market position in the engineered products sector. Investors should monitor Stabilus's ability to integrate the new acquisition and realize synergies that can contribute to its financial performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the completion of De-Sta-Co's sale is likely to result in immediate changes to Dover's balance sheet. The infusion of capital from the sale may improve liquidity and could lead to a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio. It's important to evaluate this transaction within the context of Dover's overall financial strategy, including any potential tax implications or changes in earnings forecasts. For Stabilus, the acquisition cost and how it was financed will be of interest, as it will affect their leverage and interest coverage ratios.Investors should also be attentive to any changes in Dover's future earnings reports, as the divestiture will likely lead to adjustments in revenue and possibly profit margins. The market's response to the sale will hinge on the perceived value of the deal and its alignment with Dover's long-term strategic goals. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM DOWNERS GROVE, Ill., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV) today announced that it has completed the previously reported sale of its De-Sta-Co business, which was part of Dover's Engineered Products segment, to Stabilus SE (WKN: STAB1L, ISIN: DE000STAB1L).

The following dates apply to each declaration: Share Class Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Payable Date Amount Change from Previous Declaration XFLT April 12, 2024 April 15, 2024 May 1, 2024 $0.085 No Change XFLTPRA April 12, 2024 April 15, 2024 April 30, 2024 $0.40625 No Change1 Common share distributions may be paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends), capital gains and/or a return of capital. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust’s common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2024 calendar year. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. For further information regarding the Trust’s distributions, please visit www.xainvestments.com. The Trust’s net investment income and capital gain can vary significantly over time; however, the Trust seeks to maintain more stable common share monthly distributions over time. The Trust’s investments in CLOs are subject to complex tax rules and the calculation of taxable income attributed to an investment in CLO subordinated notes can be dramatically different from the calculation of income for financial reporting purposes under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), and, as a result, there may be significant differences between the Trust’s GAAP income and its taxable income. The Trust’s final taxable income for the current fiscal year will not be known until the Trust’s tax returns are filed. As a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on January 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust’s fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so. The common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder’s tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder’s potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder’s potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares. Preferred shareholders are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends and distributions on the Trust’s 6.50% Series 2026 Term Preferred Shares, when, as and if declared by, or under authority granted by, the Board of Trustees of the Trust out of funds legally available for distribution and in preference to dividends and distributions on common shares. If the Trust is unable to distribute the full dividend amount due in a dividend period on the Trust’s 6.50% Series 2026 Term Preferred Shares, the dividends will be distributed on a pro rata basis among the preferred shareholders. Distributions and dividends shall be paid on the Payable Date listed above unless the payment of such distribution or dividend is deferred by the Board of Trustees upon a determination that such deferral is required in order to comply with applicable law, to ensure that the Trust remains solvent and able to pay its debts as they become due and continue as a going concern or, with regard to the Trust’s regular monthly distribution to common shareholders, to comply with the applicable terms or financial covenants of the Trust’s senior securities. Future common share distributions will be made if and when declared by the Trust’s Board of Trustees, based on a consideration of number of factors, including the Trust’s continued compliance with terms and financial covenants of its senior securities, the Trust’s net investment income, financial performance and available cash. There can be no assurance that the amount or timing of common share distributions in the future will be equal or similar to that described herein or that the Board of Trustees will not decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of common share distributions in the future. The investment objective of the Trust is to seek attractive total return with an emphasis on income generation across multiple stages of the credit cycle. The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in a dynamically managed portfolio of opportunities primarily within the private credit markets. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in floating rate credit instruments and other structured credit investments. There can be no assurance that the Trust will achieve its investment objective.

(APCX) reported a 12% increase in revenue for the fiscal year 2023, reaching approximately $504 thousand. The company announced strategic partnerships and acquisitions to expand its reach, including a mobile-to-mobile payment system with InstaCash, Inc. and the acquisition of FinZeo, a software development company. AppTech also secured agreements with Reno-Tahoe International Airport and a credit union network. The CEO highlighted the company's focus on growth through mergers and partnerships to enhance shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 12% increase in revenue for AppTech Payments Corp. is a modest growth, particularly in the fast-paced fintech sector. The revenue growth, driven by new licensing revenue, suggests a strategic shift towards scalable business models. However, the offset by lower merchant processing revenue indicates possible competitive pressures or a shift in business focus. Investors should consider the sustainability of the licensing model and the potential for further revenue diversification.AppTech's strategic partnership with InstaCash and its expansion into Brazil and Mexico show proactive efforts to capture emerging market opportunities. This could signal future revenue streams but also comes with inherent risks associated with international expansion, such as regulatory hurdles and localization challenges.The acquisition of FinZeo positions AppTech as a Payment Facilitator, which could streamline operations and enhance service offerings. The potential to become the fintech solution for credit unions is significant, given the size of the credit union market. However, the success of this initiative will depend on seamless integration and adoption by the credit unions. Market Research Analyst AppTech's move to develop mobile and web-based applications for contactless payments aligns with current market trends towards digital and mobile banking solutions. Visa/MasterCard sponsorship could enhance consumer trust and adoption rates. The equity stake in InstaCash could provide strategic leverage and an additional revenue source if InstaCash's mobile payment system gains traction.The announcement of Reno-Tahoe International Airport adopting the FinZeo platform is a noteworthy client win, potentially serving as a case study to attract other airports. The agreement to provide FinZeo platform services to a widespread credit union network suggests a targeted approach to penetrate the traditional banking sector, which could disrupt legacy banking systems if successful. Legal Expert The extension of AppTech's license to Brazil and Mexico introduces a complex regulatory landscape that the company must navigate. Compliance with international financial regulations and data protection laws will be critical for the successful implementation of their payment system in these markets. Additionally, the equity stake in InstaCash implies a shared responsibility and potential legal implications in the event of operational challenges or disputes.As a Payment Facilitator, AppTech assumes greater liability for transaction security and compliance. The FinZeo API's ability to integrate with software providers must align with industry standards for data security, such as PCI DSS, to mitigate the risk of data breaches and ensure consumer protection. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM CARLSBAD, Calif., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AppTech Payments Corp.

Commercial planning underway for potential U.S. launch. Financial results for Q4 and full year 2023 revealed. Positive Positive Phase 3 RESILIENT study results position Tonmya™ for NDA submission in the second half of 2024. Commercial planning, including go-to-market strategies, for the potential U.S. launch of Tonmya is in progress. Financial results for Q4 and full year 2023 were disclosed by Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. Collaborations with government agencies, non-profit organizations, and other biotech/pharma companies are being sought for pipeline programs. Selected product candidates, including Tonmya, TNX-1300, TNX-1900, TNX-2900, TNX-1500, TNX-1800, and TNX-801, show promising developments and progress in various clinical studies. FDA meetings, partnerships, and clinical trial advancements are key highlights in the PR. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Tonix Pharmaceuticals regarding positive Phase 3 RESILIENT study results for Tonmya™, a fibromyalgia treatment, is a significant development in the biopharmaceutical sector. The successful completion of this study is a important step toward a New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. Historically, the approval of new first-line treatments for conditions like fibromyalgia, which has seen little innovation over the past decade, can disrupt the market. The robustness of the clinical data, particularly the statistically significant improvement in pain and other fibromyalgia symptoms, suggests a strong potential for market penetration upon approval.From a research perspective, the Cohen's d effect size of 0.38 indicates a moderate clinical effect, which is noteworthy in a condition notoriously difficult to treat. The drug's safety profile, with no new adverse signals, is reassuring for both patients and providers. Moreover, the lack of association with weight gain or sexual side effects could give Tonmya™ a competitive advantage over existing treatments, which often have burdensome side effects.The potential expansion into Asian markets, as suggested by the PK bridging study, could significantly increase the drug's commercial footprint. However, it is essential to note that market exclusivity in regions like Japan and China will depend on successful regulatory filings and the ability to navigate different healthcare systems. Healthcare Economist From an economic standpoint, the development of Tonmya™ represents a potential shift in the management of fibromyalgia, a condition with a substantial economic burden due to direct healthcare costs and lost productivity. If approved, Tonmya™ could alleviate some of this burden by offering an effective treatment option that improves symptoms like pain, sleep quality and cognitive function. This could translate into reduced healthcare utilization and increased workforce participation among patients.Furthermore, Tonix's strategy to leverage partnerships and grants to fund R&D expenses is a capital-efficient approach that could enhance shareholder value. By offsetting costs and potentially accelerating the development timeline, the company may improve its financial position and attractiveness to investors.It's also worth considering the broader implications of Tonix's pipeline, including other CNS treatments and rare disease candidates. Success with Tonmya™ could bolster investor confidence in the company's ability to bring other products to market, potentially impacting the stock positively. However, investors should be cautious of the risks inherent in biopharmaceutical development, such as regulatory hurdles and market adoption challenges. Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Analyst The selection of dual supply sources for the potential launch of Tonmya™ in the U.S. demonstrates strategic planning for robust supply chain management. Ensuring a reliable supply of the drug is critical for successful commercialization, especially for a new treatment entering a market with pent-up demand. The partnership with EVERSANA to support the launch and commercial planning further indicates Tonix's commitment to a well-orchestrated market entry.However, the complexity of manufacturing and distributing a new pharmaceutical product should not be underestimated. The company will need to navigate manufacturing scale-up, quality control, distribution logistics and reimbursement challenges. The successful management of these factors will be pivotal in determining the speed and extent of market penetration for Tonmya™ upon potential FDA approval.Investors should monitor the progress of these commercial preparations closely, as they can significantly impact the company's ability to meet market expectations and deliver financial returns. Delays or issues within the supply chain could lead to stock volatility and investor concern. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM Positive results from confirmatory Phase 3 RESILIENT study reported in December 2023 position Tonmya™ for fibromyalgia for NDA submission second half of 2024; pre-NDA meeting with FDA scheduled for second quarter 2024 Commercial planning underway, including go-to-market, supply chain and manufacturing strategies, for U.S. launch of Tonmya, a potential new first-line, centrally-acting, non-opioid analgesic for the management of fibromyalgia CHATHAM, N.J., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp. (Nasdaq: TNXP) (Tonix or the Company), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company with marketed products and a pipeline of development candidates, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided an overview of recent operational highlights. “Our near-term focus is seeking U.S. marketing approval for Tonmya (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) for the treatment of fibromyalgia from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” said Seth Lederman, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Tonix Pharmaceuticals. “Our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA is scheduled to take place this quarter and we plan to submit our New Drug Application (NDA) for Tonmya™ in the second half of 2024. We believe the positive Phase 3 RESILIENT results reported in December of 2023 together with the positive results from the first Phase 3 RELIEF study should satisfy the requirements for approval and, if so, would provide the opportunity for Tonix to launch the first FDA-approved drug for fibromyalgia in more than a decade. We believe the activity of Tonmya on improving pain, sleep quality, fatigue and brain fog in the RESILIENT study are indicative of the broad-spectrum of activity in fibromyalgia.” Dr. Lederman added, “While Tonix is focusing its resources on progressing Tonmya toward NDA submission and potential FDA approval, we are seeking partnerships and collaborations on our pipeline programs from government agencies, non-profit organizations and other biotechnology or pharmaceuticals companies. Tonix has already shifted portions of our research and development (R&D) expenses to U.S. government agencies and other institutions through partnerships involving grants and in-kind contributions. These outside collaborations leverage our internal resources, and we believe they provide a capital efficient strategy for progress.” Selected Product Candidates* — Recent Highlights Central Nervous System (CNS) Pipeline Tonmya (also known as TNX-102 SL; cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets): a centrally-acting, non-opioid, small molecule analgesic taken once-daily at bedtime for the management of fibromyalgia (FM). The Company announced in December 2023 that the Phase 3 RESILIENT study, a registration-quality, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating TNX-102 SL met its pre-specified primary endpoint in the second of two positive Phase 3 clinical trials, significantly reducing daily pain compared to placebo (p=0.00005) in participants with fibromyalgia. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful results were also seen in all key secondary endpoints related to improving sleep quality, reducing fatigue, and improving patient global ratings and overall fibromyalgia symptoms and function. Additionally, as it relates to improving daily pain, treatment with TNX-102 SL showed a robust and clinically meaningful analgesic Cohen’s d effect size of 0.38, with rapid onset of action, separating from placebo for every week of the study. TNX-102 SL was well tolerated with an adverse event profile comparable to prior studies and no new safety signals observed. Tonix plans to submit an NDA to the FDA in the second half of 2024 for TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia.In January 2024, Tonix presented additional safety and tolerability data from the Phase 3 RESILIENT study that showed TNX-102 SL treatment was not associated with increases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure or body weight, nor were there any reported sexual side effects.In January 2024, Tonix announced that the FDA has conditionally accepted the trade name, Tonmya, for the Company’s drug product candidate TNX-102 SL for the management of fibromyalgia.In February 2024, Tonix announced positive results from its clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) bridging study of Tonmya in healthy adult male and female ethnic Japanese and Chinese volunteers. Results indicate that key PK parameters of cyclobenzaprine are comparable in ethnic Japanese and Chinese volunteers to Caucasian volunteers from a prior PK study. Tonmya was generally well tolerated in the ethnic Japanese and Chinese healthy volunteers. The company expects these data to fulfill the requirement for a bridging study, and enables Tonix to rely on Phase 3 studies RESILIENT and RELIEF results to support regulatory filings for clinical studies in Japan and China where cyclobenzaprine is a new chemical entity (NCE). Tonix holds issued patents for market exclusivity rights of Tonmya in Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.In February 2024, Tonix selected Rho, Inc., a global contract research organization, to support Tonix’s preparation and planned submission of its NDA to the FDA for the approval of Tonmya for the management of fibromyalgia.In March 2024, Tonix announced the selection of two CMOs, including Almac Pharma Services, as dual supply sources for the potential launch and commercialization of Tonmya in the U.S.In March 2024, Tonix selected EVERSANA, a leading provider of commercialization services to the global life sciences industry, to support the launch strategy and commercial planning of Tonmya in the U.S.Tonix presented additional efficacy data from RESILIENT at the 6th International Congress on Controversies in Fibromyalgia in Brussels, Belgium, March 7-8, 2024. The data showed that Tonmya treatment resulted in an improvement in cognitive dysfunction, or ‘brain fog’, measured by the change in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised (FIQ-R) memory item. The FIQ-R cognitive item showed nominal improvement in Tonmya-treated patients vs placebo-treated patients with p-value=0.001 and effect size of 0.31. TNX-102 SL for the treatment of acute stress reaction (ASR) and acute stress disorder (ASD), and prophylaxis against development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) In February 2024, the Company announced the FDA cleared the Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the Phase 2 investigator-initiated OASIS trial to evaluate TNX-102 SL in reducing the severity of ASR and the frequency of ASD and PTSD. The trial is sponsored by The UNC Institute for Trauma Recovery and supported by a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which was awarded in September 2023. The proposed Phase 2, Optimizing Acute Stress Reaction Interventions with TNX-102 SL (OASIS) study will examine the safety and efficacy of TNX-102 SL to reduce adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). The study will enroll approximately 180 trauma survivors at ED study sites in the U.S. Participants will be randomized in the ED to receive a two-week course of either TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg or placebo.Tonix expects the Phase 2 OASIS trial will initiate in the second quarter of 2024. TNX-102 SL for the treatment of Fibromyalgia-Type Long COVID, also known as Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) In January 2024, the Company announced the online publication of a research paper in the Journal Pain. The article titled, “Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions Increase the Risk of Long COVID Features, Regardless of Acute COVID Status,” by Bergmans, et al. 1, found that patients with pre-existing chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) had an increased risk of being diagnosed with symptoms of Long COVID1. Faculty at the University of Michigan directed the research. Commentary on the article titled, “A step towards better understanding chronic overlapping pain conditions” by Fitzcharles, et al,2 is in the same issue of the journal. COPCs include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, migraine headache, irritable bowel syndrome, endometriosis and low back pain. These results contribute to a growing body of evidence that common symptoms of Long COVID in many patients are at least partly driven by central nervous system mechanisms.In September 2023, the Company reported topline results from its Phase 2 PREVAIL proof-of-concept study of TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia-type Long COVID. TNX-102 SL showed a robust Cohen’s d effect size of 0.50 in improving fatigue relative to placebo; and it showed consistent activity across secondary measures of sleep quality, cognitive function, disability and Patient Global Impression of Change, but did not meet the primary endpoint of multi-site pain reduction at Week 14. TNX-102 SL was generally well tolerated and no new safety signals were observed. The Company intends to request an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss a potential Phase 3 program based on a proposed primary outcome measure using the PROMIS Fatigue scale. TNX-1300 (recombinant double mutant cocaine esterase): biologic for life-threatening cocaine intoxication Tonix expects to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study of TNX-1300 for the treatment of cocaine intoxication in emergency rooms in the second quarter of 2024. In 2022, Tonix was awarded a Cooperative Agreement grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH)’s National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) to support development of TNX-1300.TNX-1300 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. TNX-1900 (intranasal potentiated oxytocin): small peptide in development through investigator-initiated studies for bone health in autism, social anxiety disorder (SAD), adolescent obesity and binge eating disorder In November 2023, Tonix announced that the first participant was enrolled in an investigator-initiated Phase 2 study of TNX-1900 for improving bone health in children with autism spectrum disorder, named the BOX study, at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The aim of this DoD funded study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of TNX-1900 as a novel therapeutic agent to increase bone density and improve bone structure and strength in children with autism spectrum disorder. Tonix is providing active drug and placebo for the BOX study as part of a drug donation agreement with MGH. MGH is the sponsor of the trial, which is being conducted under an investigator-initiated IND application.TNX-1900 is also being studied in three other ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 2 studies as follows: MGH Phase 2 study for binge-eating disorder (BED)University of Washington Phase 2 study for social anxiety disorder (SAD)MGH Phase 2 study for adolescent obesity Rare Disease Pipeline TNX-2900 (intranasal potentiated oxytocin): small peptide for the treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) In December 2023, Tonix announced that the FDA has cleared the IND application to support clinical development of TNX-2900 to treat PWS in children and adolescents. The Phase 2 study approved under the IND is a dose-finding study involving approximately 36 PWS patients divided into four groups with approximately nine per group. One group will receive placebo and three groups will receive different dosage regimens of TNX-2900. TNX-2900 for the treatment of PWS was granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA in 2022.In March 2024, Tonix announced that it received Rare Pediatric Disease designation from the FDA for TNX-2900 for the treatment of PWS. Immunology Pipeline TNX-1500 (anti-CD40L Fc-modified humanized monoclonal antibody): third generation anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis of organ transplant rejection and treatment of autoimmune disorders. The first indication for TNX-1500 is prophylaxis of organ rejection in adult patients receiving a kidney transplant; but multiple additional indications are possible, including autoimmune diseases. Two peer reviewed publications described the work at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) on allogeneic transplants in animals were published.3,4Preclinical studies have shown that TNX-1500 maintains the activity of first-generation monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), yet with reduced risk of thrombotic complications.3-5 Modeling studies from animal pharmacokinetic data3 predict a half-life of approximately three weeks for TNX-1500 in humans, which supports a monthly i.v. dosing regimen. This analysis together with TNX-1500’s activity and tolerability in animals, suggests that the protein engineering of TNX-1500’s Fc region has achieved its design goals.In October 2023, the Company announced data from two oral presentations delivered at medical meetings in 2023. The oral presentations titled, “Pilot Evaluation of a Clinical Xeno Heart Transplant Regimen in a Preclinical Model” and “Extended Survival of 9- and 10-Gene Edited Pig Heart Xenografts with Ischemia Minimization and CD154 Costimulation Blockade-Based Immunosuppression” by Dr. Ikechukwu Ileka et al. include data demonstrating the use of TNX-1500 as maintenance therapy after xenogeneic heart transplant in non-human primates. In both studies, genetically engineered (GE) pigs in baboon transplants were treated with cold-perfused ischemia minimization and a novel costimulation-based immunosuppressive regimen that includes TNX-1500.In October 2023, Tonix announced that a study published in the Journal Nature5 by faculty at the Center for Transplantation Sciences, MGH, in collaboration with biotechnology company, eGenesis, utilized TNX-1500 as part of the immune modulating regimen to prevent organ transplant rejection. The Nature article titled, “Design and testing of a humanized porcine donor for xenotransplantation” includes data that provide additional support for TNX-1500’s activity in preventing pig xenograft organ rejection and for its safety and tolerability in non-human primates.In February 2024, Tonix announced the completion of the clinical stage of its Phase 1 single ascending dose study of TNX-1500 in healthy volunteers. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous TNX-1500. Topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2024. This first-in-human study is intended to support dosing in a planned Phase 2 trial in kidney transplant recipients.In March of 2024, the MGH announced the first transplant of a genetically modified pig kidney into a living patent in collaboration with eGenesis, which produced the pig donors.6 Some of the pre-clinical work that supported this transplant was performed in collaboration with Tonix and used TNX-1500.5 Infectious Disease Pipeline TNX-1800 (modified recombinant horsepox virus, live vaccine): potential vaccine to protect against COVID-19 designed to express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Results from a study with our TNX-1800 vaccine that showed animals were protected from challenge with SARS-CoV-2 were published as an article in the peer reviewed journal, Viruses in 2023.7In November 2023, Tonix announced that NIH and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) will conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial with TNX-1800 as part of Project NextGen. NIAID will cover the full cost of the clinical trial, including operations and related analyses. Tonix will be responsible for providing clinical trial materials, and upon completion will have the right to rely on the findings in regulatory filings with the FDA to support the approval of its COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines based on the recombinant pox vaccine (RPV) platform.We believe the TNX-1800 vaccine development plan addresses several priority vaccine attributes advanced by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Pandemic Preparedness Plan,8 the National Biodefense Science Board9 and BARDA.10 Tonix believes its RPV platform can address a wide variety of disease targets of public health interest. TNX-801 (recombinant horsepox virus, live vaccine): potential vaccine to protect against mpox disease and smallpox. Results from a study with our TNX-801 vaccine that showed animals were protected from mpox were reported at a meeting in the first quarter of 2020 and published as an article in the peer reviewed journal, Viruses in 2023.11On December 14, 2023, Dr. Lederman participated in a panel discussion on Vaccine Research & Development at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) Committee on the Current State of Research, Development, and Stockpiling of Smallpox Medical Countermeasures public meeting. Discussions explored lessons learned from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and mpox multi-country outbreak to inform an evaluation of the current state of research, development, and stockpiling of smallpox readiness and response measures. The Consensus Study Report was issued on March 28, 2024.12 Some of the conclusions included recommendations for single dose vaccines, safer vaccines, vaccine platforms and attention to supply chain and manufacturing. Tonix believes TNX-801 has the potential to address some of the recommendations from the NAS Committee since it provides single dose protection to animals, and has the potential for favorable dose, manufacturing and cold chain requirements.In August 2023, Tonix received the official written response from a Type B pre-IND meeting with the FDA to develop TNX-801 as a potential vaccine to protect against mpox disease (formerly known as monkeypox) and smallpox. Tonix believes the FDA feedback provides a path to agreement on the design of a Phase 1/2 study and the overall clinical development plan. The Phase 1/2 clinical trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of TNX-801, following the submission and clearance of an IND.Concerns about current state of new smallpox and mpox vaccines in development have been raised by the U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense13 and by an outbreak of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.14Results from a study with our TNX-801 vaccine that showed decreased virulence relative to traditional live vaccinia vaccine strains were posted on the website BioRxiv in 2023.15 Broad-spectrum anti-viral programs Tonix is developing potential broad-spectrum antiviral drugs in three programs: CD45-targeted therapeutics (TNX-4200), cathepsin inhibitors (TNX-3900) and viral glycan-targeted engineered biologics (TNX-4000). In 2020, the DoD announced that they are seeking broad spectrum antiviral drugs since it would be hard to predict which or how many viruses may be deployed on the battlefield.16 Tonix hopes that one or more of our programs may help the DoD address that goal.

Additionally, Tonix had inventory totaling approximately $13.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Net cash used in operations was approximately $102.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $98.1 million for the same period in 2022. Net cash used by investing activities for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $29.1 million compared to $48.1 million for the same period in 2022. In August 2022, the Company announced that it received a Cooperative Agreement grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”), part of the National Institutes of Health, to support the development of its TNX-1300 product candidate for the treatment of cocaine intoxication. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Tonix received $2.7 million in funding as a reduction of related research and development expenses. Included in prepaid expense and other is an additional $0.2 million that was not received until January 2024. On December 8, 2023, the Company executed a Loan and Guaranty Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) to issue a 36-month term loan (the “Term Loan”) in the principal amount of $11.0 million with a maturity date of December 8, 2026 (the “Maturity Date”). The Term Loan was funded with an original issue discount of 9% of the principal amount of the Term Loan, or $1.0 million, which is being amortized over the term of the debt as an adjustment to the effective interest rate on the outstanding borrowings. On December 20, 2023, the Company announced it had signed securities purchase agreements with existing healthcare-focused institutional investors for upfront gross proceeds of approximately $30 million through a registered direct offering. On March 28, 2024, the Company announced it had signed securities purchase agreements with existing healthcare-focused institutional investors for upfront gross proceeds of approximately $4.4 million through a registered direct offering.

Tonix completed the acquisition of two currently marketed products from Upsher-Smith Laboratories, LLC on June 30, 2023. R&D expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 were approximately $17.1 million, compared to $24.7 million for the same period in 2022. This decrease is predominantly due to decreased non-clinical and manufacturing expenses. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter 2023 were $11.6 million, compared to $8.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to sales and marketing and the transition services expenses associated with the Company’s recently acquired marketed products offset by a decrease in compensation-related expenses. Net loss available to common stockholders was $27.3 million, or $0.86 per share, basic and diluted, for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to net loss available to common stockholders of $34.1 million, or $3.42 per share, basic and diluted, for the same period in 2022.

Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net product revenue for the full year 2023 was approximately $7.8 million. Cost of sales for the full year 2023 was approximately $4.7 million. R&D expenses for the full year 2023 were approximately $86.7 million, compared to $81.9 million for the same period in 2022. This increase is predominantly due to decreased non-clinical and regulatory expenses, offset by an increase in clinical, manufacturing, employee-related and professional expenses. SG&A expenses for the full year 2023 were $34.8 million, compared to $30.2 million for the same period in 2022. The increase was primarily due to sales and marketing associated with the Company’s recently acquired marketed products. Net loss available to common stockholders was $116.7 million, or $6.85 per share, basic and diluted, for the full year 2023, compared to net loss available to common stockholders of $116.9 million, or $20.01 per share, basic and diluted, for the same period in 2022.

The report highlights commitments to reduce GHG emissions, achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and launch eco-friendly products. Partnerships with EcoVadis® aim to monitor supplier sustainability practices. Positive None. Negative None. Sustainability Analyst From a sustainability perspective, the commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in alignment with the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) is a significant step for Azenta, Inc. This demonstrates a proactive approach to climate change mitigation which is increasingly becoming a factor in investment decisions. As investors are more inclined to support companies with strong sustainability practices, this move could potentially enhance Azenta's reputation and appeal in the market. The introduction of the BioArc™ Ultra also indicates innovation towards energy-efficient technologies, which could lead to cost savings in the long term due to reduced energy consumption and potential tax incentives for environmentally friendly practices. Investor Relations Specialist Investors are likely to scrutinize the ESG report for its potential financial implications. The establishment of short-term emissions reduction targets and a commitment to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 may suggest forward-thinking risk management, as regulatory pressures and carbon pricing regimes become more prevalent. However, investors will be keen to understand the capital expenditures associated with these initiatives and how they might affect Azenta's financials in the near term. The partnership with EcoVadis® to monitor sustainability practices in the supply chain could enhance operational resilience and mitigate risks associated with supplier conduct, which is an increasingly important aspect for investors. Corporate Social Responsibility Expert Azenta's focus on social impact, particularly in the regions where it operates, indicates a commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR). The emphasis on safety, quality and reliability of products and services is essential for maintaining customer trust and loyalty. By addressing these areas, Azenta could see improved stakeholder relationships and brand image. However, it is important for stakeholders to monitor how these initiatives translate into tangible outcomes and whether they align with the interests of shareholders, customers and the communities in which Azenta operates. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM BURLINGTON, Mass., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Azenta, Inc.

ProShares Announces Changes to ETF Lineup,2024-04-01T22:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ProShares to liquidate and close ProShares S&P 500® Bond ETF (SPXB) on April 23, 2024, due to ongoing product review.","ProShares Announces Changes to ETF Lineup Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ProShares to liquidate and close ProShares S&P 500® Bond ETF (SPXB) on April 23, 2024, due to ongoing product review. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The liquidation of the ProShares S&P 500® Bond ETF (SPXB) represents a strategic shift by ProShares as they refine their product offerings. This decision likely stems from a comprehensive analysis of the fund's performance, investor demand and overall fit within the company's portfolio. From a financial standpoint, the closure of an ETF can have implications for current investors who may need to reallocate their assets, potentially incurring transaction costs. Additionally, the liquidation process typically involves selling off the fund's assets, which might impact the underlying bond market, albeit marginally given the vast size of the bond market.Investors should be aware of the tax implications of such liquidations, as any capital gains distributed as a result of the liquidation process are taxable events. Moreover, the timing of the closure, with a notice period before halting trading, allows investors the opportunity to exit their positions in an orderly fashion, mitigating potential market impact. For ProShares, the move could be seen as a way to concentrate resources on more profitable or strategic offerings, which could be beneficial in the long term if it leads to a more focused and competitive product lineup. Market Research Analyst The liquidation of an ETF such as the ProShares S&P 500® Bond ETF might indicate broader industry trends, such as shifts in investor preferences or saturation in certain fund categories. The ETF landscape is highly competitive and providers often prune their offerings to eliminate underperforming or unpopular funds. This action by ProShares may reflect a strategic response to market research that suggests a need to adapt to changing market conditions.For competitors and the broader market, the closure of SPXB could be a signal to evaluate their own product lines for potential optimizations. Market research might delve into the causes behind the fund's underperformance, whether it be fee structures, fund composition, or investor sentiment. Such insights can inform the development of new products or the enhancement of existing ones to better meet market demands. The impact on the stock market is typically limited in such cases, but it does provide valuable information on the state of the ETF market and potential gaps or opportunities for innovation. 04/01/2024 - 06:15 PM BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ProShares announced today plans to liquidate and close one ProShares Trust ETF, based on an ongoing review of ProShares product offerings.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/01/2024 - 05:10 PM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / GLG Life Tech Corporation (TSX:GLG) (""GLG"" or the ""Company""), a global and agricultural leader in the natural zero-calorie sweetener industry, committed to the sustainable development of high-quality zero-calorie natural sweeteners, announces that, as a result of newly received Chinese court orders (""Court Orders"") involving one of the Company's subsidiaries, the Company will not be able to file its annual financial statements, its management discussion and analysis relating to its annual financial statements, and its Annual Information Form and CEO and CFO certifications, all in respect of its year ended December 31, 2023 (collectively, the ""Required Documents""), before the prescribed deadline of April 2, 2024.As previously announced, the Company's Runyang Stevia High Tech Co., Ltd. (""Runyang"") subsidiary has been in bankruptcy proceedings in China; these bankruptcy proceedings involving Runyang - whose production assets have for many years been idle - form part of the Company's overall debt restructuring plan. These proceedings have no adverse impact on the Company's production capabilities.The Company, in late March and including March 31, 2024, received a series of late-coming updates - the Court Orders - from the Chinese court overseeing these proceedings. These Court Orders - effective at different dates within 2023 (ranging from February 2023 through November 2023) - separately serve to accept Runyang's bankruptcy application, to dispose of Runyang's assets, and most recently to both declare Runyang bankrupt and terminate the bankruptcy proceedings.These Court Orders will have a significant effect on the Company's balance sheet dating back to the first quarter of 2023 and the net effect, as of the fourth quarter of 2023, is understood by the Company to remove approximately 33M RMB in assets and to effectively eliminate approximately 200M RMB in debt (including accrued interest) - an expected net improvement of approximately 168M RMB (or approximately CAD $31M at present exchange rates) to the Company's balance sheet. The Company is pleased to report this progress in its debt restructuring plans as part of its multi-year effort to bring about major improvements to the Company's balance sheet.Given the Chinese court's delay in providing these 2023 orders to the Company and their receipt coming late in the audit process, the Company is working with its auditor a) to determine the precise impact of the Court Orders on the Company's financials, including the Company's 2023 interim financial statements, which, along with 2022 financial statements related to Runyang asset characterization, are expected to require restatement tied to these court orders and proceedings, and b) to coordinate a plan and timeframe in which to revise the Company's 2023 annual financial statements and complete the audit thereof. That the Court Orders were dated at different dates within 2023, but were not provided to the Company until late March 2024, is unusual from a western perspective but appears to be proving not as uncommon in China for proceedings implicating western companies given the current geopolitical climate.The Company affirms that it has the necessary resources - both financial and personnel - to remedy its default in meeting the filing requirement. At present, the Company expects to file its Required Documents no later than May 31, 2024. Additionally, Management inquired of the British Columbia Securities Commission regarding the possibility of filing for a Management Cease Trade Order (""MCTO""), pursuant to National Policy 12-203, but was informed that it was not possible this close to the filing deadline. While, accordingly, the Company will not be granted an MCTO, and that a Cease Trade Order is anticipated to issue in respect of the Company's default, the Company nevertheless affirms that management and other insiders are subject to a trading black-out policy of the Company that reflects the principles in section 9 of National Policy 11-207.The Company further affirms that it intends to satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines set out in National Policy 12-203 so long as it remains in default of its obligation to file the Required Documents. The Company affirms that there are no insolvency proceedings against it as of the date of this news release. The Company also affirms that there have been no material business developments that have not been generally disclosed since the date of the Company's most recent filing of its interim financial reports.The Company is fully prepared to facilitate the completion of the audit and looks forward to working closely with its auditor to remedy the Company's default by filing the Required Documents as soon as they are ready.For further information, please contact:Simon Springett, Investor RelationsPhone: +1 (604) 285-2602 ext. 101Fax: +1 (604) 285-2606Email: ir@glglifetech.comAbout GLG Life Tech CorporationGLG Life Tech Corporation is a global leader in the supply of high-purity zero calorie natural sweeteners including stevia and monk fruit extracts used in food, beverages, and dietary supplements.

(GOEV) reported a 45% or $184.2 million annual adjusted EBITDA improvement in 2023, securing a USPS agreement, reducing capital expenditures by 40%, and appointing new board members. The company also acquired manufacturing assets at discounts, designated its Oklahoma City facility as a Foreign Trade Zone, and unveiled the American Bulldog vehicle. Financially, Canoo saw a GAAP net loss decrease, adjusted EBITDA improvement, and significant cash flow changes. Positive 45% or $184.2 million annual adjusted EBITDA improvement in 2023 Secured USPS agreement for LDV 190s Reduced capital expenditures by 40% Appointed new board members Deborah Diaz and James Chen Acquired manufacturing assets at discounts Designated Oklahoma City facility as a Foreign Trade Zone Unveiled the American Bulldog vehicle Decrease in GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss Improved adjusted EBITDA performance Significant changes in cash flow Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported improvement in Annual Adjusted EBITDA from a loss of $408.6 million in 2022 to a loss of $224.4 million in 2023 indicates a significant reduction in operational losses for Canoo Inc. This nearly 45% improvement reflects a potential stabilization of the company's financial health and could signal to investors that the management's cost control measures and strategic initiatives are yielding tangible results.Furthermore, the 40% reduction in capital expenditures compared to the second-half guidance of 2023 suggests a more disciplined capital allocation. This is reinforced by the acquisition of advanced manufacturing assets at a discount, which is expected to reduce future capital expenditures by approximately 34%. The designation of the Oklahoma City Manufacturing Facility as a Foreign Trade Zone could offer competitive advantages, including vehicle cost savings and duty deferrals, which might enhance Canoo's profitability in the mid-term.However, it is important to note the GAAP net loss of $302.6 million for the fiscal year, which, despite being an improvement from the previous year's loss of $487.7 million, still indicates that the company is far from achieving profitability. The projected annual revenue of $50 million to $100 million for 2024 against quarterly cash outflows of $45 million to $75 million suggests that Canoo will likely continue to burn through cash in the near term, raising concerns about its sustainability and the need for additional financing. Automotive Industry Analyst The announcement of Canoo's first commercial fleet customer deliveries is a critical milestone, indicating the transition from a development-stage company to one that has begun commercial operations. This is particularly relevant in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, where the ability to scale production and deliver vehicles is a significant challenge. The 20,000 unit run-rate production target at the Oklahoma City facility is an ambitious goal that, if met, could position Canoo as a notable player in the EV space.Canoo's strategy of acquiring distressed assets could be a shrewd move to leverage existing manufacturing capabilities at a lower cost, potentially allowing for a more agile response to market demands and reducing the time to scale production. The appointment of industry veterans Deborah Diaz and James Chen to the Board of Directors may also bring valuable experience and guidance as the company navigates the complexities of the automotive industry.However, the EV market is highly competitive, with larger players having more established supply chains and customer bases. Canoo's ability to secure a USPS agreement and deliver vehicles to notable customers like the State of Oklahoma showcases its potential, but it remains to be seen how the company will perform in a crowded market and whether it can sustain and grow its customer base. Market Research Analyst The commercial EV sector is rapidly expanding, with increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions. Canoo's entry into this market, highlighted by its recent customer deliveries, positions it within a growth sector that could offer significant opportunities. The unveiling of the American Bulldog and the accumulation of approximately 20,000 miles of cumulative testing underscore the company's commitment to product development and customer experience.Canoo's focus on harmonizing its supply chain to align with manufacturing goals is a important aspect of maintaining operational efficiency and ensuring the reliability of vehicle production. The creation of over 100 jobs in Oklahoma also suggests a positive impact on the local economy and the potential for further job creation as the company scales.Investors may be interested in the company's strategic investments from foreign strategic institutional investors, which could provide not only capital but also potential strategic partnerships. However, the reliance on future incentives and the lack of guidance on capital expenditures for the upcoming quarters may introduce uncertainty regarding the company's financial trajectory. 04/01/2024 - 06:37 PM 45% or $184.2 million Annual Adjusted EBITDA Improvement from $(408.6) million in 2022 to $(224.4) million in 202340% or $11.9 million Reduction in Capital Expenditures versus already reduced 2023 Second-Half GuidanceSecured USPS Agreement to Purchase Right Hand Drive LDV 190sStarted Commercial Fleet Customer DeliveriesAcquired Advanced Manufacturing Assets at Deep Discounts Reducing Anticipated Capital Expenditures by ~34%Oklahoma City Manufacturing Facility Designated as Foreign Trade Zone (“FTZ”) Opening International Expansion and Delivers up to $70.0 million in Estimated Vehicle Cost Savings and Duty Deferrals in 2024 and 2025Appointed Former NASA Chief Technology Officer Deborah Diaz and Veteran EV Transportation Leader James Chen to Board of Directors JUSTIN, Texas, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canoo Inc.

""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC.

Ocugen Announces Positive Data and Safety Monitoring Board Review and Initiation of Enrollment in Medium Dose for OCU410ST—a Modifier Gene Therapy—in GARDian Study for Stargardt Disease,2024-04-01T22:08:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Ocugen, Inc. announces that the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) has approved proceeding with the medium dose of OCU410ST in the OCU410ST clinical trial for Stargardt disease.

The favorable safety and tolerability profile of OCU410ST allows for evaluation of higher doses, addressing the unmet medical need for Stargardt patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The DSMB's approval for Ocugen to proceed with the medium dose of OCU410ST is a positive development in the clinical trial process. It indicates that the initial low dose was well-tolerated by patients, which is a key consideration in escalating doses within such trials. This step is significant as it suggests the potential for OCU410ST to progress through the clinical stages, which could eventually lead to a marketable treatment for Stargardt disease. From a research perspective, the lack of reported serious adverse events (SAEs) is a promising sign of the drug's safety profile at this stage. However, it is important to note that the sample size is still very small and safety and efficacy must be demonstrated in larger, more diverse populations before any conclusions can be drawn. The interim safety data expected in the second quarter will be critical in evaluating the viability of OCU410ST and its market potential. Stargardt disease, being an orphan disease, represents a niche market with a relatively small patient population. Nonetheless, the absence of FDA-approved therapies for Stargardt disease underscores the high unmet medical need, which can justify the investment in the drug's development despite the smaller market size. If successful, OCU410ST could become a first-in-class therapy, potentially allowing Ocugen to set a premium price for the drug. Financial Analyst Investors often monitor clinical trial updates closely, as they can significantly impact a biotech company's stock price. The progression to the medium dose cohort in the OCU410ST trial is likely to be viewed favorably by the market, given that it reflects confidence in the drug's safety profile at the previous lower dose. This news could potentially lead to an uptick in Ocugen's stock as investors anticipate positive outcomes from future trial phases. However, it's important to balance optimism with caution, as the costs associated with advancing clinical trials are substantial and the company will likely incur increasing expenses as it moves through Phase 2 and potentially into further stages. Investors should also consider the risk of dilution if Ocugen requires additional capital to fund its operations and research. The potential for strategic partnerships or licensing deals may also come into play as the drug progresses, which could offset some of the financial risks. Given that Ocugen's pipeline success is critical for its financial health, the outcome of the OCU410ST trial could have a long-term strategic impact on the company's growth and position in the market for treatments for inherited retinal diseases. Biotechnology Market Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly competitive, with many companies vying for a share of the market in rare and orphan diseases. Ocugen's advancement in the OCU410ST trial positions it as a potential key player in the space for Stargardt disease treatments. The company's strategy to focus on an unmet medical need could pay off by securing a first-mover advantage in this area. Market dynamics in the biotech sector are influenced by such clinical trial milestones and Ocugen's announcement may attract attention from larger pharmaceutical companies interested in expanding their portfolios in rare diseases. This could lead to potential acquisition interest or collaboration opportunities, which are common exit strategies for smaller biotech firms. For patients and healthcare providers, the development of OCU410ST is significant. A successful treatment option for Stargardt disease would not only provide clinical benefits but could also reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with managing the disease's progression. This aspect could be a compelling factor for insurance companies and healthcare systems when considering the adoption and coverage of new therapies. 04/01/2024 - 06:08 PM Established Low Dose as Safe and Tolerable Dose in Current OCU410ST Clinical TrialDSMB Determination to Proceed with Medium Dose Cohort Dosing MALVERN, Pa., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocugen, Inc. (Ocugen or the Company) (NASDAQ: OCGN), a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies and vaccines, today announced that the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the OCU410ST clinical trial recently convened and approved to proceed dosing with the medium dose of OCU410ST in the dose-escalation phase of the study. Three patients with Stargardt disease were dosed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to date. An additional three patients will be dosed with the medium dose (Cohort 2) and three patients with the high dose (Cohort 3) of OCU410ST in the dose-escalation phase. “The DSMB has recommended moving forward to medium dose for dosing subjects with Stargardt disease,” said Dr. Peter Chang, MD, FACS, DSMB Chair for the OCU410ST clinical trial. “No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to OCU410ST have been reported to date. I believe that this marks a critical next step towards determining the optimal dosing regimen for OCU410ST.” “We are pleased to see the continued favorable safety and tolerability profile exhibited by OCU410ST, allowing us to evaluate a higher dose in patients with Stargardt retinal dystrophy,” said Huma Qamar, M.D., MPH, Chief Medical Officer of Ocugen. “We recognize the high unmet medical need for Stargardt patients, as there are no current FDA-approved therapies for the indication, and we look forward to sharing the interim safety data from our Phase 1 trial in the second quarter of 2024.” The GARDian clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of unilateral subretinal administration of OCU410ST in subjects with Stargardt disease and will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 is a multicenter, open-label, dose ranging study consisting of three dose levels [low dose (3.75×1010 vg/mL), medium dose (7.5×1010 vg/mL), and high dose (2.25×1011 vg/mL)]. Phase 2 is a randomized, outcome accessor-blinded, dose-expansion study in which adult and pediatric subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either one of two OCU410ST dose groups or to an untreated. The Company will continue to provide clinical updates. Ocugen is committed to finding solutions for people with inherited retinal disease for whom no effective treatment options exist. While an orphan disease, Stargardt affects approximately 40,000 people in the United States alone. About Stargardt Disease Stargardt disease is a genetic eye disorder that causes retinal degeneration and vision loss. Stargardt disease is the most common form of inherited macular degeneration. The progressive vision loss associated with Stargardt disease is caused by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the central portion of the retina called the macula. Decreased central vision due to loss of photoreceptors in the macula is the hallmark of Stargardt disease. Some peripheral vision is usually preserved. Stargardt disease typically develops during childhood or adolescence, but the age of onset and rate of progression can vary. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a layer of cells supporting photoreceptors, is also affected in people with Stargardt disease. About OCU410ST OCU410ST utilizes an AAV delivery platform for the retinal delivery of the RORA (RAR Related Orphan Receptor A) gene. It represents Ocugen’s modifier gene therapy approach, which is based on Nuclear Hormone Receptor (NHR) RORA that regulates pathway links to Stargardt disease such as lipofuscin formation, oxidative stress, compliment formation, inflammation, and cell survival networks. About Ocugen, Inc.Ocugen, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies and vaccines that improve health and offer hope for patients across the globe. We are making an impact on patient’s lives through courageous innovation—forging new scientific paths that harness our unique intellectual and human capital.

The decrease in revenue was due to fewer activations within the company's Mobile Services segment as a result of reduced government subsidized revenues, as well the company's change in strategy in late 2022.Gross profit of $3.4 million compared to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.GAAP net loss of $(3.9) million, or $(0.09) per diluted share, compared to $(3.0) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2022.Non-GAAP net loss of $(2.9) million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(1.8) million, or $(0.04) per diluted share, in the year ended December 31, 2022.Cash and cash equivalents of $777,000 compared to $2.1 million as of December 31, 2022.Quarterly Financial Highlights (Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2022)Revenue of $4.9 million, an increase of 2.3% compared to $4.8 million. This increase was directly related to an expansion of our mobile subsidized services.Gross profit was $334,000, or 6.8% gross profit margin, compared to $2.0 million, or 41.5% gross profit margin. The decline in gross profit was directly related to reduced subsidized mobile activations in Q4-2022 triggering substantially lower customer acquisition costs (booked at time of sale) compared to increased activations in Q4-2023 triggering higher customer acquisition costs (booked at time of sale).Total operating expenses were $1.8 million, down 8.1%, compared to $1.9 million. This decrease was primarily due to a slight reduction in operational personnel.GAAP net loss was $(1.7) million, or $(0.04) per diluted share compared to $(84,000), or $(0.00) per diluted share. The loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was impacted by reduced subsidized mobile activations in Q4-2022 triggering substantially lower customer acquisition costs (booked at time of sale) compared to increased activations in Q4-2023 triggering higher customer acquisition costs (booked at time of sale).Non-GAAP net loss was $(1.2) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to Non-GAAP net income of $237,000, or $0.01 per diluted share.Sean McEwen, Chairman and CEO of KonaTel stated, ""At the end of 2022, we initiated our strategy and began geographically emphasizing sales of our government-subsidized mobile service where the product mix yielded higher reimbursement products and services. While this action resulted in transitional elements and more challenging year-over-year comparisons in 2023, we have stabilized our distribution efforts and since the end of 2023 substantially improved our balance sheet. All these items combined will position the company for growth in 2024.""McEwen continued, ""Going forward, our focus is two-fold. First, we are taking steps to continue to grow our government-subsidized mobile business in higher margin lines of our target markets by establishing partnerships that reduce the need for additional capital and offering unique services. As one of only a few Eligible Telecommunications Carriers (‘ETC') with a national license approved to offer state-subsidized Lifeline in California, we are being more aggressive in offering our product in that state. California is unique in that it provides significant state lifeline benefits on top of the federal benefits. In addition, we are also focused on selling government-subsidized mobile products in states with substantial tribal land coverage, such as Oklahoma, where government subsidies are higher. Since Lifeline is a fully funded program through the FCC's Universal Service Access fund, we can continue to grow that underserved market while the ACP program finalizes its definitive funding source. Additionally, we added eight new states (AL, CO, MI, MO, RI, TN, WV, WY) to our current Lifeline license portfolio in the first quarter of 2024, for a total of 19 states with additional states pending.""McEwen continued, ""Second, as part of a long-term revenue diversification strategy, we are aggressively implementing initiatives to grow our hosted CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) business. In the third quarter, our wholly-owned CPaaS subsidiary, Apeiron, entered into a five-year agreement with Viva-US Telecommunications, Inc. (‘Viva-US'), as the exclusive supplier of wholesale cellular voice & data, messaging, international call termination, smart SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) and other telecommunications services. Viva-US is a new U.S. Mobile Virtual Network Operator (‘MVNO') and part of the Balesia Technologies group of companies currently supporting over three million cellular customers in central and South America. Viva expects to begin on-boarding customers soon, which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue for KonaTel. In addition to our new Viva partnership, we entered into an annual wholesale agreement with Altigen (OTC: ATGN) to provide advanced voice and messaging services in support of the Altigen network. Apeiron has been expanding its CPaaS software platform to include a variety of additional services, and we have added highly experienced sales capability aimed at growing wholesale and enterprise accounts in the IoT (Internet of Things), LTE and 5G data services, copper replacement services, international and domestic voice services and SMS services product arenas.""About KonaTelKonaTel provides a variety of retail and wholesale telecommunications services including mobile voice/text/data service supported by national U.S. mobile networks, mobile numbers, SMS/MMS services, IoT mobile data service, and a range of hosted cloud services.

The company also seeks rate reductions for natural gas costs and income tax credits for customers, with an overall revenue increase of 11.7%. Positive None. Negative None. 04/01/2024 - 05:19 PM Company seeks recovery of investments in system reliability and improvements to support new and existing customersRequest includes rate reductions for natural gas costs and income tax payment credits passed to customersCHARLOTTE, N.C., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Following significant infrastructure investments in recent years to support the ongoing reliability, safety and growth of its system, Piedmont Natural Gas today filed a request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission to raise its base rates. If approved, Piedmont's requested rate adjustment would become effective in November 2024. Piedmont seeks to recover its prudently incurred costs to comply with federal safety regulations, enhance the customer experience, build needed infrastructure and provide safe, reliable natural gas service to meet the energy demands of more than 810,000 customers in North Carolina. Piedmont also is requesting concurrent rate reductions for pass-through natural gas costs and to accelerate the flowback to customers of the remaining eligible balance of excess deferred income taxes, which will help mitigate the overall impact to customer bills. This request represents an overall 11.7% increase in the company's revenues over the first year that new rates are effective. An additional overall increase of about 0.8% would occur after the first year once the reduction for excess deferred income taxes expires. Piedmont requests periodic rate adjustments to reflect fluctuations in the market price of the natural gas it purchases for its customers. By law, Piedmont does not mark up the cost of natural gas and must pass through the actual cost on a dollar-for-dollar basis to customers. Market prices for wholesale natural gas are at the lowest point in more than a decade. This trend, if it continues, may enable Piedmont to seek further rate reductions for pass-through natural gas costs in the coming months. ""At Piedmont, we work hard every day to avoid increases to customer bills and to keep costs as low as possible,"" said Brian Weisker, senior vice president and president of Piedmont Natural Gas. ""The investments we've made to strengthen and enhance our natural gas delivery system help ensure we can meet rising demand for natural gas from new and existing customers while also protecting our customers from unplanned outages."" Piedmont serves six of North Carolina's 10 most populated cities. Its last general rate case proceeding in North Carolina was in 2021. ""Many of these investments were required for us to safely operate in our communities, but we know price increases for any reason can be challenging for some customers,"" Weisker said. ""Piedmont is here to help those customers by offering a variety of ways to manage their bills, including assistance programs, our Equal Payment Plan and energy-saving tips and tools."" Level out your bill with the Equal Payment Plan (EPP) programPiedmont's free EPP program helps customers manage their budgets by leveling out a customer's natural gas bills, allowing them to pay a predictable, equal monthly amount to help avoid billing surprises. Piedmont determines this payment by adding up a customer's annual natural gas usage and then dividing it into the same payment amount each month. Learn more here. Energy-saving tips and toolsPiedmont Natural Gas also offers a variety of energy-saving tips and tools to help customers and our communities identify ways to save money and energy all year long. These programs and tools help customers understand what factors are impacting their natural gas bills and emphasize specific actions they can take to prepare and reduce the impacts of higher usage.­­­­­­­­ Assistance for customers in needShare the Warmth provides funds to local agencies to assist families with their utility bills, no matter the source of energy they use. Contact information for approved assistance agencies across Piedmont's service area is available at piedmontng.com/ShareTheWarmth. The Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) provides assistance to pay for natural gas, electric and other energy sources customers use in their homes. Piedmont says anyone in need should apply for this and other newly available programs to see if they qualify. For more information, go to piedmontng.com/AssistancePrograms.

(NASDAQ: DJT), files a 10-K report revealing Digital World Acquisition Corp.'s (DWAC) financial results for 2023. TMTG has no debt and over $200 million in the bank, aiming to expand Truth Social as a free-speech platform. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The filing of a 10-K report by Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (TMTG) after its recent public listing is a significant event for investors and market observers. The report highlights the financial health of the company and its business combination partner, Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), for the year 2023. The disclosure that TMTG has no debt and a substantial cash reserve of over $200 million is noteworthy. This positions the company favorably in terms of financial stability and provides it with the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives.Furthermore, the statement about TMTG's intention to utilize its capital to expand and enhance the Truth Social platform indicates a strategic focus on product development and market penetration. Given the competitive nature of social media platforms, TMTG's financial resources could enable it to differentiate itself and potentially capture a larger user base. It's also indicative of a broader trend in the tech industry where companies aim to rapidly scale and innovate to maintain relevance in a fast-paced market. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the lack of debt and a strong cash position for TMTG could be interpreted as a solid foundation for future operations. This scenario can be particularly appealing to investors who are looking for companies with low leverage and the potential for strategic investments. However, it's essential to consider the company's revenue streams and profitability outlook when evaluating its long-term financial health. The success of TMTG will largely depend on its ability to monetize the Truth Social platform and generate sustainable revenue.Investors should also be aware of the risks associated with investing in a newly public company, particularly in the technology sector where competition is fierce. The company's ability to execute its business plans and adapt to changes in the social media landscape will be critical for its success. While the current financial position is promising, TMTG's future performance will be a key determinant of its impact on the stock market. Technology Industry Analyst The entrance of TMTG into the public market as a debt-free entity with a considerable cash reserve is an intriguing development in the social media and technology space. The company's focus on positioning Truth Social as a 'free-speech platform' taps into a particular market segment that feels underserved by existing platforms. This strategy could potentially lead to increased user engagement and market share, provided the platform can deliver on user experience and content moderation challenges.The technology sector is driven by innovation and user acquisition. TMTG's financial health, as reported, gives it the potential to invest in technology, talent and marketing efforts that are important for a social media platform's growth. However, the platform's long-term success will depend on its ability to attract a diverse user base, compete with established players and navigate the regulatory environment surrounding digital speech and content. 04/01/2024 - 06:00 PM SARASOTA, Fla., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- President Donald Trump created Truth Social to give the American people their voices back, and he has already turned the platform into yet another iconic American brand. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (“TMTG,” NASDAQ: DJT), operator of the Truth Social platform, filed a 10-K report today with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The report discloses, among other items, the financial results of its business combination partner, Digital World Acquisition Corp. (“DWAC”), for the year 2023. It is the first 10-K filed by TMTG since the company went public effective on March 26, 2024. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said, “We are excited to be operating as a public company and to have secured access to capital markets. Closing out the 2023 financials related to the merger, Truth Social today has no debt and over $200 million in the bank, opening numerous possibilities for expanding and enhancing our platform. We intend to take full advantage of these opportunities to make Truth Social the quintessential free-speech platform for the American people.” Eric Swider, former DWAC CEO and current TMTG Director, said, “DWAC overcame several challenges last year to consummate our merger with TMTG and emerge as a united, debt-free, publicly traded company. Looking toward the future, TMTG is poised to rapidly move our business plans forward.” About TMTG The mission of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is to end Big Tech's assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back.

ProMIS Neurosciences Announces Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Recent Highlights,2024-04-01T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"ProMIS Neurosciences Inc. announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update.

Neil Warma, Interim CEO, highlighted the progress made in transitioning to a clinical development company and emphasized the potential of PMN310 to benefit AD patients.","ProMIS Neurosciences Announces Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Recent Highlights Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary ProMIS Neurosciences Inc. announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. The company is nearing completion of the Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, with top-line data expected by mid-2024. Neil Warma, Interim CEO, highlighted the progress made in transitioning to a clinical development company and emphasized the potential of PMN310 to benefit AD patients. Positive None. Negative None. Biotechnology Analyst The announcement from ProMIS Neurosciences Inc. concerning their clinical-stage antibody therapeutic, PMN310, for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is significant for the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors, particularly those involved in neurodegenerative diseases. The progress into a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) study is pivotal, as it marks a transition from safety assessments to efficacy evaluations. The success of PMN310 could not only provide a new therapeutic option for AD, a condition with limited effective treatments, but also validate ProMIS's platform for other neurodegenerative diseases. Investors should monitor the upcoming data release for indications of safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, which will be critical for the continuation of the clinical program and could influence the company's stock performance.Considering the high failure rate of AD drug candidates in the past, the cautious optimism expressed by the interim CEO reflects a realistic perspective on the challenges ahead. The emphasis on cash management is also noteworthy, as it suggests a strategic approach to resource allocation, which is important in the high-risk biotech industry. The potential expansion into other neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and MSA indicates long-term planning and diversification of the company's portfolio, which could mitigate risk and contribute to future growth. Financial Analyst The fiscal results and clinical development milestones of ProMIS Neurosciences Inc. have direct implications for the company's financial health and investor confidence. The transition to a clinical development company signifies an increase in capital requirements for clinical trials, which typically leads to a more volatile stock as the market reacts to trial outcomes. Investors should anticipate fluctuations in the company's stock price leading up to and following the release of the top-line data mid-2024. Positive results could lead to a surge in stock value, while negative or inconclusive data could result in a decline.ProMIS's commitment to advancing PMN310 into a Phase 1b study is indicative of their confidence in the drug's potential. However, it's important to note that AD drug development has historically been fraught with challenges and the market may price in the associated risks. The company's fiscal discipline, as evidenced by their tight control on cash management, is reassuring to investors who are often concerned about the burn rate in biotech firms. This financial prudence, combined with strategic clinical milestones, can create a favorable investment narrative if executed well. Healthcare Industry Analyst Alzheimer's disease represents a substantial market opportunity due to the aging global population and the lack of curative therapies. ProMIS Neurosciences Inc.'s focus on PMN310 and its potential to alter the course of AD could have significant market implications. The specificity of PMN310 in targeting toxic misfolded proteins is a novel approach that, if successful, could differentiate it from other treatments and position the company as a leader in the space.The broader impact of PMN310's clinical trial results extends beyond ProMIS, as it could influence the direction of research and investment in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases. A positive outcome could catalyze increased funding and interest in the sector, while a negative result could have a chilling effect. The company's strategy to leverage its platform for multiple diseases is a smart move that could lead to multiple revenue streams and partnerships, further enhancing its business prospects and attractiveness to investors. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM Top-line data from first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease on track for mid-2024CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts and TORONTO, Ontario, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProMIS Neurosciences Inc. (Nasdaq: PMN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the generation and development of antibody therapeutics targeting toxic misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a corporate update. “I am pleased to have taken the helm of ProMIS at the beginning of 2024 and am proud of the meaningful progress the team has made to date as ProMIS made the transition to a clinical development company. Importantly, we are nearing the initial read out from our first-in-human studies of our lead product candidate, PMN310, as a potential treatment for AD,” stated Neil Warma, Interim Chief Executive Officer of ProMIS Neurosciences. “As previously noted, we are nearing completion of the Phase 1a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial of PMN310 in AD and remain on track to report top-line data midyear, which will include safety data and PMN310 exposure levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Moving forward, our goal is to advance PMN310 into a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in AD patients, which could provide the first proof-of-concept data demonstrating that PMN310 has the potential to positively benefit patients with AD. This is a very exciting opportunity for both ProMIS and the AD patients we aim to serve. In addition, it may have the potential to lead the way for us to advance our differentiated platform in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, MSA and Parkinson’s disease,” stated Mr. Warma. “We are diligently identifying ways to explore the potential application of our differentiated platform while not distracting our focus from our lead development program, PMN310, and our tight control on cash management. Specific to our pipeline candidates, we have and will continue to publish and present key data as each progresses and remain excited about the early data generated across a number of neurodegenerative diseases. We look forward to the ongoing development of our novel antibody therapies and to achieving a number of potentially value-creating milestones throughout the balance of the year.” Recent Highlights Alzheimer’s Disease Program (PMN310) PMN310, ProMIS’ lead compound, is a humanized IgG1 antibody directed against toxic amyloid beta oligomers (AβO) that are believed to be a major driver of AD. ProMIS dosed the first participants in a first-in-human Phase 1a clinical trial of PMN310 as a potential treatment for AD in November 2023 (Study NCT06105528). The Phase 1a clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PMN310 infusions in up to five cohorts of eight healthy volunteers. PMN310 exposure levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be evaluated as well as safety. The Company expects to report top-line data from the Phase 1a portion of the study in mid-2024, which will include safety data and exposure levels of antibodies in blood and CSF. Discovery Programs ProMIS continues to advance its amyloid beta vaccine program in AD based on its oligomer target epitope(s). In January 2024, ProMIS announced the selection of a lead vaccine candidate, PMN400, against multiple synucleinopathies including MSA, Parkinson’s disease and Lewy Body Dementia. Using a proprietary computational platform, ProMIS identified potential conformational epitopes (misfolded portions) unique to toxic alpha-synuclein involved in synucleinopathies. Formulations of several of these epitopes were tested in mouse vaccination studies leading to PMN400’s selection as a lead vaccine candidate for testing in mouse models replicating cognitive and motor deficits of human disease. In December 2023, ProMIS reported data identifying Receptor for Activated C-Kinase 1 (RACK1) as a novel misfolded protein target for the potential treatment of ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which data were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. Corporate In January 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Neil Warma as the interim Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Warma is a seasoned biotechnology executive with more than 25 years of leadership experience. Mr. Warma has served on the Company’s Board of Directors for the past two years and remains as a director.In March 2024, ProMIS added key U.S. and international patent allowances to further protect the Company’s monoclonal antibody therapeutic for the treatment of AD. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Cash and cash equivalents were $12.6 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $5.9 million as of December 31, 2022. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company raised $20.4 million in gross proceeds from a private investment in public equity financing, less $2.7 million of issuance costs.Research and development expenses were $7.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $16.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in direct and external research and development expenses as the Company focused on advancing its lead program, PMN310, which entered the clinic in November 2023.General and administrative expenses modestly decreased to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $7.3 million for the same period in 2022.Net loss was $13.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $18.1 million for full year in 2022.

(BBSI) partners with Kaiser Permanente to offer health plans to clients, enhancing its healthcare portfolio. The collaboration aims to provide top-quality healthcare services to businesses nationwide, showcasing BBSI's dedication to client satisfaction and well-being. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Management Analyst The strategic partnership between Barrett Business Services, Inc. (BBSI) and Kaiser Permanente represents a significant expansion in BBSI's healthcare offerings. By incorporating Kaiser's plans, BBSI is broadening the scope of health benefits available to its clients. This move could potentially increase client satisfaction and retention, as access to comprehensive health benefits is a key factor for businesses when choosing a management solutions provider. The partnership may also enhance BBSI's competitive edge in the market, as Kaiser Permanente is known for its high-quality healthcare services.From a financial perspective, the collaboration with Kaiser may lead to an uptick in BBSI's revenue stream if the added value translates into an increase in clientele or allows BBSI to command higher prices for its enhanced services. However, the costs associated with integrating Kaiser's plans into BBSI's portfolio and the terms of the partnership will also impact the overall financial outcome. It is essential for stakeholders to monitor how this partnership affects the company's profit margins and operational efficiency in the following quarters. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Kaiser Permanente plans by BBSI is a strategic move that taps into the growing demand for employer-sponsored health benefits. In an era where health and wellness are increasingly prioritized by employees, BBSI's decision to enhance its healthcare solutions could be a strong selling point. By aligning with a reputable healthcare provider, BBSI not only augments its service quality but also builds its brand as a company that values employee well-being.It is important to consider the broader industry context. If competitors are not offering similar quality partnerships, BBSI could seize a larger market share. Conversely, if the market is already saturated with such offerings, the impact may be less pronounced. The true measure of success will be BBSI's ability to convert this partnership into tangible business growth, measured through client acquisition rates and potential expansion into new markets. Health Insurance Analyst The collaboration between BBSI and Kaiser Permanente is indicative of the evolving landscape in healthcare and insurance. Employers are increasingly seeking to provide comprehensive health plans to attract and retain talent. BBSI's move to include Kaiser's plans is a response to this trend and may influence the expectations and offerings in the business management solutions sector.For BBSI's clients, the partnership could mean more diverse and potentially cost-effective healthcare options for their employees. The long-term implications could include improved employee health outcomes and productivity, which are indirect benefits that contribute to the overall value proposition of BBSI's services. However, the success of this initiative will largely depend on the execution and integration of the plans, as well as the ability of BBSI to communicate this added value to current and prospective clients. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM VANCOUVER, Wash., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrett Business Services, Inc.

Recognition of a reserve for credit losses related to a terminated credit agreement. Net loss of $25.0 million in FY 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by HCW Biologics Inc. reflect a company at a pivotal stage of its development. The initiation of Phase 2 clinical studies for HCW9218, particularly in ovarian and pancreatic cancer, signals a transition from early-stage research to more advanced trials that could determine the future commercial viability of the drug. The strategic focus on ovarian and pancreatic cancer, given the preliminary stable disease rates observed in the Phase 1 and 1b studies, is an attempt to capitalize on initial successes and aligns with the industry's approach to prioritize indications with the highest potential for clinical and commercial success. From a financial perspective, the private placement at a premium and the secured notes issuance indicate a level of confidence from insiders and other investors, which could be seen as a positive signal to the market. However, the net loss widening from $14.9 million to $25.0 million year-on-year, alongside a significant drop in revenues from $6.7 million to $2.8 million, raises concerns about the company's burn rate and the need for continued capital infusions. The reserve for credit losses of $5.3 million also highlights potential risks in the company's financial management and credit relationships. Investors would be wise to monitor the company's cash flow closely and consider the implications of these financial movements on the stock's performance. Medical Research Analyst The completion of Phase 1 and Phase 1b studies for HCW9218, with evidence of stable disease in a subset of patients, is an encouraging development in the oncology field. The transition to Phase 2 studies, particularly randomized trials, is a critical step in assessing the drug's efficacy and safety profile in a larger patient population. HCW Biologics' plan to explore the drug's potential in age-related diseases further broadens the therapeutic applications of HCW9218, potentially increasing its market potential. The mention of dermatological conditions like senile lentigo and deep wrinkles suggests a strategic move to address a broader range of age-associated diseases beyond cancer, which could be significant given the aging global population. However, the complexity of transitioning from monotherapy to combination therapy, as well as expanding into different indications, requires careful consideration of the scientific and regulatory hurdles ahead. Future registration trials will need to be designed meticulously to meet the FDA's stringent requirements for safety and efficacy. The company's patent portfolio development, particularly the awarding of fundamental patents, is a positive step, as it strengthens the intellectual property position and could provide a competitive edge in the market. Market Research Analyst HCW Biologics' strategic focus on specific cancer indications and age-related diseases could respond to unmet medical needs and tap into niche markets with high growth potential. The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and companies that successfully innovate and secure patent protection for their technologies can create significant value. The company's approach to opportunistically join studies with other investigators could facilitate the assessment of HCW9218 across more cancer indications, potentially expediting the drug's development timeline and enhancing its marketability. The market will likely react to the progression of HCW9218 through clinical trials, with investors closely watching for data readouts that could significantly impact the company's valuation. The mixed financial results, with stable revenues but increased net losses and R&D expenses, suggest that the company is still in an investment-heavy phase of its lifecycle. The market's response to these financials will depend on investor confidence in the company's ability to manage its capital effectively and deliver on its clinical promises. 04/01/2024 - 04:10 PM MIRAMAR, Fla., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HCW Biologics Inc. (the “Company” or “HCW Biologics”) (NASDAQ: HCWB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between inflammation and age-related diseases, today reported financial results and recent business highlights for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Dr. Hing C. Wong, Founder and CEO of HCW Biologics, stated, “These are exciting times at HCW Biologics. We achieved two major clinical milestones, with the completion of the Phase 1 clinical study to evaluate HCW9218 in solid tumors and the Phase 1b study to evaluate HCW9218 in pancreatic cancer. While it is still quite early in the clinical development process and we have only seen data when HCW9218 is administered as a monotherapy, we believe there are signs that HCW9218 provides clinical benefits to some patients who have previously failed multiple lines of standard-of-care therapies. We believe that HCW9218 shows the potential to be a first in class immunotherapeutic cancer treatment.” Dr. Wong continued, “Now we are on the verge of initiating multiple Phase 2 clinical studies, including randomized trials, to evaluate HCW9218 as a treatment in combination with standard-of-care therapies in patients with cancer. We intend to focus on ovarian and pancreatic cancer, and we hope to opportunistically join studies with investigators who want to add an arm to their study using HCW9218 in combination with their therapy. This approach could give us an opportunity to assess HCW9218 in more cancer indications that we believe will provide valuable data to inform us of the most appropriate indications and regimens for future registration trials.” “Another piece of exciting news for 2024 is that we are planning on the initiation of investigative studies for age-related diseases using HCW9218. We are planning on using the Recommended Phase 2 Dose level of HCW9218 identified in our two now completed Phase 1/1b cancer trials,” Dr. Wong added. “We believe age-associated dermatological conditions and diseases, such as senile lentigo and deep wrinkles, will be the first age-related indications we investigate beyond cancer.” Business Highlights The Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate HCW9218 in solid tumors and the Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate HCW9218 in pancreatic cancer were completed in February 2024. In the Phase 1 study, over 70% of patients with ovarian cancer (5/7) showed evidence of stable disease. In the Phase 1b study, 13% (2/15) of patients who participated in the study showed evidence of stable disease.The first Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate HCW9218 in patients with ovarian cancer will be sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. This fully randomized trial will have one arm of the study treating patients with HCW9218 with a neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The Company’s investment in its patent portfolio is beginning to result in new patent awards from the USPTO. Most importantly, among the patents the Company was awarded are the fundamental patents which protect the technology on which the Company’s lead molecules are based. On January 10, 2024, the Company terminated the credit agreement with Prime Capital Ventures, whereupon the Company was entitled to receive a refund of $5.3 million that was funded to establish an interest reserve account under the terms of the credit agreement. Due to the probability of default, the Company recognized a reserve for credit losses of $5.3 million as of December 31, 2023. However, the Company intends to pursue available remedies to recover these funds.On February 20, 2024, the Company completed a $2.5 million private placement of its common stock, at a price of $1.40 per share, which was a 25% premium over the market price on the closing date. Investors included certain officers and directors of the Company.As of March 31, 2024, the Company entered into legally binding agreements to issue $10.0 million of secured notes from investors, including certain of our officers and directors as well as other investors, $2.0 million of which was funded by the issuance date of the audited financial statements. Fourth Quarter 2023 and Year End Financial Results Revenues: Revenues for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $1.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $6.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively. Revenues were derived exclusively from the sale of licensed molecules to the Company’s licensee, Wugen. The licensed molecules are one of the inputs for manufacturing Wugen’s products. In 2023, revenues were negatively impacted by changes in Wugen’s clinical development program. In addition, Wugen suffered delays in ramping up its manufacturing process which also limited purchases of molecules licensed by the Company.Research and development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $2.9 million and $2.1 million, respectively. The $793,616 decrease, or 27%, resulted from a decline in manufacturing and materials expense. R&D expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $9.4 million and $7.7 million, respectively. The $1.7 million decrease, or 18%, resulted from a decline in expenses related to manufacturing and materials expense, preclinical expenses and performance-based bonuses. Manufacturing costs declined in 2023 because the Company had already made the necessary supplies of its lead molecules, HCW9218 and HCW9302, to fulfill the requirements for planned clinical development activities in 2024-2025. Preclinical costs in 2022 and 2023 are related to IND-enabling activities required to prepare an IND application to evaluate HCW9302 in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. A change in preclinical activities from 2022 to 2023 was the underlying reason for a decline in preclinical expenses. Setup costs were incurred for toxicology studies and other IND-enabling studies in 2022. Costs declined in 2023, as the Company was focused on additional research studies required for the Company’s IND submission.General and administrative (G&A) expenses: G&A expenses for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $3.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. The $628,910 increase, or 20%, was attributable to an increase in legal expenses related to the Altor/NantCell matter. G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $8.3 million and $13.3 million, respectively. The $5.0 million increase, or 60%, was attributable to an increase in legal expenses associated with the Company’s ongoing arbitration with Altor/NantCell. See further discussion of the Altor/NantCell arbitration in “Financial Guidance.”Reserve for Credit Losses. In the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a reserve for credit losses related to a $5.3 million interest reserve deposit established in connection with a credit agreement the Company terminated. While the Company is entitled to recover these funds, facts available as of December 31, 2023 indicate it is not probable.Net loss: Net loss for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $5.4 million and $10.7 million, respectively. Net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 was $14.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Financial Guidance As of December 31, 2023, there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Since that time, we had successful financings of $12.5 million, for which we received funds or have a legally binding commitment to so. And, we continue with other fundraising efforts that we are targeting to complete in the next three to six months. Under the guidance of Topic 205-40 for going concern assessment, we evaluated whether we mitigated the substantial doubt over our ability to remain a going concern for the next 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements. If no additional financings occur after the date of issuance, we believe the relevant conditions that brought about substantial doubt can be alleviated if we implement a plan that includes certain adjustments to our strategic and operating plans, such as cutting back on the number of investigative studies and Phase 2 clinical trials we initiate; reducing salaries and other spending, and limiting the amount of cash used to reduce accounts payable, as well as other adjustments to alleviate substantial doubt. On December 23, 2022, Claimants Altor and NantCell (“Altor/NantCell”) filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the “Court”), alleging claims of misappropriation of trade secrets, tortious interference with contractual relations, inducement of breach of fiduciary duty, and specific performance/injunction for assignment of patents and patent applications, among other claims. That same day, Altor/NantCell also initiated an arbitration against the Company’s CEO and Founder, Dr. Wong, based on early identical allegations and alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraudulent concealment, among other claims. The Company moved to compel arbitration and the parties ultimately stipulated to the same. On April 27, 2023, in connection with the Altor/NantCell matter, the Court approved the parties’ stipulation and ordered the parties to arbitration. On May 1, 2023, Altor/NantCell filed a demand against the Company before JAMS. On May 3, 2023, Altor/NantCell dismissed the federal court action without prejudice and the Court ordered the case dismissed without prejudice and closed the case. Altor/NantCell’s proceeding against the Company is now proceeding in arbitration before JAMS, with an arbitration hearing scheduled for May 20, 2024. In addition, on March 26, 2024, Altor/NantCell gave notice that they are filing a complaint (the “Complaint”) against the Company in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for the contribution of legal fees and expenses advanced to Dr. Wong in connection with the arbitration discussed above. Prior to the filing of the Complaint, Altor/NantCell had previously sought advancement from the Company and the Company agreed to advance 50% of Dr. Wong’s legal fees going forward from December 2023. On January 8, 2024, Altor/NantCell reserved their right to pursue contribution against the Company for 50% of the amount Altor/NantCell sent for advancement of expenses for Dr. Wong. In the Complaint, Altor/NantCell seek 50% of the fees they have already advanced to Dr. Wong, a declaration that the Company has an obligation to contribute 50% of the advancement of Dr. Wong’s expenses including 50% of Dr. Wong’s expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration through final resolution of the matter, and costs and fees in bringing this action. Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in arbitration, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated therewith at this time. As such, no accrual for these matters has been recorded within the Company’s financial statements. The Company incurred significant legal expenses in connection with this matter in the period ended December 31, 2023, and expects to continue to incur material costs and expenses in the first half of 2024. About HCW Biologics: HCW Biologics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel immunotherapies to lengthen healthspan by disrupting the link between chronic, low-grade inflammation, and age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, as well as other conditions such as long-haul COVID-19.

The offer is conditional on AMD's stock price exceeding $200.00 per share. AMD does not recommend the offer due to various conditions and financing requirements by Tutanota. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The attempt by Tutanota LLC to acquire a portion of AMD's shares via a 'mini-tender' offer is an interesting maneuver that warrants a closer look from a market dynamics perspective. Mini-tender offers are not uncommon, but they typically target a very small percentage of a company's shares and are not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as larger tender offers. The strategy here seems to be to acquire shares at a potentially lower price than the market value, which could be appealing to shareholders if they are not fully aware of the current market price or if they believe the stock's value will not rise above the offer price.However, the condition that the closing price of AMD's stock must exceed the offer price before the deal can go through is quite unusual and adds a layer of complexity to the transaction. This condition could potentially discourage shareholders from participating, as it implies they would be selling their shares for less than the market value. On the other hand, Tutanota's ability to extend the offer if the condition is not met could be seen as a way to wait for market fluctuations that could benefit their position. This strategy, while legal, often raises concerns among investors and the targeted company, as evidenced by AMD's recommendation against the offer.Investors should be aware of the potential implications of such offers on stock liquidity and price. If a significant number of shares are tendered, it could potentially influence the stock's market price. However, given the small percentage of shares targeted by this mini-tender offer, the impact on AMD's stock may be minimal. It's important for shareholders to stay informed and consult with financial advisors before making decisions based on mini-tender offers. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the mini-tender offer by Tutanota LLC for AMD shares is a strategic play that could have implications for both the offering party and AMD's shareholders. The offer price being set at $200.00 per share pegged to a condition where the market price must exceed the offer price is not only unusual but also potentially disadvantageous for shareholders who might tender their shares without realizing they are doing so at a suboptimal price.Furthermore, the fact that Tutanota is seeking financing for the offer adds another layer of uncertainty. There is no guarantee that the financing will be secured, which means there is a risk that the offer could fall through. Shareholders need to consider this risk when deciding whether to tender their shares. The extension periods mentioned in the offer could result in a delay in payment, which is another factor that shareholders need to weigh against the potential opportunity cost of holding onto their shares or selling them in the open market.AMD's stance of not endorsing the offer is also telling. It indicates that the company does not see this offer as being in the best interest of its shareholders. This is a critical piece of information for shareholders to consider, especially in light of AMD's dissociation from the offer and the advisory issued by the SEC about the nature of mini-tender offers.Overall, while the offer may not have a significant impact on AMD's share price or market performance due to the small percentage of shares involved, it does highlight the need for shareholder vigilance and the importance of understanding the terms and conditions of any tender offer before participating. Legal Expert In the context of securities law, this mini-tender offer by Tutanota LLC presents several legal considerations for AMD and its shareholders. Mini-tender offers are a way for investors to attempt to acquire a stake in a company without triggering the regulatory requirements that come with larger tender offers. The SEC has issued warnings about these types of offers because they can potentially mislead investors into selling their shares at below-market prices.AMD's decision to issue a statement advising shareholders against the offer is a protective measure, likely intended to ensure that its investors are making informed decisions. Shareholders who have already tendered their shares have the right to withdraw, which is an important legal protection. AMD's request to include this news release with all distributions of materials related to Tutanota’s offer is another step towards ensuring transparency and protecting shareholder interests.The legal intricacies of the offer, such as the conditions set forth by Tutanota and the potential for extension, make it important for shareholders to have a clear understanding of their rights and the implications of the offer. It is advisable for investors to consult with their legal or financial advisors to fully grasp the nuances of this mini-tender offer and its potential consequences. 04/01/2024 - 04:15 PM SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) was notified on March 27, 2024 of an unsolicited ""mini-tender"" offer by Tutanota LLC (“Tutanota”). Pursuant to the offer, which is dated March 18, 2024, Tutanota is offering to purchase up to 150,000 shares of AMD common stock at $200.00 per share, which represents approximately 0.009283% of AMD’s outstanding shares. The offer price of $200.00 per share is conditioned on, among other things, the closing price per share of AMD common stock exceeding $200.00 per share on the last trading day before the offer expires. This means that unless this condition is waived by Tutanota, AMD stockholders who tender shares in the offer will receive a below-market price. Tutanota can extend the offer for successive periods of 45 to 180 days until the market price of AMD common stock exceeds the offer price, in which case payment would be delayed beyond the scheduled expiration date of Friday, April 19, 2024. AMD does not in any way recommend or endorse the Tutanota offer because the offer requires that the closing price for AMD common stock exceed the offer price, and the offer price is subject to numerous additional conditions, including Tutanota obtaining financing for the offer. There is no guarantee the conditions of the offer will be satisfied. AMD is in no way associated with Tutanota, the ""mini-tender"" offer or the offer documentation.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net loss of $0.2 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily due to an increase in insurance benefits and losses incurred partially offset by an increase in unrealized gains in equity securities. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in earned premiums, as well as an increase in insurance benefits and losses as a percentage of premiums. Also contributing to the decrease in net income is an increase in debt service costs due to rising interest rates. Partially offsetting this decrease was a decline in unrealized losses on equity securities. Operating income (loss), as defined below, decreased to a $4.3 million operating loss in the three month period ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $3.5 million operating income for the three month period ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported operating income of $1.5 million compared to operating income of $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in operating income for the three and twelve month periods was primarily due to an increase in insurance benefits and losses incurred as a percentage of premiums. Commenting on the results, Hilton H. Howell, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “The Company has made significant investments in both human talent and information technology within our Life and Health segment that we expect will lead to improved top line results and profitability of our business. While we have experienced some inflationary pressures in our Property and Casualty segment, their disciplined underwriting approach delivered another profitable year. In recognition of our enthusiasm for 2024, the Board of Directors recently approved the Company’s annual dividend of $0.02 per share, which is payable on April 26, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 12, 2024.” Atlantic American Corporation is an insurance holding company involved through its subsidiary companies in specialty markets of the life, health, and property and casualty insurance industries. Its principal insurance subsidiaries are American Southern Insurance Company, American Safety Insurance Company, Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company, Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company and Atlantic Capital Life Assurance Company. Note regarding non-GAAP financial measure: Atlantic American Corporation presents its consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, from time to time, the Company may present, in its public statements, press releases and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, non-GAAP financial measures such as operating income (loss). We define operating income (loss) as net income (loss) excluding: (i) income tax expense (benefit); (ii) realized investment gains, net; and (iii) unrealized (gains) losses on equity securities, net. Management believes operating income (loss) is a useful metric for investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others because it isolates the “core” operating results of the Company before considering certain items that are either beyond the control of management (such as income tax expense (benefit), which is subject to timing, regulatory and rate changes depending on the timing of the associated revenues and expenses) or are not expected to regularly impact the Company’s operating results (such as any realized and unrealized investment gains (losses), which are not a part of the Company’s primary operations and are, to a limited extent, subject to discretion in terms of timing of realization). The financial data attached includes a reconciliation of operating income (loss) to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company’s definition of operating income (loss) may differ from similarly titled financial measures used by others. This non-GAAP financial measure should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Note regarding forward-looking statements: Except for historical information contained herein, this press release contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors and risks, including the Company’s ability to remediate the identified material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as described in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and those other risks and uncertainties detailed in statements and reports that the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

In Q4 2023, Adjusted EBITDA improved by $0.5 million from a loss of $0.4 million in Q4 2022 to positive $0.2 million. The following table is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods presented. Quarterly Revenue Historical GrowthThe chart below shows revenue for the past thirty quarters (7.5 years). Quarterly revenue increased as a result of continued addition of new customers, expanded use of CIM by existing customers and augmented by the acquisition of IM Operations' customers acquired June 30, 2022. Management's objective is to continue to increase revenues to drive cash flow and profitability which we believe will increase future Company value for shareholders. Fiscal 2023 Operational UpdateThe Company's customer relationships continued to strengthen, supporting Management's beliefs that customer retention is expected to remain near 100% and its current and new software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") products under development will continue to be adopted by existing and new customers.The Cognitive Integrity Management (""CIM"") SaaS platform is currently being used as the primary integrity management solution for oil and gas (""O&G"") pipeline companies who collectively operate approximately 20% of the piggable pipeline infrastructure in the U.S.A. Management believes that use of the Company's solutions for the balance of non-piggable pipelines that are currently managed using legacy systems and processes represents significant future opportunity for the Company.The Company's CIM platform includes core CIM and various functionality modules that integrate with CIM, including Internal Corrosion Management (""ICM""), External Corrosion Management (""ECM""), Crack Management (""CM""), Probabilistic Risk Management (""RM"") and Geohazard Strain Management (""GS""). Management's optimism for the business is bolstered by expressions of interest from customers and from the formalized steering committee initiated at the October 2023 CIM user group event, comprised of senior industry personnel whose roles generally direct integrity management functions and control the associated budgets.The Company invested resources in Fiscal 2023 to advance marketing, sales and product development initiatives, with a view to enhance its competitive moat and maintain its global technology lead by leveraging cloud computing, data science and machine learning to assist O&G pipeline operators to mitigate failure threats and reduce operating costs.The Company attended several key O&G industry tradeshow and exhibition events during Fiscal 2023, participated in industry educational events wherein Company personnel presented white paper research learnings and hosted its first annual User Group Conference, in collaboration with the Microsoft team that focuses on O&G customers. OneBridge benefits from being a Microsoft ""managed partner"" whose O&G sales team members participate in joint sales efforts to pursue sales opportunities involving the Company's solutions that operate on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.Use of the CIM platform by customers increased essentially in accordance with Management's expectations during Fiscal 2023, with higher pipeline miles operated by customers and miles under SaaS subscriptions driving revenue. OneBridge onboarded five additional pipeline operators during Fiscal 2023, who became new CIM users due to direct sales efforts or after being acquired by existing CIM customers. Some customers expanded their use of the CIM platform to include ICM and other new functionality modules, a trend we believe will generate recurring revenue in future periods.The Company's development team had a highly productive year in 2023, having released 6 major CIM platform updates, evolved the ICM, ECM, CM, RM and GS functionality modules and advanced various data science and machine learning projects. This team also addressed 221 User Stories, 180 Bugs and 2,496 commitments for customers and upgraded the CIM platform to .NET 6 status. Development staff trained in new Microsoft technologies and systems during Fiscal 2023 and this, together with our new customer additions, resulted in the Company earning the Microsoft Solutions Partner designation for ""Digital and App Innovation (Azure)"". This provides the Company access to accelerated support and discounted or free internal user rights for a wide swath of Microsoft products.The Company's client services team addressed 17 projects during Fiscal 2023, primarily involving 6 clients and 5 core CIM platform implementations, collectively involving 15 divisional operators and more than 700 pipeline systems. Projects included work associated with integrity management and compliance, geographic information system (""GIS"") integrations, loading of more than 3,700 ILI assessments and 67 million anomalies into CIM, migrating data from legacy systems into CIM, integrating with various customer software applications and training.The following table estimates the aggregate pipeline miles operated by all customers, miles of customers' pipeline assets that are subject to multi-year SaaS agreements and miles of pipeline data ingested into our CIM platform, for which revenue was earned (""data-miles"") in Fiscal 2023. Please refer to the MD&A for more information regarding data-mile. 1: The revenue per mile (Cdn $) for revenue generating miles includes CIM revenue only and excludes IM Operations revenue.The Company published its Fiscal 2024 financial guidance on February 20,2024.FISCAL 2024 outlookFiscal 2023 was a pivotal year for OneSoft, with the Company achieving its key objectives of: (a) exceeding $10 million revenue; (b) achieving near zero Adjusted EBITDA for the year; and (c) gaining more traction to become the next generation data management and analytics platform for the O&G pipeline industry. Management believes the Company has securely crossed the new technology adoption chasm wherein its technology and solutions have been strongly validated by industry innovators and visionary early adopters. The Company's 2024 objectives include completing the new functionality modules currently under development, integrating them into the CIM platform and advancing its role as the sole SaaS vendor to fulfill customers' functionality requirements regarding data management and analytics. Recent new customer acquisitions confirm that the Company has successfully progressed to attract pragmatic customers, who are generally more conservative in their adoption of new technology and represent the majority of opportunities in the marketplace.We reiterate our Fiscal 2024 revenue guidance of $15 million to $16 million, as published in our February 20, 2024 news release, representing a 44% to 54% increase, respectively, over Fiscal 2023 revenue. Most of 2024 revenue is expected to come from increased use of our SaaS solutions due to existing and new customers onboarding more pipeline miles and commercialization of some of the new modules that are under development. The Company intends to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new customers in South America and Europe in 2024, as well as seek relationships with industry partners who can assist us to broaden the adoption of our solutions world-wide. The Company is also investigating alternatives to accelerate revenue growth and business development, potentially through synergistic M&A activities. Management is optimistic that OneSoft is well positioned to capitalize on its first mover technology advantage to deliver enhanced benefits to customers and increase value for shareholders.Given the current business and operational plans for fiscal 2024, management does not anticipate raising additional capital to execute its current business plan.WEBCAST: FISCAL 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS CONFERENCE CALL: When:APRIL 2, 2024 9:00 AM Mountain TimeWebcast URL:https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/3031/50264Participant Numbers:Toll Free: 888-506-0062International: 973-528-0011Participant Access Code: 564316Participants will be greeted by an operator and asked for the access code.

The company's cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities stood at $100.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Zomedica reported a net loss of $34.5 million for 2023, with increased operating expenses and research costs. Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA loss for 2023 was $12.8 million. Negative Increased operating expenses and research costs led to a net loss of $34.5 million for Zomedica in 2023. Zomedica's Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA loss for 2023 was $12.8 million. The company's net loss per share for 2023 was $0.035, compared to $0.017 per share in 2022. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Zomedica demonstrate a robust revenue growth of 33% year-over-year, driven by the adoption of new products and a solid performance in the Diagnostics and Therapeutic Devices segments. The company's focus on expanding its product portfolio and manufacturing capabilities has translated into a significant increase in consumable and capital revenue. A financial analyst would highlight the impressive gross margin of 69%, which is above the industry average for medical device companies, typically ranging between 50-70%. This indicates strong pricing power and cost management despite the growth phase of the company.However, the increase in operating expenses by 38% and research and development costs by 123% reflect the company's aggressive investment in growth and product development. While these investments are necessary for long-term sustainability, they have contributed to a net loss of $34.5 million for the year. It's important to monitor whether these investments will lead to profitability as projected. The company's cash position of $100.5 million offers some cushion, but the cash burn rate, even when adjusted for non-recurring items, warrants attention from investors. Veterinary Industry Analyst Zomedica's strategic acquisitions, such as Structured Monitoring Products and Qorvo Biotechnologies, are set to enhance its product offerings and manufacturing efficiency. The integration of these companies could potentially improve gross margins and reduce costs associated with license fees and royalties. For stakeholders in the veterinary health sector, Zomedica's expansion into equine diagnostics and non-infectious GI testing for canines represents a diversification of its product base, meeting a broader range of veterinary needs and tapping into new market segments.The significant growth in the Diagnostics segment, particularly the TRUFORMA product line, suggests a strong market demand for innovative veterinary diagnostic solutions. The veterinary industry is experiencing a trend towards in-house diagnostics and real-time health monitoring, which aligns with Zomedica's product development strategy. The company's focus on both companion and equine animals broadens its market reach and could lead to increased market share in a sector where pet ownership and spending on animal health are on the rise. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Zomedica's reiteration of its 2024 revenue guidance, projecting a 40% increase at the high end, signals confidence in its growth trajectory and market strategy. The company's emphasis on driving increased adoption and utilization of its products, coupled with plans to launch new products in 2024, indicates a forward-looking approach aimed at capturing a larger share of the veterinary diagnostics and therapeutic devices market.However, it's important to consider the competitive landscape and the potential challenges that Zomedica may face. The veterinary health industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with numerous players investing in similar technologies. Zomedica's success will depend on its ability to maintain its technological edge, continue to innovate and effectively market its products to veterinarians and animal health professionals. Additionally, the company's ability to execute its sales territory deployment and achieve full sales maturity will be pivotal in realizing its revenue targets. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM ANN ARBOR, MI / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Zomedica Corp. (NYSE American:ZOM) (""Zomedica"" or the ""Company""), a veterinary health company offering point-of-care diagnostic and therapeutic device products for equine and companion animals, today reported consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2023. All figures are in US dollars unless otherwise stated.""The fourth quarter capped off another record quarter and year for Zomedica. On the strength of our highest revenue quarter ever, we grew full year revenue by over 33%, due to early adoption of newly launched products in our Diagnostics segment, and continued strength in our Therapeutic Devices segment,"" commented Zomedica Chief Executive Officer, Larry Heaton.""During 2023, we created a tremendous amount of momentum in the business that made multiple acquisitions, including Structured Monitoring Products, Inc. and Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC; new product launches, including the VetGuardian® Zero-Touch Vital Signs Remote Monitoring system, the TRUVIEWTM digital cystoscopy platform, our first TRUFORMA® assay for equine diagnostics and three additional assays for canine non-infectious GI testing; and the expansion of our manufacturing capabilities in both Roswell, Georgia and Plymouth, Minnesota. With this foundation in place, and our exciting near-term portfolio expansion plans, we believe that we are very well positioned to continue our growth trajectory in 2024.""We believe that the progress we made in 2023, and our planned growth for 2024, moves us forward nicely on our path to profitability as we grow revenues, maintain industry-leading margins and capture efficiencies in our operations,"" concluded Mr. Heaton.Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial HighlightsRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew 19% to $7.3 million, compared to fourth quarter 2022 revenue, primarily driven by growth in the Therapeutic Devices segment, which grew 16% over the prior year, and 144% growth over the prior year in the Diagnostics segment.Growth was further bolstered by:Consumable revenue that grew to $4.0 million, up 26% over fourth quarter 2022 consumable revenue; and,Capital revenue that grew to $3.3 million, up 12% over fourth quarter 2022 capital revenue.Gross margin was 69% for the fourth quarter of 2023.Total cash used during the quarter was $17.5 million. When adjusted for non-recurring one-time items, our non-GAAP operating burn was approximately $2.6 million.Full Year 2023 Financial HighlightsRevenue for 2023 grew 33% to $25.2 million, compared to 2022 revenue of nearly $19 million, primarily driven by increases in sales of Therapeutic Devices, which grew 28% over the prior year, and increases in sales of Diagnostics, which grew 252% over the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in TRUFORMA® product sales and revenue from the launches of the VetGuardian® and TRUVIEWTM product lines.Growth was further bolstered by:Consumable revenue that grew to $16.4 million, reflecting 41% growth over 2022 consumable revenue. Consumable revenue grew to 65% of total revenues from 61% in 2022; and,Capital revenue that grew to $8.8 million, reflecting 20% growth over 2022 capital revenue.Gross margin for full year 2023 was 69%.Cash, Cash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Securities were $100.5 million as of December 31, 2023.Investment in Growth and SustainabilityDuring 2023, Zomedica made progress on multiple fronts, expanding its product portfolio to include five product platforms across two product segments, namely Diagnostics and Therapeutic Devices.The commercial team, including field sales representatives, inside sales representatives, and professional services veterinarians, matured and an experienced Senior Vice President of Sales was recruited to lead the organization.Relationships with domestic animal health distributors and online retailers were expanded and international distribution channels were solidified. Manufacturing and distribution capabilities and capacity were further expanded at the Company's Global Manufacturing & Distribution Centers in Roswell, Georgia, and Plymouth, Minnesota.Acquisition of Structured Monitoring ProductsZomedica completed its acquisition of Structured Monitoring Products, Inc. (""SMP""), the maker of the VetGuardian Zero-Touch Vital Signs Remote Monitoring system, on September 5, 2023. This acquisition followed strategic investments by the Company in SMP beginning in May 2022, and will allow Zomedica to increase gross margin for this product line by bringing the manufacturing of VetGuardian products in-house, and also leverage both its direct sales force and animal health distributor network to drive increased adoption.Launch of the TRUVIEW Digital MicroscopeWith the launch of the TRUVIEW digital microscopy system in early 2023, the Company expects revenues to continue to grow in line with the installed base in the future.Acquisition of Qorvo BiotechnologiesOn October 5th, 2023, Zomedica announced the acquisition of Qorvo Biotechnologies, LLC (""QBT""). The acquisition substantially improves the Company's ability to capture margin improvements through the assumption of QBT's manufacturing systems and also eliminates certain future payments owed to QBT by the Company, including license fees, transition fees, and future royalties. The timing of this acquisition coincided with the launch of the equine eACTH assay and the December 2023 launch of assays for canine non-infectious GI disease, Zomedica believes it will continue to capitalize on these new capabilities to bring additional assays to market, accelerating growth of the TRUFORMA® platform.2024 Business Outlook and Financial GuidanceFor the full year 2024, the Company reiterated formal financial guidance, as follows:Zomedica continues to expect full year revenue in the range of $31 to $35 million, an increase of approximately 40% at the high end of the range, over full year 2023 revenue of $25.2 million.Zomedica believes that growth in 2024 will be driven by its existing portfolio, including recently launched products, supported by investments the Company is making to continue to drive increased adoption and utilization of its products, as well as contributions from a number of new products that the Company expects to launch during 2024. Guidance for 2024 does not incorporate any positive benefits from acquisitions the Company may make during the year.The Company expects revenues to increase, driven by synergies derived from expanded product lines, increased sales/ marketing/commercialization efforts, and the move to full sales territory deployment, execution and maturation.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 ResultsRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $25.2 million,compared to $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $6.3 million or approximately 33%. The increase was primarily due to growth within our Assisi®, PulseVet®, and TRUFORMA® product lines and the inclusion of our TRUVIEWTM and VetGuardian® products, which were not part of our consolidated figures as of December 31, 2022.Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $7.9 million, compared to $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.4 million. Margins remained strong at 69%.Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $48.9 million, compared to $35.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $13.5 million or 38%. When adjusted for one-time items, OpEx grew approximately 23%, which was lower than our top line growth of 33%.Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $5.7 million, compared to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $3.1 million or 123%. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily driven by the growth and expansion of internal capabilities to develop, test, and manufacture our next generation of diagnostic products. We anticipate that R&D costs will increase as we maintain and enhance our current product lines and continue to develop new products.Selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $14.1 million, compared to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.2 million or 43%. The increase was primarily driven by salaries and non-cash stock option expenses associated with increased hiring campaigns and increased marketing campaigns/attendance at tradeshows to build brand awareness and recognition of our expanding suite of products. We expect future selling and marketing expense to increase in line with product expansion and growth in our commercialization efforts.General and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $29.0 million, compared to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $6.1 million or 27%. The increase was primarily driven by salaries and non-cash stock option expense associated with increased hiring campaigns, non-cash amortization related to our acquisitions, recruiting and other related fees associated with creation of new departments and executive leadership transitions. When adjusted for one-time items, G&A expense increased 13%, which was less than sales growth of 33%, reflecting continued improvement in operating leverage.Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $34.5 million,or $0.035 per share, compared to a net loss of $17.0 million, or $0.017 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022.*Non-GAAP EBITDA loss (which includes adjustments for stock compensation) for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $27.7 million compared to a loss of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.When adjusting for one-time items associated with our transition of TRUFORMA development and manufacturing capabilities, executive transition activities, adjustments associated with our acquisitions, and one-off consulting work, our ** Adjusted Non-GAAP EBITDA loss was $12.8 million.Shares OutstandingAs of December 31, 2023, Zomedica had 979,949,668 common shares issued and outstanding.For complete financial results, please see Zomedica's filings on EDGAR and SEDAR or visit the Zomedica website at www.zomedica.com.Zomedica will host a conference call and audio-only webcast on Monday, April 1st, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the Company's operational and financial highlights for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

The combined company will have 15,400 fiber route miles across seven states, aiming to reach 600,000 homes and businesses by 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The acquisition of Horizon by Shenandoah Telecommunications represents a significant expansion of Shentel's fiber network infrastructure. The strategic move to rebrand Horizon's fiber businesses to Glo Fiber is indicative of Shentel's commitment to consolidating its market presence and streamlining its offerings. The integration of Horizon's dense fiber network, which serves a variety of sectors including government and healthcare, could potentially enhance Shentel's service reliability and customer base.From an industry perspective, the expansion into new markets such as Ohio and Indiana is a bold step towards increasing competitive advantage. The projected increase to 600,000 fiber passings by the end of 2026 suggests an aggressive growth strategy that could see Shentel becoming a more dominant player in the regional telecommunications landscape. This expansion might also lead to economies of scale, which can reduce costs and improve profitability over time. Financial Analyst Shentel's funding approach for the acquisition, utilizing a mix of existing cash, proceeds from a recent tower portfolio sale and the issuance of specialized stock, reflects a strategic financial maneuvering. The issuance of 7% Participating Exchangeable Perpetual Preferred Stock indicates a willingness to offer potential investors a steady income stream through dividends, which could be appealing during times of market volatility.Additionally, the decision to issue approximately 4.1 million shares of common stock to an investment fund managed by GCM Grosvenor suggests a move to diversify its investor base and align interests with a reputable investment firm. It's important to monitor how these financial instruments impact Shentel's balance sheet and cost of capital, as they could influence the company's ability to invest in future growth and service enhancements. Market Research Analyst With the rebranding to Glo Fiber, Shentel may be aiming to strengthen its brand recognition and customer loyalty in the commercial and residential sectors. The mention of new 'greenfield fiber-to-the-home' markets indicates a focus on underserved areas, which could lead to capturing untapped market segments. The move reflects a trend in the telecommunications industry where companies are increasingly investing in FTTH to meet the rising demand for high-speed internet services.It will be important to track consumer response to the Glo Fiber brand and the uptake of services in the new markets. Successful integration and marketing strategies could result in increased market share and revenue growth, while failure to effectively manage these could lead to customer churn and financial losses. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM EDINBURG, Va., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (“Shentel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: SHEN) announced today the completion of its acquisition of Horizon Acquisition Parent LLC (“Horizon” or “Horizon Telcom”). Horizon is a leading commercial fiber provider in Ohio and adjacent states serving national wireless providers, carriers, enterprises, and government, education and healthcare customers. Horizon’s unique fiber network is the largest and most dense network across its footprint, and the combined company will have approximately 15,4001 fiber route miles across seven adjacent states. Shentel plans to re-brand the Horizon commercial and residential fiber businesses to Glo Fiber. “We are excited to expand into Ohio and Indiana, roughly doubling the size of our commercial fiber business, adding new Glo Fiber greenfield fiber-to-the-home (“FTTH”) expansion markets, and now reaching approximately 250,0002 total combined company fiber passings. With our expansion into Ohio, we expect to pass approximately 600,000 total homes and businesses with Glo Fiber by the end of 2026,” said Shentel’s President and CEO, Christopher E. French. “We believe combining Horizon’s leading commercial fiber business with our rapidly growing residential Glo Fiber business will translate to a stronger combined business.” Glenn Lytle, Horizon head of Commercial Sales, will join the Shentel management team as Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales for the combined business. Mr. Lytle has over 25 years of experience in the telecommunications industry, including previous senior leadership roles at Segra and Comcast. Shentel funded the cash portion of the acquisition with a combination of existing cash resources, proceeds from last week’s completed sale of its tower portfolio, and issuance of 7%3 Participating Exchangeable Perpetual Preferred Stock of a Shentel subsidiary to an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners. The Company issued approximately 4.1 million shares of Shentel common stock to an investment fund managed by affiliates of GCM Grosvenor, a selling unit holder of Horizon.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of STANLEY Infrastructure by Stanley Black & Decker to Epiroc AB for $760 million represents a strategic portfolio optimization. This move allows Stanley Black & Decker to streamline its operations, potentially improving its financial ratios such as debt-to-equity and interest coverage. The cash influx from the sale will likely be used to pay down existing debt, which could result in lower interest expenses and an improved credit profile. Investors should monitor how this debt reduction impacts the company's leverage and cost of capital in the following quarters. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the sale of STANLEY Infrastructure could signal a shift in Stanley Black & Decker's business focus. By divesting a non-core asset, the company may be aiming to concentrate on more profitable or strategic areas. It's essential to consider the competitive landscape and how this sale might affect the company's market share in its remaining segments. Epiroc AB's acquisition could strengthen its position in the infrastructure sector, potentially reshaping market dynamics. Mergers & Acquisitions Expert The transaction's price point of $760 million needs to be evaluated against the valuation multiples of similar deals in the industry. If Stanley Black & Decker has managed to sell the unit for a higher multiple than industry average, it indicates strong negotiation and a favorable deal for shareholders. Conversely, if the sale price is below market multiples, it may raise questions about the timing or necessity of the divestiture. Additionally, the tax implications mentioned as 'modest' should be quantified to assess the net benefit to the company. 04/01/2024 - 04:08 PM Transaction Further Optimizes Portfolio to Deliver Long-Term Shareholder Value NEW BRITAIN, Conn., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) today announced that it has completed the previously announced sale of STANLEY Infrastructure to Epiroc AB (Nasdaq Stockholm: EPIA) for $760 million in cash.

Positive Net sales for 2023 were $15.3 million compared to $16.1 million in 2022 Gross profit for 2023 was $0.7 million compared to $2.1 million in 2022 Operating expenses for 2023 were $6.7 million compared to $7.7 million in 2022 Net loss was $6.5 million in 2023, or $(0.49) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.6 million, or $(0.43) per basic and diluted share in 2022 Working capital of $11.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with $550,000 in cash and $16.5 million in inventory Backlog at December 31, 2023, was $3.9 million Achieved $5.1 million in new bookings in Q1 2024 with a current backlog of $7.7 million Closed a public offering of 4.6 million common shares for gross proceeds of $1.84 million in December 2023 Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in net sales from $16.1 million in 2022 to $15.3 million in 2023 indicates a contraction in Polar Power's revenue, which is a concern for investors focused on growth trajectories. The gross profit reduction from $2.1 million to $0.7 million suggests a significant decrease in profitability, potentially due to increased cost of goods sold or pricing pressures. However, the reduction in operating expenses from $7.7 million to $6.7 million demonstrates management's efforts to control costs in a challenging economic environment.The net loss widening from $5.6 million to $6.5 million year-over-year may raise red flags about the company's financial health. Yet, the sequential growth in the fourth quarter and the reported new bookings worth $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2024 could be seen as positive indicators for a potential turnaround. The diversification of the customer base and increased international sales are strategic moves that could stabilize revenue streams and reduce dependency on key customers. Financial Analyst From a liquidity standpoint, the working capital position of $11.8 million, despite a lower cash position, is bolstered by a significant inventory holding. This could indicate either a strategic stockpiling of inventory in anticipation of future sales or potential issues with inventory management and turnover. The total liquidity of $1.0 million, including availability under the line of credit, may be a point of concern for the company's short-term financial flexibility.The backlog of $3.9 million at the end of 2023, increasing to $7.7 million by April 2024, provides visibility into future revenue, which is critical for forecasting and valuation purposes. The recent public offering of shares, although dilutive, has provided the company with gross proceeds of $1.84 million, which could support its planned investments in sales and marketing to drive growth. Energy Sector Analyst Polar Power's focus on prime, backup and solar hybrid DC power solutions positions the company within the growing renewable energy and energy efficiency markets. The mention of a diversified customer base, including military sales and international telecom providers, suggests that the company is tapping into sectors with resilient demand for energy solutions.The strategic emphasis on fuel-efficient power generation technology is noteworthy, as it aligns with global trends towards sustainability and could open up additional markets. The company's ability to secure repeat orders from the largest telecom provider in Puerto Rico demonstrates the competitiveness of its offerings in the telecom infrastructure space, which is known for its stringent requirements for reliability and efficiency. 04/01/2024 - 04:10 PM GARDENA, CA, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Polar Power, Inc.

Having recently announced bookings of over $5 million for the first quarter of 2024, we are off to a good start in 2024 and have reason to believe that we’ll see orders continue to materialize from our tier-1 telco customers and from other international telecom providers. Our capital-efficient power generation technology platform is applicable in a wide variety of end-markets where there is a dire need for sources of reliable, fuel-efficient power, in both prime and backup applications, and we’re vigorously pursuing such opportunities. “We are pleased with the progress made to diversify our customer base and penetrate new international markets. In 2023 we completed delivery on a significant number of units to a customer in Southeast Asia under a contract signed during 2022, and we’ve also seen repeat orders from the largest telecom provider in Puerto Rico, with deliveries there ongoing throughout 2024. On the military side, we also saw a healthy increase in sales in 2023 compared to the prior year. “Planned investment in our sales and marketing organization to accelerate our sales growth, and a commitment to managing our operating expenses should enable both top- and bottom-line improvements throughout 2024,” concluded Sams.

Shareholder distributions will adjust accordingly. The company's common stock will continue trading on Nasdaq under the symbol GLAD. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a reverse stock split by Gladstone Capital Corporation is a strategic move that often aims to boost the stock's market price and maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements. In analyzing the potential impact on the company's valuation, it's important to consider that a reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization but may affect investor perception. The reduction in outstanding shares from approximately 43.5 million to 21.8 million will likely increase the stock price proportionally, assuming market conditions remain constant.Investors should be aware that while the par value remains the same and distributions are adjusted accordingly, the liquidity of the stock could be affected. A higher stock price often means fewer shares are traded, which can lead to increased volatility. The short-term market reaction can vary, with some investors viewing a reverse split positively as a company's attempt to improve its stock's appeal, while others may see it as a sign of underlying issues. Long-term implications will largely depend on the company's performance and whether the reverse split succeeds in attracting institutional investors. Tax Advisor One aspect of the reverse stock split that should not be overlooked is the tax implications, particularly concerning the treatment of fractional shares. Gladstone Capital Corporation's decision to sell fractional shares on the open market and distribute the proceeds to shareholders could result in a taxable event. Shareholders will receive a cash payment equivalent to their pro rata share of the total net proceeds, which may be subject to federal, state and local income taxes.It's important for shareholders to understand that this could lead to capital gains tax liabilities, depending on the original purchase price of their shares and the sale price of the fractional shares. The tax impact will vary for each shareholder and they should consult with a tax professional to understand their individual situation. This is particularly important for those holding significant positions in the stock, as the tax consequences could be substantial. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the reaction to a reverse stock split can serve as an indicator of investor confidence in Gladstone Capital Corporation's future prospects. Historically, reverse stock splits have been met with mixed reactions, with outcomes contingent on the company's subsequent performance and market conditions. It's essential to monitor the trading volume post-split, as a significant decrease could signal a lack of investor interest, which might lead to further price declines.Additionally, the unchanged number of authorized shares post-split indicates that the company retains the flexibility to issue additional shares in the future. This could be a precursor to future financing activities or acquisitions. Stakeholders should keep an eye on how the company utilizes this capacity, as it could have implications for future equity dilution or growth financing strategies. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM MCLEAN, VA / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Gladstone Capital Corporation (Nasdaq:GLAD) (the ""Company"") announced today that its board of directors has approved a reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-2 that will be effective for purposes of trading as of the opening of business on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on April 5, 2024. As a result of the reverse stock split, every two shares of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Shareholder distributions will be unchanged as monthly distributions per share will adjust commensurate with the 1-for-2 ratio of the reverse stock split.The Company's common stock will continue to trade on Nasdaq under the symbol GLAD. The new CUSIP number for the Company's common stock following the reverse stock split will be 376535878.The reverse stock split will reduce the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding from approximately 43.5 million shares to approximately 21.8 million shares. The number of authorized shares of common stock under the Company's articles of incorporation will remain unchanged at 44.0 million shares.In lieu of issuing fractional shares, the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will aggregate all fractional shares and sell them as soon as practicable after the reverse stock split at then-prevailing prices on the open market. After this sale, record stockholders will receive a cash payment in an amount equal to their respective pro rata share of the total net proceeds of that sale. This cash payment may be subject to applicable U.S. federal, state and local income tax.Holders of the Company's common stock held in book-entry form or through a bank, broker or other nominee do not need to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record will receive information from Computershare regarding their post-split common stock ownership. Stockholders holding shares of common stock in certificate form will receive a transmittal letter from Computershare, accompanied by instructions specifying how to exchange stock certificates for a statement of holding, together with any payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.The Company's preferred stock is not subject to the reverse stock split.Gladstone Capital Corporation is a publicly traded business development company that invests in debt and equity securities consisting primarily of secured first and second lien term loans to lower middle market businesses in the United States.

The company's cash balance decreased, and net income turned positive. Management expressed confidence in the company's growth trajectory and financial profile. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion strategy of Yoshiharu, as highlighted by the opening of new locations and the acquisition of additional restaurants, reflects an aggressive growth approach that can be appealing to investors seeking companies with a clear scale-up plan. The reported increase in restaurant-level contribution margin suggests an improvement in operational efficiency, potentially translating into higher profitability per unit over time. However, the decline in average unit volumes raises questions about the overall customer traffic and spending patterns, which could be a red flag for sustained growth. Financial Analyst Yoshiharu's improved operating loss and the shift from a net loss to a net income in the fourth quarter are positive indicators of the company's financial turnaround. However, the significant decrease in the cash balance year-over-year might indicate a high cash burn rate, which could concern investors about the company's liquidity and long-term sustainability. The reliance on non-GAAP measures like adjusted EBITDA needs to be scrutinized, as these figures often exclude one-time costs that can provide a distorted view of the company's actual financial health. Food Industry Analyst While Yoshiharu's focus on authentic Japanese ramen offers a niche appeal, the competitive landscape of the restaurant industry requires continuous innovation and marketing to maintain customer interest. The decrease in food and beverage costs due to increased bargaining power is a testament to management's cost-saving initiatives, but it's essential to ensure that quality is not compromised in the process. The slight decrease in combined average monthly sales for existing locations may suggest market saturation or operational challenges that need to be addressed to secure repeat business and attract new customers. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM BUENA PARK, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Yoshiharu Global Co.

""Our strategic locations for the three new restaurants have yielded strong performance and sustained demand thus far, as we aim to replicate this successful trend with our pipeline of new restaurant locations.

The increase was primarily due to the decrease in food and beverage costs following the increased bargaining power.Total restaurant operating expenses were $2.3 million, a slight decrease compared to the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure defined below, improved to $(0.4) million from $(0.8) million in the prior year period.

The Company's SEC filings can be found on the SEC's website at https://www.sec.gov/ or the Company's investor relations site at https://ir.yoshiharuramen.com/.About Yoshiharu Global Co.Yoshiharu is a fast-growing restaurant operator and was born out of the idea of introducing the modernized Japanese dining experience to customers all over the world. Specializing in Japanese ramen, Yoshiharu gained recognition as a leading ramen restaurant in Southern California within six months of its 2016 debut and has continued to expand its top-notch restaurant service across Southern California, currently owning and operating 11 restaurants.For more information, please visit www.yoshiharuramen.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense, non-cash lease expense and asset disposals, closure costs and restaurant impairments, as well as certain items, such as employee retention credit, litigation accrual, and certain executive transition costs, that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales. EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures which are intended as supplemental measures of our performance and are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and operating results. However, these measures may not provide a complete understanding of the operating results of the Company as a whole and such measures should be reviewed in conjunction with its GAAP financial results.The Company believes that the use of EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The Company's computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.Because of these limitations, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA in the Company's SEC filings and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.The full reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 which can be found on the SEC ‘s website at https://www.sec.gov/ or the Company's investor relations site at https://ir.yoshiharuramen.com/.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release includes certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including without limitation, statements regarding our position to execute on our growth strategy, and our ability to expand our leadership position.

(NASDAQ: MSGM) released its financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, showcasing a focus on cost reduction and innovation with the launch of Le Mans Ultimate.","Motorsport Games Reports Fourth Quarter & Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Motorsport Games Inc. (NASDAQ: MSGM) released its financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, showcasing a focus on cost reduction and innovation with the launch of Le Mans Ultimate. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by Motorsport Games Inc. offers a window into the company's operational adjustments and strategic focus. A pivot towards cost reduction, including downsizing headcount and narrowing project scope, is indicative of a company streamlining operations to improve its financial health. This is a common response to market pressures or previous overextensions. The emphasis on 'Le Mans Ultimate,' a new team-based racing game, suggests a strategic bet on a flagship product. This product-centric strategy can be beneficial if the game captures market share and drives revenue growth. However, it also consolidates risk; if the game fails to resonate with consumers, the financial repercussions could be significant given the company's narrowed focus.Investors should monitor user reception and sales figures post-launch to gauge the success of this strategic shift. Additionally, the broader gaming industry's performance, including consumer spending patterns and competition, will provide context for Motorsport Games' potential market performance. Market Research Analyst The gaming industry is fiercely competitive with high consumer expectations for innovation and engagement. Motorsport Games' decision to concentrate on 'Le Mans Ultimate' suggests an attempt to leverage niche market appeal within the racing genre. The company's focus on innovation could differentiate it from competitors. However, the success of such a title will depend heavily on its reception within the gaming community and its ability to establish a loyal player base.Market trends show a significant consumer interest in esports and competitive gaming, which could play to Motorsport Games' strengths if 'Le Mans Ultimate' is positioned effectively within these spheres. Cross-platform playability, post-launch support and community engagement are key factors that could influence the game's longevity and, by extension, the company's revenue streams. Gaming Industry Analyst Within the gaming sector, the development and launch of a new title are capital-intensive processes with long lead times. Motorsport Games' focus on 'Le Mans Ultimate' indicates a substantial investment in both development and marketing. The game's performance will not only affect immediate financial results but also the company's reputation and its ability to attract partnerships and licensing deals.It's essential to consider the historical performance of racing games and the specific appeal of the Le Mans brand. If the company has successfully captured the essence of the Le Mans experience, it could tap into a dedicated audience of racing enthusiasts. However, the game's reliance on the Le Mans license means that any issues with the license holder or changes in the popularity of the Le Mans series could impact the game's success and, by extension, the company's financials. 04/01/2024 - 04:10 PM MIAMI, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Motorsport Games Inc. (NASDAQ: MSGM) (“Motorsport Games” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The Company has also posted the fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2023 earnings slides highlighting key milestones that occurred in the period, which are accessible on the Company’s investor relations website. “2023 was a year of repositioning. Reducing costs, headcount and projects allowed us to focus on what we know best, making innovative games. Having determined the correct direction for the company, we put our energy into Le Mans Ultimate, an innovative team-based racing title from our internal team, Studio 397. All efforts were redirected to make this a success, and as part of the delivery, we set about reestablishing ourselves in the eyes of players.” Stephen Hood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Motorsport Games commented. “This reworking of what had become a complex business, was at times a difficult process. But the renewed energy on display from our tightly knit team became our guiding light.” “This past year marks a significant milestone in the rebuilding of the company” continued Hood. “With a strong sense of direction and energy, we became a games company again, ready to deliver through 2024.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Subsequent Business Update Expense reductions under the previously announced 2022 Restructuring Program has yielded savings of $6.7 million as of the end of 2023Closed Motorsport Games Australia to centralise development efforts and reduce costReleased Le Mans Ultimate into Early Access in February 2024, the official game of the FIA World Endurance Championship and the 24 Hours of Le Mans to positive community reception with initial sales above internal forecasted levels Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.7 million compared to $3.8 million for the same period in the prior year, a reduction of $2.1 million, or 53.7%. Gross profit was $1.1 million compared to $2.3 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $1.2 million, while gross profit margin marginally increased to 61.4% from 60.6%. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $2.7 million, or $1.35 per share, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million, or $4.17 per share, for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of $7.5 million, or $5.52 per share. Lower cost of revenues and operating expenses required to develop and release additional new games in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed to the increase in net income, as well as a $3.0 million gain from the sale of the NASCAR license to iRacing in October 2023. Adjusted EBITDA gain(1) for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.5 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) of $3.2 million for the same period in the prior year. The change in Adjusted EBITDA gain(1) of $3.7 million was primarily due to the same factors driving the previously discussed change in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 when compared to the same period in the prior year. The following table provides a reconciliation from net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA gain(loss)(1) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively: Three Months EndedDecember 31, 2023 Three Months EndedDecember 31, 2022 Net Income (Loss)$2,671,021 $(4,849,023)Interest expense, net 98,929 509,993 Depreciation and Amortization 602,800 490,377 EBITDA 3,372,750 (3,848,653)Acquisition related expenses 66,224 161,010 Loss contingency expenses - 425,000 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - 188,378 Gain on sale of NASCAR License (3,037,341) - Stock-based compensation 81,242 (105,792)Adjusted EBITDA$482,875 $(3,180,057) Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue for the full year 2023 was $6.9 million compared to $10.3 million for the prior year period, a reduction of $3.4 million, or 33.1%. Gaming segment revenues were $6.6 million for the full year 2023, compared to $9.1 million for the prior year period, a reduction of $2.5 million, or 27.6%. Esports segment revenues were $0.3 million for the full year 2023 compared to $1.2 million for the prior year period, a reduction of $0.9 million, or 75.4%. Consolidated gross profit was $3.3 million for the full year 2023 compared to $5.4 million for the prior year period, a decrease of $2.1 million, while gross profit margin decreased to 47.6% from 52.0%. Net loss for the full year 2023 was $14.3 million, or $5.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $36.8 million, or $30.73 per share, for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of $22.5 million, or $25.66 per share. Lower cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and impairment losses, as well as the gain on the sale of the NASCAR license, were key contributors to the decrease in net loss for the full year 2023 when compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a reduction in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) was $8.9 million for the full year 2023, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) of $21.2 million for the same period in prior year, an improvement of $12.3 million, or 58.0%. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) was primarily due to the same factors driving the previously discussed change in net loss for the full year 2023 when compared to the prior year period. The following table provides a reconciliation from net loss to Adjusted EBITDA loss(1) for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively: Twelve Months EndedDecember 31, 2023 Twelve Months EndedDecember 31, 2022Net Loss$(14,323,185) $(36,840,454)Interest expense, net 772,989 1,148,204 Depreciation and Amortization 2,115,430 2,062,551 EBITDA (11,434,766) (33,629,699)Acquisition related expenses 387,532 718,611 Loss contingency expenses 232,359 1,425,000 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 4,004,627 9,616,748 Gain on sale of NASCAR License (3,037,341) - Stock-based compensation 957,302 714,523 Adjusted EBITDA$(8,890,288) (21,154,817) Cash Flow and Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had negative cash flows from operations of approximately $12.9 million, representing an average monthly net cash burn from operations of approximately $1.1 million. While it has taken measures to reduce its costs, the Company expects to continue to have a net cash outflow from operations for the foreseeable future as it continues to develop its product portfolio and invest in developing new video game titles. As of April 1, 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents has decreased to $1.3million. Based on this cash and cash equivalents position, and the Company’s average cash burn, the Company does not believe it has sufficient cash on hand to fund its operations for the remainder of 2024 and that additional funding will be required in order to continue operations. In order to address its liquidity short fall, the Company is actively exploring several options, including, but not limited to: i) additional funding in the form of potential equity and/or debt financing arrangements or similar transactions; ii) other strategic alternatives for its business, including, but not limited to, the sale or licensing of the Company’s assets in addition to its recent sale of its NASCAR license; and iii) further cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional liquidity through the means referenced above, nor can there be any assurances that the Company can sufficiently reduce costs and restructure its business to sufficiently lower its cash burn to sustainable levels and therefore meet its ongoing cash requirements. Further, other factors can impact the Company’s liquidity position, including, but not limited to, the Company’s level of sales and expenditures, as well as accounts receivable, sales allowances, prepaid manufacturing expenses and accrued expenses. For additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity, see the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). (1)Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA (the “Non-GAAP Measure”) is not a financial measure defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Reconciliations of the Non-GAAP Measure to net income (loss), its most directly comparable financial measure, calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are presented in the tables above. Adjusted EBITDA, a measure used by management to assess the Company’s operating performance, is defined as EBITDA, which is net loss plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization, less income tax benefit (if any), adjusted to exclude: (i) acquisition related expenses; (ii) stock-based compensation expenses; (iii) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; (iv) loss contingency expenses; and (v) charges or gains resulting from non-recurring events, such as the gain on the sale of the Company’s NASCAR license, as applicable. The Company uses the Non-GAAP Measure to manage its business and evaluate its financial performance, as Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items that affect comparability between periods that the Company believes are not representative of its core ongoing operating business. Additionally, management believes that using the Non-GAAP Measure is useful to its investors because it enhances investors’ understanding and assessment of the Company’s normalized operating performance and facilitates comparisons to prior periods and its competitors’ results (who may define Adjusted EBITDA differently). The Non-GAAP Measure is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to revenue, income/loss from operations, net (loss) income, or cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, the Non-GAAP Measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flows available for management’s discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements, such as interest payments, tax payments, working capital requirements and debt service requirements. The Non-GAAP Measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Management compensates for the limitations of using the Non-GAAP Measure by using it to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than would be presented by using only measures in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Non-GAAP Measure may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Negative Decrease in full-year net revenues by 18.2% compared to the prior year. Net loss of $9.1 million for the full year 2023. Various factors contributing to the decrease in net revenues such as decreased Ark Mobile sales and deferred revenues. Decrease in EBITDA for the full year 2023 by 1,198.1%. Financial Analyst The recent earnings report from Snail, Inc. highlights a mixed financial performance that warrants a nuanced analysis. The launch of ARK: Survival Ascended is a significant event, with the game selling 1.5 million units to date, which is a strong performance in the competitive gaming industry. This success contributed to a substantial increase in quarterly net revenues from $15.3 million to $28.6 million year-over-year. However, annual net revenues saw an 18.2% decline, which raises concerns about the company's ability to sustain growth.The reported increase in bookings, from $11.9 million to $52.6 million in Q4, suggests a solid demand for the new release, which is a positive indicator for future revenue recognition. The strategy to defer $22.0 million in revenues for unreleased DLCs indicates a potential for future earnings, but also reflects in the reported net loss of $9.1 million for the year. This loss, alongside increased R&D and marketing costs, suggests that the company is investing heavily in its product pipeline and market presence.From a liquidity standpoint, the slight increase in unrestricted cash to $15.2 million provides some cushion, but the overall decrease in net income year-over-year is a point of concern for investors focused on profitability and cash flow sustainability. The company's use of non-GAAP measures like Bookings and EBITDA can offer additional insights into operational performance, but investors should also consider the GAAP figures to understand the full financial health of the company. Market Research Analyst The gaming industry is highly dynamic, with consumer preferences and technology evolving rapidly. Snail, Inc.'s focus on leveraging Unreal Engine 5 for ARK: Survival Ascended showcases their commitment to staying at the forefront of technology, which is imperative to maintain relevance in this sector. The introduction of a cross-platform modding system could potentially foster a loyal community and drive long-term engagement, a trend that has been successful for other leading games.However, the decrease in year-over-year unit sales for ARK: Survival Evolved could indicate market saturation or competition from newer titles. The company's ability to innovate and keep their existing titles fresh will be critical to maintaining user engagement. The gaming industry's shift towards digital sales and the emphasis on recurring revenue through DLCs and microtransactions is reflected in Snail's strategy, which could provide a steady revenue stream if managed effectively.Marketing and advertising efforts, which saw an increase in costs, will need to be carefully optimized to ensure a high return on investment, as the gaming market is notorious for its high customer acquisition costs. Snail's performance in the next quarters will be telling of their ability to capitalize on the strong launch of their latest title and translate that into sustained financial success. Legal & Compliance Expert The financial disclosures by Snail, Inc. demonstrate a clear adherence to regulatory requirements, as evidenced by their detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. The transparency in reporting Bookings and EBITDA alongside traditional financial metrics allows stakeholders to assess the company's performance from multiple angles. It is important to note that while non-GAAP measures can provide additional context, they should not overshadow GAAP results, which remain the standard for legal financial reporting.The reduced expenses related to compliance and litigation indicate that the company has likely streamlined its operations in these areas, which could result in cost savings. However, investors should monitor any future legal or compliance-related expenses as these could impact the company's financial position. The decrease in professional expenses is a positive development, but it is essential to ensure that this does not compromise the company's ability to navigate the complex legal landscape of the gaming industry, which includes intellectual property rights, international regulations and consumer protection laws. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM CULVER CITY, Calif., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Snail, Inc.

ARK: Survival Ascended was ranked the top #1 selling game on Steam on launch day.Since its launch, ARK: Survival Ascended sold 1.6 million units and has an average of 182,000 daily active users (“DAUs”) with a peak of 308,000 DAUs. ARK: Survival Evolved. In the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, ARK: Survival Evolved averaged a total of 192,000 DAUs and 235,000 DAUs, respectively. ARK: Survival Evolved units sold increased for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the same period in 2022; approximately 0.7 million vs. 1.6 million, respectively.Units sold decreased for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022; approximately 4.4 million vs. 5.5 million, respectively. Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $28.6 million as compared to $15.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the release of ARK: Survival Ascended. Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $13.5 million to $60.9 million, or 18.2%, compared to $74.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net revenues was due to a decrease in Ark Mobile sales of $2.9 million, a decrease in one-time deferred revenue from contracts recognized in 2022 of $10.3 million, one-time payments in 2022 of $8.5 million related to free download promotions and DLC’s, that did not occur in 2023 and an increase in deferred revenues of $25.2 million related to Ark; partially offset by an increase in Ark sales of $32.7 million. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $2.4 million compared to a net loss of $2.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net income is due to the release of ARK: Survival Ascended, reduced general and administrative expenses of $2.5 million and decreased professional expenses related to compliance with public company requirements and litigation related expenses, partially offset by increased advertising and marketing costs of $0.9 million related to the ARK: Survival Ascended release and a $3.9 million decrease in the income tax benefit for the period. Net loss was $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to a net income of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of $10.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to decreased revenues of $13.5 million, increased research and development costs of $2.2 million, increased advertising and marketing costs of $0.9 million, increased interest expenses of $0.6 million, decreased interest income – related party of $0.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenues of $4.8 million, and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $2.9 million. Bookings for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $52.6 million as compared to $11.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to the strong release of ARK: Survival Ascended on the Steam, PlayStation and Xbox platforms. Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $85.7 million as compared to $63.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to the release of ARK: Survival Ascended in the fourth quarter of 2023. In addition to increased sales of ARK: Survival Ascended, the Company deferred approximately $22.0 million in revenues during the fourth quarter of 2023 for the ARK: Survival Ascended DLC’s which have not yet released and had $10.3 million in one-time deferred contract revenues recognized in 2022 that did not occur in 2023. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased by $8.8 million, or 169%, as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in net income of $4.7million, partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes of $3.9 million. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $9.0 million, or 1,198.1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a decrease in net income of $10.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $0.7 million and an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million. As of December 31, 2023, unrestricted cash was $15.2 million versus $12.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to the financial results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Snail believes Bookings and EBITDA, as non-GAAP measures, are useful in evaluating its operating performance. Bookings and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that are presented as supplemental disclosures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income (loss) or revenue as indicators of operating performance, nor as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, both as determined in accordance with GAAP. Snail supplementally presents Bookings and EBITDA because they are key operating measures used by management to assess financial performance. Bookings adjusts for the impact of deferrals and, Snail believes, provides a useful indicator of sales in a given period. EBITDA adjusts for items that Snail believes do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of its business, such as certain non-cash items, unusual or infrequent items or items that change from period to period without any material relevance to its operating performance. Management believes Bookings and EBITDA are useful to investors and analysts in highlighting trends in Snail’s operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which Snail operates and capital investments. Bookings is defined as the net amount of products and services sold digitally or physically in the period. Bookings is equal to revenues excluding the impact from deferrals. Below is a reconciliation of total net revenue to Bookings, the closest GAAP financial measure.

The company provides personal emergency response systems and health communication devices, aiming to create a Connected Care Platform. Positive None. Negative The postponement of financial results and conference call may raise concerns among investors about the company's financial performance and transparency. Financial Analyst The postponement of LogicMark's financial results and the corresponding conference call signifies a delay in the critical dissemination of company performance data to shareholders and potential investors. This action may trigger uncertainty in the market, as timely financial disclosures are a cornerstone of investor confidence. The need for an extension to complete the annual report could imply complexities in financial reporting or potential issues that require additional time to resolve. It is essential to monitor the stock's performance, as such delays can often lead to volatility. Investors should assess the company's historical punctuality in financial reporting and consider how this postponement aligns with or deviates from that pattern. Market Research Analyst LogicMark operates within the care economy, a sector experiencing growth due to demographic shifts such as an aging population. The delay in financial reporting may impact investors' ability to evaluate the company's market position and performance, especially in the context of its contracts with the U.S. Veterans Health Administration and the U.S. General Services Administration. These contracts suggest a stable demand for LogicMark's products, but without current financial data, it is challenging to gauge the company's success in capitalizing on these opportunities. Further, the company's innovation in PERS technology and direct-to-consumer sales model are critical factors that investors would typically scrutinize against financial outcomes to assess scalability and market penetration. Compliance Officer Filing an extension with the SEC is a regulated process that allows companies additional time to ensure accuracy and completeness in their annual reports. While this is a procedural right, it is not the norm for companies to delay annual reports and it can raise questions about the robustness of LogicMark's internal financial controls and governance practices. Investors and analysts should look for any subsequent disclosures that might shed light on the reasons for the delay. The company's adherence to regulatory requirements and transparency in communication will be key in maintaining trust with stakeholders during this period of uncertainty. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LogicMark, Inc.

Announces Closing of $10 Million Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary U-BX Technology (UBXG) closes its IPO, raising $10 million by offering 2,000,000 ordinary shares at $5.00 per share. The Company's shares began trading on Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol 'UBXG'. EF Hutton , the underwriter, has an option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of U-BX Technology Ltd.'s initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company and a notable event for investors and market participants. The pricing of the IPO at $5.00 per share, with a total raise of $10 million, is a critical data point. It reflects the valuation that the market is prepared to assign to a company in the AI-driven value-added services for insurance carriers sector. This sector is growing, as insurers increasingly rely on AI to improve efficiency and customer experience.The allocation of the raised funds is particularly interesting. With 60% earmarked for research and development, UBXG signals a strong commitment to innovation, which is essential in the tech sector. The 30% for advertising and marketing suggests that UBXG is also focusing on brand recognition and market penetration. The remaining 10% for general working capital indicates a balanced approach to financial planning. The use of proceeds will likely be scrutinized by investors to ensure that it aligns with growth and profitability targets. Financial Analyst Investors will pay close attention to the underwriter's over-allotment option, commonly known as a 'greenshoe' option. EF Hutton's ability to purchase an additional 300,000 shares can help stabilize the stock price post-IPO, a factor that could influence the stock's short-term performance. The role of EF Hutton as the sole bookrunner indicates confidence in their ability to manage the offering effectively.Moreover, the legal counsel involved, Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP and Winston & Strawn LLP, adds a layer of credibility to the proceedings, which is important for investor confidence. The successful filing and effectiveness of the registration statement with the SEC are procedural yet vital steps that ensure regulatory compliance and transparency, key considerations for institutional and retail investors alike. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form F-1 is a pivotal aspect of the IPO process. It indicates that UBXG has met the SEC's stringent disclosure requirements, providing investors with the necessary information to make informed decisions. The availability of the final prospectus through multiple channels, including the SEC's website, is a transparency measure that supports investor protection.It is also noteworthy that the offering is made only by means of a prospectus, underscoring the importance of formal disclosure in capital market transactions. The legal framework governing IPOs is designed to ensure fairness and efficiency in the markets and UBXG's adherence to these regulations is a positive sign for potential investors. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Beijing, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U-BX Technology Ltd.

(NASDAQ: SIGA), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on health security and infectious disease, announced today that it entered into an amendment to its international promotion agreement with Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. (Meridian). Effective June 1, SIGA will drive international promotion activities for oral TPOXX® while maintaining its contractual relationship with Meridian to maintain continuity for key customer relationships. “We are excited about the long-term growth opportunities for oral TPOXX and believe this amendment to the Meridian promotion agreement will be instrumental in driving our expansion efforts for TPOXX outside the U.S.,” said Diem Nguyen, Chief Executive Officer. “This strategic move, which gives SIGA greater control, will enable us to meet our global customers’ needs more effectively during these uncertain times of orthopox threats. The ability to forge direct relationships with key international stakeholders is essential to our plans to expand access to TPOXX and maximize value creation.” This amendment, which extends the term of the promotion agreement by two years with respect to specific territories including the European Union, gives SIGA primary responsibility for promoting oral TPOXX. Certain existing contracts under the promotion agreement, including Meridian’s contract with the European Commission’s DG Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), will remain in effect. ABOUT SIGA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. SIGA Technologies, Inc. is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the health security market. Health security comprises countermeasures for biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear attacks (biodefense market), vaccines and therapies for emerging infectious diseases, and health preparedness. Our lead product is TPOXX®, also known as tecovirimat and ST-246®, an orally administered and IV formulation antiviral drug for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus. ABOUT TPOXX® TPOXX is a novel small-molecule drug and the U.S. maintains a supply of TPOXX under Project BioShield. The oral formulation of TPOXX was approved by the FDA for the treatment of smallpox in 2018, and the IV formulation was approved for the same indication in 2022. The full label is available by clicking here. Oral tecovirimat received approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom in 2022. The EMA and UK approvals include labeling for oral tecovirimat indicating its use for the treatment of smallpox, monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia complications following vaccination against smallpox. The full label is available by clicking here. In September 2018, SIGA signed a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for additional procurement and development related to both oral and intravenous formulations of TPOXX. For more information about SIGA, please visit www.siga.com. ABOUT ORTHOPOXVIRUSESOrthopoxvirus, belonging to the family of poxvirus that infect humans, include smallpox, mpox, cowpox and vaccinia. Smallpox, a highly contagious and fatal disease, presents itself as a risk to global health security today given fears of its release accidentally or intentionally as a bioweapon. Mpox virus, similar to smallpox, causes intermittent human infections, painful lesions, and possible case fatalities. Mpox outbreaks have been observed recently in the US, Europe, and Central & West Africa. Whether through natural occurrence or potential bioweapon warfare, orthopox threatens global health. Anti-virals and vaccines serve as possible solutions to address these threats.

Despite challenges, management is optimistic about the future and has implemented strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported preliminary financial results for BurgerFi International, Inc. show a decrease in total revenue and systemwide sales in both the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 compared to the previous periods. This contraction in sales, with a particular note on same-store sales, is a red flag for investors, as it indicates a potential decline in the brand's market share and customer loyalty. However, it is important to analyze whether these declines are specific to the company or part of a broader industry trend.Looking at the improved net loss figures, we see a significant reduction from the previous fiscal year, which suggests that the company's cost control and efficiency measures may be yielding results. The improved food, beverage and paper expense margin and the decreased hourly turnover that outperforms industry benchmarks at Anthony’s are positive signs that management's strategic initiatives are having an impact.Investors should closely monitor the company's ability to sustain these improvements in cost management while seeking strategies to reverse the negative sales trends. The opening of new franchised locations and the acquisition of franchisee locations could be seen as steps towards expanding market presence and potentially increasing future revenues. Market Research Analyst The data indicates a shift in consumer behavior with a consistent percentage of digital channel sales, highlighting the importance of an omnichannel strategy in the fast-casual dining sector. BurgerFi's performance in this area seems stable, maintaining a one-third share of sales through digital channels. However, the overall decline in systemwide sales growth suggests that the company's digital presence has not been enough to offset declines in physical store sales.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape of the 'better burger' niche and casual dining pizza sector. With BurgerFi's systemwide sales for both brands decreasing, it's important to understand the competitive actions that may have contributed to this decline. Are competitors offering more innovative products, better value, or more effective marketing? These factors can influence consumer choice and affect BurgerFi's market position.The franchise model expansion, including the first dual-brand franchise location, is an interesting development. This strategy could potentially diversify revenue streams and reduce operational risk. However, the success of franchised locations is contingent upon the brand's overall health and market demand, which currently shows signs of weakness. Operational Efficiency Expert From an operational perspective, the decline in hourly turnover and the alignment with industry benchmarks in management turnover at BurgerFi are indicative of improving operational stability. This can lead to better customer service and potentially improved sales in the long term. The mention of investments into inventory control systems and a new POS platform at Anthony’s are strategic moves aimed at increasing operational efficiency and margin expansion.The emphasis on labor and cost efficiency, despite the challenges in the top line, suggests a focus on lean operations which is critical for maintaining profitability in the highly competitive restaurant industry. However, it's essential to balance cost-cutting with quality and service to avoid negatively impacting the customer experience.The improved net loss and adjusted EBITDA figures give a glimpse into the company's financial health and its management's ability to control costs. Still, without addressing the root causes of the sales decline, these operational efficiencies may not be sustainable in the long term. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Conference Call today, April 1, at 4:30 p.m. ETFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BurgerFi International, Inc. (Nasdaq: BFI, BFIIW) (“BurgerFi” or the “Company”), owner BurgerFi, one of the nation’s leading fast-casual “better burger” dining brands, and Anthony’s Coal Fired Pizza & Wings (“Anthony’s”), the high-quality, casual dining pizza brand, today reported preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 1, 2024. Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 20231 Total revenue was $41.5 million in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to $45.2 million in the fourth quarter 2022 Consolidated systemwide sales decreased to $65.0 million compared to $71.6 million in the prior periodCorporate-owned restaurant same-store sales decreased 3% at Anthony’s compared to the prior periodSystemwide sales for BurgerFi decreased 9% to $33.9 million compared to $38.7 million in the prior periodSystemwide same-store sales decreased 10% at BurgerFi compared to the prior period Opened three new franchised BurgerFi locations in Strongsville, Ohio, Arecibo, Puerto Rico and Rochester, New York and the first franchised co-branded restaurant in Kissimmee, Florida.Hourly turnover continued to decline significantly from the sequential quarter, with Anthony’s performing better than industry benchmarks, while BurgerFi continued to make considerable progress. Management turnover at BurgerFi continued approaching industry benchmarks.Consolidated food, beverage and paper expense margin improved 42 basis points compared to the prior periodConsolidated restaurant-level operating expenses increased 147 basis points compared to the prior periodNet loss improved to $10.6 million, or $(0.40) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $26.2 million, or $(1.18) per diluted share, in the prior periodAdjusted EBITDA1 of $0.7 million compared to $2.6 million in the prior period Highlights for the Fiscal Year 20231 Total revenue was $170.1 million in the fiscal year 2023 compared to $178.7 million in the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated systemwide sales decreased to $274.4 million compared to $289.6 million in the prior yearCorporate-owned restaurant same-store sales decreased 1% at Anthony’s compared to the prior yearSystemwide sales for BurgerFi decreased 7% to $148.8 million compared to the prior yearSystemwide same-store sales decreased 8% at BurgerFi compared to the prior year Opened eight new franchised BurgerFi locations, including the first dual-brand franchise location and acquired four locations from franchiseesConsolidated food, beverage and paper expense margin improved 240 basis points compared to the prior yearConsolidated restaurant-level operating expenses remained flat compared to the prior yearNet loss improved to $30.7 million, or $(1.20) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $103.4 million, or $(4.66) per diluted share, in the prior yearAdjusted EBITDA1 of $6.1 million compared to $9.2 million in the prior year Management Commentary Carl Bachmann, Chief Executive Officer of BurgerFi, stated, “2023 was a challenging year at both Anthony’s and BurgerFi but, in no way indicative of the work this new management team is doing or where we intend to take the business over time. In fact, I am more convinced than ever that Anthony’s and BurgerFi are high quality brands with great opportunities ahead and strong growth potential. Leveraging my prior experience in turnaround situations at burger and pizza concepts, I implemented five key strategic priorities when I began eight months ago which should ultimately drive long-term, profitable growth.” Bachmann continued, “Notably, we have already begun to see early leading indicators that our efforts are taking hold. While Anthony’s had a 3% decrease in same-store sales growth during the fourth quarter, it did experience a sequential improvement in same-store sales and traffic compared to the third quarter and an encouraging performance during the Christmas holidays. Like most of our peers, January was a challenging month, however, trends have improved sequentially, with March flat to slightly positive, adjusting for the Easter shift.” Christopher Jones, Chief Financial Officer of BurgerFi, added, “This new management team is working hard every day executing a sound strategy that will increase sales and improve margins over time. During the fourth quarter, top line softness pressured margins, but that did not stop us from continuing to drive labor and cost efficiency, as evidenced by the ongoing declines in payroll and corporate expense dollars. With modest investments into inventory control systems at both brands and a new POS platform at Anthony’s, we are convinced that the more work we do, driving efficiencies today, the greater margin expansion opportunity we have, as we come out of the recovery.” Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Key Metrics Summary1,2 Consolidated Quarter Ended Year Ended(in thousands, except for percentage data)January 1, 2024 January 2, 2023 January 1, 2024 January 2, 20233Systemwide Restaurant Sales$65,032 $71,626 $274,437 $289,640 Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth(8)% (2)% (5)% —%Systemwide Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(6)% (4)% (4)% (2)%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales$39,386 $41,878 $160,827 $166,198 Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales Growth(5)% 2% (3)% 6%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(5)% (1)% (4)% 2%Franchise Restaurant Sales$25,646 $29,748 $113,610 $123,442 Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth(11)% (7)% (7)% (7)%Franchise Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(8)% (8)% (6)% (6)%Digital Channel % of Systemwide Sales 32% 32% 32% 35% Quarter Ended January 1, 2024 January 2, 2023(in thousands, except for percentage data)Anthony's BurgerFi Anthony's3 BurgerFiSystemwide Restaurant Sales$31,142 $33,890 $32,962 $38,663 Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth(6)% (9)% 2% (5)%Systemwide Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(3)% (10)% 1% (9)%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales$31,085 $8,301 $32,962 $8,915 Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales Growth(6)% (4)% 2% 2%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(3)% (14)% 1% (10)%Franchise Restaurant Sales$57 $25,589 N/A $29,748 Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth 100% (11)% N/A (7)%Franchise Restaurant Same-Store Sales GrowthN/A (8)% N/A (8)%Digital Channel % of Systemwide Sales 34% 31% 35% 29% Year Ended January 1, 2024 January 2, 2023(in thousands, except for percentage data)Anthony's BurgerFi Anthony's3 BurgerFiSystemwide Restaurant Sales$125,686 $148,750 $128,819 $160,821 Systemwide Restaurant Sales Growth(2)% (7)% 5% (3)%Systemwide Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(1)% (8)% 5% (7)%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales$125,629 $35,198 $128,819 $37,379 Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales Growth(2)% (5)% 5% 10%Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same-Store Sales Growth(1)% (12)% 5% (11)%Franchise Restaurant Sales$57 $113,553 N/A $123,442 Franchise Restaurant Sales Growth 100% (7)% N/A (7)%Franchise Restaurant Same-Store Sales GrowthN/A (6)% N/A (6)%Digital Channel % of Systemwide Sales 33% 31% 37% 33% 1Refer to “Key Metrics Definitions” and “About Non-GAAP Financial Measures” sections below.2The fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 reporting periods for BurgerFi changed to 4-4-5 calendar quarters with a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the Monday nearest December 31 of each year to improve the alignment of financial and business processes following the acquisition of Anthony’s.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenue decreased 8.3% to $41.5 million compared to $45.2 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in same-store sales at BurgerFi and Anthony’s partially offset by the additional revenue from new restaurants opened during the period. For the Anthony’s brand, same-store sales for the fourth quarter decreased 3% over the prior year period. For the BurgerFi brand, same-store sales decreased 14% and 8% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively, over the prior year period. Restaurant-level operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $34.5 million compared to $36.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the Anthony's brand, restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 20 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, due to lower leverage on sales partially offset by lower food, beverage and paper costs. For the BurgerFi brand, restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 660 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower leverage on sales. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10.6 million compared to a net loss of $26.2 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower goodwill and fixed asset impairments, lower depreciation and amortization expenses, lower general and administrative expenses primarily due to lower litigation expenses partially offset by lost leverage on sales partially offset by lower food costs and other operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased $2.0 million to $0.7 million compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by lost leverage on sales partially offset by lower food costs and other operating expenses. See the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a financial measure that is a non-generally accepted accounting principle in the United States (“GAAP”), and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure below. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue in the fiscal year 2023 decreased 4.8% to $170.1 million compared to $178.7 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in same-store sales at BurgerFi and Anthony’s partially offset by the additional revenue from new corporate restaurants transferred from franchisees during the period. For the Anthony’s brand, same-store sales decreased 1% over the prior year period. For the BurgerFi brand, same-store sales decreased 12% and 6% in corporate-owned and franchised locations, respectively.

For the Anthony's brand, restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, decreased 90 basis points for fiscal year 2023, compared to the fiscal year 2022, due to lower leverage on sales partially offset by lower food, beverage and paper costs. For the BurgerFi brand, restaurant-level operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased 350 basis points for the fiscal year 2023, compared to the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower leverage on sales. Net loss in the fiscal year 2023 was $30.7 million compared to a net loss of $103.4 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lower food beverage and paper costs, lower asset impairments, lower share-based compensation expenses, lower depreciation and amortization expense, lower general and administrative expenses due to decreased litigation expense, partially offset by lower same-store sales, the absence of gains on employee retention credits, higher costs due to restructuring and lower gain on change in value of warrant liability compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA in the fiscal year 2023 decreased $3.1 million to $6.1 million compared to $9.2 million in the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to lost leverage on sales and lower systemwide restaurant sales partially offset by lower food costs and other operating expenses.

Key Metrics Definitions The following definitions apply to the terms listed below: “Systemwide Restaurant Sales” is presented as informational data in order to understand the aggregation of franchised stores sales, ghost kitchen and corporate-owned store sales performance. Systemwide Restaurant Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens and corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Systemwide Restaurant Same-Store Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants, ghost kitchens, and corporate-owned restaurants after 14 months of operations. See definition below for “Same-Store Sales”. “Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales” represent the sales generated only by corporate-owned restaurants. Corporate-Owned Restaurant Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Corporate-Owned Restaurant Same-Store Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all corporate-owned restaurants after 14 months of operations. These measures highlight the performance of existing corporate-owned restaurants. “Franchise Restaurant Sales” represent the sales generated only by franchisee-owned restaurants and are not recorded as revenue, however, the royalties based on a percentage of these franchise restaurant sales are recorded as revenue. Franchise Restaurant Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants in one period from the same period in the prior year. Franchise Restaurant Same-Store Sales growth refers to the percentage change in sales at all franchised restaurants after 14 months of operations. These measures highlight the performance of existing franchised restaurants. “Same-Store Sales” is used to evaluate the performance of our store base, which excludes the impact of new stores and closed stores, in both periods under comparison. We include a restaurant in the calculation of Same-Store Sales after 14 months of operations. A restaurant that is temporarily closed, is included in the Same-Store Sales computation. A restaurant that is closed permanently, such as upon termination of the lease, or other permanent closure, is immediately removed from the Same-Store Sales computation. Our calculation of Same-Store Sales may not be comparable to others in the industry. “Digital Channel” % of Systemwide Sales is used to measure performance of our investments made in our digital platform and partnerships with third party delivery partners. We believe our digital platform capabilities are a vital element to continuing to serve our customers and will continue to be a differentiator for the Company as compared to some of our competitors. Digital Channel as % of Systemwide Sales are indicative of the sales placed through our digital platforms and the percentage of those digital sales when compared to total sales at all our franchised and corporate-owned restaurants. “Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net loss before goodwill impairment, asset impairment charges, employee retention credits, share-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense (which includes accretion on the value of preferred stock and interest accretion on the related party note), restructuring costs, merger, acquisition and integration costs, legal settlements, store closure costs, loss (gain) on change in value of warrant liability, pre-opening costs, (gain) loss on sale of assets and income tax expense (benefit). Unless otherwise stated, Systemwide Restaurant Sales, Systemwide Sales growth, and Same-Store Sales are presented on a systemwide basis, which means they include franchise restaurants and corporate-owned restaurants. Franchise restaurant sales represent sales at all franchise restaurants and are revenues to our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues and brand royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales.

About Non-GAAP Projected Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to this non-GAAP financial measure in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors both because (1) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) it is used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.

We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from this non-GAAP financial measure and evaluating this non-GAAP financial measure together with its relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance is not being provided due to the nature of this forward-looking non-GAAP measure containing certain elements that are impractical to predict given their market-based nature, such as share-based compensation expense and gain and losses on change in value of warrant liabilities, without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, nor can we accurately predict all of the components of the applicable non-GAAP financial measure and reconciling adjustments thereto; accordingly, guidance for the corresponding GAAP measure may be materially different than guidance for the non-GAAP measure.

This performance could influence investor sentiment due to the apparent challenges in scaling operations despite the expansion of the sales infrastructure. The long sales cycles mentioned are characteristic of the industry, yet they present risks in terms of cash flow predictability and investor confidence in the short-term.However, the diversification of the product line and the increased presence in various sectors such as pharmaceuticals and homeland security suggest a strategic move to capture more market share. The introduction of new products like the SteraMist Hybrid and Transport units could potentially lead to an uptick in future revenues, aligning with the company's growth strategy, although this hinges on market acceptance and successful deployment. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial health of TOMI, the decrease in net revenue year-over-year alongside an operating and net loss widening suggests a need for careful scrutiny of their expense management and sales efficiency. The balance sheet, however, shows a relatively stable working capital position and shareholder equity, which may offer some buffer against short-term financial pressures.The convertible note financing indicates a reliance on debt for working capital, which could affect future profitability due to interest obligations. Investors might be concerned with the company's ability to manage these debts while still investing in growth initiatives. Moreover, the decrease in gross margin, attributed to product mix, requires a deeper analysis of cost structures and pricing strategies to ensure long-term sustainability. Medical Technology Industry Expert The entry into contracts with organizations like Vizient and the addition of a public health preparedness expert to the team reflect a strategic positioning within the healthcare and commercial markets. This move could potentially open up new revenue streams and partnerships, especially in a post-pandemic era where disinfection and decontamination technologies are in high demand.Additionally, the delivery of custom engineered systems to biotech and pharmaceutical companies signals an advancement in product development and a foothold in industries that have rigorous standards for cleanliness and contamination control. The growth in service revenue also points to a potentially recurring revenue model, which is favorable for long-term financial stability. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM FREDERICK, Md., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc.® (“TOMI”) (NASDAQ: TOMZ), a global company specializing in disinfection and decontamination utilizing its premier Binary Ionization Technology (BIT) platform through its SteraMist brand of products, today announced its fourth quarter and year end 2023 results.

CPS Announces Renewal of $200 Million Credit Facility,2024-04-01T20:04:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (CPSS) renews its two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P., securing loans with automobile receivables until March 31, 2026.","CPS Announces Renewal of $200 Million Credit Facility Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (CPSS) renews its two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P., securing loans with automobile receivables until March 31, 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The renewal of Consumer Portfolio Services' revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services is a strategic financial move, indicating the company's ongoing need for flexible capital to fund its operations. The use of automobile receivables as collateral is a common practice in the industry, which typically allows a company to secure lower interest rates on borrowed funds due to the reduced risk for lenders.From a liquidity standpoint, this revolving credit facility provides CPS with the ability to manage cash flow more effectively, ensuring that it has the necessary funds to support its business activities, such as purchasing new receivables from dealers. The option to either repay the loans in full or allow them to amortize over an additional two-year period after the initial term ends gives CPS a degree of financial flexibility that can be advantageous in managing its debt obligations in response to market conditions.Investors should note that the terms of such agreements are important indicators of a company's creditworthiness and the confidence of financial institutions in its business model. It's also indicative of the company's projected cash flows and its ability to service debt. However, it's important to monitor the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage to ensure that the debt remains at manageable levels. Market Research Analyst In the context of the auto finance industry, CPS's renewed credit agreement is reflective of the company's position in the market and its operational strategy. By securing a credit line backed by automobile receivables, CPS is aligning its financing strategy with its core business of lending to automobile purchasers.This move may signal to the market that CPS is anticipating growth or at least maintaining its current volume of business. The ability to borrow on a revolving basis through 2026 provides CPS with the agility to respond to market demands and opportunities as they arise, such as shifts in consumer borrowing behavior or changes in the automotive market.For stakeholders, the implications of this credit agreement extend beyond mere financial flexibility. It suggests that CPS is actively managing its risk profile and has a strategic plan for its receivables. The agreement's structure, which includes the option for amortization, also provides CPS with a mechanism to smooth out financial obligations over time, which could be beneficial in periods of economic uncertainty or fluctuating interest rates. 04/01/2024 - 04:04 PM LAS VEGAS, Nevada, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (Nasdaq: CPSS) (“CPS” or the “Company”) today announced that on March 29, 2024, it renewed its two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. Loans under the renewed credit agreement will be secured by automobile receivables that CPS now holds, will originate directly, or will purchase from dealers in the future. CPS may borrow on a revolving basis through March 31, 2026, after which CPS will have the option to repay the outstanding loans in full or to allow them to amortize through March 31, 2028. About Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. is an independent specialty finance company that provides indirect automobile financing to individuals with past credit problems or limited credit histories. We purchase retail installment sales contracts primarily from franchised automobile dealerships secured by late model used vehicles and, to a lesser extent, new vehicles. We fund these contract purchases on a long-term basis through the securitization markets and service the contracts over their lives. Forward-looking statements in this news release include the Company's expectation that the revolving period will extend for two years, and that an amortization period may follow. The revolving credit agreement renewed on March 29, 2024, provides for both a revolving period and an amortization period to follow, but it is possible that the Company may suffer certain defaults or events of default that would terminate the revolving period or result in acceleration of maturity of the credit extended. In general, such defaults or events of default would result from losses that the Company might incur in the future. In turn, such losses might result from poor performance of receivables acquired or to be acquired by the Company, from increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Company’s rights to collect payments from its portfolio; from changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; or from adverse economic conditions, either generally or in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated. Investor Relations Contact Danny Bharwani, EVP/ Chief Financial Officer949-753-6811 What was announced by Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (CPSS) on April 1, 2024? CPSS announced the renewal of its two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. Who is the lender in the renewed credit agreement for CPSS? Ares Agent Services, L.P. is the lender in the renewed credit agreement for CPSS. What will secure the loans under the renewed credit agreement for CPSS?

The company reported a net loss of $117.8 million for the full year, including a $200.0 million milestone payment. Omeros also secured $115.5 million in cash from an amended OMIDRIA royalty purchase agreement with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the recent financial results of Omeros Corporation, several key takeaways emerge. The company's reduced net loss in Q4 2023, down to $9.1 million from $37.8 million in the previous quarter, signals a tightening of financial controls and potentially more efficient operations. However, the year-over-year comparison paints a different picture, with a swing from a net income of $47.4 million in the previous year to a net loss of $117.8 million. This dramatic shift is largely attributed to the one-time $200 million milestone payment from Rayner in the previous year, which skews the comparison and highlights the volatility of relying on milestone payments for revenue.The cash influx from operations, notably the $200 million milestone and the $115.5 million from the expanded royalty interest sale to DRI, has fortified the company's cash position, allowing for debt servicing and operational investment. The strategic move to sell royalty interests to DRI extends the company's cash runway, which is a important factor for investors assessing the company's short-term liquidity and long-term financial health. However, the reduction of the base royalty rate from 50% to 30% on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA post-milestone achievement and the subsequent sale of royalty interests, may impact long-term revenue streams.Investors should note the company's proactive approach to managing its convertible notes, as evidenced by the repurchase and retirement of these debts. This not only reduces future interest obligations but also demonstrates management's commitment to maintaining a manageable debt profile. Overall, while the short-term financial position appears strengthened, the long-term revenue generation capability remains uncertain, pending the outcome of ongoing clinical trials and FDA discussions. Medical Research Analyst The clinical developments at Omeros Corporation, particularly around their lead monoclonal antibody narsoplimab, are noteworthy. The reported treatment successes in TA-TMA patients, including a durable and complete response in six out of nine patients, suggest potential for narsoplimab as a viable treatment option. Furthermore, the ability to maintain calcineurin and mTOR inhibitors during treatment could be a significant differentiator, as it addresses a major treatment management issue in stem cell transplant patients.The fully enrolled Phase 2 trials for OMS906 and the positive interim data indicate progress in the company's pipeline, potentially addressing a significant unmet need in PNH patients. The combination therapy's rapid improvement in hemoglobin and absolute reticulocyte count and the monotherapy's significant effects on hemolysis markers, are promising for patients not responding to existing treatments. These developments could enhance the company's market position if the results translate into regulatory approval and successful commercialization.From a research perspective, the ongoing discussions with FDA and the planned BLA resubmission for narsoplimab are critical. The inability to estimate the submission timeline introduces uncertainty, which is a concern for stakeholders. The company's commitment to initiating Phase 3 development programs for OMS906 in PNH and C3G by late 2024 and early 2025, respectively, indicates a strategic focus on advancing the pipeline. However, the outcome of these trials and subsequent FDA decisions will significantly influence the company's future prospects and market position. Market Research Analyst Omeros Corporation's strategic efforts to extend its cash runway into 2026 and reduce its outstanding common share count by 8% through stock repurchases reflect a concerted effort to enhance shareholder value. The company's focus on achieving regulatory approval for narsoplimab and advancing the OMS906 and OMS1029 programs demonstrates a clear commitment to driving product development forward. The high survival rates reported in pivotal trials and the compassionate use program for narsoplimab, coupled with the growing body of supporting literature, could strengthen the company's case for FDA approval.However, the market potential for narsoplimab and OMS906 hinges on successful Phase 3 trials and favorable regulatory outcomes. The company's emphasis on unlocking the value of other clinical and preclinical assets suggests a diversified approach to mitigating risk and capitalizing on multiple opportunities within its portfolio. Investors should consider the competitive landscape in immunologic disorders and the alternative complement pathway, as well as the potential market size for these treatments, when assessing the company's long-term growth potential. The upcoming presentations at major hematology conferences will likely be pivotal in shaping perceptions and expectations among stakeholders. 04/01/2024 - 04:02 PM – Conference Call Today at 4:30 p.m. ET SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Omeros Corporation (Nasdaq: OMER), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to discovering, developing and commercializing small-molecule and protein therapeutics for large-market and orphan indications targeting immunologic disorders including complement-mediated diseases, cancers, and addictive and compulsive disorders, today announced recent highlights and developments as well as financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, which include: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.1 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $37.8 million, or $0.60 per share for the third quarter of 2023. Net loss from continuing operations was $39.3 million for the 2023 fourth quarter compared to $51.7 million for the prior quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss was $117.8 million, or $1.88 per share, compared to net income of $47.4 million, or $0.76 per share, in the prior year. The 2022 results included recognition of a $200.0 million milestone that became payable by Rayner Surgical, Inc. (“Rayner”) upon the achievement of the milestone event in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $174.9 million compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $182.0 million in the prior year. Cash provided for operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $74.7 million, which includes receipt of the $200.0 million milestone payment in February 2023. In February 2024, Omeros and DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP (“DRI”) amended the OMIDRIA royalty purchase agreement to sell an expanded royalty interest to DRI, resulting in Omeros receiving $115.5 million in cash. After the amendment, DRI is entitled to receive all royalties on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA through December 31, 2031. Omeros will receive any and all royalties on ex-U.S. sales and, from and after January 1, 2032, all royalties globally. We also have the potential to receive two future milestones, each for up to $27.5 million, depending on U.S. OMIDRIA revenues. At December 31, 2023, we had $171.8 million of cash and short-term investments available for operations and debt servicing. In addition, we received the $115.5 million from DRI in February 2024. Our cash used in operations for the fourth quarter was $34.8 million. We also used cash to retire the $95.0 million outstanding on our 2023 convertible notes at maturity, $4.9 million to repurchase $9.1 million par value of our 2026 convertible notes and $4.7 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock. We continue to engage with FDA regarding the planned resubmission of our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for narsoplimab in hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (“TA-TMA”). As previously disclosed, we submitted to FDA in the fall of 2023 an analysis plan to assess already existing clinical trial data, existing data from an historical control population available from an external source, data from the narsoplimab expanded access (i.e., compassionate use) program, and data directed to the mechanism of action of narsoplimab. We are having ongoing discussions with the agency regarding the proposed analysis plan. As a result, we are currently unable to estimate when we will submit the BLA or, subsequently, FDA’s timing for a decision regarding approval. Both of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials evaluating OMS906 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) are fully enrolled and each has recently reported positive data from interim analyses. We have also initiated an extension study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of OMS906 in patients with PNH that enrolls patients who have completed either of our two Phase 2 studies without a break in OMS906 treatment. OMS906 is our MASP-3 inhibitor antibody targeting the alternative pathway of complement. Our Phase 3 development programs for OMS906 in PNH and C3G are targeted to begin in late 2024 and early 2025, respectively. “We continue pursuing diligently four major corporate priorities – those that we believe will drive substantial near-term shareholder value,” said Gregory A. Demopulos, M.D., Omeros’ chairman and chief executive officer. “The first, extending our cash runway non-dilutively into 2026, was successfully achieved through the OMIDRIA partial royalty sale to DRI Healthcare earlier this year, securing an upfront payment of $116 million and creating the opportunity to earn an additional $55 million in OMIDRIA sales-based milestones. In parallel, we reduced our outstanding common share count by 8 percent through stock repurchases. With high survival rates in our pivotal trial and in over 130 adult and pediatric patients who accessed the narsoplimab compassionate use program, together with the growing number of publications and international congress presentations detailing narsoplimab’s survival benefits in treatment-naïve TA-TMA patients as well as in those who previously failed other complement inhibitor regimens, we are continuing discussions with FDA to achieve our second corporate priority – regulatory approval of narsoplimab in TA-TMA. Success on our third and fourth corporate priorities – the initiation of well-designed and de-risked OMS906 Phase 3 and OMS1029 Phase 2 programs – appears likely. Beyond these four priorities, the team is working hard to unlock the value in our other clinical and preclinical assets. We expect those committed efforts and focus to continue driving shareholder value for our investors now and in the months ahead.” Fourth Quarter and Recent Clinical Developments Recent developments regarding narsoplimab, our lead monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-2 (“MASP-2”), include the following: In February 2024, a report detailing treatment with narsoplimab in nine adult patients with TA-TMA was featured as a poster presentation at the 2024 Tandem Meetings – the Transplantation & Cellular Therapy Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. The report was authored by an external group of U.S. investigators involved in treating these patients with narsoplimab provided under Omeros’ expanded access or compassionate use program. Six of the nine patients receiving narsoplimab treatment demonstrated a durable and complete response to narsoplimab. In March 2024, investigators at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center published a report in Bone Marrow Transplantation describing, for the first time, achievement of a complete response to narsoplimab treatment while maintaining the use of calcineurin inhibitors, or CNIs, and mTOR inhibitors in a high-risk TA-TMA patient. CNIs and mTOR inhibitors are used to prevent life-threatening graft-versus-host disease, or GvHD, in stem cell transplant patients, however, they are also known to potentiate TA-TMA. Withdrawal of these agents has historically been considered the first step in managing TA-TMA, however this presents greater risk of GvHD-related mortality. The ability to successfully treat TA-TMA with narsoplimab without withdrawing these GvHD-preventing agents would represent a further significant advance of the drug in the management of TA-TMA. A panel of international experts is preparing to author an additional publication, detailing the survival benefits of narsoplimab in over 130 TA-TMA patients under our expanded access program. Recent developments regarding OMS1029, our long-acting, next-generation MASP-2 inhibitor, include: Dosing has been completed in the second of two planned cohorts of our ongoing Phase 1 multiple-ascending-dose study of OMS1029 in healthy volunteers. A single-ascending-dose Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in early 2023 and showed that OMS1029 was well-tolerated with no safety concerns identified. We expect the multiple-ascending dose study to conclude in mid-2024. We continue to evaluate several large market indications for Phase 2 of clinical development of OMS1029 and expect to select an indication for Phase 2 development in the third quarter of 2024. Recent developments regarding OMS906, our lead monoclonal antibody targeting mannan-binding lectin-associated serine protease-3 (“MASP-3”), the key activator of the alternative pathway, include: Our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating OMS906 in PNH patients who have had an unsatisfactory response to the C5 inhibitor ravulizumab is fully enrolled with 13 patients. Results from a pre-specified interim analysis of showed that OMS906 administered in combination with ravulizumab resulted in rapid improvement in hemoglobin levels and absolute reticulocyte count. The study has a “switch-over” design and enrolls PNH patients receiving ravulizumab, adds OMS906 to provide combination therapy with ravulizumab for 24 weeks, and then provides OMS906 monotherapy in patients who demonstrate a hemoglobin response with combination therapy. The interim analysis data from the combination therapy portion of the trial showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both mean hemoglobin levels and absolute reticulocyte counts by week 4 of combination therapy, with a sustained response demonstrated through week 24 (the latest assessment prior to the interim analysis cutoff). The interim analysis data demonstrate that in patients experiencing substantial extravascular hemolysis while on ravulizumab monotherapy the addition of OMS906 was well tolerated with no safety signals of concern. Further, the rapid improvement in hemoglobin and the reduction in absolute reticulocyte count following OMS906 therapy demonstrate that OMS906 prevents extravascular hemolysis. Full details from the interim analysis are expected to be presented at a major hematology conference in mid-2024. Interim analysis data from the monotherapy portion of the trial are expected to be available in late 2024. Our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating OMS906 in PNH patients who have not previously been treated with a complement inhibitor is also fully enrolled with 11 patients. In December 2023, new and updated interim analysis data from this trial were featured as an oral presentation at the annual congress of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH. The presentation described the clinically meaningful and statistically significant effects of OMS906 observed across all measured markers of hemolysis, including hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (“LDH”), and red blood cell clone size in PNH patients. This latest analysis reported that all enrolled patients achieved increases in hemoglobin of at least 2 grams per deciliter. Additionally, all 9 patients who did not have myelodysplastic syndrome, a condition causing bone marrow failure, achieved an absolute hemoglobin greater than 12 grams per deciliter. No patients were reported to have had a clinical breakthrough of PNH or a thrombotic event, and none were reported to require a transfusion while receiving OMS906 treatment. Two abstracts have been submitted and are expected to be presented at a major hematology conference in mid-2024. The first is directed to clinical pharmacology of OMS906 and elucidates the effect of OMS906 on MASP-3 and resultant blockade on alternative pathway activity. The second describes population PK/PD models that predict exposure-response relationships for OMS906 versus mature factor D, hemoglobin and LDH. We have initiated an extension study to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of OMS906 in patients with PNH. Enrolled patients who have completed one of our two PNH Phase 2 studies evaluating OMS906 will move directly into the extension study without interruption of treatment. Data from this study will support a planned BLA for OMS906 in PNH. In February, we met with FDA to discuss our development program for OMS906 in PNH. We presented clinical and nonclinical data and requested input on expectations for Phase 3 studies and BLA submission. FDA confirmed that the scope of our nonclinical program is sufficient to support Phase 3 studies and provided input on dosing and design of the proposed Phase 3 studies to support a BLA in PNH. We expect to meet again with FDA later this year to discuss further details of the design of our Phase 3 studies. We are targeting to initiate our Phase 3 development program evaluating OMS906 for treatment of PNH in late 2024. Our Phase 2 clinical program evaluating OMS906 in patients with complement 3 glomerulopathy (“C3G”) is also underway. Although delayed by a protocol amendment to change the OMS906 dose based on information learned from our PNH programs, multiple clinical sites now are open and patients are being screened for enrollment. Recent developments regarding OMS527, our phosphodiesterase 7 (“PDE7”) inhibitor program focused on addictions and compulsive disorders as well as movement disorders, include: Funded by a three-year, $6.69 million grant awarded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) in April 2023 we continue to pursue development of our lead orally administered PDE7 inhibitor compound for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (“CUD”). The grant is intended to support a preclinical cocaine interaction study, which we expect to complete by the end of 2024, as well as a randomized, placebo-controlled, inpatient clinical study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of OMS527 in patients with CUD. Previously, a Phase 1 clinical trial of the study drug in healthy subjects was successfully completed. Together with collaborators at Emory University, we continue to evaluate the potential of our PDE7 inhibitors to treat levodopa-induced dyskinesias (“LID”). LID is caused by prolonged treatment with levodopa (“L-DOPA”), the most prescribed treatment for the over 10 million patients with Parkinson’s disease worldwide. LID is reported to affect approximately 50 percent of Parkinson's patients who have been treated for five or more years with L-DOPA. The only approved treatment for LID is marginally effective and fraught with safety issues. Financial Results Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.1 million, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss in the prior quarter of $37.8 million, or $0.60 per share. Net loss from continuing operations was $39.3 million in the current quarter compared to a net loss of $51.7 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter net loss from continuing operations included a $4.1 million gain on the early extinguishment of $9.1 million par value of our 2026 convertible notes. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, our net loss was $117.8 million, or $1.88 per share, compared to net income of $47.4 million, or $0.76 per share, in the prior year period. The primary difference between the periods was the achievement of the $200.0 million OMIDRIA milestone event in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is reported as a component of discontinued operations. Net loss from continuing operations for the full year ended December 31, 2023, was $174.9 million compared to a loss of $182.0 million in the prior year. Cash provided for operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $74.7 million, which includes receipt of the $200.0 million milestone payment in February 2023. This compares to cash used in operations of $86.5 million for the prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2023, we earned OMIDRIA royalties of $10.7 million on Rayner’s U.S. net sales of $35.7 million. This compares to earned OMIDRIA royalties of $10.0 million during the third quarter on U.S. net sales of $33.3 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we earned OMIDRIA royalties of $40.6 million on Rayner’s U.S. net sales of $135.3 million. This compares to earned OMIDRIA royalties of $65.4 million on U.S. net sales of $130.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The difference in earned royalties reflects the decrease from 50 percent to 30 percent in the base royalty rate applicable to U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA, which occurred in December 2022 upon achievement of the $200.0 million milestone event. In February 2024, Omeros and DRI entered into an amended and restated royalty purchase agreement under which Omeros sold to DRI an expanded interest in royalties payable by Rayner based on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA. Omeros received $115.5 million in cash for the expanded royalty interest and is also eligible to receive two future milestone payments, each up to $27.5 million, based on achievement of certain thresholds for U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA. The amendment eliminated the annual caps on payments to which DRI's purchased royalty interest was previously subject and provides that DRI will now receive all royalties on U.S. net sales of OMIDRIA payable between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2031. Omeros retains the right to receive all royalties on any net sales of OMIDRIA outside the U.S. and, after December 31, 2031, to all royalties on OMIDRIA net sales globally. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $39.8 million compared to $48.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of employee compensation costs and payment of a development milestone under a technology license in the third quarter of 2023. Interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.1 million compared to $7.9 million during the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to retiring $95.0 million of our 2023 convertible notes upon maturity in November 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we earned $3.4 million in interest and other income compared to $4.4 million in the third quarter. The decrease was due to lower average balances available to invest due to the retirement of the 2023 convertible notes. Net income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $30.2 million, or $0.48 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $13.9 million, or $0.22 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. The difference was primarily attributable to a $16.1 million increase in remeasurement adjustments on the OMIDRIA contract royalty asset in the current quarter. At December 31, 2023, we had $171.8 million of cash and short-term investments available for operations and debt service. In addition, we received the $115.5 million from DRI in February 2024. Our cash used in operations for the fourth quarter was $34.8 million. We also used cash to retire the $95.0 million outstanding on our 2023 convertible notes at maturity, $4.9 million to repurchase $9.1 million par value of our 2026 convertible notes and $4.7 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares of our common stock. We expect our first quarter net loss to be $34.0 to $37.0 million or $0.58 to $0.63 loss per share. As of March 31, 2024, we expect our cash and investments balance available for operations and debt service to be approximately $230.0 million after repurchasing 3.2 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $11.9 million during the first quarter. Our total common stock outstanding at March 31, 2024 is 57,942,695.

We are particularly pleased to see all three of our businesses attaining higher revenue over the prior year,” commented Dr. Jun Ma, President and Chief Executive Officer of Vaso Corporation. “Net income for the year was $4.8 million, despite additional significant investments during the year on a new program in the professional sales service segment, on product development efforts in the equipment segment, and on corporate undertakings such as investment banking activities, etc. We believe these investments and initiatives will lead to further growth of our businesses and increase the shareholder value of the Company.” “The Company continued to generate positive cashflow from operating activities, at a rate of $5.3 million during fiscal year 2023, resulting in a strong balance sheet with $25.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of 2023,” Dr. Ma continued. “Deferred revenue at the end of 2023 was $32.2 million, an increase of $1.4 million when compared to the end of 2022, which will turn into recognized revenue in future periods upon completion of delivery of the underlying products or services.” “Based on the resources presently available and potentially in the future, the management is working on growth strategies for all areas of our diversified business portfolio, including seeking opportunities for new partnerships and accretive acquisitions. We look forward to delivering more exciting developments in the Company with continued growth and profitability in 2024,” concluded Dr. Ma. Achari Business Combination Agreement As previously announced, the Company entered into a business combination agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), dated as of December 6, 2023, with Achari Ventures Holdings Corp. I, a Delaware corporation (“Achari”) (NASDAQ: AVHI), and Achari Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Achari (“Merger Sub”). The Business Combination Agreement provides, among other things, that on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Achari. Upon the closing of the Business Combination Agreement (the “Closing”), we anticipate that Achari will change its name to “Vaso Holdings Corp.” or an alternative name chosen by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Achari (“New Vaso”). The Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement are hereinafter referred to collectively as the “Business Combination”. Upon the Closing, New Vaso would have authorized shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The Business Combination Agreement establishes a pro forma equity value of the Company at approximately $176 million, at $10.00 per share of Class A common stock. As such, we believe that the current Vaso stockholders would receive approximately 17.6 million shares of Class A common stock and the current Achari shareholders would maintain between 500 thousand and 750 thousand shares of Class A common stock depending on Achari’s unpaid expenses at the Closing and presuming the redemption of all outstanding public shares of Achari on or prior to the Closing. In addition, current Achari warrant holders would have outstanding warrants to purchase a minimum of 8.25 million shares of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. No shares of Class B common stock are expected to be outstanding immediately after the Business Combination. The Boards of Directors of Vaso and Achari have each approved the Business Combination, the consummation of which is subject to various customary closing conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented, the “Registration Statement”) by Achari with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the filing of a proxy statement by Vaso with the SEC and clearance by the SEC, and the approval of a majority of shareholders of both Achari and Vaso of the proposed business combination (Vaso shareholders representing approximately 44% of Vaso’s outstanding shares have entered into support agreements committing them to vote in favor of the Business Combination). The Business Combination is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Financial Results for Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenue decreased by 5.6% to $21.9 million from $23.2 million for the same period of 2022 due to lower revenues in all our segments. Revenue in our IT segment decreased by $0.4 million, or 4.4%, to $9.8 million as the result of lower recurring services during the quarter; revenue in our equipment segment decreased by $82 thousand, or 10.4%, to $0.7 million due to lower equipment sales in China in the quarter; and revenue in our professional sales service segment decreased by $0.8 million, or 6.4%, to $11.4 million due to lower incentive commission revenue when compared to the prior year, partially offset by higher delivery of underlying equipment. We anticipate that revenue will improve in all three business segments, as we expect growth from new business in the IT segment, higher delivery of underlying equipment in our professional sales service segment resulting from strong order bookings in 2023, and continued recovery of our China operations from COVID lockdowns. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 4.0% to $14.1 million, compared with a gross profit of $14.6 million for the same quarter of 2022. This decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in revenue. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by 14.7% to $12.9 million, compared to $11.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and travel costs in the professional sales service segment mainly as a result of the new program launched in 2023 which we anticipate will lead to increased revenue in 2024. SG&A expenses were 58.9% and 48.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $1.1 million, compared with a net income of $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and an increase in SG&A costs in 2023 as well as to the recognition of a $4.8 million tax benefit resulting from a reduction in the reserve for deferred tax assets in 2022. Financial Results for Year Ended December 31, 2023 For the year ended December 31, 2023, revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 2.2%, to $81.0 million when compared with $79.3 million of revenue for the year 2022. Revenue in our IT segment increased by 0.7% to $40.4 million for the year 2023, from 2022 revenue of $40.1 million, primarily due to an increase in revenue in the healthcare IT business. Commission revenues in our professional sales service segment increased by $1.2 million, or 3.3%, to $37.8 million in the year 2023, compared to $36.6 million in 2022, primarily as the result of higher equipment deliveries by our partner and higher blended commission rates for the equipment delivered during the year. Equipment segment revenue for the year 2023 increased by 10.1% to $2.8 million, from $2.6 million in 2022, due to higher ARCS®-cloud software-as-a-service revenues partially offset by lower reported product sales in our China operations due to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2023. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by 5.6% to $50.6 million, from $47.9 million in 2022, as a result of the higher revenue in our professional sales service segment and improved margin in our IT segment. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by $4.8 million, or 11.8%, to $45.6 million, or 56.3% of revenue, compared with $40.8 million, or 51.5% of revenue, for the same period in 2022. The increase resulted primarily from an increase of $3.4 million in personnel and travel costs in the professional sales service segment, including for the launch of a new program in 2023 which we anticipate will lead to increased revenue in 2024, and a $0.8 million increase in corporate expenses resulting from an increase in investment banking costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had net income of $4.8 million compared to net income of $11.3 million in 2022, a decrease of $6.5 million due to higher operating expenses in 2023 as referenced above, and the income tax benefit of $4.8 million recognized in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation) was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the lower reported net income. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2023 was $5.3 million, compared to net cash provided from operating activities of $14.4 million in 2022. The decrease is principally due to the decrease in profitability. Net cash and short-term investments increased to $25.3 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $20.3 million at December 31, 2022. Deferred revenue increased to $32.2 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $30.8 million at December 31, 2022. The increase is primarily the result of order bookings exceeding equipment deliveries in the professional sales service segment. Deferred revenue will be recognized in the future when the underlying equipment or services are delivered and accepted at the customer site.

Negative Net loss increased from $13.6 million in 2022 to $14.5 million in 2023. The company ended 2023 with a decreased cash balance compared to 2022. Research grant revenue decreased from $0.5 million in 2022 to $0.1 million in 2023. Market Research Analyst The granting of a global commercial license to Vision Bioenergy by Yield10 Bioscience for the production of Camelina feedstock oil for biofuels represents a strategic move within the agricultural bioscience and renewable energy sectors. This development taps into the increasing demand for sustainable biofuels, particularly in the aviation, maritime and heavy-duty transport industries. The biofuel market is poised for growth due to global decarbonization efforts and the transition towards renewable energy sources. The license agreement, which includes $3 million in cash payments to Yield10, can potentially provide a new revenue stream and strengthen the company's financial position in the medium to long term.Additionally, Yield10's focus on commercializing omega-3 Camelina oil for aquafeed and nutritional markets aligns with the rising consumer demand for omega-3 fatty acids, recognized for their health benefits. The regulatory clearance for planting omega-3 Camelina in Canada and the anticipated approval in Chile could accelerate market penetration and revenue generation. However, the company's financial health, as evidenced by a decrease in unrestricted cash and investments from $4.3 million to $1.1 million year-over-year, raises concerns about its ability to sustain operations and investments without additional funding sources. Investors should monitor Yield10's execution of its development and commercialization plans, as delays or failures could impact the company's financial viability and stock performance. Financial Analyst Yield10 Bioscience's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, reveal a reduction in cash usage for operating activities from $11.4 million to $10.1 million, indicating a more disciplined approach to cash flow management. This is a positive signal for cost-conscious investors, as the company appears to be streamlining operations and delaying payments to conserve cash. However, the net loss of $14.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to a net loss of $13.6 million in 2022, reflects ongoing financial challenges. The reported increase in research and development expenses due to higher crop trial and seed production costs is noteworthy because it suggests investment in product development, which could lead to future revenue growth if successful.The $3.0 million cash proceeds from the commercial license agreement with Vision Bioenergy and the $1.2 million raised from a warrant inducement transaction in early 2024 provide a temporary financial cushion. Still, the company's ability to achieve profitability is uncertain and depends on the successful commercialization of its Camelina products. The reduction in grant revenue from $0.5 million to $0.1 million also indicates a potential need for Yield10 to diversify its funding sources to mitigate the impact of fluctuating grant contributions on its financial stability. Agricultural Biotechnology Expert Yield10 Bioscience's advancements in agricultural biotechnology, particularly the development of Camelina varieties with enhanced traits such as herbicide tolerance (HT) and increased omega-3 oil production, are significant. These innovations could improve crop performance, yield and value, which are critical factors for widespread adoption among growers. The regulatory achievements, including the positive response from USDA-APHIS for the proprietary elite Camelina varieties and the determination by the CFIA that E3902 Camelina is not a Plant with Novel Trait (PNT), reduce barriers to market entry and facilitate the path to commercial scale planting.However, the success of these biotechnological advancements hinges on Yield10's ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and secure partnerships for commercialization. The strategic focus on the aquafeed and nutritional markets for omega-3 products is well-founded, given the established health benefits and market demand for these fatty acids. The integration of HT and omega-3 traits to produce new Camelina varieties could further enhance the crop's marketability and appeal to a broader range of end-users. The company's efforts to establish a closed-loop production system, from seed supply to oil and meal sale, demonstrate a comprehensive approach to value chain management that could lead to increased efficiency and profitability in the long run. 04/01/2024 - 04:01 PM -Granted global commercial license to Vision Bioenergy for Camelina addressing the biofuel market-Advanced regulatory and seed scale-up program for omega-3 Camelina-E3902 oil trait in Camelina cleared by regulatory authority for planting in Canada-Management will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. (ET) to review financial results and provide a corporate update WOBURN, Mass., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Yield10 Bioscience, Inc. (Nasdaq:YTEN) (""Yield10"" or the ""Company""), an agricultural bioscience company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. ""In 2023 we successfully executed our plan and achieved several key milestones that position Yield10 to build a sustainable products business based on engineered Camelina,"" said Oliver Peoples, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Yield10. ""Our crop innovations are intended to support grower adoption of the crop and enable commercial-scale planting to produce Camelina oil and meal products targeting significant market opportunities. ""We believe Camelina represents a game changer for producing omega-3 oil and meal products. In early 2024, we made the strategic decision to focus our resources on the commercialization of Camelina products targeting the aquafeed and nutritional markets for omega-3 fatty acids. In the year ahead, we plan to focus on executing our development program for omega-3 Camelina, building seed inventory in anticipation of commercial scale planting, obtaining regulatory approval to sell omega-3 oil for aquafeed in Chile, and engaging with potential commercial partners to enable future commercial sale of omega-3 oil and meal in target markets. If all goes according to plan, we estimate that our omega-3 products could begin producing revenue as early as 2025. “We also recently achieved significant regulatory milestones supporting our commercial plans. USDA-APHIS completed review of our herbicide tolerance (“HT”) and omega-3 traits enabling us to plan for the commercial ramp-up of engineered Camelina varieties containing these traits in the U.S. We believe herbicide tolerance will be a significant factor in driving the adoption of Camelina. Our team is creating a portfolio of Camelina varieties incorporating these traits and others to improve the performance and value of the crop. ""In early 2024, Yield10 granted to Vision Bioenergy Oilseeds (“VISION”) a global license to certain proprietary varieties of Camelina for the production of feedstock oil for biofuels. This agreement is intended to empower farmers to capitalize on the growing biofuel market while advancing the decarbonization goals of aviation, maritime, and heavy-duty transport industries. Yield10 plans to work with biofuel players to support the production of Camelina feedstock oil. “In 2023 we demonstrated closed-loop production of Camelina as we supplied our seed to growers under contract and arranged the offtake and sale of the grain to a biofuel refiner. We intend to continue to build relationships across the value chain to support increasing scale of Camelina production and sale of oil and meal into target markets. ""In the coming months, we expect to execute on our commercial and regulatory plan to produce omega-3 oil and meal products in Camelina, to combine our HT and omega-3 traits to produce new Camelina varieties, and to continue to support grower adoption of Camelina,"" said Dr. Peoples. Recent Accomplishments Recent progress by Yield10 is underscored by the key milestones achieved during 2023 and is setting the direction for the Company’s business strategy in 2024, including: Yield10 planted omega-3 (EPA) Camelina at the 50 acre-scale in Chile to produce oil for use in business development activities. The crop was harvested in early 2024. In March of 2024, USDA-APHIS provided a positive response to the Company's announced filings for two requests for a Regulatory Status Review (RSR) with USDA-APHIS's Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) under the SECURE Rule for proprietary elite Camelina varieties containing genes enabling the plant to produce the EPA and EPA+DHA components of omega-3 oil. Yield10 plans to conduct seed scale-up activities with omega-3 Camelina in 2024. Omega-3 fatty acids are used in aquafeed as well as for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical products. In November of 2023, USDA-APHIS determined that Yield10’s glufosinate tolerant Camelina as well as its stacked herbicide tolerant Camelina may be planted and bred in the United States in response to two Requests for Regulatory Status Review (“RSRs”) packages submitted by Yield10. An application to add Camelina to a glufosinate label is pending with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In early 2024, Yield10 granted to Vision Bioenergy Oilseeds a global license to certain proprietary varieties of Camelina for the production of feedstock oil for biofuels. Commercial production of Camelina is currently ramping up in North America as a source of ultra-low carbon feedstock oil for the biofuel industry. In consideration for the license and completion of certain deliverables, Vision will make cash payments to Yield10 totaling $3 million. We recently reported encouraging results from the first field testing of our winter HT and Stacked HT Camelina varieties. We expect to harvest the winter field test plantings later this year and conduct an evaluation of seed yield, oil content, herbicide tolerance and overall agronomy. In early 2024, the Plant Biosafety Office (“PBO”) of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) reviewed information on the Company’s E3902 Camelina sativa (“Camelina”) and determined that E3902 is not a Plant with Novel Trait (PNT) and is not subject to a pre-market notification under Part V of the Seeds Regulations. Yield10’s E3902 Camelina combines genome edits in three proprietary genetic traits, C3008a, C3008b and C3009, that result in an increase in oil production by five percent. In 2023, Yield10 successfully demonstrated the supply chain from seed to growers contracts to oil and meal offtake to customers. In the fall of 2023, Yield10 signed growers contracts representing approximately 1,200 acres of winter Camelina production which is expected to be harvested in the third quarter of 2024. FULL YEAR AND FOURTH QUARTER 2023 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Cash Position Yield10 is managed with an emphasis on cash flow and deploys its financial resources in a disciplined manner to achieve its key strategic objectives. Yield10 used $10.1 million in cash for its operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 in comparison to $11.4 million used for operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company ended 2023 with $1.1 million in unrestricted cash and investments in comparison to a balance of $4.3 in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in cash usage for operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, in comparison to the previous year, was the result of our decision to delay payments to vendors and conserve cash as we continued our Camelina biofuels and omega-3 business development activities. In February of 2024, we granted a commercial license to VISION Bioenergy Oilseeds, LLC, for certain proprietary varieties of Camelina for the production of feedstock oil for biofuels. Cash proceeds from the arrangement total $3.0 million. In March of 2024, we raised $1.2 million, net in a warrant inducement transaction. Operating Results Research grant revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $0.1 million in comparison to grant revenue of $0.5 million recorded in the previous year. Early in 2023, our work in support of a five-year DOE sub-award through Michigan State University was completed with no further grant revenue to be recognized. Research and development expense was $8.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.5 million, in comparison to $7.8 million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the increased cost of crop trials and commercial seed production, partially offset by lower employee compensation and benefits expenses as we implemented cost cutting measures during the year. General and administrative expenses were consistent at $6.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Yield10 reported a net loss of $14.5 million, or $1.82 per share for the full year 2023, as compared to a net loss of $13.6 million, or $2.76 per share in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2023, research and development expense increased by $0.1 million from $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $2.0 million. General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million to $1.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, from $1.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Yield10 reported a loss after taxes of $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, or $0.27 per share, compared to a similar loss after taxes of $3.3 million, or $0.67 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022.

The company plans to initiate Phase 2 trial for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with MSS CRC. Xilio granted Gilead exclusive license for XTX301, expecting cash runway into Q2 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Biotech Financial Analyst The licensing agreement between Xilio Therapeutics and Gilead Sciences for XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12, represents a strategic move with substantial financial implications. The upfront payment of $30.0 million, alongside an equity investment of approximately $13.5 million, provides immediate liquidity and validates Xilio's research. The potential for up to $604.0 million in additional payments, contingent on development and sales milestones, suggests confidence in the drug candidate's prospects. However, investors should note the risk associated with the transition fee clause, which could lead to termination of the agreement if Gilead opts out after reviewing clinical data packages.The anticipated cash runway into Q2 2025 indicates a stable financial position in the short-term, reducing immediate dilution risk for shareholders. Yet, the long-term success hinges on clinical trial outcomes and the ability to bring these therapies to market. The discontinuation of XTX202 as a monotherapy and workforce reduction might be seen as cost-saving measures, but they also reflect a narrowing of focus that could affect the company's diversification strategy. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of Phase 2 trials for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab for MSS CRC is a significant step forward in Xilio's clinical pipeline. MSS CRC is a challenging indication with limited effective therapies and the combination approach could potentially offer a new treatment paradigm. The Fc-enhanced anti-CTLA-4 mechanism is designed to deplete regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment, which is a novel approach that could have implications for immunotherapy across various cancer types.Moreover, the engineered IL-12 molecule, XTX301, aims to reprogram 'cold' tumors to a 'hot' state, enhancing the immune system's ability to attack cancer cells. The dose escalation trials have so far shown tolerability at doses significantly higher than the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant human IL-12, which is an encouraging sign for its therapeutic window and potential efficacy. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly competitive, with immuno-oncology being a particularly active area of development. Xilio's focus on tumor-activated therapies positions the company within a niche that is garnering significant interest. The strategic partnership with Gilead provides not only financial backing but also a validation of Xilio's technology platform. However, the success of Xilio's candidates, such as XTX101 and XTX301, will ultimately depend on their clinical efficacy and safety profiles compared to existing treatments and other products in the pipeline.Market dynamics for cancer immunotherapies are evolving, with a trend towards combination therapies that could improve patient outcomes. Xilio's strategy to design tumor-activated bispecifics and immune cell engagers aligns with this trend, potentially opening up broader applications for their technology. Nevertheless, the market will closely watch the upcoming Phase 2 data for XTX101 and early data for XTX301, as these will be critical in assessing the company's future prospects. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM On track with plans to initiate Phase 2 trial for XTX101, a tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced anti-CTLA-4, in combination with atezolizumab in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) in the third quarter of 2024 Granted Gilead exclusive license to develop and commercialize XTX301, a tumor-activated IL-12 Anticipates cash runway into the second quarter of 2025 WALTHAM, Mass., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xilio Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: XLO), a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering and developing tumor-activated immuno-oncology therapies for people living with cancer, today announced pipeline progress and business updates and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “With our recently announced partnership with Gilead for XTX301, our tumor-activated IL-12, and additional financing from existing investors, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to advance our differentiated pipeline of tumor-activated I-O therapies and achieve potential near-term clinical milestones and value-drivers,” said René Russo, Pharm.D., president and chief executive officer of Xilio. “Looking ahead, we are focused on rapidly advancing clinical development for XTX301 and XTX101, our tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced anti-CTLA-4, with anticipated clinical data for each of these programs later this year, as well as continuing to leverage our novel research platform to design and develop tumor-activated bispecific and immune cell engager molecules.” Pipeline and Business Updates XTX101: tumor-activated anti-CTLA-4 XTX101 is an investigational tumor-activated, Fc-enhanced, high affinity binding anti-CTLA-4 designed to block CTLA-4 and deplete regulatory T cells when activated (unmasked) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). XTX101 is currently being evaluated in combination with atezolizumab in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors. Xilio today reaffirmed plans to: Select a recommended Phase 2 dose for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in the second quarter of 2024.Subject to the results of the Phase 1 combination dose escalation portion of the trial, initiate the Phase 2 portion of the trial for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in patients with microsatellite stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) in the third quarter of 2024.Report initial Phase 2 data for XTX101 in combination with atezolizumab in approximately 20 patients with MSS CRC in the fourth quarter of 2024 and in approximately 20 additional patients (40 patients total) in the first quarter of 2025. XTX301: tumor-activated, engineered IL-12 XTX301 is an investigational tumor-activated, engineered IL-12 molecule designed to potently stimulate anti-tumor immunity and reprogram the TME of poorly immunogenic “cold” tumors towards an inflamed, or “hot,” state. In March 2024, Xilio and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) announced an exclusive license agreement for Xilio’s tumor-activated IL-12 program, including XTX301. Under the terms of the agreement: Xilio is eligible to receive $43.5 million in upfront payments, including a cash payment of $30.0 million and an initial equity investment by Gilead of approximately $13.5 million in Xilio common stock. The initial equity investment closed on March 28, 2024, and the $30.0 million upfront cash payment is payable by Gilead within a specified time period promptly following signing of the license agreement.Xilio will be eligible to receive up to $604.0 million in additional contingent payments, including proceeds from up to three additional equity investments by Gilead, a $75.0 million transition fee and specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. Xilio will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from high single digits to mid-teens on annual global net product sales.Prior to the potential transition fee, Xilio is eligible to receive up to a total of $29.0 million in additional equity investments and a development milestone payment.Xilio will be responsible for conducting clinical development for XTX301 in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial through dose expansion. Following the delivery by Xilio of a specified clinical data package for XTX301, Gilead can elect to transition responsibilities for the development and commercialization of XTX301 to Gilead, subject to the terms of the agreement and payment by Gilead of the $75.0 million transition fee. If Gilead elects not to transition responsibilities for development and commercialization of the licensed products and pay the transition fee, then the license agreement will automatically terminate. For more information, read the press release here. XTX301 is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 dose escalation in patients with advanced solid tumors. In January 2024, Xilio reported encouraging preliminary safety data into the third dose level in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial. As of the data cutoff date of January 5, 2024, XTX301 had been administered at doses up to 45 ug/kg, which is nearly 100 times the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant human IL-12, and was generally well-tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities observed.Xilio today reaffirmed plans to report Phase 1 safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for XTX301 in patients with advanced solid tumors in the fourth quarter of 2024. XTX202: tumor-activated, engineered IL-2 XTX202 is an investigational tumor-activated, beta-gamma biased IL-2 designed to potently stimulate CD8+ effector T cells and natural killer (NK) cells without concomitant stimulation of regulatory T cells when activated (unmasked) in the tumor microenvironment. In March 2024, Xilio announced additional data from its Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating XTX202 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or unresectable or metastatic melanoma. For more information, read the press release here.Together with previously reported data, Xilio believes these additional data further validate the company’s tumor-activated approach and support the broad potential for XTX202 as a combination therapy. Xilio plans to explore strategic opportunities to continue to develop XTX202 in combination with other agents. Tumor-Activated Bispecific and Immune Cell Engager Programs In March 2024, Xilio announced plans to focus its research-stage development efforts on tumor-activated bispecifics and immune cell engagers, including tumor-activated cell engagers and tumor-activated effector-enhanced cell engagers. Preclinical data from the company’s first bispecific program, XTX501, a tumor-activated PD-1/IL-2 bispecific development candidate, will be featured at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego, California from April 5-10, 2024. Presentation title: A tumor-activated PD1/IL2 bispecific molecule, designed to overcome IL-2 receptor-mediated clearance, improve tolerability and stimulate antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment of murine modelsSession date and time: Sunday, April 7, 2024, at 1:30 pm to 5:00 pm P.T.Abstract number: 719Poster board number: 5 Corporate Updates In March 2024, Xilio announced a private placement equity financing with certain existing accredited investors, including Bain Capital Life Sciences and Rock Springs Capital. Xilio anticipates receiving aggregate gross proceeds from the private placement of approximately $11.3 million, before deducting placement agent fees and expenses payable by the company. The private placement is expected to close on April 2, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Xilio expects to use the proceeds from the private placement to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes.In March 2024, Xilio announced plans to implement a strategic portfolio prioritization designed to focus its resources on rapidly advancing clinical development for XTX301 and XTX101 and leveraging the company’s promising research platform to advance differentiated tumor-activated bispecific and immune cell engager molecules. As part of the strategic portfolio reprioritization, Xilio also announced plans to discontinue further investment in XTX202 as a monotherapy and implement an approximately 21% workforce reduction. Year-End and Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: Cash and cash equivalents were $44.7 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $120.4 million as of December 31, 2022.Research & Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $11.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $15.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. R&D expenses were $52.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by decreases in manufacturing activities, XTX301 preclinical development activities, XTX101 clinical activities and personnel-related costs. These decreases were partially offset by increases in XTX301 and XTX202 clinical activities.General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $6.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. G&A expenses were $27.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $29.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by decreases in professional and consulting fees, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and stock-based compensation expenses.Net Loss: Net loss was $17.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $22.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net loss was $76.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $88.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Financial Guidance Based on its current operating plans, Xilio anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, together with (i) the $30.0 million upfront payment under the license agreement with Gilead, (ii) the approximately $13.5 million in proceeds from the initial private placement with Gilead, which closed on March 28, 2024, and (iii) the approximately $11.3 million in proceeds from the private placement, which is expected to close on April 2, 2024 (subject to customary closing conditions), and after giving effect to (a) one-time costs and anticipated future cost savings associated with Xilio’s strategic portfolio reprioritization and workforce reduction announced in March 2024 and (b) the repayment in the first quarter of 2024 of the outstanding loan balance under Xilio’s loan and security agreement with Pacific Western Bank, will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2025.

Air Industries Group Reports Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results and Initial 2024 Business Outlook,2024-04-01T20:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Air Industries Group (AIRI) reports strong Q4 2023 earnings with record net sales and operating income, along with a positive 2024 business outlook.","Air Industries Group Reports Preliminary Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results and Initial 2024 Business Outlook Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Air Industries Group (AIRI) reports strong Q4 2023 earnings with record net sales and operating income, along with a positive 2024 business outlook. Positive Record net sales and operating income in Q4 2023. Highest Adjusted EBITDA for the year. Positive 2024 business outlook. Strong bookings and expanding opportunities. Negative None. Financial Analyst The preliminary earnings results for Air Industries Group indicate a positive trajectory in terms of revenue and profitability, as highlighted by the highest net sales and operating income for the fourth quarter. This performance suggests a solid financial position and operational efficiency that could be attractive to investors. The strong bookings and expanding opportunities mentioned may imply a healthy backlog and future revenue streams, which are critical for sustained growth in the aerospace and defense sectors.However, it is essential to scrutinize the Adjusted EBITDA figures, as this metric excludes certain expenses which may present a more favorable picture than actual profitability. Investors should compare these figures with industry benchmarks and consider how they reflect the company's ability to generate cash flow. Additionally, the initial 2024 business outlook will be a key factor in assessing the company's potential for long-term growth and its strategic direction in a competitive industry landscape. Market Research Analyst The aerospace and defense industry is highly dependent on government spending and contracts, which can be influenced by geopolitical tensions and economic policies. Air Industries Group's positive earnings report could indicate resilience and adaptability in this complex market. The mention of strategic growth positioning suggests that the company may be diversifying its portfolio or entering new markets, which could mitigate risks associated with dependency on a few large contracts.It is also important to consider the broader industry trends, such as the push for innovation in defense technology and the increasing importance of cybersecurity within aerospace. These factors could impact Air Industries Group's product development and investment strategies. Understanding the company's alignment with these trends will provide a clearer picture of its long-term viability and competitive edge. Defense Industry Analyst Air Industries Group's focus on precision components for aerospace and defense indicates its involvement in a niche but important segment of the market. The report of highest net sales in the fourth quarter could be reflective of increased demand for defense equipment amid rising global security concerns. The company's performance in this context is a testament to its operational capabilities and the strategic importance of its product offerings.Given the long cycle times typically associated with defense contracts, the strong bookings could suggest secured revenue well into the future, which is a positive sign for stability. Nevertheless, it's important to monitor the company's ability to maintain and grow its customer base, especially among large prime contractors, as they are key drivers of revenue in this industry. The initial outlook for 2024 will be telling of the company's competitive positioning and its ability to capitalize on industry trends such as modernization initiatives and international defense spending. 04/01/2024 - 04:00 PM BAY SHORE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Air Industries Group (NYSE American: AIRI), a leading manufacturer of precision components and assemblies for large aerospace and defense prime contractors, today reported preliminary earnings results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023 along with its initial 2024 business outlook. “The fourth quarter of 2023 marked a robust end to a year of significant progress and strategic growth positioning,” said Lou Melluzzo, CEO of Air Industries Group. “Not only did Q4 see the highest net sales of the year but also saw us achieve our highest operating income and Adjusted EBITDA.

In particular, the Company's statements regarding trends in the marketplace, future revenues, earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, the ability to realize firm backlog and projected backlog, cost cutting measures, potential future results and acquisitions, are examples of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the timing of projects due to variability in size, scope and duration, the inherent discrepancy in actual results from estimates, projections and forecasts made by management, regulatory delays, changes in government funding and budgets, and other factors, including general economic conditions, not within the Company's control. The factors discussed herein and expressed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such statements. The forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, as a supplemental profitability measure because management finds it useful to understand and evaluate results, excluding the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, stock based compensation expenses, and nonrecurring expenses and outlays, prior to consideration of the impact of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items. This calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies and may be different than the EBITDA calculation used by our lenders for purposes of determining compliance with our financial covenants. This Non-GAAP measure may have limitations when understanding performance as it excludes the financial impact of transactions such as interest expense necessary to conduct the Company’s business and therefore are not intended to be an alternative to financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not quantitatively reconciled its forward looking Adjusted EBITDA target to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because items such as amortization of stock-based compensation and interest expense, which are specific items that impact these measures, have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control, or cannot be predicted. For example, quantification of stock-based compensation is not possible as it requires inputs such as future grants and stock prices which are not currently ascertainable.

CEO Ted Murphy discusses strategic adjustments for future growth. Positive Total revenue increased by 1.0% to $8.9 million in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Total costs and expenses increased by 8.5% to $11.1 million in Q4 2023. Net loss was $1.5 million in Q4 2023 compared to a net loss of $0.9 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was a loss of $1.1 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $64.2 million as of December 31, 2023, with no long-term debt. IZEA was named 'Best Influencer Marketing Company' in the 2023 MarTech Breakthrough Awards Program. Expanded sales presence into the South Korea market and launched new features in IZEA Flex and FormAI. FY 2023 saw a 12% decrease in total revenue to $36.2 million compared to FY 2022. Net loss for FY 2023 was $7.3 million, and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5.5 million. CEO Ted Murphy highlighted strategic adjustments made in 2023 to position the company for future growth and global expansion. Managed services bookings growth returned in Q1 2024 with a strong pipeline, and SaaS revenue rebounded after a low point in Q3 2023. Negative None. Market Research Analyst When analyzing IZEA Worldwide's financial performance, we observe a modest revenue increase in Q4 2023 juxtaposed with a significant rise in costs and expenses, leading to an enlarged net loss. This pattern suggests that while the company is managing to slightly grow its top-line figures, it is doing so inefficiently, with expenses outpacing revenues. The extended net loss and increased adjusted EBITDA loss are indicators of operational challenges.Despite a challenging fiscal year where total revenue saw a decline, the company's strategic shifts and platform updates are intended for long-term growth. The emphasis on a pipeline of opportunities and diversification strategy, particularly in managed services and SaaS, is a positive signal for future revenue streams. However, the immediate financial health, as indicated by the net loss and negative adjusted EBITDA, raises concerns about the sustainability of current growth strategies.The lack of long-term debt and a healthy cash reserve position the company to weather short-term volatility. Yet, investors should be attentive to how efficiently IZEA can convert its strategic adjustments into profitable growth and whether it can control costs to improve its bottom line in the long run. Financial Analyst IZEA's financial report indicates a company in a transitional phase, with cash reserves providing a buffer against operational losses. The revenue decline year-over-year and the widening gap in net loss highlight the need for a careful evaluation of the company's cost structure and revenue generation capabilities.From an investment perspective, the key lies in the company's ability to leverage its strategic changes to reverse the negative trend in adjusted EBITDA. The market's reaction to these financials will likely hinge on confidence in the company's ability to execute its global expansion and the successful monetization of its SaaS offerings.The launch of new tools and expansion into the South Korean market represent potential growth areas, but the true test will be their contribution to reversing the negative earnings trend. Investors should monitor the company's operational efficiency and the impact of its strategic initiatives on future financial performance. Technology Industry Analyst IZEA's introduction of GPT-4 and AI Video Generation tools demonstrate the company's commitment to integrating advanced technologies into its platform. This is a strategic move to differentiate its offerings in the influencer marketing space, which is becoming increasingly competitive and tech-driven.The technology adoption could potentially attract a new segment of tech-savvy users and enhance the user experience for existing customers. However, the financial implications of these tech investments are not immediately clear from the report. The long-term success of these tools will depend on their adoption rate and how effectively they can be monetized.Furthermore, the expansion into South Korea, a market known for its digital innovation and high social media engagement, could offer new revenue streams. Yet, the costs associated with such expansion need to be justified by the revenue it generates to avoid exacerbating the company's current financial situation. 04/01/2024 - 04:01 PM ORLANDO, Fla., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IZEA Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ: IZEA), a premier provider of influencer marketing technology, data, and services for the world’s leading brands, reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023.

For the definition and reconciliation of this measure, refer to “Use of Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Management Commentary “Last year we made comprehensive strategic adjustments to better position ourselves for 2024 and beyond,” commented Ted Murphy, Founder and CEO of IZEA. “This included shifts in organizational frameworks, as well as updates to our platforms and pricing strategies. We made these challenging yet necessary transitions to improve our operations, setting the stage for an upcoming era of ambitious global expansion through both organic and inorganic initiatives. I'm happy to report that we are beginning to see the positive outcomes of these changes in the first quarter of this year.” “Year-over-year managed services bookings growth has returned in Q1 of 2024, fueled by a strong pipeline in Q4 of 2023, and an all-time record breaking pipeline in Q1 of 2024. Not only have we seen a pipeline record in terms of dollar value, we have also seen a jump in terms of number of opportunities, which is core to our revenue diversification strategy moving forward. While Managed Services represents the overwhelming majority of revenue, SaaS revenue has begun to rebound after hitting a low point in Q3 of 2023. We ended 2023 with a record count of active SaaS customers, and that trend has continued into the first quarter.” “We are excited and optimistic about the years ahead, and believe that IZEA is well positioned to capitalize on global opportunities in the creator economy.” Q4 2023 Financial Results Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 1.0% to $8.9 million, compared to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue from Managed Services increased by 4.2% to $8.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, from $8.4 million in the same period in 2022. In January 2023, we announced that we had begun parting ways with one large customer (the ""non-recurring customer""), which is now complete. Managed Services revenue from this non-recurring customer totaled $0.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, $1.3 million or 79.0% lower than in 2022. Managed Services revenue from new and existing customers (our ""ongoing customers""), excluding our non-recurring customer, totaled $8.4 million in the fourth quarter, $1.7 million or 25.1% higher than in 2022, primarily due to stronger bookings from these ongoing customers during the second and third quarters of 2023. Managed Services bookings totaled $7.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $7.9 million during the same period in 2022, largely due to the loss of our non-recurring customer. Revenue from SaaS Services decreased by $0.3 million, or 70.0%, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. During the second quarter of 2023, we completed the transition from our legacy IZEAx platform to Flex and The Creator Marketplace, which both have lower per-user revenue models designed to drive subscriber growth. Cost of revenue decreased to $4.7 million, or 53.1% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $5.7 million, or 65.3% of revenue, in the same period of 2022, primarily due to higher lower-margin contract deliveries to our non-recurring customer in the prior-year quarter. The percentage cost of revenue on ongoing customer deliveries was in range with recent historical averages. Costs and expenses other than the cost of revenue totaled $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, 42.5% above the prior-year quarter. Sales and marketing costs were $2.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, 18.0% higher than the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased spend on trade shows and brand awareness efforts. General and administrative costs totaled $3.6 million during the quarter, $1.8 million or 97.6% higher than the prior-year quarter, due primarily to higher human capital and contractor costs and non-cash stock-based compensation costs. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 million, or $(0.09) per share, as compared to a net loss of $0.9 million, or $(0.06) per share in the fourth quarter of 2022, based on 16.4 million and 15.5 million average shares outstanding, respectively, as adjusted for the four-for-one reverse split effected in June 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below, a non-GAAP measure management uses as a proxy for operating cash flow) totaled a loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with a loss of $0.3 million in the same period in 2022, decreasing $0.8 million due primarily to lower net income. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was a loss of 9.0% compared to a loss of 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2023, our cash and investments totaled $64.2 million. The company has no long-term debt borrowings outstanding.

(“IZEA”) is a marketing technology company providing software and professional services that enable brands to collaborate and transact with the full spectrum of today’s top social influencers and content creators. The company serves as a champion for the growing Creator Economy, enabling individuals to monetize their content, creativity, and influence.

Leading brands and agencies partner with IZEA to increase digital engagement, diversify brand voice, scale content production, and drive a measurable return on investment. Use of Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Managed Services bookings measure all sales orders received, less cancellations received, or refunds given during the same period. Sales order contracts vary in complexity with each customer and range from custom content delivery to integrated marketing services; our contracts generally run from several months for smaller contracts to twelve months for larger contracts. We recognize revenue from our Managed Services contracts based on a percentage of completion basis as we deliver the content or services over time, which can vary greatly from a few weeks to a year. For this reason, Managed Services bookings, while an overall indicator of the health of our business, may not be used to predict quarterly revenues and could be subject to future adjustments. Managed Services bookings is a useful metric as it reflects the amount of orders received in one period, even though revenue may be reflected over time. Management uses the Managed Services bookings metric to plan its operating staff, identify key customer group trends, enlighten go-to-market activities, and inform its product development efforts. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules commonly defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. IZEA defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as earnings or loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation, gain or loss on asset disposals or impairment, and certain other unusual or non-cash income and expense items such as gains or losses on settlement of liabilities and exchanges, and changes in the fair value of derivatives, if applicable. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors as it primarily excludes non-cash transactions and provides consistency to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. All companies do not calculate bookings, and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. These metrics and financial measures, as presented by IZEA, may be different from those presented by other companies. Moreover, these metrics and financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. You should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. The financial tables included in this press release present a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

(""Goodness Growth"") (CSE: GDNS; OTCQX: GDNSF), today announced that they have executed a binding term sheet whereby Ace plans to acquire assets of Goodness Growth Holdings subsidiary, Vireo Health of New York (“VireoNY”), pending the satisfaction of closing conditions, including secured capital commitments and regulatory approval. Founded by life-long New Yorker, Steven Acevedo, a television and film producer who has worked with some of the world’s most recognizable entertainers, Ace’s mission is to bring New York the quality and affordable cannabis its regulated market deserves, while investing in communities that have been disproportionately affected by the War on Drugs. Ace Venture Enterprises, Inc. shareholder, Arthur Isagholian, has over 25 years of experience within various sectors of the cannabis value chain, and has recruited, developed and managed highly-skilled teams, both plant touching and ancillary, across cultivation, manufacturing, marketing and retail operations. Terms of the transaction include a purchase price between $3.0 and $5.0 million for Vireo Health of New York’s licenses, inventory and assets, as well as Ace’s assumption of the lease agreement with Innovative Industrial Properties (“IIP”) for the Johnstown, NY cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus. Ace has agreed to assume VireoNY’s financial liabilities, including its operating losses, beginning on April 1, 2024. These activities are expected to be supported initially by a $2.5 million unsecured loan from Goodness Growth to VireoNY. In addition, the parties are committed to a collaborative advisory agreement that retains Goodness Growth’s management and compliance oversight in return for an approximate 15 percent share of net profits. Goodness Growth and Ace anticipate regulatory approval for the transfer of the New York licenses, as well as closing of the VireoNY transaction, to occur by June 30, 2024. Lease Amendment for Johnstown, NY Cultivation and Manufacturing Campus Goodness Growth also announced in conjunction with the VireoNY transaction that it has executed an eighth amendment to its lease with IIP for the Johnstown, NY cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus. The amendment to the Johnstown campus lease extends a lease termination option until June 30, 2024, and adds a purchase option of the facility for the tenant. Ace Venture Enterprises, Inc. is committed to providing an investment of $20.0 million to fund the development of the license and support the transfer of the IIP lease, and intends to acquire the Johnstown cannabis cultivation and manufacturing campus from IIP by executing the two-year purchase option. Management Commentary Steven Acevedo commented, “We are thrilled to reach this agreement with Goodness Growth and are excited to enter New York’s cannabis industry. We are prepared to showcase the strength of our team and to support a thriving industry in New York that benefits both consumers and communities that have been impacted by the failed War on Drugs. With more stores opening regularly, our timing feels impeccable and we’re pleased to have Goodness Growth’s continued involvement in the management of our operations. After spending considerable time with their team and observing the success they've had with renewed operational focus in Maryland and Minnesota, we see great benefit to a collaborative relationship that helps ensure long-term success for both of our organizations.” Goodness Growth Interim Chief Executive Officer Josh Rosen said, “We're excited to support the Ace team as they bring the benefits of a tremendous legacy within the industry and a deep network of relationships that we believe can help both Ace and Goodness Growth thrive moving forward. Execution in New York is the first priority, and we are eager to support Ace’s entry into New York’s wholesale market as soon as practicable following regulatory approval of our Registered Organization Non-Dispensing (ROND) license.

The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income and total return by investing in income-producing securities globally.","Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust Announces Distribution Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust (TBLD) announces a monthly distribution of $0.10417 per share payable on April 19, 2024. The distribution includes a short-term capital gain of $0.03279 and is paid from net investment income. The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income and total return by investing in income-producing securities globally. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust regarding its monthly distribution may seem routine, but it holds implications for both the Trust's valuation and investor sentiment. The steady distribution rate of $0.10417 per share, unchanged from the previous declaration, signals a consistent payout policy. This consistency can be attractive to income-focused investors seeking reliable dividend streams, potentially increasing demand for TBLD shares.However, a deeper look into the composition of the distribution reveals that a portion of the payout is attributed to short-term capital gains, which are taxed at a higher rate than qualified dividends. This could affect the after-tax income for shareholders, potentially making the Trust less attractive to tax-sensitive investors. Additionally, the absence of long-term capital gains and return of capital in this distribution might indicate a focus on income generation over capital appreciation, which could influence the Trust's total return profile.The Trust's adherence to the 4% excise tax rule, mandating distribution of at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains, ensures that it avoids the excise tax. This is a critical aspect for maintaining its status as a regulated investment company and preserving its tax advantages. The decision to retain income or capital gain, as mentioned, reflects a strategic move by the Board of Trustees, which could be based on reinvestment opportunities or other financial strategies aimed at long-term shareholder value. Tax Advisor For investors analyzing the tax implications of Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust's distributions, it's important to understand the different tax treatments of income components. The Trust's distribution includes short-term capital gains, which are subject to higher tax rates compared to qualified dividends or long-term capital gains. This distinction affects the net income investors receive and could influence investment decisions for those in higher tax brackets.The Trust's strategy to avoid the excise tax by distributing the required percentage of income and gains is a prudent tax planning measure. However, investors must recognize that distributions that exceed net investment income might lead to a return of capital. While not immediately taxable, a return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the Trust, potentially increasing capital gains liability upon the sale of shares.Investors should also be aware that the final tax characteristics of distributions will only be confirmed after year-end, necessitating careful record-keeping and consultation with tax professionals to accurately report income and adjust their investment strategies accordingly. Market Research Analyst The global investment approach of Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust, with a minimum of 80% managed assets in a broad range of income-producing securities, reflects a diversified investment strategy. This can be appealing to investors seeking exposure to various markets, including up to 20% in emerging market companies. Diversification can mitigate risk and provide growth opportunities, which may be reflected in the Trust's performance and, consequently, its stock price.The current distribution strategy, which includes income from both U.S. and non-U.S. sources, offers insight into the Trust's operational focus on generating current income alongside additional total return. This balance between income and growth is a critical factor for investors when assessing the sustainability of distributions and the overall health of the Trust.The absence of long-term capital gains in the current distribution could suggest a limited realization of gains from investments held for more than a year, which might be a point of concern for those looking for growth as well as income. However, the Trust's potential to elect to retain income or capital gain for shareholder interest indicates flexibility in financial management, which could lead to strategic decisions that enhance long-term shareholder value. 04/01/2024 - 04:01 PM SANTA FE, N.M., April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Thornburg Income Builder Opportunities Trust (the ""Trust"") (NASDAQ: TBLD) today announced a monthly distribution of $0.10417 per share on the Trust's common shares, payable on April 19, 2024 to common shareholders of record as of April 11, 2024. The Trust's monthly distribution is shown below: Amount Payable Date Ex-Dividend Date Record Date Change from Previous Declaration $0.10417 April 19, 2024 April 10, 2024 April 11, 2024 No Change Distribution rates are not performance and are calculated by summing the Trust's monthly distribution per share over four quarters and dividing by the net asset value or market price per share, as applicable, as of the distribution announcement date. Distributions on common shares are generally paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends) and may also include capital gains and/or a return of capital. The Trust's distribution payable on April 19, 2024, does not include a long-term capital gain or a return of capital, but does include a short-term capital gain of $0.03279. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to the Trust's common shareholders on Form 1099 after the end of the 2024 calendar year. The final determination for all distributions paid in 2024 will be made in early 2025 and reported to you on Form 1099-DIV. You should not use this notice as a substitute for your 1099-DIV. The Trust's fiscal year (10/01/2023 through 09/30/2024) cumulative distributions are shown below: Current Distribution Cumulative Distributions FYTD Net Investment Income $0.07138 (69 %) $0.28777 (39 %) Net Realized Short-term Capital Gain $0.03279 (31 %) $0.15825 (22 %) Net Realized Long-term Capital Gain $0.00000 (0 %) $0.08712 (12 %) Return of Capital or Other Capital Sources $0.00000 (0 %) $0.19605 (27 %) Total per share $0.10417 (100 %) $0.72919 (100 %) Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Trust is net income or profit. A distribution comprised in whole or in part by a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Trust's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" Future distributions may consist of a return of capital. For further information regarding the Trust's distributions, please visit www.thornburg.com/tbld-distributions. The Trust's investment objective is to provide current income and additional total return. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of its managed assets in a broad range of income-producing securities. The Trust invests in both equity and debt securities of companies located in the United States and around the globe. The Trust may invest in non-U.S. domiciled companies, including up to 20% of its managed assets at the time of investment in equity and debt securities of emerging market companies. As a registered investment company, the Trust is subject to a 4% excise tax that is imposed if the Trust does not distribute to common shareholders by the end of any calendar year at least the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gain or loss) for the calendar year and (ii) 98.2% of its capital gain in excess of its capital loss (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made to use the Trust's fiscal year). In certain circumstances, the Trust may elect to retain income or capital gain to the extent that the Board of Trustees, in consultation with Trust management, determines it to be in the interest of shareholders to do so. The common share distributions paid by the Trust for any particular period may be more than the amount of net investment income from that period. As a result, all or a portion of a distribution may be a return of capital, which is in effect a partial return of the amount a common shareholder invested in the Trust, up to the amount of the common shareholder's tax basis in their common shares, which would reduce such tax basis. Although a return of capital may not be taxable, it will generally increase the common shareholder's potential gain, or reduce the common shareholder's potential loss, on any subsequent sale or other disposition of common shares.

Q4 2023 and FY23 Highlights New orders for engineering division increased by 70.9% during FY2023 to $37.6 million, up from $22.0 million in FY2022.Total new order flow for FY2023 was $47.3 million, up $7.7 million or 19.5% from $39.5 million in FY2022.Engineering revenues increased 6.3% for FY2023 to $31.8 million compared to $29.9 million in FY2022.Backlog at December 31, 2023, was $34.5 million, including $29.0 million of Engineering backlog, and $5.5 million of Workforce Solutions backlog.Ended Q4 with cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $3.7 million, including restricted cash of $1.5 million.Highlights subsequent to year-end Subsequent to year end, we received a significant contract renewal for 12 months of T&M services from a major long-term customer of $6.3 million, which is a 10.7% increase from prior year's contract.Subsequent to year end, we received an order for the first year of a four-year agreement with a long-term customer of $0.9 million. The total expected value to be released over the next four years is $4.3 million.Management Commentary ""Fiscal 2023 was a year in which we streamlined the company to properly reflect the state of the end market and aligned our efforts towards industry spend: lifetime extension of the existing fleet and increasing power production from the existing fleet through targeted capital investment. To that end, we are pleased with the Engineering revenue year-over-year increase, which resulted in an improved gross margin for the Company. Our focus on engineering utilization, especially in the second half of the year, has yielded solid results, and that focus will continue into 2024 as we continue to build our backlog. Workforce Solutions continues to be a challenge, as the industry is simply no longer committing to significant staff augmentation projects as they had prior to the pandemic. That said, we have worked diligently to now be properly aligned to the market and have seen significant improvement in our operational results in the second half of 2023. Our improved Adjusted EBITDA numbers in the second half of the year reflect this proper alignment and new mix of business. Moving into 2024, we will benefit from a full year of streamlined operational costs, an improved engineering utilization and a business mix that will continue to favor higher margin business and revenue."" Emmett Pepe, CFO of GSE Systems, added, ""As expected, we continued our improvement in reducing operating expenses as reflected in the reductions both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. These improvements, with the majority occurring in the second half of 2023, led to a favorable full year variance over 2022. We are positioned to achieve a full year of reduced operating expenses in 2024. We continue to pay down our corporate debt, while maintaining our cash position which improved in the quarter as a result of the cost saving measures."" Q4 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS Revenue during Q4 2023 was $10.2 million, a decrease of 12.0% compared to revenue of $11.6 million in Q3 2023, and a decrease of 6.0% revenue from $10.8 million in Q4 2022. The year-over-year decrease of $0.6 million was primarily due to the wind down of large projects in 2023 resulting in a reduction of staffing from our major customers, which continues to affect the power industry. Engineering revenue was $7.1 million in Q4 2023 compared to $8.7 million in Q3 2023, and $7.5 million in Q4 2022. The year over year change was primarily attributable to the project inefficiencies in Q4 2023, resulting in decreased revenues. Workforce Solutions revenue was $3.1 million in Q4 2023 compared to $2.9 million in Q3 2023, and $3.3 million in Q4 2022. The year over year decrease was due to the reduction in customer demand for Workforce Solutions. Gross profit in Q4 2023 was $2.6 million, or 25.5% of revenue. This compared to gross profit of $3.1 million, or 28.2% of revenue in Q4 2022, and $3.7 million, or 32.1% of revenue in Q3 2023. The decrease in gross margin was primarily related to increased cost estimates in Q4 to align expected project costs. Operating expenses in Q4 2023 were $4.1 million compared to $4.1 million in Q4 2022, the cost cutting measures implemented during FY 2023 offset the goodwill impairment of $0.5 million recorded in Q4 2023. Operating loss was approximately $(1.4) million in Q4 2023, compared to $(1.1) million in Q4 2022 and operating loss was $(1.8) million in Q3 2023, and the decrease from Q3 2023 was due to a $0.8 million legal settlement expense recorded in Q3 2023. Net loss in Q4 2023 was $(2.3) million or $(0.82) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $(1.5) million or $(0.68) per basic and diluted share in Q4 2022. Adjusted net (loss) Income1 totaled $(0.8) million, or $(0.28) in Q4 2023, $0.2 million, or $0.07 in Q3 2023, and $(1.1), or $(0.49) in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $(0.1) million in Q4 2023, compared to $(0.4) million in Q4 2022 and $0.7 million in Q3 2023. Backlog at December 31, 2023, was $34.5 million, including $29.0 million of Engineering backlog, and $5.5 million of Workforce Solutions. 2023 FULL YEAR RECAP Revenue in 2023 was $45.0 million a decrease of 5.6% compared to $47.7 million in 2022. The year over year decrease of $2.7 million was primarily due to due a wind down of large projects and a reduction in demand for staffing from our major customers as reflected in the reduction in orders. Engineering revenue was $31.8 million in 2023 compared to $29.9 million in 2022. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased work on fixed price training and consulting projects and improved utilization of personnel on T&M projects. Workforce Solutions revenue was $13.3 million in 2023 compared to $17.8 million in 2022. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily due to a wind down of large projects and a reduction in demand for staffing from our major customers as reflected in the reduction in orders. Gross profit in 2023 was $11.9 million, or 26.5% of revenue. This compared to gross profit of $11.9 million, or 25.0% of revenue in 2022. The increase in gross margin is primarily related to a mix of higher margins projects, shorter lead times and improved processes. Operating expenses in 2023 were $18.7 million compared to $26.3 million in 2022, and the decrease was due to a $6.1 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2022. The remaining decrease in operating expenses was due to cost saving initiatives put in place during 2023. Operating loss was approximately $(6.8) million in 2023, compared to $(14.4) million in 2022. Net loss in 2023 was $(8.7) million or $(3.51) per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $(15.3) million or $(7.18) per basic and diluted share in 2022. Adjusted net loss1 totaled $(4.5) million, or $(1.79) per diluted share in 2023, compared to adjusted net loss of $(5.5) million, or $(2.57) per diluted share, in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA1 totaled $(2.0) million in 2023, compared to $(3.5) million in 2022. 1 Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation tables at the end of this press release for a definition of ""EBITDA"", ""adjusted EBITDA"" and ""adjusted net income"".

References to Adjusted EBITDA excludes irregular or non-recurring items and are not directly related to the Company's core operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP. Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to operating profit, net income and other U.S. GAAP measures, are useful to investors to evaluate the Company's results because it excludes certain items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our results for any particular period. Investors should recognize that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. This measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(Nasdaq: ATOS) reported fully enrolling two Phase 2 studies with data expected in the second half of 2024.

The company ended 2023 with $88.5 million in cash and no debt.","Atossa Therapeutics Announces Year-End 2023 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATOS) reported fully enrolling two Phase 2 studies with data expected in the second half of 2024. They also dosed the first patient in a new Phase 2 breast cancer prevention study and provided updates on ongoing trials. The company ended 2023 with $88.5 million in cash and no debt. Positive Atossa fully enrolled Phase 2 Karisma-Endoxifen and I-SPY 2 Clinical Trials, with data expected in the second half of 2024. The company dosed the first patient in the RECAST DCIS study for breast cancer prevention. Atossa expanded access patient completed five years of successful (Z)-endoxifen treatment. Data from the EVANGELINE study will be presented at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting. The company appointed Tessa Cigler, M.D., M.P.H., and Jonathan Finn, CFA, to the Board of Directors. Operating expenses for 2023 increased by $3.7 million compared to 2022, mainly due to R&D expenses. Interest income for 2023 was $4.3 million, a significant increase from $0.9 million in 2022. Negative Operating expenses increased by $3.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022, potentially impacting profitability. Impairment charges on equity securities and increased professional fees contributed to higher expenses. Decrease in G&A compensation expenses offset by higher professional fees and insurance expenses. Financial Analyst Atossa Therapeutics' announcement of fully enrolling two Phase 2 studies and the dosing of the first patient in a new Phase 2 breast cancer prevention study are pivotal milestones that investors should monitor closely. The expected data release in the second half of 2024 will provide significant insights into the efficacy and potential market viability of (Z)-endoxifen, a key product in their pipeline. The company's financial position, ending 2023 with $88.5 million in cash and no debt, offers a cushion for continued R&D investment without the immediate need for additional financing, which is a positive signal for investor confidence.However, the increased R&D and G&A expenses reflect the company's aggressive investment in its clinical trials and operational infrastructure. While necessary for progress, these expenditures have resulted in a net increase in operating expenses year-over-year. This trend is not uncommon in the biopharmaceutical industry, especially for clinical-stage companies prioritizing product development. Investors should weigh the potential long-term benefits of successful clinical outcomes against the short-term financial costs and the associated risks.The impairment charge on investment in equity securities is a reminder of the inherent risks associated with biotech investments. While non-core to their business, it does impact the overall financial health of the company. The increased interest income due to higher average balances and interest rates is a silver lining, providing an additional revenue stream amidst the capital-intensive R&D phase. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of Atossa Therapeutics' (Z)-endoxifen through two Phase 2 clinical trials is a significant step in addressing unmet needs in breast cancer treatment and prevention. The Karisma-Endoxifen Clinical Trial and the I-SPY 2 Clinical Trial are designed to evaluate the drug's efficacy in different breast cancer scenarios, which could potentially lead to a paradigm shift in how breast cancer is managed, particularly in premenopausal women and those with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.The RECAST DCIS study's innovative approach to determine the suitability of long-term active surveillance without surgery in DCIS patients could revolutionize current treatment protocols. The presentation of the EVANGELINE study data at the AACR Annual Meeting will be critical for scientific validation and could influence future clinical practices. These studies' outcomes will not only affect patient care but also have the potential to open new markets for Atossa, impacting the stock's future valuation.Investors should be aware of the long timelines associated with biopharmaceutical development. While the expected data in the second half of 2024 is a significant event, it's also a reminder of the patience required for investments in this sector. The successful completion of these trials could lead to increased partnership opportunities, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies, providing multiple pathways for shareholder value creation. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and Atossa Therapeutics' focus on breast cancer—a field with a high prevalence and significant unmet medical needs—positions the company in a potentially lucrative market. The successful development of (Z)-endoxifen could disrupt current treatment standards, offering Atossa a competitive edge. However, the market's response to the upcoming trial results will be contingent on the data's strength and the drug's comparative effectiveness and safety profile.The strategic appointment of Tessa Cigler, M.D., M.P.H. and Jonathan Finn, CFA, to the Board of Directors brings a blend of clinical and financial expertise, signaling Atossa's commitment to aligning its strategic vision with operational and financial prudence. This could foster investor trust and potentially attract more institutional investors.It's important to consider the broader industry trends, such as the increasing emphasis on personalized medicine and the shift towards preventive healthcare strategies. Atossa's pipeline aligns well with these trends, which could lead to a favorable market position if their products reach commercialization. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain its financial stability while navigating the regulatory pathways and potential market entry challenges. 04/01/2024 - 04:00 PM Fully enrolled two Phase 2 studies with data from both expected in the second half of 2024First patient dosed in new Phase 2 breast cancer prevention studyData from ongoing Phase 2 EVANGELINE study scheduled to be presented at 2024 AACR Annual MeetingEnded 2023 with $88.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt SEATTLE, April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATOS) (“Atossa” or the “Company”), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on recent Company developments. Atossa is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing proprietary innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need in oncology with a focus on breast cancer and other breast conditions. Key developments from Q4 2023 and the year to date include: Full enrollment of Phase 2 Karisma-Endoxifen Clinical Trial – the study is investigating (Z)-endoxifen in premenopausal women with measurable breast density. Participants receive daily doses of (Z)-endoxifen for six months, over the course of which mammograms are conducted to measure reduction in breast density. Full enrollment was achieved in November 2023 and data is expected in the second half of 2024.Full enrollment of Phase 2 I-SPY 2 Clinical Trial – (Z)-endoxifen is being evaluated as a neoadjuvant treatment in a study arm of the ongoing I-SPY 2 clinical trial. The study arm targets patients with newly diagnosed estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer whose tumors are predicted to be sensitive to endocrine therapy but for whom chemotherapy is expected to provide little or no benefit. Full enrollment was achieved in February 2024 and data is expected in the second half of 2024.First patient dosed with (Z)-endoxifen in RECAST DCIS study – the Re-Evaluating Conditions for Active Surveillance Suitability as Treatment: Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (RECAST DCIS) study is an ongoing Phase 2 platform study designed to offer women diagnosed with DCIS six months of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy with the intent of determining their suitability for long-term active surveillance without surgery.Expanded access patient concluded five-years of (Z)-endoxifen treatment – the pre-menopausal, Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) / Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 negative (HER2-), breast cancer patient who received neoadjuvant and adjuvant (Z)-endoxifen therapy under an FDA-approved ""expanded access"" program completed five years of successful treatment.Data from ongoing EVANGELINE study scheduled to be presented at the AACR Annual Meeting – safety and efficacy data from the 40mg pharmacokinetic run-in cohort of the ongoing Phase 2 EVANGELINE (Endoxifen Versus exemestANe GosEreLIn) study is scheduled to be presented on April 9, 2024 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The data is scheduled to be presented by Dr. Matthew Goetz, deputy director of translational research for the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center and co-leader of the Mayo Clinic Women's Cancer Program. Dr. Goetz is also the primary investigator of the EVANGELINE study.Appointment of Tessa Cigler, M.D., M.P.H and Jonathan Finn, CFA to Atossa’s Board of Directors – Dr. Cigler is a medical oncologist and clinical investigator at the Weill Cornell Breast Center in New York City. As a member of the Weill Cornell Breast Center research team, she heads several clinical trials designed to provide her patients with access to the new promising options for therapy and supportive care. Mr. Finn has more than 25 years of experience in the financial industry with a focus on early to mid-stage biotech and technology companies. He currently serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer at Vantage Consulting Group, an investment advisory firm. ""I am very proud of the progress we made in Q4 2023 and the momentum we have continued to generate in 2024,” said Steven Quay, M.D., Ph.D., Atossa’s President and Chief Executive Officer. ""With important data from our EVANGELINE study being presented at AACR this month and primary data from two of our Phase 2 studies expected in the second half of this year, the remainder of 2024 will be a critical period for our Company. Our focus continues to be on accelerating our (Z)-endoxifen development program and generating additional data to support the growing body of evidence that (Z)-endoxifen has the potential to address significant unmet needs that exist in both the breast cancer prevention and treatment settings.” Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Operating Expenses.Total operating expenses were $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was an increase of $3.7 million, from the year ended December 31, 2022 of $27.7 million. Factors contributing to the increased operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2023 are explained below. The following table provides a breakdown of major categories within R&D expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, together with the dollar change in those categories (in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31,2023 Year EndedDecember 31,2022 Increase(decrease) Research and Development Expense Clinical and non-clinical trials$12,722 $10,225 $2,497 Compensation$3,474 4,268 (794) Professional fees and other$1,138 590 548 Research and Development Expense Total$17,334 $15,083 $2,251 R&D Expenses. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $17.3 million, an increase of $2.3 million from total R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 of $15.1 million. Key changes were as follows: The increase in R&D expense was in part due to increased spending on clinical and non-clinical trials of $1.1 million compared to the prior year due to increased spending on (Z)-endoxifen trials, including drug development costs. The additional increase of $1.4 million was due to a change in estimate of the amount that no longer met the reasonably assured threshold to be sustained under a potential ATO audit related to R&D expenditures under the Australian R&D tax incentive program as a result of recent Australian Taxation Office guidance. The decrease in R&D compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.8 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation decreased compared to the prior year due to the weighted average fair value of options amortizing in the year ended December 31, 2023 being lower year over year.The increase in R&D professional fees and other was due in part to the refund in the prior year of $1.0 million from a research institution with which we had an exclusive right to negotiate for the acquisition of worldwide rights of two oncology programs. No exclusivity payments were made or refunded during the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table provides a breakdown of major categories within General and Administrative (G&A) expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, together with the dollar change in those categories (in thousands): Year EndedDecember 31,2023 Year EndedDecember 31,2022 Increase(decrease) General and Administrative Expense Compensation$7,388 $7,429 $(41) Professional fees and other$5,367 3,539 1,828 Insurance$1,288 1,640 (352) General and Administrative Expense Total$14,043 $12,608 $1,435 G&A Expenses. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $14.0 million an increase of $1.4 million from total G&A expenses for year ended December 31, 2022 of $12.6 million. Key changes were as follows: The decrease in G&A compensation expense of $41 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was partially due to an increase in cash compensation expense of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation of $1.4 million. The increase in cash compensation expense compared to the prior year was primarily driven by salary and bonus severance costs for former executives of $0.6 million, an increase of $0.4 million due to compensation for new employees as well as an overall increase in salaries, bonuses and benefits of $0.3 million. Non-cash stock-based compensation decreased by $1.4 million due to the weighted average fair value of options amortizing in 2023 being lower year over year. The increase in G&A professional fees of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in legal fees for higher patent-related activity of $0.7 million and an increase in professional fees of $0.8 million primarily due to higher investor relations costs and accounting fees. The additional increase of $0.4 million was due to a change in estimate related to the Australian R&D tax incentive program.The decrease in G&A insurance expense of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year was due to lower negotiated insurance premiums for the same or better coverage year over year. Impairment Charge on Investment in Equity Securities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote down our investment in DCT by $3.0 million due to an impairment charge. For the year ended December 31, 2022 there were no impairment charges related to our equity securities. Interest Income. Interest income was $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.5 million from interest income of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to the higher average balance invested in money market funds of $26.5 million and higher average interest rates for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year. About (Z)-Endoxifen (Z)-endoxifen is the most potent Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM) for estrogen receptor inhibition and also causes estrogen receptor degradation. It has also been shown to have efficacy in the setting of patients with tumor resistance to other hormonal treatments. In addition to its potent anti-estrogen effects, (Z)-endoxifen has been shown to target PKCβ1, a known oncogenic protein, at clinically attainable blood concentrations. Finally, (Z)-endoxifen appears to deliver similar or even greater bone agonistic effects while resulting in little or no endometrial proliferative effects compared with standard treatments, like tamoxifen. Atossa is developing a proprietary oral formulation of (Z)-endoxifen that does not require liver metabolism to achieve therapeutic concentrations and is encapsulated to bypass the stomach, as acidic conditions in the stomach convert a significant proportion of (Z)-endoxifen to the inactive (E)-endoxifen. Atossa’s (Z)-endoxifen has been shown to be well tolerated in Phase 1 studies and in a small Phase 2 study of women with breast cancer. (Z)-endoxifen is currently being studied in four Phase 2 trials: one in healthy women with measurable breast density, one in women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, and two other studies including the EVANGELINE study in women with ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Atossa’s (Z)-endoxifen is protected by three issued U.S. patents and numerous pending patent applications. About Atossa Therapeutics Atossa Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines in areas of significant unmet medical need in oncology with a focus on using (Z)-endoxifen to prevent and treat breast cancer.

Market Research Analyst Pioneer Power Solutions' financial results demonstrate a significant year-over-year growth in revenue, a substantial increase in gross profit and a positive shift from a net loss to a net income. The backlog growth indicates a strong demand for their products, particularly the E-Bloc systems and mobile EV charging solutions. The company's transition to profitability and the expansion of gross margins reflect improved operational efficiency and a favorable product mix.From a market perspective, the substantial increase in backlog and the projected revenue for 2024 suggest that Pioneer is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing need for distributed energy resources and EV infrastructure. The shift towards electrification in various sectors, including transportation and utilities, is likely to continue driving demand for Pioneer's offerings. However, investors should monitor the execution of the backlog and the company's ability to maintain or improve margins in a competitive landscape. Financial Analyst Analyzing Pioneer Power Solutions' financial health, the conversion of federal net operating loss carryforwards into a positive net income suggests a more favorable tax position moving forward. The company's ability to improve gross margins while scaling revenue is indicative of effective cost management and pricing strategies. The EPS guidance for 2024 reflects confidence in continued profitability.Investors should consider the implications of the reported decrease in fourth-quarter revenue and the shift of certain orders to 2024. While this may raise concerns about short-term revenue recognition, the overall positive outlook for 2024 may alleviate some of these concerns. It's critical to evaluate the company's cash position and working capital to ensure it can sustain growth without compromising financial stability. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration of distributed energy resources and EV infrastructure. Pioneer's focus on E-Bloc power systems and e-Boost mobile EV charging products aligns with industry trends towards decarbonization and energy independence. The company's success in securing contracts with major automakers and service agreements with large carriers reflects the industry's recognition of Pioneer's technological capabilities.However, the energy sector is subject to regulatory changes and technological disruptions. The long-term success of Pioneer's products will depend on their adaptability to evolving standards and their competitiveness against emerging technologies. Stakeholders should weigh the potential risks associated with regulatory shifts and market entry by larger competitors with the resources to invest in research and development. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Delivers Positive Full-Year Net Income vs. Net Loss in 2022; Backlog Surges to $46 Million; up 36% Sequentially; Expects Continued, Rapid Growth in Revenue, EPS and Operating Margins in 2024; Guides to $52 to $54 Million in Revenue and $0.31 to $0.34 in EPS for Full-Year 2024 FORT LEE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: PPSI) (“Pioneer” or the “Company”), a leader in the design, manufacture, service and integration of electrical power systems, distributed energy resources, power generation equipment and mobile electric vehicle (“EV”) charging solutions, today announced unaudited preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and 12 months ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. Preliminary Financial Highlights for the Full Year 2023 (Unaudited): Revenue was $40.8 million, as compared to $27.0 million during 2022, an increase of 51.1%. Gross profit was $10.4 million, or a gross margin of 25.5%, as compared to $4.6 million, or a gross margin of 17.1%, for 2022. Gross profit increased 125% and gross margin increased 840 basis points. Loss from operations was $617,000, compared to a loss of $4.0 million during 2022, a $3.4 million improvement year-over-year. The Company recognized $1.5 million of non-cash, stock-based compensation expense during 2023, as compared to $1.0 million during 2022. Net income was $138,000, or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.6 million, or $(0.37) per share last year, a tremendous improvement of $3.7 million. The Company had $14.6 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023. Total backlog surged to $45.9 million as of December 31, 2023, up 36% as compared to $33.6 million as of September 30, 2023, and up 23% as compared to $37.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Business Highlights for the Full Year 2023 Delivered a significant increase in mobile charging power via its suite of e-Boost© charging products during 2023; 7,500 charging sessions/220mwh of mobile charging power compared to 350 charging sessions/7.5mwh during 2022. Delivered $9 million of E-Bloc product and related equipment to one of the world’s largest automakers for their new EV design and manufacturing campus. Delivered $6 million of E-Bloc products and related equipment to three water districts located in California as part of their efforts to decrease their grid reliance. Introduced and immediately booked orders for a new and innovative E-Bloc solar microgrid series of equipment. Awarded a three-year service agreement from a large U.S. cellular carrier valued at approximately $5 million over three years. Completed a turnkey distributed generation project at Miami International Airport valued at approximately $700,000. Delivered six new e-Boost units to customers, doubling deliveries compared to 2022. Nathan Mazurek, Pioneer’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We delivered a record $40.8 million in revenue during 2023, representing rapid growth of more than 50% over last year, primarily due to increased sales of our E-Bloc power systems and related equipment, despite a shift in the timing from the fourth quarter of 2023 to throughout 2024 of certain orders valued at approximately $4.5 million. Momentum continues to strengthen with our E-Bloc product as governments, utilities and commercial enterprises seek solutions that address the rapidly increasing need for more power. In tandem with our revenue growth, gross margins expanded to 25.5% during 2023.” “Today’s grid infrastructure will not be able to meet the accelerating demand for power for many years to come,” Mazurek continued. “Our E-Bloc series of products such as our solar micro grid line, mini substations, and our charge port series support the installation and throughput of distributed power generation resources and, indeed, enable the deployment of electrical power with greater speed and efficiency. The surge in orders for our E-Bloc product is a strong indicator of the traction we are experiencing. With additional product launches planned in 2024, we believe there is tremendous opportunity for additional revenue and earnings growth as well as margin expansion.” Mazurek concluded, “We are aggressively marketing our suite of e-Boost mobile EV charging products to electric bus and truck manufacturers, fleet management companies, municipalities and EV infrastructure providers. As awareness of these solutions expands, actual orders for e-Boost have similarly surged, making it a significant driver of the increase in our order backlog at year end. The increasing adoption of electric vehicles by school districts and municipalities, indeed, the overall electrification of all means of transportation, airport ground service equipment and even construction and agricultural equipment, provide a strong tailwind for continued growth in this portion of our business. Strong market demand, a robust backlog and a steady generation of new opportunities give us a high level of confidence for an even stronger and more profitable 2024.” Preliminary Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results (Unaudited) Revenue Consolidated revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $7.7 million, a decrease of 19%, as compared to $9.5 million during the fourth quarter of last year, primarily due to the timing of certain orders shifting from the fourth quarter of 2023 to throughout 2024. Revenue from the Electrical Infrastructure segment decreased by 31%, and revenue from the Critical Power segment increased by 23% during the fourth quarter of 2023 as compared to the same period last year. Gross Profit/Margin Consolidated gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.8 million, or 22.7% of revenue, compared to $2.8 million, or 29% of revenue, for the same period in 2022. The decrease in consolidated gross profit and margin is primarily due to the reduction in revenue as a result of certain orders shifting from the fourth quarter of 2023 to 2024. Operating Income (Loss) For the three months ended December 31, 2023, loss from operations was $1.2 million, as compared to income from operations of $759,000 during the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of approximately $2.0 million. Net Income (Loss) The Company’s net loss during the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $689,000, or $(0.07) per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $948,000, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, during the same period last year. Preliminary Full Year 2023 Financial Results (Unaudited) Consolidated revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, was $40.8 million, an increase of 51% compared to $27.0 million for the 12 months ended December 31, 2022.

Shareholders Approve Previously Announced Business Combination With iLearningEngines, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Arrowroot Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ:ARRW) and iLearningEngines, Inc. announced the approval of their business combination by Arrowroot's shareholders, with over 97% of votes in favor. The combined company will operate as iLearningEngines, Inc. and is expected to be listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols 'AILE' and 'AILEW'. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The approval of the business combination by Arrowroot Acquisition Corp.'s shareholders represents a strategic move with potential to reshape the competitive landscape within the AI-powered learning automation and information intelligence sector. The overwhelming support, with over 97% of votes in favor, indicates strong shareholder confidence in the synergy that iLearningEngines can bring to the table. This merger could leverage iLearningEngines' technological capabilities to scale operations and enhance product offerings, potentially increasing market share.From a market perspective, the anticipated Nasdaq listing under the new ticker symbol 'AILE' will likely increase the visibility of iLearningEngines to a broader range of investors. This visibility, coupled with the entry into public markets, can lead to greater liquidity and access to capital for the company. However, it is important to monitor post-merger integration and performance to ensure that the expected benefits materialize. Financial Analyst Financially, the business combination between Arrowroot and iLearningEngines is a significant event that warrants close scrutiny. The transaction's completion will likely result in immediate changes in the stock's liquidity and volatility. Investors should pay attention to the closing conditions and the subsequent fulfillment of Nasdaq listing requirements, as these are critical steps that can influence the combined company's financial health and investor appeal.Furthermore, the combined entity's future financial performance will be a key indicator of the merger's success. It is essential to assess how the integration of iLearningEngines' AI technology into Arrowroot's portfolio will affect revenue streams, cost structures and overall profitability. The market will be looking for signs of operational efficiency and synergistic gains in upcoming financial statements. Legal Expert The filing of the results with the SEC, as mentioned, is a procedural step that ensures regulatory compliance and transparency for investors. It is important for stakeholders to review the Form 8-K for any material information that may affect their investment decisions. The legal processes involved in a business combination of this nature are complex and the successful navigation of these processes to this point reflects positively on the management's capability to handle regulatory requirements.Additionally, the legal implications post-merger, such as intellectual property rights, contractual obligations and regulatory compliance in the educational technology space, will be areas that the combined company must manage diligently. Any oversight in these areas could lead to legal challenges that may impact the company's operations and stock performance. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM BETHESDA, Md. & MARINA DEL REY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arrowroot Acquisition Corp.

The financial statements, MD&A, and AIF are accessible on Skeena's website and regulatory platforms.","Skeena Reports Fourth Quarter and Annual 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Skeena Resources (SKE) releases its fourth quarter and annual financial results for 2023, showcasing positive growth and performance. The financial statements, MD&A, and AIF are accessible on Skeena's website and regulatory platforms. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by Skeena Resources Limited offers a wealth of information for stakeholders and potential investors. A deep dive into the fourth quarter and annual financial results reveals the company's performance and strategic direction. Analyzing key metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow provides a clear picture of Skeena's financial health. Particularly, the year-over-year comparison of these metrics can indicate the company's growth trajectory and its operational efficiency.Furthermore, understanding the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) section is crucial, as it contains management's perspective on the financial results, including any challenges faced or opportunities seized during the year. It often provides context beyond the raw numbers, such as market conditions, operational hurdles and future outlooks, which are vital for assessing the company's potential for sustainable growth.Lastly, the annual information form (AIF) typically includes comprehensive details about the company's operations, governance and risks. Scrutinizing this document helps in evaluating the company's long-term strategies and its approach to risk management, which are critical factors influencing investor confidence and the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Skeena Resources Limited's financial results are not just numbers on a page; they represent the company's standing in the competitive landscape. The mining industry is subject to volatile commodity prices and regulatory changes, which can significantly impact a company's profitability. Comparing Skeena's performance with industry benchmarks and competitors can shed light on its competitive advantage or reveal areas where it may be lagging.Additionally, the market's reaction to financial results is often immediate and can be quite telling. A positive response might indicate that the results have met or exceeded market expectations, suggesting investor confidence. Conversely, a negative reaction could point to concerns over the company's ability to maintain profitability or grow in the future. It's important to note that market sentiment can be influenced by a multitude of factors and financial results are just one piece of the puzzle. Economist Examining the financial results of Skeena Resources Limited from an economic standpoint involves considering broader economic indicators and their interplay with the company's performance. For instance, the impact of inflation on operational costs and the exchange rates on international transactions are important for a resource-based company like Skeena. Additionally, global economic trends, such as demand for commodities, can affect the company's export potential and pricing power.The company's financial resilience in the face of economic cycles is also of interest. A strong balance sheet and liquidity position can buffer against economic downturns, while a high debt load can be a vulnerability. Analyzing these aspects provides insight into how well-positioned Skeena is to capitalize on economic recoveries or to weather economic storms. 04/01/2024 - 03:55 PM VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 1, 2024 / Skeena Resources Limited (TSX:SKE)(NYSE:SKE) (""Skeena"" or the ""Company"") reports fourth quarter and annual financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.

About Cytokinetics Cytokinetics is a late-stage, specialty cardiovascular biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing first-in-class muscle activators and next-in-class muscle inhibitors as potential treatments for debilitating diseases in which cardiac muscle performance is compromised. As a leader in muscle biology and the mechanics of muscle performance, the company is developing small molecule drug candidates specifically engineered to impact myocardial muscle function and contractility. Cytokinetics is preparing for regulatory submissions for aficamten, its next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, following positive results from SEQUOIA-HCM, the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Aficamten is also currently being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials: MAPLE-HCM, evaluating aficamten as monotherapy compared to metoprolol as monotherapy in patients with obstructive HCM and ACACIA-HCM, evaluating aficamten in patients with non-obstructive HCM. Cytokinetics is also developing omecamtiv mecarbil, a cardiac muscle activator, in patients with heart failure. Additionally, Cytokinetics is developing CK-586, a cardiac myosin inhibitor with a mechanism of action distinct from aficamten for the potential treatment of HFpEF, and CK-136, a cardiac troponin activator for the potential treatment HFrEF and other types of heart failure, such as right ventricular failure resulting from impaired cardiac contractility.

Adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.6 million for the full year, reflecting strong financial performance and operational enhancements. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial performance of VirTra, Inc. demonstrates a significant uptick in both revenue and net income, which are key indicators of a company's financial health and operational efficiency. The 34% increase in annual revenue and a substantial rise in net income by $6.4 million reflect strong market demand and effective cost management. The gross profit margin improvement from 57% to 70% suggests streamlined operations and possibly better pricing strategies.Investors should note the impact of an unusual event—a $3 million kickoff milestone payment—which may not be a recurring factor in future earnings. This one-time event could inflate the perceived profitability for the period. The adjusted EBITDA, although a non-GAAP metric, provides insight into the company's operating performance by excluding non-cash expenses and its increase is indicative of a solid operational year.Considering the company's expansion into new markets and operational enhancements, such as the implementation of a new ERP system, there appears to be a strategic focus on scalability and efficiency. However, it is important to monitor how the operational expenditures, such as the costs of the new Orlando facility and increased staffing, will balance against the revenue growth in the long-term. Market Research Analyst The strategic changes highlighted by VirTra's CEO, including the overhaul of internal operations and sales team restructuring, are poised to potentially increase market share and enhance customer satisfaction. The introduction of V-XR, an extended reality training platform, taps into the growing demand for high-tech training solutions. The positive market reception to this new product could be a catalyst for revenue streams in the near future.VirTra's penetration into the military sector, facilitated by the integration of VBS software, is a strategic move that diversifies its client base beyond law enforcement. While longer sales cycles in the military market are typical, early expansion ahead of schedule is a positive signal. Stakeholders should consider the potential for these new product lines to contribute to sustained growth, albeit with the caution that new ventures carry inherent risks and uncertainties.The reduction of the backlog from previous years and the focus on a quick book-to-ship ratio may lead to better customer service and repeat business. However, the ability to maintain high gross margins in the face of increased competition and potential market saturation will be an important aspect to watch. Economist The financial results of VirTra are indicative of a favorable economic environment for the defense training and simulation industry. The 34% increase in annual revenue suggests that the sector is experiencing robust growth, likely fueled by increased global security concerns and a heightened focus on law enforcement training. The company's ability to significantly grow its net income while managing to keep its cost of sales in line with previous levels is a testament to the effectiveness of its cost-control measures.Investors might consider the broader economic implications of VirTra's growth, including the potential for job creation through new hires and the economic impact of the new Orlando facility. Additionally, the company's investment in technology and R&D indicates a forward-looking approach that could be beneficial in maintaining a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving industry.However, it is important to remain cautious about the sustainability of the growth rates reported, especially in the context of the one-time milestone payment. The ability of VirTra to replicate such performance organically in subsequent years will be important for long-term valuation. 04/01/2024 - 04:05 PM Annual Revenue Grows to a Record $38.0 Million, Marking a 34% Increase Net Income Increases to $8.4 Million in 2023 CHANDLER, Ariz., April 01, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VirTra, Inc. (Nasdaq: VTSI) (“VirTra”), a global provider of judgmental use of force training simulators, firearms training simulators for the law enforcement and military markets, reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. The financial statements are available on VirTra’s website and here. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Summary: Total revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $10.1 millionGross profit increased 58% year-over-year to $8.4 million, or 83% of total revenueNet income increased by $1.4 million year-over-year to $2.8 millionAdjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 millionCash and cash equivalents of $18.9 million at December 31, 2023 Full Year 2023 Financial Summary: Total revenue increased 34% to $38.0 millionGross profit increased 64% to $26.7 million, or 70% of total revenueNet income increased by $6.4 million to $8.4 millionAdjusted EBITDA totaled $11.6 million Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights: For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months EndedAll figures in millions, except per share dataDecember 31, 2023December 31, 2022% Δ December 31, 2023December 31, 2022% ΔTotal Revenue$10.1$8.617% $38.0$28.334% Gross Profit$8.4$5.358% $26.7$16.364%Gross Margin83%61%N/A 70%57%N/A Net Income (Loss)$2.8$1.4N/A $8.4$2.0N/ADiluted EPS$0.25$0.13N/A $0.77$0.18N/AAdjusted EBITDA$1.7$1.9N/A $11.6$4.0N/A Management Commentary “2023 was a year of substantial transformation, which culminated in a strong fourth quarter with revenue of $10.1 million – our third double-digit million revenue quarter in 2023. This performance led to record-breaking annual revenue of $38.0 million, representing a 34% increase from 2022,” said VirTra CEO John Givens. “Our success has been the result of strategic changes we’ve implemented across our business, particularly in enhancing our internal operations. Last year, we successfully upgraded our machine shop and consolidated production into a single facility, implemented a new ERP system, and revised our processes for scalability, just to name a few of the operational strides we took. These actions have increased our throughput significantly and improved our book-to-ship ratio, all while reducing production costs and maintaining excellent product quality. We are now shipping orders that we receive within days instead of years, and we have set a solid foundation for future success as demand for our solutions continues to rise.” “This strategic overhaul was instrumental in effectively working through the substantial backlog we faced entering 2023. With that backlog down to $19.4 million entering 2024, growing bookings and our pipeline will be critical to our growth trajectory going forward. To align more closely with future growth opportunities, we also restructured our sales team, introducing new methodologies, adopting a territory-based approach, and revising our compensation structure. We expect these adjustments to enhance our sales productivity and bolster our customer success functions. “As our newly implemented sales strategies begin to take root, we expect that the technological innovations we made in 2023 will drive further interest from the core law enforcement market and the military sector. The introduction of V-XR®, our extended reality training platform, has been met with great interest, with a very positive market reception setting us up for strong delivery volume starting in the next few months. V-XR’s emphasis on training soft skills, such as managing mental health crises, is set to broaden our reach within our core target markets but also in wider settings, such as in hospitals and educational institutions. Additionally, to better serve military customers, we integrated VBS, a premier military software that facilitates the creation of real-time, geo-specific training into our simulators. Despite the typically longer sales cycles in the military market, our foothold is expanding ahead of schedule. “Building on our operating momentum, we are moving into the second quarter with high confidence in our trajectory for continued growth for 2024.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Total revenue increased 16% to $10.1 million from $8.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in revenue was driven by continued demand for training solutions with government customers, both domestically and internationally. Gross profit increased 58% to $8.4 million from $5.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin was 83%, an increase compared to 61% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net operating expense was $5.8 million, compared to $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in net operating expense was associated with additional staffing and the opening of the Company’s Orlando facility. Operating income increased by $0.7 million to $2.6 million from $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income was $2.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share (based on 11.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), an improvement compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share (based on 10.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was $1.7 million, compared to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Total revenue increased 34% to $38.0 million from $28.3 million in 2022. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of increases in simulator and accessory sales, STEP sales, and design and prototyping revenue. Gross profit increased 64% to $26.7 million from $16.3 million in 2022. Gross profit margin was 70%, an increase compared to 57% in 2022. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in revenue while maintaining cost of sales in line with 2022 levels. Also contributing to this increase was an unusual event of the Company’s receiving a $3 million kickoff milestone payment in connection with a contract for custom work, for which no significant costs were associated. Net operating expense was $17.0 million in 2023, compared to $13.7 million in 2022. The increase in net operating expense was primarily driven by an increase in salaries and benefits resulting from the addition of new staff, expenses for the new Orlando office, as well as an increase in R&D spend, and the implementation expense related to the launch of the Company’s new ERP system. Operating income jumped to $9.6 million in 2023, a $7.0 million increase from $2.6 million in the prior year period. Net income was $8.4 million, or $0.77 per diluted share (based on 11.0 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), an improvement compared to net income of $2.0 million, or $0.18 per diluted share (based on 10.9 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding), in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, increased to $11.1 million from $3.6 million in 2022. Financial Commentary “In the fourth quarter we continued to grow our revenue while making improvements to our profitability metrics,” said VirTra CFO Alanna Boudreau. “The changes we’ve made internally to our operations have also had a significant effect on the margin growth we had in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Based on our recent performance, we are expecting that our backlog will remain lower than past levels historically as we focus on continuing to improve our book-to-ship ratio moving forward. We anticipate continued revenue and profitability expansion as we move into additional markets outside of law enforcement in 2024.” Conference CallVirTra’s management will hold a conference call today (April 1, 2024) at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these results.

About the Presentation of Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and before other non-operating costs and income (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA also includes non-cash stock option expense and other than temporary impairment loss on investments. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently. VirTra calculates its Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of certain items it does not consider to be indicative of its performance and its ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is presented herein because management believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to VirTra’s investors regarding VirTra’s financial condition and results of operations and because Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in VirTra’s industry, several of which present a form of Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of VirTra’s results as reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative for net income, cash flows from operating activities and other consolidated income or cash flows statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity.
