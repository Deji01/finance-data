The application is based on Phase 2b and Clarity AD studies data. Fast Track designation sought for SC formulation. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application for lecanemab-irmb by Eisai represents a significant step in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The focus on early-stage Alzheimer's is noteworthy, as early intervention is key in managing the disease's progression. The maintenance dosing regimen, transitioning from biweekly to monthly, could potentially improve patient adherence and quality of life by reducing the frequency of treatments. This shift also aligns with the trend in biologic therapies towards less frequent dosing schedules, which can reduce healthcare resource utilization.From a clinical perspective, the maintenance of drug concentration for sustained clearance of neurotoxic protofibrils is crucial. The modeling data from the Phase 2b and Clarity AD studies indicate a commitment to evidence-based progression of treatment protocols. However, it is essential to scrutinize the long-term efficacy and safety data, particularly as it relates to the potential for immunogenicity with the proposed subcutaneous administration route. The requirement for additional immunogenicity data underscores the FDA's focus on patient safety in the context of novel administration methods. Financial Analyst The announcement by Eisai to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application and pursue a Fast Track designation for a subcutaneous formulation of lecanemab-irmb may have a notable impact on BioArctic's financial outlook. As the originator of the antibody used in lecanemab, BioArctic stands to benefit from the commercial success of the drug. The potential approval and subsequent commercialization in the Nordic region, where BioArctic holds commercialization rights, could provide a significant revenue stream for the company.Investors should monitor the FDA's decision on the Fast Track designation for the subcutaneous formulation, as this could expedite the review process and potentially lead to earlier market entry. Additionally, the drug's approval in multiple global markets, including the U.S., Japan and China and submissions in various other countries, signals a broad market potential. However, the competitive landscape of Alzheimer's treatments and the overall market reception to new administration methods should be considered when evaluating the financial implications for BioArctic and its partners. Healthcare Industry Analyst The global approval and submission strategy for lecanemab-irmb showcases Eisai's and BioArctic's commitment to addressing Alzheimer's disease on a worldwide scale. The approval in major markets like the U.S., Japan and China and the pending reviews in the European Union and other regions, indicate the potential for lecanemab to become a standard of care for early Alzheimer's disease. This could disrupt the current treatment paradigm, which has been historically limited by a lack of effective options.The collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, leveraging Professor Lars Lannfelt's discovery, exemplifies the value of academic-industry partnerships in drug development. The commercial strategy, with Eisai leading development and BioArctic preparing for Nordic commercialization, suggests a well-organized approach to leverage each company's strengths. The market should assess the impact of these strategic moves on the broader Alzheimer's treatment market, including potential shifts in market share and treatment guidelines. 03/31/2024 - 11:19 PM STOCKHOLM, April 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BioArctic AB's (publ) (Nasdaq: BIOA B) (Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai announced today that Eisai has submitted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for monthly lecanemab-irmb (U.S. brand name: Leqembi®) intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Leqembi is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease (collectively referred to as early AD). As part of the monthly IV maintenance regimen, the patients who have completed the biweekly IV initiation phase, exact period under discussion with the FDA, would receive a monthly IV dose that maintains effective drug concentration to sustain the clearance of highly toxic protofibrils[1] which can continue to cause neuronal injury even after the amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque has been cleared from the brain. The sBLA is based on modeling of observed data from the Phase 2b study (Study 201) and its open-label extension (OLE) as well as Clarity AD study (Study 301) and its OLE study. Eisai had aimed to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for weekly maintenance therapy using subcutaneous (SC) administration in March 2024. To respond to the FDA's recent requirement of additional three-month immunogenicity data at the proposed maintenance dose of 360 mg weekly, Eisai planned to initiate a rolling BLA for lecanemab SC maintenance in the first quarter 2024, under lecanemab's existing Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations.[2] However, Eisai was recently informed by the FDA that a Fast Track designation specific for the SC formulation is needed to receive rolling review. Following the guidance, Eisai submitted a request for Fast Track designation for the SC formulation and will initiate a rolling submission should the FDA grant this designation. The Fast Track designation will be determined within 60 days from the March 2024 submission. AD is an ongoing neurotoxic process that begins before and continues after plaque deposition. There is an urgency to treat early AD because early and ongoing treatment can slow the progression of AD and continuing treatment may prolong the benefit even after plaque is cleared from the brain. The earlier Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia are diagnosed and treated, the greater the opportunity for the patient to benefit. Continued maintenance dosing is intended to maintain the clinical and biomarker benefits with a dosing regimen that may be more convenient for some patients and their care partners. Leqembi is now approved in the U.S., Japan and China, and applications have been submitted for review in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Great Britain, India, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Switzerland. The drug is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, and the antibody was originally developed by BioArctic based on the work of Professor Lars Lannfelt and his discovery of the Arctic mutation in Alzheimer's disease. Eisai serves as the lead of lecanemab development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. BioArctic has the right to commercialize lecanemab in the Nordic region, pending European approval, and currently Eisai and BioArctic are preparing for a joint commercialization in the region.

It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ). Lecanemab is approved in the U.S., Japan, and China with the following indications: U.S.: For the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease. See full US prescribing information.Japan: For slowing progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to AD.China: For the treatment of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia.Lecanemab approvals were based on the large global Phase 3 Clarity AD study. In the Clarity AD study, lecanemab met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results. In November 2022, the results of the Clarity AD study were presented at the 2022 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference, and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a peer-reviewed medical journal. Eisai has also submitted applications for approval of lecanemab in 14 countries and regions, including the European Union (EU). Eisai has completed a lecanemab subcutaneous bioavailability study, and subcutaneous dosing is currently being evaluated in the Clarity AD (Study 301) open-label extension (OLE) study. A maintenance dosing regimen has been evaluated as part of the Phase 2b study (Study 201). Since July 2020 Eisai's Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) for individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. AHEAD 3-45 is conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health and Eisai. Since January 2022, the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy. About the collaboration between BioArctic and EisaiSince 2005, BioArctic has a long-term collaboration with Eisai regarding the development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The most important agreements are the Development and Commercialization Agreement for the lecanemab antibody, which was signed 2007, and the Development and Commercialization agreement for the antibody Leqembi back-up for Alzheimer's disease, which was signed 2015. In 2014, Eisai and Biogen entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement for lecanemab. Eisai is responsible for the clinical development, application for market approval and commercialization of the products for Alzheimer's disease. BioArctic has the right to commercialize lecanemab in the Nordic region under certain conditions and is currently preparing for commercialization in the Nordics together with Eisai. BioArctic has no development costs for lecanemab in Alzheimer's disease and is entitled to payments in connection with regulatory approvals, and sales milestones as well as royalties on global sales. About BioArctic ABBioArctic AB (publ) is a Swedish research-based biopharma company focusing on innovative treatments that can delay or stop the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

[1] Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition. Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction. [2] Breakthrough Therapy designation and Fast Track designation are two FDA programs that are intended to facilitate and expedite development of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition such as AD and provide opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA.

By capturing and permanently storing these emissions, it is possible to reduce up to 25% of Trondheim municipality's CO₂ emissions. The pre-FEED covers CO2 capture, compression, purification, liquefaction, and temporary storage of CO2 at the Heimdal waste-to-energy plant. From Heimdal, the liquid CO2 will be transported by truck to an export terminal with subsequent ship transport to permanent storage. ""We are excited to extend our collaboration with Statkraft. The decarbonization of the waste-to-energy industry is crucial in achieving Norway's ambitious climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030,"" said Jon Christopher Knudsen, Chief Commercial Officer at Aker Carbon Capture. ""By leveraging our product portfolio and ongoing projects, we maintain a robust position within the waste-to-energy sector,"" Knudsen continued. In 2023, Aker Carbon Capture was awarded a full FEED by Hafslund Oslo Celsio, the largest supplier of district heating in Norway, to develop carbon capture at their waste-to-energy facility at Klemetsrud in Oslo, Norway. The project will be delivered based on Aker Carbon Capture's modularized Just Catch 400 unit, with a design capacity to capture up to 400,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Treating waste in a modern incineration plant is the most climate-efficient way of final treatment when the waste has no other utility value. However, waste incineration emits large volumes of CO2. District heating from Statkraft's waste-to-energy plant at Heimdal provides more than 30% of the Trondheim municipality's heating demand. District heating reduces the amount of electricity needed, making more electricity available for other purposes. Together with the direct carbon reduction and removal when these emissions are captured, waste-to-energy facilities serve as an important part of Norway's journey towards net zero. Project Manager Bjørn Hølaas in Statkraft finds it exciting that Aker Carbon Capture is one of the three selected contractors who will carry out pre-FEED studies for CO2 reduction and removal from our waste incineration plants in Trondheim. Statkraft looks forward to continuing the good dialogue with Aker Carbon Capture, and not least studying the report from Aker when it is completed in the autumn. Statkraft is also a member of 'CCS Midt-Norge', an industry cluster for CO2 capture and storage in central Norway, representing about 1.5 million tonnes of annual CO2 emissions. The cluster is expected to lead to an increased understanding, progress and potential economies of scale related to the realization of CCS in the region.

Fast Track designation sought for SC formulation. LEQEMBI aims to reduce protofibrils' impact on brain injury. Positive None. Negative The need for additional immunogenicity data delays the BLA submission for the SC formulation. Fast Track designation specific for the SC formulation is required for rolling review. ARIA-related imaging abnormalities pose risks, especially for ApoE ε4 homozygotes. Intracerebral hemorrhages have been observed, including fatal events. Hypersensitivity reactions and infusion-related reactions have occurred in patients treated with LEQEMBI. Medical Research Analyst The submission of a Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for LEQEMBI by Eisai to the FDA represents a significant event in the progression of Alzheimer's disease treatment options. This development is particularly noteworthy given that LEQEMBI is one of the few therapies targeting early-stage Alzheimer's, a period when intervention may be most beneficial. The focus on maintaining effective drug concentration through monthly IV dosing to sustain clearance of protofibrils is a strategic approach to prolonging the therapeutic benefits of the drug. The clinical implications of this are substantial, as continued treatment could potentially slow disease progression and improve quality of life for patients.Furthermore, the request for a Fast Track designation for the subcutaneous (SC) formulation indicates a commitment to enhancing the convenience and accessibility of the treatment. The FDA's response to this request and the subsequent rolling submission process will be critical in determining the speed at which this new dosing option becomes available to patients. The potential for a more convenient SC administration could improve adherence to treatment regimens, a common challenge in chronic disease management. Financial Analyst The announcement by Eisai and Biogen regarding the sBLA for LEQEMBI is likely to have a tangible impact on the market performance of both companies. The progress in regulatory submissions and the expansion of the drug's approval to additional markets, including the U.S., Japan and China, with ongoing applications in numerous other countries, suggests a strategic effort to capture a significant share of the global Alzheimer's treatment market.Investors should note the potential for increased revenue streams from LEQEMBI, especially considering the high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and the limited number of effective treatments currently available. The Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations could expedite the approval process, allowing for quicker market entry and competitive advantage. However, the requirement for additional immunogenicity data and the need for a specific Fast Track designation for the SC formulation introduce an element of uncertainty that could affect investor sentiment and stock volatility in the short term. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of LEQEMBI's potential widespread use are multifaceted. On one hand, the treatment could lead to reduced long-term healthcare costs by potentially delaying the progression of Alzheimer's disease and decreasing the need for more intensive care. On the other hand, the costs associated with monthly IV treatments and the management of side effects, such as ARIA, could pose financial challenges for healthcare systems and patients. It is important to consider the cost-effectiveness of such treatments, balancing the potential clinical benefits against the economic burden they may impose.Moreover, the therapeutic landscape of Alzheimer's disease is shifting towards early intervention strategies, which could lead to increased screening and diagnostic procedures. This shift has the potential to increase overall healthcare expenditures but may ultimately result in better patient outcomes and reduced long-term costs associated with advanced stages of the disease. 03/31/2024 - 07:30 PM TOKYO and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Co., Ltd. (Headquarters: Tokyo, CEO: Haruo Naito, ""Eisai"") and Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB, Corporate headquarters: Cambridge, Massachusetts, CEO: Christopher A. Viehbacher, ""Biogen"") announced today that Eisai submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a Supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for monthly lecanemab-irmb (U.S. brand name: LEQEMBI®) intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing. LEQEMBI is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease (collectively referred to as early AD). As part of the monthly IV maintenance regimen, the patients who have completed the biweekly IV initiation phase, exact period under discussion with the FDA, would receive a monthly IV dose that maintains effective drug concentration to sustain the clearance of highly toxic protofibrils* which can continue to cause neuronal injury even after the amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque has been cleared from the brain. The sBLA is based on modeling of observed data from the Phase 2 study (Study 201) and its open-label extension (OLE) as well as Clarity AD study (Study 301) and its OLE study. Eisai had aimed to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) for weekly maintenance therapy using subcutaneous (SC) administration in March 2024. To respond to the FDA's recent requirement of additional three-month immunogenicity data at the proposed maintenance dose of 360 mg weekly, Eisai planned to initiate a rolling BLA for lecanemab SC maintenance in March 2024, under the existing Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations. However, Eisai was recently informed by the FDA that a Fast Track designation specific for the SC formulation is needed to receive rolling review. Following the guidance, Eisai submitted a request for Fast Track designation for the SC formulation and will initiate a rolling submission should the FDA grant this designation. The Fast Track designation will be determined within 60 days from the March 2024 submission. AD is an ongoing neurotoxic process that begins before and continues after plaque deposition. There is an urgency to treat early AD because early and ongoing treatment can slow the progression of AD and continuing treatment may prolong the benefit even after plaque is cleared from the brain. The earlier Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD and mild AD dementia are diagnosed and treated, the greater the opportunity for the patient to benefit. Continued maintenance dosing is intended to maintain the clinical and biomarker benefits with a dosing regimen that may be more convenient for some patients and their care partners. LEQEMBI is now approved in the U.S., Japan and China, and applications have been submitted for review in the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, Great Britain, India, Israel, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Switzerland. Eisai serves as the lead for lecanemab's development and regulatory submissions globally with both companies co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. * Protofibrils are believed to contribute to the brain injury that occurs with AD and are considered to be the most toxic form of Aβ, having a primary role in the cognitive decline associated with this progressive, debilitating condition.1 Protofibrils cause injury to neurons in the brain, which in turn, can negatively impact cognitive function via multiple mechanisms, not only increasing the development of insoluble Aβ plaques but also increasing direct damage to brain cell membranes and the connections that transmit signals between nerve cells or nerve cells and other cells. It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction. 2 U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONLEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb) 100 mg/ml injection for intravenous (IV) use is indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with LEQEMBI should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. WARNING: AMYLOID RELATED IMAGING ABNORMALITIES (ARIA) Monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of amyloid beta, including LEQEMBI, can cause amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), characterized as ARIA with edema (ARIA-E) and ARIA with hemosiderin deposition (ARIA-H). Incidence and timing of ARIA vary among treatments. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events rarely can occur. Serious intracerebral hemorrhages >1 cm, some of which have been fatal, have been observed in patients treated with this class of medications. Apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4) Homozygotes: Patients who are ApoE ε4 homozygotes (approximately 15% of Alzheimer's disease patients) treated with this class of medications, including LEQEMBI, have a higher incidence of ARIA, including symptomatic, serious, and severe radiographic ARIA, compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. Testing for ApoE ε4 status should be performed prior to initiation of treatment to inform the risk of developing ARIA. Prior to testing, prescribers should discuss with patients the risk of ARIA across genotypes and the implications of genetic testing results. Prescribers should inform patients that if genotype testing is not performed, they can still be treated with LEQEMBI; however, it cannot be determined if they are ApoE ε4 homozygotes and at higher risk for ARIA. Consider the benefit of LEQEMBI for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and potential risk of serious adverse events associated with ARIA when deciding to initiate treatment with LEQEMBICONTRAINDICATIONLEQEMBI is contraindicated in patients with serious hypersensitivity to lecanemab-irmb or to any of the excipients of LEQEMBI. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSAmyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities LEQEMBI can cause ARIA-E and ARIA-H. ARIA-E can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions, and ARIA-H as microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis. ARIA can occur spontaneously in patients with Alzheimer's disease. ARIA-H associated with monoclonal antibodies directed against aggregated forms of beta amyloid generally occurs in association with an occurrence of ARIA-E. ARIA-H and ARIA-E can occur together. ARIA usually occurs early in treatment and is usually asymptomatic, although serious and life-threatening events, including seizure and status epilepticus, rarely can occur. Reported symptoms associated with ARIA may include headache, confusion, visual changes, dizziness, nausea, and gait difficulty. Focal neurologic deficits may also occur. Symptoms associated with ARIA usually resolve over time.ARIA Monitoring and Dose Management Guidelines Obtain recent baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to initiating treatment with LEQEMBI. Obtain an MRI prior to the 5th, 7th and 14th infusions.Recommendations for dosing in patients with ARIA-E and ARIA-H depend on clinical symptoms and radiographic severity. Depending on ARIA severity, use clinical judgment in considering whether to continue dosing, temporarily discontinue treatment, or permanently discontinue LEQEMBI.Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 14 weeks of treatment with LEQEMBI. If a patient experiences symptoms suggestive of ARIA, clinical evaluation should be performed, including MRI if indicated. If ARIA is observed on MRI, careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment.There is no experience in patients who continued dosing through symptomatic ARIA-E or through asymptomatic, but radiographically severe, ARIA-E. There is limited experience in patients who continued dosing through asymptomatic but radiographically mild to moderate ARIA-E. There are limited data in dosing patients who experienced recurrent ARIA-E.Incidence of ARIA In Study 2, symptomatic ARIA occurred in 3% (29/898) of LEQEMBI-treated patients. Serious symptoms associated with ARIA were reported in 0.7% (6/898) of patients treated with LEQEMBI. Clinical symptoms associated with ARIA resolved in 79% (23/29) of patients during the period of observation.Including asymptomatic radiographic events, ARIA was observed in LEQEMBI: 21% (191/898); placebo: 9% (84/897). ARIA-E was observed in LEQEMBI: 13% (113/898); placebo: 2% (15/897). ARIA-H was observed in LEQEMBI: 17% (152/898); placebo: 9% (80/897). There was no increase in isolated ARIA-H for LEQEMBI vs placebo.ApoE ε4 Carrier Status and Risk of ARIA In Study 2, 16% (141/898) of patients in the LEQEMBI arm were ApoE ε4 homozygotes, 53% (479/898) were heterozygotes, and 31% (278/898) were noncarriers.The incidence of ARIA was higher in ApoE ε4 homozygotes (LEQEMBI: 45%; placebo: 22%) than in heterozygotes (LEQEMBI: 19%; placebo: 9%) and noncarriers (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 4%). Among patients treated with LEQEMBI, symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 9% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes compared with 2% of heterozygotes and 1% noncarriers. Serious events of ARIA occurred in 3% of ApoE ε4 homozygotes, and approximately 1% of heterozygotes and noncarriers.The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers.Radiographic Findings The majority of ARIA-E radiographic events occurred early in treatment (within the first 7 doses), although ARIA can occur at any time and patients can have more than 1 episode. The maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-E in patients treated with LEQEMBI was mild in 4% (37/898), moderate in 7% (66/898), and severe in 1% (9/898). Resolution on MRI occurred in 52% of ARIA-E patients by 12 weeks, 81% by 17 weeks, and 100% overall after detection. The maximum radiographic severity of ARIA-H microhemorrhage in LEQEMBI-treated patients was mild in 9% (79/898), moderate in 2% (19/898), and severe in 3% (28/898) of patients; superficial siderosis was mild in 4% (38/898), moderate in 1% (8/898), and severe in 0.4% (4/898). Among LEQEMBI-treated patients, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-E was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes 5% (7/141), compared to heterozygotes 0.4% (2/479) or noncarriers 0% (0/278). Among LEQEMBI-treated patients, the rate of severe radiographic ARIA-H was highest in ApoE ε4 homozygotes 13.5% (19/141), compared to heterozygotes 2.1% (10/479) or noncarriers 1.1% (3/278).Intracerebral Hemorrhage Intracerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in diameter was reported in 0.7% (6/898) of patients in Study 2 after treatment with LEQEMBI compared to 0.1% (1/897) on placebo. Fatal events of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients taking LEQEMBI have been reported.Concomitant Antithrombotic Medication: In Study 2, baseline use of antithrombotic medication (aspirin, other antiplatelets, or anticoagulants) was allowed if the patient was on a stable dose. The majority of exposures to antithrombotic medications were to aspirin. Antithrombotic medications did not increase the risk of ARIA with LEQEMBI. The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage was 0.9% (3/328 patients) in patients taking LEQEMBI with a concomitant antithrombotic medication at the time of the event compared to 0.6% (3/545 patients) in those who did not receive an antithrombotic. Patients taking LEQEMBI with an anticoagulant alone or combined with an antiplatelet medication or aspirin had an incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage of 2.5% (2/79 patients) compared to none in patients who received placebo.Because intracerebral hemorrhages >1 cm in diameter have been observed in patients taking LEQEMBI, additional caution should be exercised when considering the administration of anticoagulants or a thrombolytic agent (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) to a patient already being treated with LEQEMBI.Other Risk Factors for Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Patients were excluded from enrollment in Study 2 for findings on neuroimaging that indicated an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage. These included findings suggestive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (prior cerebral hemorrhage >1 cm in greatest diameter, >4 microhemorrhages, superficial siderosis, vasogenic edema) or other lesions (aneurysm, vascular malformation) that could potentially increase the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. The presence of an ApoE ε4 allele is also associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which has an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage. Caution should be exercised when considering the use of LEQEMBI in patients with factors that indicate an increased risk for intracerebral hemorrhage and in particular for patients who need to be on anticoagulant therapy.Hypersensitivity ReactionsHypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis, have occurred in LEQEMBI-treated patients. Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, and initiate appropriate therapy. Infusion-Related Reactions In Study 2, infusion-related reactions were observed in LEQEMBI: 26% (237/898); placebo: 7% (66/897), and the majority of cases in LEQEMBI-treated patients (75%, 178/237) occurred with the first infusion. Infusion-related reactions were mostly mild (69%) or moderate (28%) in severity. Infusion-related reactions resulted in discontinuations in 1% (12/898) of LEQEMBI-treated patients. Symptoms of infusion-related reactions included fever and flu-like symptoms (chills, generalized aches, feeling shaky, and joint pain), nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypertension, and oxygen desaturation.In the event of an infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate may be reduced, or the infusion may be discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated as clinically indicated. Prophylactic treatment with antihistamines, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or corticosteroids prior to future infusions may be considered.ADVERSE REACTIONS In Study 2, the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of LEQEMBI was ARIA-H microhemorrhages that led to discontinuation in 2% (15/898) of patients treated with LEQEMBI compared to <1% (1/897) of patients on placebo.In Study 2, the most common adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of patients treated with LEQEMBI (N=898) and ≥2% higher than placebo (N=897) were infusion-related reactions (LEQEMBI: 26%; placebo: 7%), ARIA-H (LEQEMBI: 14%; placebo: 8%), ARIA-E (LEQEMBI: 13%; placebo: 2%), headache (LEQEMBI: 11%; placebo: 8%), superficial siderosis of central nervous system (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 3%), rash (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%), and nausea/vomiting (LEQEMBI: 6%; placebo: 4%).Please see full Prescribing Information for LEQEMBI, including Boxed WARNING.

About lecanemab (Leqembi®) Lecanemab is the result of a strategic research alliance between Eisai and BioArctic. It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ).3 Lecanemab is approved in the U.S.,4 Japan,5 and China.6 In the U.S., Japan and China, the indications are as follows: U.S.: For the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease.4Japan: For slowing progression of MCI and mild dementia due to AD.5China: For the treatment of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia.6LEQEMBI's FDA approval was based on Phase 3 data from Eisai's, global Clarity AD clinical trial, in which it met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results.7 The primary endpoint was the global cognitive and functional scale, Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). In the Clarity AD clinical trial, treatment with lecanemab reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB by 27% at 18 months compared to placebo.7 The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 1.66 with placebo (difference, −0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.67 to −0.23; P<0.001).7 In addition, the secondary endpoint from the AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL), which measures information provided by people caring for patients with AD, noted a statistically significant benefit of 37% compared to placebo.7 The adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months in the ADCS-MCI-ADL score was −3.5 in the lecanemab group and −5.5 in the placebo group (difference, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001).7 The ADCS MCI-ADL assesses the ability of patients to function independently, including being able to dress, feed themselves and participate in community activities. The most common adverse events (>10%) in the lecanemab group were infusion reactions, ARIA-H (combined cerebral microhemorrhages, cerebral macrohemorrhages, and superficial siderosis), ARIA-E (edema/effusion), headache, and fall.7 Eisai has also submitted applications for approval of lecanemab in 14 countries and regions, including the European Union (EU). 2.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of new A ordinary shares by Noble Corporation plc and the exercise of warrants resulting in additional capital reflects a potential strategy to bolster the company's financial position. The exercise prices, USD 19.27 and USD 23.13 respectively, suggest that the company is capitalizing on its current share value, which may be perceived positively by investors. However, the proceeds of just over USD 4,000 are relatively insignificant in the context of the company's overall capital structure.The issuance of shares to employees as part of the vesting of restricted stock units is a common form of performance incentive. It aligns employee interests with those of shareholders, potentially driving company performance. However, investors should monitor the dilutive effect of such practices on their holdings. The total number of A ordinary shares now stands at 142,816,359 and while the nominal value is low, the impact on share price and earnings per share is a key consideration for current and prospective shareholders. Market Research Analyst The dual listing of Noble's shares on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Copenhagen offers investors flexibility and may attract a broader investment base, potentially increasing liquidity. The ability to exchange shares between markets could be seen as a strategic move to enhance the attractiveness of Noble's shares to international investors. The uniformity in dividends and voting rights, irrespective of the trading currency, simplifies the investment proposition.However, it is essential to consider the implications of currency exchange rates on dividends received in different denominations. Investors might prefer the stability of USD dividends, given the currency's global reserve status, but the choice offers strategic flexibility. The impact of this news on the stock market could be neutral to mildly positive, depending on investor perception of Noble's growth prospects and the effectiveness of its capital allocation strategy. 03/31/2024 - 04:00 PM SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Noble Corporation plc (""Noble"") (NYSE: NE, CSE: NOBLE) today announces changes to its share capital.

Revenues were €48.8 million for the year, down from €52.2 million in 2022. Loss for Q4 2023 was €9.8 million, compared to a profit of €2.5 million in Q4 2022. Positive Total assets as of December 31, 2023, amounted to approximately €611.7 million, compared to €576.2 million in 2022. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, were €48.8 million, a decrease from €52.2 million in 2022. Loss for Q4 2023 was €9.8 million, contrasting with a profit of €2.5 million in Q4 2022. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023, was €18.8 million, down from €20.8 million in 2022. The Company executed an agreement to sell its holdings in the 9 MW PV plant in Israel for approximately €11.2 million, with a potential additional payment of up to €4 million. The decrease in revenues was mainly due to lower electricity prices in Spain and curtailment of electricity supply in June 2023. Operating expenses decreased due to lower payments under Spanish RDL 17/2022. Project development costs increased primarily from photovoltaic projects in the USA, Italy, and Israel. Net profit for 2023 was €0.6 million, compared to €0.1 million in 2022. The Dorad power station saw increased revenues and net income in 2023. Construction of solar projects in the USA and Italy is progressing, with additional projects planned. The Talmei Yosef PV project sale agreement is expected to close in Q2 2024. Negative Revenues decreased due to lower electricity prices in Spain and curtailment of electricity supply. Loss for Q4 2023 was significant at €9.8 million. EBITDA declined from the previous year. The Company recorded a loss in connection with the expected sale of the Talmei Yosef facility. Energy Sector Financial Analyst The unaudited financial results of Ellomay Capital Ltd. indicate a mixed performance with a slight increase in net profit to €0.6 million from €0.1 million year-over-year, despite a decline in annual revenues from €52.2 million to €48.8 million. This scenario suggests effective cost management, possibly through operational efficiencies or cost-cutting measures. However, the reported loss for the last quarter of 2023 and a decrease in EBITDA from €20.8 million to €18.8 million year-over-year raise concerns about the company's short-term profitability and operational performance.Additionally, the sale of the Talmei Yosef PV plant and the subsequent loss from discontinued operations of €1.8 million, despite the asset being sold above its acquisition cost, highlights the complexities of accounting standards like IFRIC 12. Investors should be aware that such non-cash accounting entries can affect reported earnings without impacting cash flows. The total comprehensive income's significant swing from a €35.2 million loss to a €41.9 million gain, primarily due to changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges, underscores the volatility in the renewable energy sector, particularly in the context of fluctuating European electricity prices. Renewable Energy Market Analyst The financial results reflect the broader challenges in the renewable energy market, particularly in Europe. The decrease in electricity prices in Spain, which affected Ellomay's revenues, is indicative of market conditions that renewable energy companies must navigate. The company's reliance on power purchase agreements (PPAs) to stabilize revenue amidst fluctuating market prices is a common strategy in the industry. The PPA's role in buffering the impact of Spain's price decrease is significant, as it demonstrates the importance of long-term contracts in providing revenue predictability for renewable energy operators.Ellomay's strategic sale of the Talmei Yosef PV plant and the diversification into new markets, such as the United States and Italy, where construction and development of new solar projects are underway, reflect a proactive approach to portfolio management and geographic diversification. This strategy may mitigate risks associated with regional market volatility and regulatory changes. However, the geopolitical risks highlighted by the condition related to the 'war' status in southern Israel for the sale of the Talmei Yosef PV plant illustrate the non-market risks that renewable energy companies may face, which can have material impacts on transactions and operations. Risk Management Specialist Ellomay Capital's financials reveal several key risk management considerations. The company's exposure to changes in electricity prices and regulatory frameworks, such as the Spanish RDL 17/2022, is a testament to the regulatory risk inherent in the energy sector. The reported decrease in payments under RDL 17/2022 due to lower market prices in Spain could be seen as a short-term relief, but it also points to the sensitivity of operating expenses to regulatory changes.The hedging strategy through the Talasol PPA, which covers a significant portion of the output at a fixed price, is an effective risk mitigation tool against price volatility. The substantial change in fair value of cash flow hedges, leading to a large swing in other comprehensive income, demonstrates the importance of financial instruments in stabilizing cash flows. Investors should consider both the benefits and potential complexities associated with such hedging strategies, as they can have material implications on financial statements, particularly under volatile market conditions. 03/31/2024 - 05:21 PM TEL-AVIV, Israel, March 31, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American: ELLO) (TASE: ELLO) (""Ellomay"" or the ""Company""), a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and the USA, today reported its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Highlights • Total assets as of December 31, 2023 amounted to approximately €611.7 million, compared to total assets as of December 31, 2022 of approximately €576.2 million. • Revenues1 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were approximately €8.4 million. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, were approximately €48.8 million, compared to approximately €52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. • Loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately €9.8 million, compared to a profit of approximately €2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Profit for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately €0.6 million, compared with approximately €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. • EBITDA loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was approximately €2.5 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately €18.8 million, compared to approximately €20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. See below under ""Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for additional disclosure concerning EBITDA. • On December 31, 2023, the Company executed an agreement to sell its holdings in the 9 MW PV plant located in Talmei Yosef, Israel in consideration for NIS 44.75 million (approximately €11.2 million), with an additional potential payment of up to NIS 4 million in the event the Talmei Yosef PV Plant produces more than 18 million Kwh during 2024. In connection with the expected sale, the Company presents the results of this PV plant as discontinued operations and the results for the year and for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are adjusted accordingly. See below for additional information. Financial Overview for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 • Revenues were approximately €48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenues mainly results from the decrease in electricity prices in Spain and from a curtailment of the electricity supply from the Company's facilities in Spain to the grid during June 2023 due to maintenance and upgrade work on the main transmission line between Spain and Portugal, which caused a decrease in revenues of approximately €1 million. The Company subsequently implemented a solution aimed at minimizing the impact of future similar curtailments due to maintenance and upgrades to the national grid. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by an increase in revenues from the Company's biogas plants in the Netherlands, resulting mainly from increased production and an increase in the 2023 gas price, and from the connection to the grid of Ellomay Solar (a 28 MW photovoltaic plant in Spain) during June 2022, upon which the Company commenced recognition of revenues. • Operating expenses were approximately €22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €23.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in operating expenses mainly results from a decrease in payments under the Spanish RDL 17/2022, caused by a reduction in the electricity market price. RDL 17/2022 established the reduction of returns on the electricity generating activity of Spanish production facilities that do not emit greenhouse gases, accomplished through payments of a portion of the revenues by the production facilities to the Spanish government. As a result of the decrease in the electricity market price in Spain during the year ended December 31, 2023, the payments under RDL 17/2022 were lower compared to last year. This decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by increased operating expenses in connection with the Company's biogas operations in the Netherlands caused by higher production and the use of higher quality raw materials, and from the connection to the grid of Ellomay Solar during June 2022, upon which the Company commenced recognition of expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately €16 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses is mainly attributable to the commencement of recognition of results of Ellomay Solar upon connection to the Spanish grid in June 2022. • Project development costs were approximately €4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in project development costs is mainly due to development expenses in connection with photovoltaic projects in the USA, Italy, and Israel. • General and administrative expenses were approximately €5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is mostly due to a decrease in D&O liability insurance costs and to bonuses paid to employees in 2022. • The Company's share of profits of equity accounted investee, after elimination of intercompany transactions, was approximately €4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in share of profits of equity accounted investee was mainly due to the increase in revenues of Dorad Energy Ltd. (""Dorad"") due to higher quantities produced and a higher electricity tariff, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses in connection with the increased production and higher tariff. • Financing expenses, net, were approximately €3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in financing expenses, net, was mainly attributable to higher interest expenses in connection with the Company's loans (net of any related SWAP payments) and debentures amounting to an aggregate amount of approximately €11.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expenses mainly resulted from the issuance of the Company's Series E debentures in February 2023 and from higher interest rates applied to variable interest rate bearing loans. This increase was partially offset by higher interest income due to increased interest rates amounting to approximately €2 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an amount of approximately €0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and to higher income resulting from exchange rate differences, of approximately €6.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly in connection with the New Israeli Shekel (""NIS"") cash and cash equivalents and the Company's NIS denominated debentures, compared to approximately €6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, caused by the 6.9% devaluation of the NIS against the euro during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a 6.6% appreciation of the NIS against the euro during the year ended December 31, 2022. • Tax benefit was approximately €1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to taxes on income of approximately €1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in tax is mainly due to the substantial decrease in electricity prices in Spain, resulting in lower taxable income of the Company's Spanish subsidiaries. • Loss from discontinued operations (net of tax) was approximately €1.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a profit from discontinued operations of approximately €0.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. On December 31, 2023, the Company executed an agreement to sell its holdings in the 9 MW PV plant located in Talmei Yosef, Israel (the ""Agreement"" and the ""Talmei Yosef PV Plant,"" respectively). The Agreement provides for the sale of the Company's holdings in the Talmei Yosef PV Plant to Greenlight Fund Limited Partnership and Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources Ltd., in equal parts, in consideration for NIS 44.75 million (approximately €11.2 million), with an additional potential payment of up to NIS 4 million in the event the Talmei Yosef PV Plant produces more than 18 million Kwh during 2024. The Agreement further provides for a cutoff date of June 30, 2023, and at closing the parties will determine whether an adjustment to the purchase price is required reflect the Company's entitlement to revenues (net of expenses) up to such date, taking into account the results and the cash held by the project company. The Company does not expect a material adjustment to the purchase price. In connection with the expected sale of the Talmei Yosef PV Plant, the Company presents the results of the Talmei Yosef PV Plant as discontinued operations and the results for the year and for the three months ended December 31, 2022 are adjusted accordingly. The Talmei Yosef PV Plant is presented in the Company's financial results as a financial asset, in accordance with IFRIC 12 under IFRS, and since its acquisition of the plant, the Company recognized relatively high profits through its ownership. Accordingly, although the consideration expected to be received for the Talmei Yosef PV Plant reflects a market value that is higher than the price invested by the Company in its acquisition, due to the accounting treatment under IFRIC 12, the Company recognized a net loss of approximately €1.8 million in connection with the expected sale. The Agreement includes customary representations and indemnification undertakings in connection with breaches of representations, which, other than with respect to customary exceptions, are subject to a cap of NIS 9 million and limited to a period of 18 months from the closing date. The consummation of the sale is subject to various customary conditions to closing, including receipt of regulatory approvals and the consent of the financing entity of the Talmei Yosef PV Plant. All conditions to closing are required to be fulfilled within an initial period of 90 days from execution of the Talmei Yosef Sale Agreement, which can be extended to up to 150 days under certain circumstances. The Talmei Yosef PV Plant is located in southern Israel. One of the conditions to closing is the end of the ""war"" status in southern Israel for a pre-determined period (based on the official definitions published by the Israeli Authorities) and that the Talmei Yosef PV Plant is physically accessible. Based on the circumstances as of the date hereof, this condition is currently fulfilled but there can be no assurance that it will continue to be fulfilled on the expected closing date. The closing of the sale is currently expected during the second quarter of 2024. The Talmei Yosef Sale Agreement further provides that in the event that due to the current war and hostilities in Israel the facility will be damaged or its output will decrease, the buyers will have the right not to consummate the acquisition of the plant. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is subject to the fulfilment of the conditions to closing as of the date of the closing. These conditions to closing are mostly not within the Company's control or the buyers' control. There can be no assurance as to whether or when the conditions to closing will be satisfied and as to the impact of the war and hostilities in Israel on the ability to consummate the sale and on the final purchase price. • Net profit was approximately €0.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. • Total other comprehensive income was approximately €41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to total other comprehensive loss of approximately €35.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The change in total other comprehensive loss mainly results from changes in fair value of cash flow hedges, including a material increase in the fair value of the liability resulting from the financial power swap that covers approximately 80% of the output of the Talasol PV Plant (the ""Talasol PPA""). The Talasol PPA experienced a high volatility due to the substantial change in electricity prices in Europe. In accordance with hedge accounting standards, the changes in the Talasol PPA's fair value are recorded in the Company's shareholders' equity through a hedging reserve and not through the accumulated deficit/retained earnings. The changes do not impact the Company's consolidated net profit/loss or the Company's consolidated cash flows. • Total comprehensive income was approximately €41.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to total comprehensive loss of approximately €35.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. • EBITDA was approximately €18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. • Net cash from operating activities was approximately €9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately €11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. CEO Review Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 2023 was characterized by a decline in the electricity prices in Europe compared to the prices in 2022. The decrease is mainly evident in Spain, whereas in Italy the prices remained relatively stable. Despite the significant decrease in electricity prices in Spain, the revenues for 2023 did not decrease in the same rate and were approximately €48.8 million, compared to revenues of approximately €52.2 million in 2022. The main reason that the significant decrease in electricity prices in Spain has a relatively small impact on the Company's revenues is that the majority of the electricity the Company sells in Spain is under a long-term PPA. Net profit for 2023 was approximately €0.6 million, compared to approximately €0.1 million for 2022. The EBITDA for 2023 was approximately €18.8 million, compared to EBITDA of approximately €20.8 million in 2022. The decrease in the EBIDTA for 2023 was mainly due to a loss from discontinued operations in the amount of approximately €1.8 million that was recorded in connection with the expected sale of the Talmei Yosef facility. Although the consideration expected to be received for the Talmei Yosef project reflects a market value that is higher than the price invested by the Company in its acquisition, because the Talmei Yosef facility is treated as financial asset under IFRIC 12, the Company recorded a loss in connection with the expected sale. The Dorad power station presented an increase in revenues and net income during 2023, and the net income of Dorad for 2023 was approximately €53 million. The development and construction activities of solar projects in the USA are advancing rapidly and the construction of the first two projects, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 27.5 MW, commenced in early 2024. Two additional projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 22 MW are expected to commence construction in May 2024 and additional projects scheduled for construction in 2025 are under development. In Italy, the construction of a solar project with a capacity of 18 MW (ELLO 10) commenced, in addition to solar projects with a capacity of approximately 20 MW who have finished construction. Of the 20 MW that have finished construction, 5 MW were connected to the grid during the first quarter of 2024 and an additional 15 MW are expected to connect to the grid shortly. Therefore, the additional income from sales of electricity in Italy will only be reflected in 2024. At the end of 2023 an agreement for the sale of the Talmei Yosef PV project was executed, the cutoff date for the transaction was set at June 30, 2023. The Company maintained the rights to a portion of the land in Talmei Yosef, which will be used to construct projects under development (the Talmei Yosef Project and the Talmei Yosef Storage Project in Batteries noted below) that are currently not recorded as fixed assets in the Company's financial statements. Due to the expected sale, the financial results of the Talmei Yosef PV plant are presented as discontinued operations in the Company's financial results for 2023. The Company's operations concentrate on three main fields: - Construction of New Projects: solar projects in the USA, solar projects in Italy, and a pumped hydro storage project in the Manara Cliff in Israel. - Initiating and Developing of New Projects: solar projects in Italy, Spain, USA and Israel. - Management, Operation and Improvement of Generating Projects: in Israel (solar), Spain (solar) and the Netherlands (bio-gas). Activity in Spain: During 2023, the Talasol solar project (300 MW, Company's share is 51%) produced revenues from the sale of electricity and green certificates of approximately €25 million, slightly below the expected revenues due to a maintenance event in the main distribution line that caused a loss of revenues of approximately €1 million. As a result of the event a system was installed that significantly limits the possibility that such an event will recur in the future. Talasol is a party to a financial hedge of its electricity capture price (PPA). Approximately 80% of its production (75% based on P-50) are sold under this agreement for a fixed price. The remaining electricity produced by Talasol is sold directly to the grid, at spot prices. During 2023, the Ellomay Solar project (28 MW) produced revenues from the sale of electricity and green certificates of approximately €4 million. Activity in Italy: The Company has approximately 505 solar MW projects under advanced development stages, of which licenses have been obtained for approximately 203 MW. Projects with an aggregate capacity of approximately 20 MW have finished construction, of which 5 MW was connected during the first quarter of 2024 and an additional 15 MW will be connected within a few weeks. The construction works of ELLO 10 (18 MW) commenced and the completion of the construction is expected in the third quarter of 2024. Activity in Israel: The Manara Pumped Storage Project (Company's share is 83.34%): The Manara Cliff pumped storage project, with a capacity of 156 MW, is in advanced construction stages. The Iron Swords War, which commenced on October 7, 2023, stopped the construction work on the project. The project has protection from the state for damages and losses due to the war within the framework of the tariff regulation (covenants that support financing). The project was expected to reach commercial operation during the first half of 2027 and the continuation of the Iron Swords war will case a delay in the date of operations. The Israeli Electricity Authority currently approved a postponement of eight months of the dates for the project. The Company and its partner in the project, Ampa, invested the equity required for the project (other than linkage differences), and the remainder of the funding is from a consortium of lenders led by Mizrahi Bank, at a scope of approximately NIS 1.18 billion. Development of Solar licenses combined with storage: 1. The Komemiyut Project: intended for 21 solar MW and 50 MW / hour batteries. The sale of electricity will be conducted through a private supplier. Commencement of construction is planned for the third quarter of 2024. 2. The Qelahim Project: intended for 21 solar MW and 50 MW / hour batteries. The sale of electricity will be conducted through a private supplier. Commencement of construction is planned for the fourth quarter of 2024. With respect to projects 1 and 2, the Company waived the rights it won in the tender process no. 1 for battery storage and elected to transition to the regulation that enables direct sale to end customers. 3. The Talmei Yosef Project: intended for 10 solar MW and 22 MW / hour batteries. The request for zoning approval was approved in the fourth quarter of 2023. 4. The Talmei Yosef Storage Project in Batteries: there is a zoning approval for approximately 400 MW / hour. The project is designed for the regulation of high voltage storage. 5. The Company also has approximately 46 solar MW under preliminary planning stages. Dorad Power Station (Company's share is approximately 9.4%): the gas flow from the Karish reservoir that began in November 2022 reduced the gas costs of Dorad. Dorad benefited from the increase in the TAOZ and the production component compared to the same period last year. In addition, the Israeli Electricity Authority's resolution in connection with the changes of the hourly tariffs, which entered into force in January 2023, means an extension of the ""summer"" period (a month was added to the ""summer"" season in which the tariffs are higher), the elimination of the ""GEVA"" (average consumption) hours and the change in the ""PISGA"" (peak) hours in the intermediate seasons to the afternoon and evening. As a result, Dorad provides availability to the system manager for the ""SHEFEL"" (low) period, which is longer and the demand of the system manager is higher. As a result of the continuous operations of the power plant, the maintenance expenses decreased and the hours of operation increased, increasing production and the revenues and profit. Moreover, the Israeli government decided to increase the power station by an additional 650 MW and the National Infrastructure Committee approved the TTL/11/B plan – expansion of the Dorad power station. In June 2023, an arbitration award was given that, among other issues, obligated Zorlu and Edeltech to refund approximately $130 million to Dorad and to pay the derivative plaintiffs NIS 20 million as reimbursement of legal expenses. Appeals on the arbitration award were submitted by both parties and the appeal process was agreed in advance and is expected to end in the second quarter of 2024. Activity in the Netherlands: In connection with the military conflict in Ukraine and the stoppage of Russian gas supply to Europe, there are substantial changes in the field of biogas in the Netherlands and Europe. Europe in general and the Netherlands specifically have set ambitious goals for increasing gas production from waste. Various incentives are being considered, the main one is increasing the price of the green certificates. The price of these certificates has increased from approximately 13–15 euro cents per cubic meter to around 45 euro cents per cubic meter. The prices of green certificates continue to rise and the expectation is that the price will reach approximately 60 euro cents per cubic meter in 2024. The Company estimates that with the increasing importance of the biogas field, this field entered into a new era. In the Netherlands, new legislation was adopted that obliges the gas suppliers to incorporate green gas in a scope of up to 20% of the amount supplied by them, valid commencing January 1, 2025. This legislation and the growing demand for green certificates derived from the biogas industry, is expected to add and significantly improve the results of the biogas segment of the Company. Activity in Texas, USA: During the first quarter of 2024, the construction of the initial two projects, with an aggregate installed capacity of approximately 27.5 MW DC commenced, expected completion date is in September 2024. Two additional projects with an aggregate installed capacity of approximately 22 MW DC are expected to commence construction in May 2024. The estimated capital cost for the first two projects is approximately $30-$32 million, of which the Company's share is expected to be approximately $19-$21 million. The estimated capital cost for the two additional projects is approximately $24-$26 million, of which the Company's share is expected to be $15-$17 million. The remaining capital costs are expected to be covered by tax equity partners. The Company is developing additional projects scheduled for construction in 2025. Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as earnings before financial expenses, net, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company presents this measure in order to enhance the understanding of the Company's operating performance and to enable comparability between periods. While the Company considers EBITDA to be an important measure of comparative operating performance, EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other statement of operations or cash flow data prepared in accordance with IFRS as a measure of profitability or liquidity. EBITDA does not take into account the Company's commitments, including capital expenditures and restricted cash and, accordingly, is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available for discretionary uses. Not all companies calculate EBITDA in the same manner, and the measure as presented may not be comparable to similarly-titled measure presented by other companies. The Company's EBITDA may not be indicative of the Company's historic operating results; nor is it meant to be predictive of potential future results. The Company uses this measure internally as performance measure and believes that when this measure is combined with IFRS measure it add useful information concerning the Company's operating performance. A reconciliation between results on an IFRS and non-IFRS basis is provided on page 19 of this press release. About Ellomay Capital Ltd.

(NYSE American: MIMO) has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with Fortress Investment Group and key stakeholders to strengthen its financial foundation. The agreement includes up to $95 million of new equity financing and the elimination of all existing funded debt, positioning Airspan for long-term success in the 5G networks and Open RAN markets. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The agreement between Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. and its creditors, facilitated by Fortress Investment Group, is a strategic move designed to enhance the company's financial stability. The restructuring plan, which includes a substantial equity infusion and the elimination of existing debt, signifies a pivotal shift aimed at optimizing Airspan's capital structure. The decision to transition Airspan into a private entity reflects a broader industry trend where companies seek to streamline operations and focus on long-term growth without the pressures of public market scrutiny.The provision of $53 million in debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing is a critical component that will ensure Airspan's business continuity throughout the restructuring process. This financial maneuver is a common practice in prepackaged bankruptcies, allowing companies to maintain operational liquidity. The move is likely to be well-received by the market as it suggests a controlled and consensual approach to restructuring, which typically mitigates the risk of disruptive operational or financial surprises. Market Research Analyst Airspan's emphasis on 5G technology and Open RAN is indicative of its alignment with current telecom industry trends focused on innovation and flexibility. The restructuring may provide Airspan with a competitive edge, as a debt-free balance sheet can enable increased investment in research and development. This is particularly relevant as the telecom sector is known for its rapid technological advancements and the need for constant innovation to stay ahead.The market for 5G and private network solutions is expected to grow significantly and Airspan's strategic positioning in these areas could potentially capture a larger market share. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to effectively leverage its intellectual property portfolio and deliver on its product promises post-restructuring. Telecommunications Expert Airspan's role as a pioneer in end-to-end Open RAN and private network solutions places it at the forefront of a transformative phase in telecommunications. The industry is rapidly moving towards more open and interoperable architectures and Airspan's focus on these areas suggests it is well-positioned to capitalize on these changes. The restructuring could facilitate Airspan's agility and responsiveness to market demands, which is often more challenging for companies burdened with significant debt.The company's commitment to maintaining operations during the recapitalization process is vital for customer confidence and retention. In a highly competitive landscape, any sign of operational instability can lead to customer attrition. Therefore, the prepackaged nature of the restructuring and the full support of major creditors are reassuring signals to customers and partners of Airspan's operational solidity and future prospects. 03/31/2024 - 02:19 PM Enters Agreement with Creditors to Strengthen Financial Foundation and Right-Size Balance Sheet Airspan Will Become Private Company with Strong Balance Sheet and Greater Financial Flexibility Majority-Owned by Fortress Will Operate in Normal Course While Implementing Prepackaged Recapitalization on an Expedited Basis with Full Support of all Major Creditors Secures Commitment for Over $53 Million of DIP Financing to Support Operations BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. (NYSE American: MIMO) (“Airspan” or the “Company”), a provider of ground-breaking, disruptive software and hardware for 5G networks and a pioneer in end-to-end Open RAN, private network and air-to-ground connectivity solutions, today announced that it has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Agreement”) with certain funds managed by Fortress Investment Group (“Fortress”) and several of its other key financial stakeholders to position Airspan for long-term success through up to $95 million of new equity financing and the elimination of all the Company’s existing funded debt. “This support agreement is the culmination of a strategic review process, and we believe it is the best path forward for Airspan to continue providing exceptional services and products to our customers worldwide,” said Glenn Laxdal, President and Chief Executive Officer at Airspan. “By strengthening the Company financially with new capital and a debt-free balance sheet, we will be better positioned to execute our plan to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities across our public and private network markets. We appreciate the support and engagement of all of our stakeholders as we build Airspan for the future.” “Airspan provides a critical, next-generation suite of solutions for the broader telecommunications industry and possesses an invaluable intellectual property portfolio to protect its innovations,” said Drew McKnight, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner at Fortress. “We are excited about the Company’s long-term growth opportunities. Our significant commitments through this Agreement reflect our conviction that a recapitalized Airspan can further solidify its leadership position within the wireless industry. We look forward to continuing to support the Company’s talented management team throughout this process and in the future.” Airspan and its U.S. subsidiaries have filed voluntary prepackaged Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Court”) in order to implement the Agreement, that has received support from 97.4% of the Company’s funded debt creditors. Airspan will operate its business without disruption through this process, safeguarding its commitment to employees, customers, and suppliers. The Company expects to complete the process on a highly expedited basis and obtain court approval of the transaction in as soon as the next 30-45 days, resulting in Airspan becoming a private company majority-owned by Fortress affiliates after receiving certain governmental and regulatory consents. Consummation of the transactions set forth in the Agreement is subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. Airspan has received a commitment from Fortress affiliates for over $53 million in debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing, which combined with the Company’s cash on hand, is expected to provide sufficient capital during the restructuring process to support Airspan’s operations. The DIP financing is subject to Court approval and the satisfaction of specified closing conditions. Airspan is filing a number of customary “first day” motions with the Court to enable it to continue uninterrupted operations during the financial restructuring, including to continue paying employee wages and providing benefits to employees, and to pay vendors and suppliers in full in the ordinary course of business. As part of the transaction, Airspan’s existing common stockholders will have the opportunity to receive in exchange for their shares their pro rata share of a total of $450,000 or, at their election, warrants in lieu of cash; provided, that if more than 150 shareholders elect to receive warrants, no warrants will be issued.

Côté Gold is expected to be one of the largest operating gold mines in Canada with significant growth opportunities and a long mine life.","IAMGOLD Announces First Gold Pour at Côté Gold Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary IAMGOLD announces the successful completion of its first gold pour at the Côté Gold Mine in Ontario, Canada, operated in a joint venture with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., The company aims for commercial production in the third quarter, with a production guidance of 220,000 to 290,000 ounces of gold this year. Côté Gold is expected to be one of the largest operating gold mines in Canada with significant growth opportunities and a long mine life. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The initiation of gold production at IAMGOLD's Côté Gold Mine is a significant event that has the potential to influence the company's financial performance. The announcement details the completion of the first gold pour, which marks the transition from a development project to a producing asset. This transition is critical for IAMGOLD as it directly impacts their production output and revenue generation capabilities. With the addition of Côté Gold, IAMGOLD increases its operational footprint, diversifying its risk and potentially improving economies of scale.From a market perspective, the unchanged production guidance of 220,000 to 290,000 ounces of gold for the year indicates a strong start and operational confidence. The expected mine life of over 18 years positions Côté Gold as a long-term asset that could provide sustained value. Moreover, the mention of automation as a significant feature of the mine suggests operational efficiency and cost savings in the long run. However, investors should be aware that the ramp-up to commercial production and achieving the 90% throughput rate by year-end will be critical to watch, as these factors will influence whether the mine meets production and cost targets. Mining Engineer The inclusion of a fully automated haulage fleet is a forward-thinking approach that addresses both operational efficiency and worker safety. Automation in mining is a growing trend that can lead to reduced operating costs and increased predictability in production. The health and safety benefits cannot be overstated, as automation reduces the risk of accidents associated with human-operated machinery. The mention of the Côté Gold Mine's design for automation indicates that IAMGOLD is investing in cutting-edge technology, which could set a benchmark in the industry and attract interest from investors looking for companies at the forefront of innovation.Additionally, the combined Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 16.5 million ounces, with an additional 4.2 million ounces Inferred, places Côté among the larger gold deposits in Canada. This scale of resources is likely to provide a buffer against gold price volatility and could make IAMGOLD a more attractive investment. However, with large-scale assets come significant capital and operational expenditures, which investors should consider when evaluating the company's financial health and future cash flow potential. Environmental Analyst The development of a new mining district, as mentioned by Mr. Adams, signals potential long-term economic benefits for the region and stakeholders. However, it also brings environmental responsibilities. The creation of a new mining hub can have significant environmental impacts and the company's approach to managing these will be closely scrutinized by both regulators and the public. The focus on innovation and automation may also extend to environmental management practices, which could mitigate some of the environmental footprint associated with traditional mining operations.As the Côté Gold Mine progresses, IAMGOLD's environmental strategies will likely become a point of interest for investors who are increasingly valuing sustainability and corporate responsibility. The company's ability to balance economic growth with environmental stewardship could influence investor sentiment and, by extension, stock performance. It is essential for investors to monitor IAMGOLD's environmental reporting and commitments as these factors can have long-term implications for the company's license to operate and its reputation in the market. 03/31/2024 - 05:00 PM All monetary amounts are expressed in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise indicated.Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 31, 2024) - IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG) (TSX: IMG) (""IAMGOLD"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has completed its first gold pour at the Côté Gold Mine (""Côté Gold"" or ""Côté""), located in Ontario, Canada. Côté Gold is operated as a joint venture between IAMGOLD, as the operator, and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd. (""Sumitomo"").""I am delighted to announce that Côté Gold achieved the milestone of first gold pour, less than 90 days since the start of the pre-commissioning activities,"" said Renaud Adams, President and Chief Executive Officer of IAMGOLD. ""With Côté Gold online, IAMGOLD now has three operating mines, joining Essakane in Burkina Faso and Westwood in Quebec, Canada. This achievement represents the culmination of over 15 million hours of work over four years of construction - an incredible effort for the team on the ground as the project cost to first gold remains in line with the updated budget estimate while maintaining a near impeccable safety record. Further, I want to thank our partner Sumitomo for their continued support and dedication. This achievement is monumental for the Côté team, IAMGOLD, Sumitomo and for the gold mining industry itself.""Commissioning activities at Côté have been progressing well, with performance achieved in the crushing, HPGR and processing circuits within expectations, including power consumption. With first gold now achieved, the next step and focus for IAMGOLD is on the ramp up of the operation to commercial production in the third quarter towards the goal of exiting the year at a 90% throughput rate. Production guidance from Côté this year, on a 100% basis, is unchanged at 220,000 to 290,000 ounces of gold, assuming the remaining milestones are achieved. At steady run-rate, Côté Gold is expected to be within the largest operating gold mines in Canada with an expected mine life exceeding 18 years and significant opportunities for growth. On a project level, combining the Côté and Gosselin deposits, Côté has a total estimated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource1 of 16.5 million ounces with an additional 4.2 million ounces of Inferred1, putting the project in exclusive company of large-scale Canadian assets. Mr. Adams continued, ""Côté is positioned as an innovation leader in our industry as the first gold mining project in North America designed and built for a fully automated haulage fleet. Automation not only brings significant benefits in health and safety and operating efficiencies but is a considerable step forward in the evolution of modern mining and the skilled workforce of tomorrow. Further, this is just the beginning for Côté, as we believe the project is the start of what will ultimately turn into a new mining district that will be a mining hub for decades to come."" About IAMGOLDIAMGOLD is an intermediate gold producer and developer based in Canada with operating mines in North America and West Africa. The Company has commenced production at the large-scale, long life Côté Gold Mine in partnership with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. Ltd., which is expected to be among the largest gold mines in Canada.
