Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 04:00 AM Companies aim to fundamentally change the role legacy systems play in the future, ISG Provider Lens™ report says LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Europe’s mainframes are undergoing a significant transformation as enterprises pursue ways to more effectively integrate their legacy systems with emerging technologies, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Mainframes – Services and Solutions report for Europe finds European enterprises are moving toward hybrid modernization strategies that strike a balance between maintaining mainframe robustness and leveraging cloud agility. Companies across the continent demand solutions that combine managed modernization, cloud migration and cost-effective optimization, the ISG report says. “Some providers are taking an AI-first approach to mainframe modernization,” said Matthias Paletta, director, Technology Modernization, for ISG. “They are using the capabilities of GenAI to foster maintainable, object-oriented designs and boost developer productivity.” This growing emphasis on automation, including leveraging AI and ML, signals a pivotal shift toward enhancing efficiency and precision in migration and testing processes, the ISG report says. The aim among providers is to go beyond employing GenAI for isolated innovations and to use it as a springboard for executing a transformative leap in mainframe modernization, the report says. The strategic embrace of AI and automation technologies by providers and the pursuit of more intelligent, efficient modernization processes are indications of a deepening integration of cutting-edge technologies, the ISG report says. According to the report, there is a shared goal among providers to revolutionize efficiency and innovation in legacy systems transformation by strategically integrating GenAI in all aspects of the transition, from automated code conversion and enhanced testing protocols to data cleansing and post-migration optimization. High on the aspirational list for many providers is achieving near-perfect accuracy in language conversion efforts, ISG says. Ultimately, the goal is to fundamentally change how legacy systems are perceived, managed and evolved, the report says. “Enterprises must invest in mainframe modernization efforts to reduce technical debt, enable AI technologies, allow data access for better business analytics and enhance compliance,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “In short, they are seeking to enhance their overall business agility.” The report also examines how mainframe outsourcing and mainframe-as-a-service (MFaaS) can offer short-term cost savings and help clients integrate with cloud infrastructures.

Downstream results are expected to reflect increased refining margins, with oil and LNG trading results in line with historical averages. Sensitivities for 2024 include impacts on adjusted net operating income and cash flow from operations based on changes in dollar value, average liquids price, European gas price, and European Refining Margin Marker. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst In examining TotalEnergies SE's reported indicators for the first quarter of 2024, it's clear that developments in the energy market are playing a pivotal role. Notably, the Brent crude benchmarks—a proxy for international oil prices—have shown a slight decrease compared to previous quarters. This trend can often signal shifts in global supply-demand dynamics, potentially impacting energy companies. The reported stability in hydrocarbon production despite asset disposals indicates operational efficiency and strategic asset management. The growth in integrated power and LNG production could suggest a diversification strategy that is increasingly important as the energy transition accelerates. Financial Analyst The financial implications of TotalEnergies' performance are multifaceted. The reported quarter-on-quarter stability in hydrocarbon production above 2.45 Mboe/d, combined with the increase in refining margins, suggests a potential strengthening in downstream profitability. This could lead to favorable outcomes for adjusted net operating income, which is pivotal for investors' confidence. Moreover, the estimated sensitivities to fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate, average liquids price and European gas price highlight the company's exposure to market volatility. Investors should be mindful of the risk management strategies employed by TotalEnergies to mitigate such volatility. Commodity Trading Analyst TotalEnergies’ anticipated trading results, in line with historical averages due to low volatility, may not excite traders looking for large swings to capitalize on. However, the stability can be appreciated by investors seeking consistent performance. It’s also important to note the influence of the European Refining Margin Marker, as it reflects the profitability of European refining operations. The substantial increase in this metric indicates a beneficial environment for TotalEnergies' refining segment, which is significant given the capital-intensive nature of refining and its impact on cash flow. 04/16/2024 - 02:32 AM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies SE (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE): The main indicators, estimated financial information and key elements impacting TotalEnergies’ first quarter 2024 aggregates are shown below: Main indicators 1Q24 4Q23 3Q23 2Q23 1Q23 €/$ 1.09 1.08 1.09 1.09 1.07 Brent ($/b) 83.2 84.3 86.7 78.1 81.2 Average liquids price * (1) ($/b) 78.9 80.2 78.9 72.0 73.4 Average gas price * (1) ($/Mbtu) 5.11 6.17 5.47 5.98 8.89 Average LNG price ** (1) ($/Mbtu) 9.58 10.28 9.56 9.84 13.27 European Refining Margin Marker (ERM) *** ($/t) 71.7 52.6 100.6 40.1 90.7 * Sales in $ / Sales in volume for consolidated affiliates. ** Sales in $ / Sales in volume for consolidated and equity affiliates. *** This market indicator for European refining, calculated based on public market prices ($/t), uses a basket of crudes, petroleum product yields and variable costs representative of the European refining system of TotalEnergies. (1) Does not include oil, gas and LNG trading activities, respectively. Main elements impacting the quarter aggregates Hydrocarbon production is expected to be stable quarter-on-quarter, above 2.45 Mboe/d, despite the Canadian oil sands assets disposals effective during the fourth quarter 2023, thanks to the growth in LNG production and the startups of Mero 2 in Brazil and Akpo West in Nigeria. Integrated Power results are expected to be up quarter-on-quarter, thanks to growth in the business. Downstream results will reflect the increase in refining margins, as the utilization rate of refineries during the first quarter 2024 was relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter 2023. Due to the low volatility during the first quarter 2024, oil and LNG trading results are expected to be in line with their historical averages. 2024 Sensitivities* Change Estimated impact on adjusted net operating income Estimated impact on cash flow from operations Dollar +/- 0.1 $ per € -/+ 0.1 B$ ~0 B$ Average liquids price ** +/- 10 $/b +/- 2.3 B$ +/- 2.8 B$ European gas price – NBP / TTF +/- 2 $/Mbtu +/- 0.4 B$ +/- 0.4 B$ European Refining Margin Marker (ERM) +/- 10 $/t +/- 0.4 B$ +/- 0.5 B$ * Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year’s fourth quarter results.

The new International Paper shares to be issued pursuant to the Combination have not been registered under the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act. The New International Paper shares to be issued pursuant to the Combination will be issued pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) under the US Securities Act. If, in the future, International Paper exercises its right to implement the Combination by way of an Offer or otherwise in a manner that is not exempt from the registration requirements of the US Securities Act, it will file a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") that will contain a prospectus with respect to the issuance of the new International Paper shares to be issued in connection with the Combination. In this event, DS Smith shareholders are urged to read these documents and any other relevant documents filed with the SEC, as well as any amendments or supplements to those documents, because they will contain important information, and such documents will be available free of charge at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to International Paper's contact for enquiries identified above. Neither the SEC nor any US state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the New International Paper shares to be issued in connection with the Combination or determined if this release is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence in the United States. This release contains estimated financial information that is unaudited and not presented in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP). Such information includes financial information presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS); information relating to the combined financial data presented with the side-by-side financials; estimated efficiencies and run-rate savings, estimated synergies and efficiencies. This information has been provided on a forward-looking basis pursuant to an exception for non-GAAP financial measures included in disclosures relating to a proposed business combination transaction, the entity resulting from the business combination transaction or any entity that is a party to the business combination transaction where the communication containing such disclosure is subject to the SEC's rules relating to communications applicable to business combination transactions. Investors should not place undue reliance on these measures and should carefully review the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary statement relating to ""Forward-Looking Statements"" contained herein. It may be difficult for US DS Smith shareholders to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the US federal securities laws, because DS Smith is located in a non-US country, and some or all of its officers and directors are residents of a non-US country. US DS Smith shareholders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment. US DS Smith shareholders also should be aware that the Combination may have tax consequences for US federal income tax purposes and under applicable US state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws, and, that such consequences, if any, are not described herein, US DS Smith shareholders are urged to consult with legal, tax and financial advisers in connection with making a decision regarding the Combination. Forward Looking Statements This release contains certain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 1995 that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact or relating to present facts or current conditions included in this release are forward-looking statements, including any statements regarding guidance and statements of a general economic or industry-specific nature. Forward-looking statements give International Paper's and DS Smith's current expectations and projections with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of International Paper, DS Smith and certain plans and objectives of International Paper, DS Smith and the combined company. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by International Paper and DS Smith in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate, and therefore are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often use forward-looking or conditional words such as ""anticipate"", ""target"", ""expect"", ""forecast"", ""estimate"", ""intend"", ""plan"", ""goal"", ""believe"", ""hope"", ""aim"", ""will"", ""continue"", ""may"", ""can"", ""would"", ""could"" or ""should"" or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. Forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) the ability of International Paper and DS Smith to consummate the Combination in a timely manner or at all; (ii) the satisfaction (or waiver) of conditions to the consummation of the Combination; (iii) adverse effects on the market price of International Paper's or DS Smith's operating results including because of a failure to complete the Combination; (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the Combination on International Paper's or DS Smith's business relationships, operating results and business generally; (v) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, synergies, financial conditions, market growth, dividend policy, losses and future prospects; (vi) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of the International Paper group or the DS Smith group; and (vii) the effects of government regulation on the business of the International Paper group or the DS Smith group. There are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Among such factors are changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or disposals. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this release may cause the actual results, performance, or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. No assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as at the date of this release. All subsequent oral or written forward-looking statements attributable to International Paper or DS Smith or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. Neither International Paper nor DS Smith undertakes any obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required. International Paper's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 contains additional information regarding forward-looking statements and other risk factors with respect to International Paper.

In connection with the foregoing proposed issuance of the new International Paper shares, International Paper expects to file a proxy statement on Schedule 14A with the SEC, together with any amendments and supplements thereto, the ""Proxy Statement"".

This innovative product features a custom-designed glass cartridge containing Rosin Absolute, a cultivar-specific cannabis oil produced using an FDA and EU approved solvent for food additives.Employing perfuming technologies not commonly utilized in the cannabis industry, Frosted Flowers has integrated this solvent into its extraction methods to capture the true aroma and flavor of the source material. The benefits of this extraction method include low-temperature, low-pressure extraction that requires no post-processing, resulting in a pure cannabis extract that closely resembles the experience of consuming cannabis flower without the presence of plant matter.In addition to Rosin Absolute, Frosted Flowers is proud to introduce its infused flower line. This product starts with Frosted Flowers' premium indoor flower which is then coated with cultivar-specific isolate to enhance potency. Utilizing the isolate, a byproduct of Rosin Absolute's extraction process, allows Juva Life to maximize return on investment from all its outputs. Available for orders now, the Infused Flower line will start delivering to the market towards the end of the month.Rosin Absolute and the infused flower line made their debut at Hall of Flowers, an industry tradeshow in Ventura, California on March 13, 2024 and elicited an overwhelmingly positive response from industry professionals and retail buyers alike. The successful unveiling marks a significant milestone for Frosted Flowers and sets the stage for the official launch into the California marketplace later this month.In addition to the development of Rosin Absolute, Juva Life is proud to announce its partnership with Cloudius9 to incorporate their innovative Carti9 vape device into the product catalog.

Negative None. 04/16/2024 - 01:45 AM Amundi US to combine into Victory Capital Amundi to become a strategic shareholder of Victory Capital Reciprocal 15-year exclusive distribution agreements PARIS & SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Amundi and Victory Capital (Nasdaq: VCTR) are announcing today that they have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to combine Amundi US into Victory Capital, for Amundi to become a strategic shareholder of Victory Capital, and to establish long-term global distribution agreements. The proposed transaction would create a broader US investment platform for clients of both firms, provide Amundi with access to a wider set of US-managed capabilities, and expand worldwide distribution for Victory Capital. The proposed transaction would benefit clients of both firms with a broader range of asset classes including actively managed fixed income, equity, and multi-asset investment strategies offered through a variety of investment vehicles including separately managed accounts, ETFs, mutual funds, UCITs, collective investment trusts, and model portfolios. Victory Capital is a fast growing, diversified US-based asset management firm with $175bn of total client assets, and a proven acquisition track record. The company’s differentiated platform preserves the investment autonomy of a variety of independent investment teams, all of whom leverage the benefits of a fully integrated, centralized operating and distribution platform. Amundi US currently manages $104bn of assets across a broad array of asset classes, including US and global equity, fixed income and multi-asset investment capabilities for individuals and institutions worldwide. Amundi US leverages Amundi’s expansive international distribution footprint, managing a significant amount of assets and portfolios on behalf of non-US retail and institutional clients. The addition of Amundi US as Victory Capital’s largest Investment Franchise would meaningfully enhance Victory Capital’s scale, expand its global client base, and further diversify its investment capabilities, given Amundi US's broad investment capabilities and strong long-term investment performance. Under the proposed transaction: Amundi US would be combined into Victory Capital in exchange for a 26.1% economic stake for Amundi in Victory Capital, with no cash payment involved. Amundi would become a strategic shareholder of Victory Capital with two of its representatives joining the Victory Capital Board of Directors when the transaction closes. Both parties would simultaneously enter into 15-year reciprocal distribution agreements. Under these proposed distribution agreements: Amundi would be the distributor of Victory Capital’s investment offering outside of the US. This would allow Victory Capital to further expand its reach beyond the US through Amundi’s global client base, which would benefit from Victory Capital’s deep investment expertise and strong investment performance track record across a wider range of US-manufactured solutions. Victory Capital would become the distributor of Amundi’s non-US manufactured products in the US. As a result, Amundi would gain access to an expanded distribution platform in the US, while providing Victory Capital’s clients with its wide range of high-performing non-US investment capabilities. The proposed transaction would enable both parties to further their respective strategic goals: It would allow Amundi to strengthen its access to the US market via a larger US investment and distribution platform, as well as to provide Amundi’s clients with access to a broader and even more differentiated range of US investment solutions; It would enable Victory Capital to strategically extend its platform with the addition of its largest Investment Franchise, which would meaningfully expand and diversify its client base both in the US and outside the US. It also would present Victory Capital with a unique opportunity to sell the combined Victory Capital and Amundi US strategies to non-US clients through Amundi’s entire global distribution network and joint ventures. Victory Capital’s clients would benefit from expanded US and non-US investment capabilities and products in complementary asset classes. As contemplated, the transaction is expected to be accretive for the shareholders of both Victory Capital and Amundi, increasing adjusted net income and earnings per share for both companies. The parties are working toward definitive agreement, which is expected to be announced by the end of the second quarter. About this opportunity, Valérie Baudson, Chief Executive Officer of Amundi, commented: “The proposed transaction with Victory Capital is a unique opportunity to strengthen our presence in the US, while becoming a strategic shareholder in a reputable US based asset management firm with an excellent track record of growth. It would expand our access to top-performing US investment strategies for the benefit of our clients globally. Additionally, Amundi would greatly benefit from expanded distribution strength in the US market. The combination would provide a significant catalyst for growth for Amundi. Overall, this is a compelling proposition for our clients and our employees; it would also be a value-creating deal for our shareholders with significant prospects for both revenue growth and synergies.” David Brown, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Victory Capital, added: “This transaction would benefit the clients, employees, and shareholders of both organizations. Strategically, bringing the Amundi U.S. business on to our platform increases our size and scale, adds new investment capabilities, and further strengthens our U.S. distribution with the addition of new talent and relationships. At the same time, the distribution agreement would immediately position our products for success through Amundi’s extensive and effective distribution channels throughout the world. Financially, the transaction would create shareholder value, be accretive to earnings, and increase our financial flexibility. Moreover, having Amundi as a strategic shareholder in our firm would strengthen our alignment on the distribution agreement and establish the foundation for an enduring and mutually beneficial long-term relationship.” The Memorandum of Understanding is non-binding on the parties. As with any negotiation, there is no certainty that these negotiations will result in a definitive agreement. The ultimate completion of a transaction would remain subject to conditions, including regulatory approvals. Conference Call, Webcast and Slide Presentation Victory Capital will host a conference call this morning, April 16, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the agreement. Analysts and investors may participate in the question-and-answer session.

Despite the sales decline, the company managed to improve gross margin to 42.7% and increase EBITA to SEK 5.1 billion. The company focused on cost efficiencies and strategic measures to optimize the business for long-term success. Positive Sales declined organically by -14% YoY, with Networks sales decreasing by -19%. Reported gross margin improved to 42.5% supported by a competitive product portfolio and cost actions. EBITA excluding restructuring charges increased to SEK 5.1 billion with a margin of 9.6%. Net income increased to SEK 2.6 billion, with EPS diluted at SEK 0.77. Free cash flow before M&A improved to SEK 3.7 billion reflecting better management of working capital. Net cash on March 31, 2024, was SEK 10.8 billion compared to SEK 7.8 billion on December 31, 2023. Negative Sales declined organically by -14% YoY, with Networks sales decreasing by -19%. Reported gross income and EBITA margin saw a decrease compared to the previous year. Free cash flow before M&A showed a decline compared to the previous year. Net cash at the end of the period decreased by -20% compared to the previous year. Financial Analyst Ericsson's latest financials indicate a significant organic sales decline of -14%, primarily led by a -19% drop in Networks, showcasing the impact of customer investment caution. However, the silver lining lies in their gross margin improvement to 42.7%, attributed to cost-efficiency measures and commercial discipline. This shows the company's ability to navigate a declining sales environment without a commensurate decline in profitability.From an investor's perspective, the improvement in net income and diluted EPS, with net income up 66% and EPS up 71%, is a strong signal of Ericsson's cost management and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the free cash flow turnaround to SEK 3.7 billion, from a negative cash flow in the previous year, suggests robust working capital management and successful culmination of capital-intensive 5G rollouts in specific markets like India.Looking forward, the expectation of a continued RAN market decline could temper optimism, despite the company's guidance for stable sales in the latter half of the year. Strategic cost-saving initiatives and a focus on cash flow generation are critical as Ericsson navigates market headwinds and aims for long-term shareholder value enhancement. Telecom Industry Expert Ericsson's competitive edge in product offerings and cost management has resulted in a strong gross margin of 44.3% within Networks, despite reduced sales volume. This reflects the company's technological leadership and reinforces its standing in a competitive market. The focus on IPR licensing, including a new 5G patent agreement, suggests a strategic leveraging of their innovation for revenue diversification.The company's strategic moves, including partnerships with Verizon, AT&T and Amazon Web Services, indicate a shift towards creating a Global Network Platform for network APIs, which could be pivotal in the next wave of digitalization. Such advanced network functionalities could open up new service creation opportunities and are likely to influence investment patterns in the telecom sector. Market Analyst Ericsson's performance in the face of market headwinds provides insights into the broader telecommunications equipment sector. The decline in sales volume highlights the cautious investment stance of their customers. However, the company's ability to not only maintain but improve margins suggests a strong cost structure and product desirability.Ericsson's emphasis on the enterprise segment growth, despite setbacks in the Global Communications Platform, indicates a long-term strategy to expand beyond traditional telecom services. The collaborations with industry giants like AWS and KDDI to expose network features through APIs is indicative of a push towards enterprise digitalization, potentially sparking new growth avenues for the industry.Investors should be aware of the forecasted RAN market decline through the year's end, which could pose risks to sales volume stabilization. The focus on margin health and a resilient enterprise strategy could, however, act as buffers against these market pressures. 04/16/2024 - 01:41 AM STOCKHOLM, April 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- First quarter highlights – Driving gross margin improvements and cost efficiencies Sales declined organically[1] by -14% YoY, due to a -19% decline in Networks.

Q1 – Market headwinds and execution focus While organic sales[1] declined by -14%, we reached a gross margin[2] of 42.7%, generated EBITA[3] of SEK 5.1 billion and a 9.6% EBITA margin[3]. Networks sales[1] decreased organically by -19% YoY as our customers continued to be cautious with their investments. Despite this, we generated a strong gross margin[2] of 44.3% – a testament to our technology leadership, our competitive product portfolio, and the strategic actions we are taking, including on costs. In Cloud Software and Services, we continued to execute on our strategy to strengthen delivery performance and commercial discipline. We delivered a gross margin[2] of 37.4% and our EBITA margin[2] improved year-on-year for a fifth consecutive quarter. The rolling four quarter EBITA margin[2] was 3.0%. In Enterprise, sales grew organically overall but declined in Global Communications Platform, impacted by a low-margin customer contract loss in Q4 and our decision to reduce our operations in some countries, with the impact expected to continue throughout the year. We continue to focus on leveraging the current business to support the build-out of our Global Network Platform for network APIs. Our IPR revenues continued to grow, with a new 5G patent license agreement with a handset manufacturer. We are confident of delivering further growth in IPR revenues, benefiting from additional 5G agreements and an expansion into additional licensing areas. The timing of contracts will fluctuate, as we seek to optimize the value of new agreements. We delivered SEK 3.7 billion of free cash flow[4] in Q1, benefiting from our operational improvements, and lower working capital as we concluded an intense 5G roll-out phase in India. We announced further measures in the quarter to improve our cost efficiency and streamline operations, including headcount reductions. This is a necessary action to position the Company for longer-term success. In March, our independent Monitor certified our compliance program. This is an important step to conclude our plea agreement. Our focus on culture and integrity will continue. Executing on our strategy Our strategy is aimed at building a stronger and more profitable Ericsson in the long term, with a vision to capture the next major wave of networks innovation with a substantial platform business. At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we showcased industry-leading hardware and software solutions required in order to build the high-performance and programmable networks necessary to digitalize society. Our industry is shifting from a vertically integrated architecture to a horizontal and cloud-based network architecture – and Ericsson is leading this development. We also took critical steps in our strategy to build a Global Network Platform for network APIs, and announced three key partnerships with Verizon, AT&T and Amazon Web Services, as well as a communications API agreement with KDDI. Exposing network features through APIs will support the creation of new differentiated services and will be crucial in the next step of digitalization of enterprise and society. Looking ahead We expect a further decline in the RAN market, at least through the end of this year, as customers remain cautious with their investments and the pace of investment in India continues to normalize. Dell'Oro estimates the global RAN equipment market will decline by -4% in 2024, which may prove optimistic. If current trends persist, we expect our sales to stabilize during the second half of the year, benefiting from recent contract wins and the normalization of customer inventory levels in North America. In Q2, we expect Networks gross margin excluding restructuring charges to be in the range of 42-44%. In the second half, our margins should benefit from improved business mix. We also remain highly focused on delivering stronger cash flow, based on our operating discipline. Our enterprise strategy aims to leverage network capabilities to increase telecoms industry revenue growth above the level that traffic growth alone could deliver. We are creating new, differentiated, products and services, supporting our customers in this transformation. In turn, this will support industry investment levels in the longer term. While near-term dynamics are challenging, we remain fully committed to our long-term targets, and we continue to be focused on increasing shareholder value.

FDA decision on CIDP sBLA for VYVGART Hytrulo expected by June 21, 2024. Real-world data for gMG patients demonstrate a significant reduction in steroid use with VYVGART treatment. VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo show differentiated efficacy and safety profiles, driving rapid, deep, and sustained improvements in gMG patients. New data presented at AAN highlight the ability of VYVGART treatment to reduce concomitant steroid use in gMG patients. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent trial results for VYVGART Hytrulo indicate a significant advancement in treating chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), potentially marking the first notable progress in three decades. Such developments can be pivotal, influencing the trajectory of argenx's stock by instilling investor confidence. The trial's rapid and meaningful clinical improvements are noteworthy, with a 61% reduction in relapse risk, according to the primary endpoint data. This efficacy level could translate into a strong competitive edge in the immunology market, potentially impacting the company's revenue growth positively.The high continuation rate into the ADHERE-Plus study suggests strong patient and clinician acceptance, which bodes well for long-term demand. Moreover, the FDA's priority review with a decision expected by June enhances the immediacy of the potential market impact. Investors should monitor the FDA's decision as a critical inflection point for argenx's valuation. Financial Analyst When evaluating the financial implications of the ADHERE clinical trial data, the significant reduction in concomitant steroid use in gMG patients presents a dual advantage. Firstly, it can reduce long-term healthcare costs associated with steroid side effects, making VYVGART an economically attractive option. Secondly, the drug's ability to demonstrate minimal symptom expression (MSE) could lead to increased market penetration and patient adherence, supporting robust sales figures.Investors should consider the potential market expansion if VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for CIDP treatment and its impact on argenx's revenue. The therapy's novel mechanism, which targets IgG autoantibodies, may present licensing opportunities and strategic partnerships, further bolstering investor sentiment. However, it is important to weigh these prospects against the inherent risks of biotech investing, such as regulatory hurdles and market competition. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the successful trial results and subsequent presentations at the AAN Annual Meeting raise argenx's profile within the neurology and immunology communities. This increased visibility can lead to greater advocacy and usage by healthcare providers. The market size for CIDP treatments, given the current lack of advancements, suggests an untapped opportunity for argenx to capitalize on, assuming VYVGART Hytrulo's approval.Understanding the competitive landscape is key; if approved, VYVGART would disrupt a stable market, challenging existing therapies. It's essential to evaluate payer response and potential barriers to market entry, such as pricing and reimbursement strategies. The long-term potential lies in sustained efficacy and safety, which can drive market share and justify premium pricing models. 04/16/2024 - 01:00 AM ADHERE data show VYVGART® Hytrulo has potential to be first advancement for CIDP patients in 30 years Real-world data demonstrate gMG patients able to significantly reduce steroid use over first six months of initiating VYVGART® treatment April 16, 2024 – 7:00am CET Amsterdam, the Netherlands – argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases, today announced that data from its Phase 3 ADHERE trial evaluating VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) were presented for the first time to the medical community during the Clinical Trials Plenary Session at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting in Denver, CO. argenx also highlighted clinical trial and real-world data across seven posters and presentations that continue to reinforce VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo as a transformative treatment option for gMG patients. “Our innovative approach to autoimmunity research is changing expectations for the global immunology community,” said Luc Truyen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, argenx. “The gMG and CIDP data presented at AAN reinforce that our pioneering approach to transforming autoimmunity is redefining what is possible for patients and their communities.” “Patients with CIDP face a number of diagnostic and treatment challenges” said Jeffrey Allen, M.D., Professor, Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota and Principal Investigator in the ADHERE trial. “The results of the ADHERE trial show that VYVGART Hytrulo reduces the risk of clinical deterioration in patients with CIDP while minimizing side effects and reducing the treatment burden. These findings enhance our understanding of the role that IgG autoantibodies are likely to play in the disease, and open the door to new safe, effective and well-tolerated treatments that eliminate pathogenic IgGs.” ADHERE Plenary Session (PL5) Highlights Rapid, Deep and Clinically Meaningful, and Durable Functional Improvements in CIDP In the ADHERE study, a majority of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo, regardless of prior treatment, demonstrated evidence of rapid clinical improvement, and a reduced risk of relapse compared to those treated with placebo. As previously reported, ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. VYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated, and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials. Evidence of rapid onset and maintenance of clinical response: In the open-label Stage A of the ADHERE study, 67% of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI), including 40% who had achieved ECI by the earliest possible measure at week 4. In Stage B, VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients maintained a clinical response to treatment longer than those on placebo as evidenced by a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in risk of relapse. Results across both Stage A and B indicate IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in mediating the underlying biology of CIDP. Deep and clinically meaningful functional improvements: 81% of VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients demonstrated ≥1 point improvement on the aINCAT as compared to baseline Stage A scores in ADHERE, which includes 42% of patients with ≥2 point improvement, 28% with ≥3 point improvement, and 12% with ≥4 point improvement.Clinical benefit demonstrated regardless of prior CIDP treatment: Clinical benefit was seen across all patient subtypes, including those who had previously received corticosteroids, intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin, or were on no treatment prior to study entry.High rate of treatment continuation: 99% of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study.FDA decision on CIDP sBLA expected by June 21, 2024: Data from the ADHERE trial were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for VYVGART Hytrulo for the treatment of CIDP. The application was accepted for Priority Review in February 2024 and has been granted a PDUFA target action date of June 21, 2024. AAN presentations highlight rapid, deep, and sustained improvements in gMG with ability to reduce steroid burden Clinical trial data and real-world evidence presented during AAN continue to highlight the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo, driving rapid, deep, and sustained improvement across disease scales and with different dosing schedules, including the ability for patients to achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE). MSE results in ADAPT/ADAPT+: Poster Session 10ADAPT-SC+ interim results: Poster Session 10ADAPT-NXT interim results: Poster Session 10Cost-benefit analysis of efgartigimod to IVIG in Canada: Poster Session 4 Side effects from long-term steroid use continue to be a significant burden associated with autoimmune disease, reinforcing the importance of the favorable safety profile of VYVGART. New data presented in an oral presentation (Scientific Platform Session 38) during AAN characterize how VVYGART treatment can significantly reduce concomitant steroid use. A substantial proportion of gMG patients (46%) were able to reduce steroid use over the first six months of initiating VYVGART treatment, including 34% of patients who tapered to <5mg/day and 18% who reduced completely to zero.Overview of efgartigimod safety profile across indications: Poster Session 4 Analysis of serious infections and malignancies in MG: Poster Session 10 About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized, placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial, the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage, where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease, with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool, including INCAT, I-RODS, or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B, patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score, or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B, patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B, all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo. See Important Safety Information below, full United States Prescribing Information for VYVGART and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional information.

About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles, causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months,1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population. About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging, there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue, muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment, one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair. About VYVGART®VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States, EU, China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).

(“LIFT” or the “Company”) (TSXV: LIFT) (OTCQX: LIFFF) (Frankfurt: WS0) is pleased to report assays from 17 drill holes completed at the Echo, Fi Main, & Fi Southwest pegmatites within the Yellowknife Lithium Project (“YLP”) located outside the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Figure 1). Drilling intersected significant intervals of spodumene mineralization, with the following highlights: Highlights: YLP-0259: 43 m at 0.85% Li2O, (Echo) including: 24 m at 1.33% Li2OYLP-0212: 16 m at 1.29% Li2O, (Echo) and: 5 m at 1.36% Li2O and: 5 m at 1.19% Li2O and: 1 m at 0.68% Li2O YLP-0237: 16 m at 1.31% Li2O, (Fi Main)YLP-0234: 13 m at 1.32% Li2O, (Echo)YLP-0228: 10 m at 1.36% Li2O, (Echo)YLP-0235: 10 m at 1.25% Li2O, (Echo)YLP-0229: 9 m at 1.28% Li2O, (Fi Main) and: 12 m at 0.54% Li2O Discussion of Results This news release provides results for 17 drill holes (3,729 m) from LIFT’s ongoing 2024 winter drilling program. Seven holes are reported from the Echo pegmatite complex, eight holes from Fi Main, and two from Fi Southwest (Fi-SW). A table of composite calculations, general comments related to this discussion, and a table of collar headers are provided towards the end of this section. Dave Smithson, SVP, Geology of LIFT comments, “The Echo Pegmatite System continues to deliver impressive grades and widths close to surface this week. Hole 259 is particularly significant as it extends spodumene mineralization another 100 m down-dip from 10 m of 1.29% Li2O and 16 m of 1.26% Li2O drilled in hole 216, last summer. Here, the dykes merge into a single 43 m-wide dyke averaging 0.85% Li2O (Inc. 24 m of 1.33% Li2O), only 75 m from the surface. This new information confirms for the first time the low-angle nature of mineralization, emphasising the potential for Echo to deliver accessible tonnes and grades close to surface. We are very excited to see what happens next as we mobilise our drill rigs to test outward and downward from these first outstanding results.” Figure 1 – Location of LIFT’s Yellowknife Lithium Project. Drilling has been thus far mainly focused on the Near Field Group of pegmatites which are located to the east of the city of Yellowknife along a government-maintained paved highway, and advancing to the Echo target, the first drilling in the Further Afield Group. Echo Pegmatite System The Echo pegmatite complex comprises a fanning splay of moderate to gently dipping dykes for 0.5 km to the northwest (“Echo splay”). In addition, the Echo Splay is connected to a steeply dipping, northwest-trending, feeder dyke (“Echo feeder”). The dyke complex has a total strike length of over 1.0 km. The feeder dyke is 10-15 m wide whereas the gently dipping dykes in the splay are thicker, ranging from 10-25 m. Three (YLP-0259, 0212, 0220) holes were drilled on the Echo splay. YLP-0259 tested between the northeastern part of the splay approximately 150-200 m from where it merges, between 35-75 m below the surface, and stepped back 100 m and 150 m, respectively, from previously released drill holes YLP-0216 (1.35% Li2O over 36 m from 3 intervals in 78 m) and YLP-0128 (0.94% Li2O over 22 m from 2 intervals in 51 m). New drilling intersected a 43 m wide pegmatite that returned a wall-to-wall grade of 0.85% Li2O that includes 24 m of 1.33% Li2O. There is no drilling along strike to the northwest of this intersection (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 3). Figure 2 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Echo pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 3 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0259 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 24 m interval of 1.33% Li2O. YLP-0212 was drilled to test the Echo splay approximately 250-300 m from its merge zone with the feeder, <25 m to 100 m below the surface, and stepped back of 50 m from previously released YLP-0205 (1.03% Li2O over 23 m from 3 intervals in 56 m). Drilling cut a 141 m interval with 45 m of pegmatite spread over seven dykes ranging between 1-21 m in width. Four of the thicker (6-21 m) dykes returned spodumene-bearing intercepts that form a combined composite of 1.26% Li2O over 27 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 4). Figure 4 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0212 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 16 m interval of 1.29% Li2O. Four of the seven holes reported here were drilled on the Echo feeder, with YLP-0228 designed to test the Echo feeder dyke approximately 50 m southeast of where it merges with the splay, 25-50 m below the surface, as well as along strike and 50 m southeast of previously released YLP-0226 (1.45% Li2O over 13 m). New drilling intersected a 14 m wide feeder dyke that returned a composite of 1.36% Li2O over 10 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 5). Figure 5 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0228 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 10 m interval of 1.36% Li2O. YLP-0234 was drilled along strike and 50 m southeast of holes YLP-0228/0230 to test the feeder at 25-50 m below the surface. New drilling intersected a 14 m wide pegmatite that returned a composite of 1.32% Li2O over 13 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 6). Figure 6 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0234 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 13 m interval of 1.32% Li2O. YLP-0235 tested the Echo feeder dyke another 50 m along strike and southeast of YLP-0234 with new drilling intersecting a 10 m wide pegmatite dyke that returned a wall-to-wall composite of 1.25% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 7). Figure 7 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0235 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 10 m interval of 1.25% Li2O. YLP-0220 was collared in the area where the splay merges with the feeder dyke and stepped forward 100 m from previous released YLP-0099 (0.62% Li2O over 11 m). New drilling intersected a 124 m interval with 20 m of pegmatite spread over eight dykes between 1-9 m in depth. The thickest dyke (9 m) occurs just below overburden and returned a wall-to-wall composite of 0.96% Li2O with 5 m of 1.52% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 2). YLP-0230 was drilled on the same section as YLP-0228 to test the Echo feeder at 75-100 m below the surface and 50 m downdip of YLP-0228 (see above). Drilling intersected mostly mafic dyke where the feeder dyke was expected in addition to a new pegmatite further down the hole, for 17 m of pegmatite within a 35 m interval. Assays returned no significant grades (Table 1 & 2, Figure 2). Fi Main Pegmatite The Fi Main pegmatite complex crops out over at least 1.5 km of strike length within a north-south striking corridor that dips between 70°-85° to the west. The central 800-900 m of the complex can be split into a northern part where most pegmatite occurs in a single 25-30 m thick dyke and a southern part where this dyke splits into upper and lower pegmatites that then remerge 450 m further south. The width of the Fi Main corridor ranges from 25-75 m where it is dominated by a single dyke and between 75-150 m where it is split into two. Two (YLP-0237, 0214) holes were drilled where the Fi Main dyke is split into an upper and lower zone, with YLP-0237 drilled to test the upper and lower pegmatites at 25 m and 100 m below the surface, respectively. This hole was collared along strike and 50 m south of previously released YLP-0013 (0.65% Li2O over 14 m) and 50 m north of YLP-0018 (0.81% Li2O over 19 m from two intervals, 59 m apart). New drilling intersected 13 pegmatite dykes over 199 m of drill core, with dykes ranging from 1-17 m in width and spaced between 5-20 m apart. The thickest of these correlates with the upper zone and returned a composite of 1.31% Li2O over 16 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 8 & 9). Figure 8 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Main pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 9 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0237 with results as shown in the Fi Main pegmatite dyke with a 16 m interval of 1.31% Li2O. YLP-0229 was drilled on a section located 50 m south of the section with YLP-0224. Drilling intersected a 109 m wide corridor with 46 m of pegmatite spread over seven dykes between 2-17 m in width. The two thickest dykes (9 m and 17 m) likely represent the remerging upper and lower pegmatites and returned a combined composite of 0.86% Li2O over 21 m. Mineralization in this area is open at depth and to the south (Table 1 & 2, Figures 8 & 10). Figure 10 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0229 with results as shown in the Fi Main pegmatite dyke with a 9 m interval of 1.28% Li2O. YLP-0214 was collared on a section 50 m north of YLP-0237 to test the upper and lower pegmatites at approximately 100-200 m beneath the surface. Previously released drilling on the same section returned 0.65% Li2O over 14 m (YLP-0013) from 50 m below the surface but negligible results at 250 m depth (YLP-0022). New drilling aimed for an intermediate depth between these two holes, intersecting three swarms of pegmatite dykes each about 50-100 m apart and including an 83 m corridor with 31 m of pegmatite and a 29 m corridor with 25 m of pegmatite. All assays, however, returned negligible Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). YLP-0218 was collared near where the single thick Fi Main dyke splits into the upper and lower pegmatites and on a section 100 m north of YLP-0214. Drilling was designed to test the Fi Main dyke at 150 m beneath the surface as well as 75 m downdip of previously released YLP-0015 (1.00% Li2O over 27 m) and 125 m downdip of YLP-0009 (0.49% Li2O over 12 m). New drilling intersected a 23 m wide pegmatite at 150 m vertically beneath the surface but failed to return significant Li2O assays. A 3 m wide dyke intersected 125 m outboard of the main dyke returned 0.81% Li2O over 1 m (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). Two (YLP-0224, 0229) of eight holes on the southern part of the split and upper and lower pegmatites, near where they merge back into a single narrower corridor. YLP-0224 was designed to test this corridor at 125-250 m below the surface and 75-100 m downdip of previously released YLP-0010 (0.72% Li2O over 32 m from two intervals, 48 m apart). New drilling intersected three corridors of pegmatite dykes separated by 30-75 m of country rock, with the uppermost of these corridors comprising 16 m of pegmatite within a 23 m interval that returned a composite of 0.89% Li2O over 10 m including 1.48% Li2O over 4 m. The two lower corridors, which include the lower zone, include 9 m and 17 m of pegmatite that both average <0.1% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). Drill holes YLP-0225, 0227, and 0231 were all drilled at the north end of the Fi Main pegmatite complex where a single thick dyke splits into several thinner dykes spread over a broader corridor (“north splay”). YLP-0225 was drilled on a section located 50 m north of previously released YLP-0024 (1.12% Li2O over 24 m) to test the north splay at 25-75 m beneath the surface. Drilling intersected a 62 m corridor with 46 m of pegmatite spread over eight dykes that are each between 1-15 m in width. Six of these dykes returned wall-to-wall average grades between 0.1-0.3% Li2O that, in the two thickest dykes, include one metre intervals of 0.5-0.6% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). YLP-0227 and 0231 were drilled on a section 50 m north of YLP-0225 to test the north splay at 75 m and 150 m beneath the surface, respectively. YLP-0227 intersected a 112 m wide corridor with 48 m of pegmatite spread over seven dykes between 1-23 m in width. Six of these dykes returned average grades of ≤0.1% Li2O whereas the thickest dyke returned an average wall-to-wall grade of 0.2% Li2O that includes 1 m of 0.51% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). YLP-0231 was drilled 50 m downdip of YLP-0227 and intersected a 69 m wide corridor with 56 m of pegmatite, most of which occurs in two pegmatite dykes that are 22 m and 32 m wide. The 22 m wide dyke has an average wall-to-wall grade of 0.34% Li2O that includes 10 m of 0.57% Li2O. These results indicate that mineralization in the Fi Main pegmatite remains open towards the north and at depth (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8). Fi Southwest Pegmatite The Fi Southwest (Fi-SW) pegmatite complex is exposed over at least 1.1 km on surface and occurs within a broader corridor that is 50-100 m wide and dips between 60°-80° to the east. The complex is cored by a 20-40 m wide main dyke that is continuous for at least 800 m along strike, with numerous sub-parallel subsidiary dykes between 1-5 m in width. At its northern and southern ends, the main dyke splays out into a broader corridor with more dykes that have narrower widths. Holes YLP-0210 and YLP-0215 were both drilled as part of a 400 m long drill fence that tests the broad corridor stretching from the north tip of the Fi-SW dyke to the Fi Main corridor located 350-400 m to the east. Previously released drilling on this fence returned 1.05% Li2O over 11 m (YLP-0057) and barren pegmatite (YLP-0201). New drilling intersected four pegmatite corridors in YLP-0210 and five corridors in YLP-0215, each ranging from 1-50 m in width and containing between 1-20 m of pegmatite. All assays returned negligible Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figure 11).

Drill core was transported from the drill platform to the core processing facility where it was logged, photographed, and split by diamond saw prior to being sampled. Samples were then bagged, and blanks and certified reference materials were inserted at regular intervals. Field duplicates consisting of quarter-cut core samples were also included in the sample runs. Groups of samples were placed in large bags, sealed with numbered tags in order to maintain a chain-of-custody, and transported from LIFT’s core logging facility to ALS Labs (“ALS”) laboratory in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Sample preparation and analytical work for this drill program were carried out by ALS. Samples were prepared for analysis according to ALS method CRU31: individual samples were crushed to 70% passing through 2 mm (10 mesh) screen; a 1,000-gram sub-sample was riffle split (SPL-21) and then pulverized (PUL-32) such that 85% passed through 75 micron (200 mesh) screen. A 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was then dissolved in a sodium peroxide solution and analysed for lithium according to ALS method ME-ICP82b. Another 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was analysed for 53 elements according to ALS method ME-MS89L. All results passed the QA/QC screening at the lab, all inserted standards and blanks returned results that were within acceptable limits.

Gold Resource Corporation Announces Preliminary First Quarter Production Results,2024-04-16T01:02:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Gold Resource  (GORO) announces preliminary first quarter production results, including the sale of 3,557 ounces of gold and 216,535 ounces of silver.

The company also sold 1,682 tonnes of zinc, 264 tonnes of copper, and 667 tonnes of lead. The average metal prices realized have increased compared to the previous year. The company is focusing on cost reductions and operational efficiencies to improve profitability and is moving forward with a drill program to increase resources and reserves. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Gold Resource Corporation's preliminary first quarter production results demonstrate a mixed performance. Gold sales have decreased significantly from 6,508 ounces to 3,557 ounces year-over-year. This substantial decrease in gold production could signal operational challenges or vein depletion concerns. However, the average realized price of gold per ounce has increased from $1,915 to $2,094, offsetting some revenue loss from lower volumes. Notably, the company mentions cost reductions and operational efficiencies, which are important for improving the bottom line in a commodity-based industry. Investors should monitor how these cost-saving measures translate into improved profitability in subsequent quarters. On the downside, lower production volumes in gold, silver and base metals like zinc, copper and lead could be a red flag for resource depletion or operational inefficiencies. These preliminary results might concern investors about the company's long-term growth prospects and sustainability of mining operations. Mining Industry Analyst The company's strategic focus on their 2024 drill program aimed at increasing resources and reserves is a forward-thinking move. This indicates a proactive approach to replenish and expand their mineral base, which is important for long-term sustainability. The mention of a strong Mexican peso against the US dollar presents a forex challenge, but the report indicates that rising metal prices are compensating for these effects. For investors, this highlights an important aspect of the mining industry—geopolitical and forex risks are pivotal factors in mining companies' profitability. The production statistics shed light on the grade of the metals being mined, showing a noticeable fluctuation in the yield per tonne. This variability is typical in mining operations, but it underscores the importance of efficient resource management and the potential variability in profit margins. The impact of metal grade variability on production volumes and cost efficiency should be an area of focus for investors looking to understand operational performance. 04/15/2024 - 09:02 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gold Resource Corporation (NYSE American: GORO) (the “Company”) announces its preliminary first quarter results that includes the sale of 3,557 ounces of gold and 216,535 ounces of silver resulting in total gold equivalent (“AuEq”) ounces of 5,965. Additionally, the company sold 1,682 tonnes of zinc, 264 tonnes of copper, and 667 tonnes of lead. “During the first quarter we continued our process to identify and implement opportunities for cost reductions and operational efficiencies in order to improve profitability. We are also moving forward with our 2024 drill program with the purpose of increasing our resources and reserves that could lead to future production improvements.” stated Allen Palmiere, President and CEO. “The Mexican peso has continued to remain strong against the US dollar, but we have seen substantial increases in the metals prices that are more than offsetting the impact of the exchange rate. With the enhancements we are making with our operations and the improvements we are seeing in the metal prices, we are moving in the right direction.” Sales Statistics Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 Metal sold Gold (ozs.) 3,557 6,508 Silver (ozs.) 216,535 294,815 Copper (tonnes) 264 332 Lead (tonnes) 667 1,417 Zinc (tonnes) 1,682 3,060 Average metal prices realized(1) Gold ($ per oz.) 2,094 1,915 Silver ($ per oz.) 23 23 Copper ($ per tonne) 8,546 9,172 Lead ($ per tonne) 1,977 2,158 Zinc ($ per tonne) 2,483 3,195 Precious metal gold equivalent ounces sold Gold Ounces 3,557 6,508 Gold Equivalent Ounces from Silver 2,408 3,547 Total AuEq Ounces 5,965 10,055 (1) Average metal prices realized vary from the market metal prices due to final settlement adjustments from our provisional invoices.

(NYSE: FSM) (TSX: FVI) is pleased to provide an update on its Yessi vein exploration program at the San Jose Mine in Mexico. Paul Weedon, Senior Vice President of Exploration, commented, “Drilling on the Yessi vein, since the initial discovery hole in August 2023, has continued to establish a well-defined system, with recent results such as 1,327 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 3.0 meters from 604.85 meters in SJO-1444 and 1,036 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 8.1 meters including 2,910 g/t Ag Eq in SJO-1460 highlighting the potential for high-grade shoots. In addition, wide intervals such as the 179 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 17.5 meters in SJO-1455A highlight the potential for broad zones of mineralization”. Yessi vein drilling highlights include: SJO-1444: 1,327 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 3.0 meters from 604.85 meters, including 5,135 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 0.3 meters from 605.90 meters SJO-1447: 295 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 4.8 meters from 649.50 meters SJO-1455A: 179 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 17.5 meters from 460.10 meters, including 236 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 7.7 meters from 475.05 meters SJO-1458: 453 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 4.8 meters from 446.30 meters SJO-1460 1,036 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 8.1 meters from 463.30 meters, including2,910 g/t Ag Eq over an estimated true width of 2.4 meters from 472.15 metersAg Eq is calculated using a factor of 80:1. Please see Appendix 1 for further details. Drilling on the Yessi vein has continued with the dual objectives of firstly testing for the limits of the Yessi vein and secondly infilling the drill spacing to support initial resource estimations and mining studies. The Yessi vein has now been successfully drill tested over a 350-meter strike and a 450-meter vertical profile where it remains open up- and down-dip, as well as along strike to the southeast. The current phase of the program consisted of 10 additional holes for a total of 6,622 meters. Geological and structural logging of the drill core has confirmed the vein geometry as trending north-northwest, intersecting and merging with the north-south orientated Victoria Mineralized Zone (“VMZ”) towards the west. Evidence is also emerging of higher-grade shoots within the structure demonstrating a moderate south-easterly plunge and often associated with high gold grades. Vein development is consistently associated with extensive alteration and brecciation with veining characterised by fine veinlets and fragments suggesting several phases of emplacement. Additional drilling with three drill rigs will continue to test the depth, strike and infill of the current Yessi vein extent.

One-time events contributing to the net loss, including divestment costs. Debt reduction by $77 million may impact future financial flexibility. Revenue increase may not fully offset the net loss incurred in FY 2023. Financial Analyst Alternus Clean Energy, Inc.'s announcement of a 17.5% increase in revenue and a 25% increase in gross profit year-over-year, against a backdrop of a net loss of $69.5 million, provides a complex financial landscape. The simultaneous news of debt reduction and a Nasdaq listing presents a duality of financial restructuring and market confidence. From an investor's standpoint, such growth in revenue is encouraging, particularly in the clean energy sector, indicating potential for scalability and stability in a burgeoning market. However, the reported net loss requires scrutiny; attributed largely to one-time events and divestments, it suggests a strategic, albeit costly, repositioning. This, coupled with the debt reduction post-balance sheet, may depict an attempt to fortify the company's financial health. Looking ahead, the company's strategy to refinance assets over a longer term could potentially align future debt obligations with the projected income from operational assets, a prudent move in principle. Energy Market Analyst The strategy of divestment in non-core markets like Poland and the Netherlands can be seen as a move to concentrate resources and efforts on markets with higher growth potential, such as the United States and select European countries. The pursuit of 'equity light' projects in the US is indicative of a trend in the renewable energy sector where companies are seeking to maximize returns while minimizing equity costs, which can be capital intensive. The secured pipeline in Italy and Spain, alongside acquisitions such as the 'Dancing Horse' project in Tennessee, reflect a focused geographical and sectoral expansion. The expected operational start dates and revenue from these projects reveal a clear timeline for growth and investment returns, which should be closely monitored for execution risks and potential deviations from projected financial outcomes. M&A Expert Mergers and acquisitions are pivotal events for companies and their stakeholders. Alternus's successful merger with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp and the subsequent Nasdaq listing not only signal a boost in credibility and potential liquidity for investors but also represent a strategic consolidation within the industry. This maneuver allows Alternus to leverage Clean Earth's assets while providing a platform for elevated market presence and increased access to capital. The merger's significance is amplified by the concurrent issuance of common stock, making AEG the largest shareholder, thereby intertwining the fortunes of both entities. It is imperative for investors to track how this expanded shareholder base influences corporate governance and strategy going forward. Additionally, the continuation of AEG as a separate legal entity and its listing on the Euronext Growth market in Oslo could provide insights into investor sentiment across different market regions. 04/15/2024 - 07:56 PM • Revenue up by 17.5% YoY• Gross profit up by 25% YoY FORT MILL, S.C., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Utility-scale transatlantic clean energy independent power producer Alternus Clean Energy, Inc.

Company Highlights: Increase in revenue from by 17.5% YoY;Increase in revenue offtake by 3.8% YoY;Debt reduced by $77 million subsequent to balance sheet;Total of 165 GWH of clean energy produced in 2023, further offsetting global CO2 emissions;Completed business combination agreement with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp., (“Clean Earth”) priorly listed as “CLIN”, “CLINW”, and “CLINU” over NASDAQ;Listed on NASDAQ in December 2023 under the ticker symbol “ALCE”;Divestment of non-strategic operating assets in Poland and the Netherlands, reducing debt by over $75M;Net loss of $69.5M, due primarily to one-time events including, $15.8M related to divestment of projects in non-core countries, $16.6M for fair value movement related to the forward purchase agreement, $11.2M related to the Solis bond waiver fees, and $5.5M related to loss on disposal of assets. Commenting on the results, Vincent Browne, Chairman and Group CEO said: “In 2023, we focused on a strategic business realignment and consolidation, refining our core operations to pave the way for further growth in key high-potential markets across the US and Europe. One standout moment was our successful merger with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp (CLIN), culminating in our Nasdaq listing (NASDAQ: “ALCE”)—a significant achievement that fills us with pride. Now, equipped with renewed energy and resolve, we're poised to increase our impact, broaden our scope, and ignite further growth in our business. We remain focused on our goal of reaching 3GW of operational assets within five years.” Alternus Chief Financial Officer Joseph E. Duey added: “2023 represented a year of strategic development for Alternus. We announced our listing on Nasdaq in December 2023 and are now well positioned organisationally to deliver on our goals. Our 2023 balance sheet is reflective of a conservative position. Subsequent to this balance sheet we have reduced debt by $77 million. We are now in a process of refinancing assets over a longer-term period, to align our debt with the longevity of our continuing asset portfolio. Once restructured the debt will be spread out of our balance sheet. We also have a secure pipeline of potential acquisition projects to execute on within the coming 12-18 months and are confident that we have the ability to access equity capital as needed and fund the growth plan we have in place.” Results Underpinned by a Diversified Portfolio of Assets The table below summarises the Company’s portfolio of assets as of December 31, 2023. COUNTRY MEGAWATTSINSTALLED Percentage Romania 40.1 91.3%United States 3.8 8.7%Total 43.9 100% The Company announced the divestment of non-core assets in late 2023, in line with our renewed strategy to focus on strategic markets across Europe and the US. A focus will be on delivering on the advanced stage development pipeline portfolio of over 300MW in Italy and Spain and on executing on near-term acquisitions of both operating and ready-to-build projects from a growing pipeline of ‘equity light’ projects in the US. It was announced in 2023 that Alternus acquired 32MWp solar PV project in Tennessee, USA, known as ‘Dancing Horse.’ Dancing Horse is expected to start operating in Q1 2025 and should produce annual revenue of approximately $2.3 million when fully operational. 100% of the offtake from this facility is secured by 30-year power purchase agreements with two regional utilities. The Company also announced a planned expansion in Spain with the acquisition of Solar PV projects totalling 32 MWp of Solar PV projects in Valencia, Spain, known as the NF Projects. The portfolio consists of six projects in total: five of which, totalling 24.4 MWp, are expected to reach operation in Q2 2024, with the remaining project expected to achieve operation in Q1 2025. Once operating, 10-year average annual revenues from the initial portfolio of five will be approximately $2.3 million, going to $2.8 million once all are connected. Business Combination and Nasdaq Listing The Company successfully started trading over Nasdaq on the 26th of December 2023 under the ticker (NASDAQ: ALCE) following a successful business combination with its predecessor, Clean Earth. Under the terms of the business combination agreement, the Company acquired the majority of Alternus Energy Group PLC, a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland (“AEG”)’s assets, with simultaneously issuing it common stock, in turn making it the largest shareholder in the Company. AEG continues to exist as a separate legal entity and continues to trade on the Euronext Growth stock market in Oslo under the ticker (OSE: ALT). The completion of the business combination with Clean Earth and resultant listing on Nasdaq, is a key strategic pillar in our commitment towards a sustainable future.

(TSXV: CTEK) (""Cleantek"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce its fourth quarter and annual 2023 financial and operational results. Cleantek is an innovative provider of patented, clean technology solutions focused on reducing both cost and carbon intensity in the wastewater management and industrial lighting sectors across North America. Cleantek Chief Executive Officer and President Matt Gowanlock commented, ""The completion of the long-term financing in December, with significantly reduced monthly principal and interest payments, provides the Company with improved financial flexibility and ability to fund future growth. This, combined with the settlement of longstanding legal disputes, allows the Company to fully focus on its core business objectives and near-term strategy, positioning the Company well for 2024."" Highlights for the Fourth Quarter 2023 (All amounts are in thousands of Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated)Cleantek generated revenue of $3,188 for Q4 2023, a decrease of $279 or 8%, from Q4 2022. On an annual basis, Cleantek generated revenues of $13,989, an increase of $873 or 7%, from 2022. The decrease in revenue for Q4 compared to same period last year is largely due to decreased utilization whilst the increased revenue on a year to date basis compared to the prior year is due to increased fleet size and higher rental rates combined with a sale of a HALOTM lighting system;Cleantek's gross profit of $1,716 or 54% of revenue for Q4 2023 was lower than the gross profit of $2,232 and 64% of revenue in Q4 2022 due to the inclusion of a $259 US federal wage subsidy received in Q4 2022. Cleantek's gross profit of $8,385 or 60% of revenue for the year ended 2023 was inline with target gross profit and greater than gross profit of $7,792 and 59% of revenue for 2022;Cleantek's Adjusted EBITDA was $559 for Q4 2023, a decrease of $714 when compared to Q4 2022, primarily due to the decreased gross profit; On an annual basis Adjusted EBITDA was $4,050, a decrease of $320 from 2022 primarily due to the receipt of a $259 US federal wage subsidy in Q4 2022; On December 27, 2023, the Company entered into a new long-term debt financing facilities arrangement, replacing the Company's existing short-term credit facility. Whilst the new long-term facilities do not provide the Company with a significant amount of immediate new liquidity, they do provide the Company with a long-term partnership, reduced monthly principal and interest payments and added financial flexibility over the life of the facilities; and;In December, 2023, the Company reached a settlement agreement on the litigation disputes with former Cleantek executives for wrongful dismissals in 2019 which has eliminated litigation spending going forward. Legal costs incurred in 2023 for these litigations totaled $550 and an additional $550 was accrued for settlement. Details can be found in the Litigation and Claims section within the MD&A. Expansion and OutlookCleantek's strategy focuses on delivering innovative and cost-effective solutions that reduce the carbon intensity as well as the capital and operating costs of industrial operations. By focusing on expanding the market awareness and adoption of its sustainable lighting solutions and wastewater treatment assets, Cleantek continues to experience increased utilization of these high-margin product lines. In 2023, the Company launched two new growth initiatives, including SecureTek, Cleantek's line of remote security services, as well as the company's newest addition to the ZeroE line of wastewater treatment products, the mobile waste gas fired GZeroE. Both growth initiatives will utilize the Company's existing asset base and require minimal capital investment for what the Company believes could be substantial growth opportunities in adjacent industry verticals. International Expansion - Expanding on the Company's recent success with the first HALOTM sale in a geographic area historically not serviced by Cleantek, Cleantek completed a proof-of-concept trial with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its HALOTM line and is exploring a number of promising opportunities diversifying Cleantek's geographic focus and customer base, including exploring opportunities across the Middle East for rental and/or product sales.SecureTek - Cleantek's line of remote security services, being offered as a stand-alone system or integrated with our sustainable lighting products, is expected to drive higher utilization of existing assets and creating an exciting new recurring revenue stream for the Company. Utilizing our existing infrastructure, SecureTek is an accretive service offering and a great opportunity to expand our reach into the construction, mining, storage, agriculture, and other commercial markets, with minimal new capital investment. Mobile GZeroE - Adding to the fleet of ZeroE technology is our new waste-gas powered, wastewater treatment and dehydration system, or ""GZeroE"". GZeroE utilizes waste-gas as its primary energy source, allowing for deployment of the ZeroE system into areas without a waste-heat source while providing substantial ESG and cost benefits. The first system was launched in March 2024 to one of a growing number of clientele and has received excellent feedback. The manufacture of additional units will be determined based off customer demand and feedback. The Company's near-term strategy will continue to focus on: maximize utilization rates of its current fleet of sustainable lighting solutions and mobile ZeroE wastewater treatment assets; expanding and growing the Company's fleet of sustainable lighting solutions and mobile ZeroE wastewater treatment assets to satisfy increased demand in the oil and gas, midstream, mining, industrial and construction markets;leveraging Cleantek's technology to capture additional market share through organic growth of the ZeroE wastewater treatment and vaporization services, including the new mobile GZeroE, as well as the new product and service offering in SecureTek; focusing on growth, generating positive return for shareholders and improving the Company's financial position now that long-term financing is in place and longstanding legal disputes have been settled; and,evaluating new technology, products and services to increase our offering to our current client base.The Company is uniquely positioned with the prospect to capture expansion in both ZeroE wastewater vaporization and sustainable lighting markets. Cleantek expects that wastewater and vaporization opportunities in the oil and gas, municipal grey water, and industrial wastewater industries and a growing awareness regarding the disadvantages and risks of downhole injection will continue to increase the demand for Cleantek's ZeroE products. Operational Update Cleantek's fourth quarter 2023 revenue was $3,188, a decrease of $279 from same period last year and $13,989 for the year ended December 31, 2023 an increase of $873 from the prior year.

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Aon plc announces early results of cash tender offers and consent solicitations for NFP Corp's outstanding debt securities, revealing principal amounts tendered and reference yields for various notes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer and consent solicitation initiated by Aon for outstanding debt securities of NFP Corp. indicate a strong participation rate among holders, with a significant portion of the debt being tendered. This high participation rate, especially for the longer-dated securities, suggests confidence in Aon's financial prospects and stability. The additional leverage offered through the tender could imply an optimization of Aon's capital structure. However, investors should be mindful of the impact of these actions on the company's debt profile and watch for any changes in credit ratings or outlooks as a result. Debt Market Analyst The repurchase yields, set above the U.S. Treasury Reference yields, represent a premium that Aon's subsidiary is willing to pay to retire its outstanding debt early. The choice to do so may be indicative of Aon's strategy to reduce interest expenses or to clear the way for future financial maneuvers, which could include corporate restructuring or acquisitions. The high percentage of secured notes tendered suggests a favorable reception from debt holders to the terms offered, which may correspond with a lower risk perception of Aon's creditworthiness. Legal Expert The consent solicitation by Aon to amend indenture provisions, including restrictive covenants and events of default, indicates a strategic move to gain more operational flexibility. It could herald significant changes in how Aon intends to manage its capital structure going forward. Investors should note that these amendments, along with the release of collateral securing the notes, could potentially alter the risk profile of the outstanding bonds. Hence, there may be implications for the value of any remaining notes not tendered in this offering. 04/15/2024 - 07:15 PM DUBLIN, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aon plc (NYSE: AON) (""Aon""), a leading global professional services firm, announced today (i) the early tender results as of the previously announced early tender deadline of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 15, 2024 (the ""Early Tender Date"") for the previously announced cash tender offers (the ""Offers"") and related consent solicitations (the ""Consent Solicitations"") by Randolph Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon (the ""Offeror""), for any and all of the outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due 2028 (the ""Unsecured 2028 Notes""), 4.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the ""Secured 2028 Notes""), 7.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the ""2030 Notes"") and 8.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the ""2031 Notes"" and, together with the Secured 2028 Notes and the 2030 Notes, the ""Secured Notes,"" and the Secured Notes, together with the Unsecured 2028 Notes, the ""Notes""), each issued by NFP Corp.

The ""Total Consideration"" offered per $1,000 principal amount of Notes of any series identified in the table above titled ""Fixed Price Notes"" (the ""Fixed Price Notes"") tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will be the amount set forth under the heading ""Total Consideration"". The ""Total Consideration"" offered per $1,000 principal amount of Notes of any series identified in the table above titled ""Fixed Spread Notes"" (the ""Fixed Spread Notes"") tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will be determined in accordance with the formula set forth in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the fixed spread for such series (the ""Fixed Spread"") specified on such table plus the ""Reference Yield"" for such series specified in such table, which is the yield based on the bid-side price of the applicable U.S. Treasury Reference Security specified on such table as quoted on the Bloomberg Reference Page specified on such table on the Price Determination Date. The sum of the Fixed Spread and the Reference Yield is referred to as the ""Repurchase Yield."" As previously announced, in order to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration with respect to the Notes, holders must have validly tendered Notes at or before the Early Tender Date. Holders validly tendering Notes after the applicable Early Tender Date but at or before 5:00 pm, New York City time, on April 30, 2024 (such time and date with respect to each Offer, as it may be extended, the ""Expiration Date"") will be eligible to receive only the applicable ""Tender Consideration"" for such Notes, which is equal to the applicable Total Consideration less the amount in cash set forth in the table above under the heading ""Early Tender Payment."" In addition, holders whose Notes are purchased in the Offers will receive accrued and unpaid interest in respect of their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date of such Notes up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date for such Offer. In addition, as previously announced, the Offeror solicited consents in the Consent Solicitations for proposed amendments described in the Offer to Purchase that would (i) eliminate or modify substantially all of the restrictive covenants relating to the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, certain reporting obligations, certain events of default and related provisions in the applicable indenture relating to the Notes and reduce the notice period required in connection with an optional redemption of the Notes (the ""Proposed Amendments"") and (ii) in the case of the Secured Notes, release all of the collateral securing the obligations of the Issuer and the guarantors party thereto (the ""Proposed Release Amendments""). Because the Offeror received consents representing a majority of the aggregate principal amount of each of the Unsecured 2028 Notes and the Secured Notes, with the holders of the Secured Notes voting as a single class, the Offeror expects that the Issuer and its subsidiaries that guarantee the Notes will execute and deliver a supplemental indenture with respect to each of the Unsecured 2028 Notes and the Secured Notes giving effect to the Proposed Amendments. Additionally, because the Offeror received consents representing over 66⅔% of the aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes, with the holders of the Secured Notes voting as a single class, the Offeror expects that the supplemental indenture with respect to the Secured Notes will give effect to the Proposed Release Amendments. The Proposed Amendments and, in the case of the Secured Notes, the Proposed Release Amendments are expected to become operative on the Early Settlement Date, if any, or the Final Settlement Date. Each Offer and the related Consent Solicitation will expire on the Expiration Date. Except as set forth below, payment for the Notes that are validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date and that are accepted for purchase will be made on the date referred to as the ""Final Settlement Date."" It is anticipated that the Final Settlement Date for the Notes will be May 2, 2024, the second business day after the Expiration Date. The Offeror reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make payment for Notes that are validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Date and that are accepted for purchase on the date referred to as the ""Early Settlement Date."" The Early Settlement Date for the Notes, if applicable, will be a date following the Early Tender Date and prior to the Expiration Date on which the conditions to the consummation of the applicable Offer, including the Merger Condition (as defined below), are satisfied or waived. If the Merger is consummated on or prior to April 26, 2024, the Offeror intends to (i) select the business day following the consummation of the Merger as the Early Settlement Date for the Notes and (ii) announce the Total Consideration offered per $1,000 principal amount of each series of Fixed Spread Notes by press release on the date of the consummation of the Merger. In the event the consummation of the Merger occurs after May 2, 2024, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Total Consideration and the Tender Consideration, as applicable, will be calculated as if the Final Settlement Date occurred on May 2, 2024. The Offeror's obligation to consummate the Offers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, which are more fully described in the Offer to Purchase, including, among others, the consummation of the acquisition of NFP Intermediate Holdings A Corp. (""NFP Intermediate"") by the Offeror (the ""Merger"") on the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 19, 2023 (as amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified from time to time), by and among Aon, the Offeror, Randolph Merger Sub LLC, NFP Intermediate and NFP Parent Co, LLC (the ""Merger Condition"").

These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of Aon's operations. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities, events or developments that Aon expects or anticipates may occur in the future, including, without limitation, statements about the benefits of the proposed Merger, including future financial and operating results and synergies, Aon's, NFP Intermediate's and the combined firm's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, and the expected timing of the completion of the proposed Merger, are forward-looking statements. Also, when Aon uses words such as ""anticipate"", ""believe"", ""continue"", ""could"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""forecast"", ""intend"", ""looking forward"", ""may"", ""might"", ""plan"", ""potential"", ""opportunity"", ""commit"", ""probably"", ""project"", ""should"", ""will"", ""would"" or similar expressions, it is making forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or anticipated by the forward looking statements: the possibility that the proposed Merger will not be consummated, failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed Merger, adverse effects on the market price of Aon's securities and on Aon's operating results for any reason, including, without limitation, because of the failure to consummate the proposed Merger, the failure to realize the expected benefits of the proposed Merger (including anticipated revenue and growth synergies), the failure to effectively integrate the combined companies following consummation of the proposed Merger, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals, or any announcement relating to the consummation of or failure to consummate the proposed Merger on the market price of Aon's securities, significant transaction and integration costs or difficulties in connection with the proposed Merger and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, potential litigation associated with the proposed Merger, the potential impact of the consummation of the proposed Merger on relationships, including with suppliers, customers, employees and regulators, and general economic, business and political conditions (including any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak) that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the proposed Merger. Any or all of Aon's forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about Aon's performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made.

Aon is not under, and expressly disclaims, any obligation to update or alter any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

The report highlights the expansion of the country's cloud ecosystem driven by digital transformations and cloud implementations. Positive None. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 08:00 PM Australian enterprises accelerate and adapt cloud strategies amid AI hopes, ransomware worries and changing work modes, ISG Provider Lens™ report says SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The acceleration of digital transformations and cloud implementations by Australian companies and government agencies is expanding the country’s Microsoft cloud ecosystem, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Microsoft Cloud Ecosystem report for Australia finds that organizations’ cloud strategies are evolving quickly, shaped by concerns about cloud costs, geopolitical instability and a growing risk of cyberattacks. In turn, the market for Microsoft cloud-related services is also evolving. Adoption of Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 is especially strong, with enterprises increasingly focused on building applications correctly as they migrate to the cloud. “Australian companies are cautious about technology, seeking a strong return on investment,” said Ben Rossiter, ISG technology modernization lead in Australia. “They are partnering with providers for the best possible implementations.” Many Australian organizations are still catching up with dramatic changes in employee and customer expectations that accelerated with the COVID-19 pandemic, ISG says. Service providers are helping them deploy the right devices, network security and collaboration tools to keep remote workers happy, safe and productive. Microsoft’s AI strategy for Azure continues to evolve amid growing enterprise interest in using AI to augment human productivity, the report says. Companies are under pressure to quickly introduce new products and services and see AI as a tool to boost employees’ innovation efforts. They are expected to increase their adoption of AI, and especially conversational AI, in Azure implementations over the next few years. As generative AI (GenAI) emerges as a key technology for many enterprise functions, companies are integrating AI with their workflows, business applications and collaborative platforms, ISG says. GenAI services for Microsoft clouds are helping them to prepare for this new wave of capabilities. Organizations that understand how to use GenAI are expected to outperform those that come late to the technology. In the wake of the pandemic and a recent surge in ransomware attacks, Australian organizations have grown more comfortable with putting applications on the cloud, ISG says. Many, though not all, have already migrated applications with low to medium complexity and are now ready to trust complex core systems such as SAP to the cloud. SAP’s announcement of the impending end of life for its on-premises products has accelerated this trend. “Some Australian organizations are still reluctant to put business-critical applications on the cloud,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Service providers can educate them on how to make the transition easily and minimize risks.” The report also examines other Microsoft cloud trends affecting Australian companies, including the rising importance of data governance and providers’ shift from IT-centric to customer-centric approaches, focusing on end-user experience to drive business outcomes. For more insights into the Microsoft cloud challenges facing Australian enterprises, including the growth of unstructured data and a shortage of resources for digital transformation amid rising costs, along with advice for addressing them, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Microsoft Cloud Ecosystem report for Australia evaluates the capabilities of 40 providers across five quadrants: Managed Services for Azure, Microsoft 365 Services, SAP on Azure Services, Power Platform Services and Generative AI Services for the Microsoft Clouds. The report names Accenture & Avanade, DXC Technology, Fujitsu, TCS and Wipro as Leaders in all five quadrants. It names Kyndryl as a Leader in four quadrants and Capgemini, HCLTech and Telstra as Leaders in three quadrants each. Logicalis, Unisys and Velrada are named as Leaders in two quadrants each. AC3, Barhead Solutions, Hexaware, Macquarie Cloud Services, PwC and Tech Mahindra are named as Leaders in one quadrant each. In addition, Infosys is named as a Rising Star — a company with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in three quadrants. Engage Squared, FiveP Australia, HCLTech, Insight and Kyndryl are named as Rising Stars in one quadrant each. Customized versions of the report are available from Barhead Solutions, Logicalis, Unisys and Velrada. In the area of customer experience, Bechtle is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among Microsoft cloud ecosystem partners. The provider earned the highest customer satisfaction scores in ISG's Voice of the Customer survey, which is part of the ISG Star of Excellence™ program, the premier quality recognition for the technology and business services industry.

Financial Analyst The reported financials by Vuzix indicate a slight increase in total revenues, primarily driven by sales of smart glasses, yet there's an alarming increase in net loss year-over-year. The company's investment in research and development slightly declined, which could be seen as a positive cost control measure. However, the significant upsurge in selling and marketing expenses raises questions about the efficiency of these efforts, especially given the modest revenue growth.The substantial gross loss and provision for inventory write-downs suggest overestimation of demand or issues with inventory management. The cash and cash equivalents position is still substantial, but the increased cash burn rate could pressure the company to secure additional funding or reduce costs to maintain operations long-term. Market Research Analyst Despite the setbacks in revenue growth, Vuzix emphasizes advancements in their product development and manufacturing capabilities. This focus on improving technology and expanding market reach, particularly in the enterprise, consumer and defense sectors, could be pivotal. It's important for current and potential investors to monitor the adoption rates of AR smart glasses within these markets, as Vuzix’s future profitability hinges on this.The company's optimistic management outlook centered on the burgeoning partnerships and upcoming projects could serve as a promising indicator for long-term growth. However, it is essential to contrast this optimism with the actual pace of market adoption and the competitive landscape of the AR industry. Technology Analyst The progress in microLED display technology and the integration of eye-correction prescriptions in waveguides present key advancements in AR smart glasses. These innovations could enhance the user experience and widen the market appeal. The anticipation surrounding Atomistic's work on RGB microLEDs points to potential breakthroughs in display technology, which might create a competitive edge for Vuzix. However, investors should evaluate such technological milestones in light of the company’s financial health and the practical applications of these technologies. There needs to be a clear pathway from technological innovation to marketable products that can generate sustainable revenue streams for Vuzix. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM ROCHESTER, N.Y., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vuzix® Corporation (NASDAQ: VUZI) (""Vuzix"" or the ""Company""), a leading supplier of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and products, today reported its fourth quarter and full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. ""In 2023, Vuzix made important advancements in our product development, core technologies and manufacturing, all of which uniquely position Vuzix to play an important role in the expected to become multibillion dollar AR smart glasses market,"" said Paul Travers, President and CEO of Vuzix. ""We have also completed the expansion of our waveguide manufacturing capabilities and moved equipment into a dedicated manufacturing space. At the same time, we've expanded our know-how and capabilities to make waveguides with virtually no forward eye glow and integrating wearer eye-correction prescriptions. On the microLED display side, Atomistic is making steady progress and has delivered against multiple key milestones."" ""2023 did not deliver on our expected revenue growth largely due to the timing of the AR enterprise industry adoption curve, which has taken longer to develop, much like other leading-edge technologies,"" said Mr. Travers.

The increase in revenues for the year was due to higher sales of smart glasses. Sales of engineering services for the year ended December 31, 2023, were modestly higher at $1.4 million as compared to $1.3 million in the same period of 2022. There was an overall gross loss of $2.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to overall gross profit of $1.5 million or 13% as a percent of total revenues for the same period in 2022. Included in Total Cost of Sales for 2023 were inventory write-down and obsolescence provisions totaling $4.4 million, as compared to provisions of $0.3 million for the 2022 year. Research and Development expense was $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $12.7 million for the comparable 2022 period, a decrease of 3% largely due to a $0.9 million reduction in external development expenses and consultant expenses. Selling and Marketing expense was $12.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $8.1 million for the comparable 2022 period, an increase of 57% that was largely due to a $2.1 million increase in salary, commissions and benefits related expenses driven by headcount increases and a reserve allowance for potential bad debts of $1.6 million. General and Administrative expense was $18.6 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $21.0 million for the comparable 2022 period, a decrease of 12%. The decrease was largely due to a $3.1 million decline in non-cash stock-based compensation. The net loss for the full year ending December 31, 2023 was $50.1 million or $0.79 cents per share versus a net loss of $40.8 million or $0.64 for the same period in 2022.

We have a good book of business with identified opportunities, representing large potential deals and cornerstone customers for our enterprise products. And on the OEM side of our business, we expect to enter into several new projects with new and existing defense and consumer product-focused customers over the course of the year. At the same time, we remain vigilant in our actions to lower our operating costs, extend our operational runway and improve our enterprise product margins,"" said Mr. Travers. ""We expect our red-green-blue (RGB) microLED development progress with Atomistic to accelerate over the coming year with their increased production of test samples and refinements of initial designs. We have started to engage with potential customers and development partners ranging from US and international defense organizations to a number of well-known brands and OEM supply companies. The feedback has been very positive thus far, with nearly all parties intently interested in seeing and potentially supporting Atomistic/Vuzix practical solution for MicroLEDs with high brightness, high efficiency and high contrast that should be clearly scalable and cost effective,"" concluded Mr. Travers.

Net income was $28.0 million, with adjusted net income of $39.9 million. Loans held for investment were $9.29 billion, deposits were $10.50 billion, and net interest margin was 3.42%. Book value per common share increased by 6.48% from the previous quarter. Positive FB Financial reported a decline in diluted EPS from the previous quarter but an increase in adjusted diluted EPS compared to the same period last year. The company's loans held for investment decreased slightly, while deposits remained relatively stable. Net interest margin decreased slightly, but book value per common share showed a significant increase from the previous quarter. The company's core noninterest income increased, driven by strong performances in mortgage banking income. Noninterest expense decreased, leading to an improved core efficiency ratio compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. The company recorded a provision expense related to loans held for investment and unfunded loan commitments, resulting in a net provision expense for the quarter. Capital strength remained solid, allowing the company to restructure its balance sheet and reauthorize its share repurchase program. Negative None. Financial Analyst Assessing FB Financial Corporation's disclosed financials, a few key points emerge. Firstly, the diluted earnings per share (EPS) has dipped to $0.59 from $0.63 in the previous quarter, noting a decrease in profitability which may concern investors looking for consistent growth. The decrease from the previous year's $0.78 is even more pronounced. However, the adjusted EPS shows an increase, indicating that non-recurring items impacted reported net income.From a balance sheet perspective, the decline in loans held for investment (HFI) and deposits suggests a slight contraction in scale, potentially impacting future interest revenue. However, the bank's net interest margin (NIM) decline is minimal, signifying the company is maintaining profitability despite a challenging interest rate environment. This level of NIM management could reflect positively on stakeholder confidence in the company's financial health.The Company's strategy to partially restructure its balance sheet by liquidating lower-yield securities in favor of higher-yield ones is notable. This move is likely an effort to improve net interest income in future quarters but resulted in a loss currently impacting earnings. The impact on the stock will depend on investors’ views on the long-term benefits versus the short-term earnings hit. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the competitive landscape, FB Financial Corporation's strategic pivot from construction lending towards relationship-based customer growth could be an effort to build a more stable and diversified loan portfolio, which may be well-received by market participants sensitive to credit risks. However, the increased provision for credit losses and higher nonperforming loan ratios could indicate emerging credit quality concerns, which could temper investor enthusiasm.The efficiency improvements and proactive expense management resulting in a lower core efficiency ratio are positive signals that the company is controlling costs, a critical factor during economic downturns or uncertain financial periods. Investors often scrutinize such metrics to gauge management effectiveness in improving profitability. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Expert From a compliance standpoint, it's worth noting the inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures like adjusted net income and tangible book value per common share. These alternate measures can offer investors additional insights into the company's performance by excluding certain non-recurring transactions and intangible assets. However, reliance on these measures requires careful scrutiny to understand the adjustments made and ensure they're not masking underlying issues. Investors should consult the reconciliation to GAAP measures provided in the company's financial supplement for a complete view. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM Reports Q1 Diluted EPS of $0.59, Adjusted Diluted EPS* of $0.85 NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) (NYSE: FBK), parent company of FirstBank, reported net income of $28.0 million, or $0.59 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $0.63 in the previous quarter and $0.78 in the first quarter of last year.

Further, we had a securities transaction late in the quarter which will contribute additional near-term earnings and provide additional balance sheet optionality.” Annualized (dollars in thousands, except share data) Mar 2024 Dec 2023 Mar 2023 Mar 24 / Dec 23 % Change Mar 24 / Mar 23 % Change Balance Sheet Highlights Investment securities, at fair value $ 1,464,682 $ 1,471,973 $ 1,474,064 (1.99 )% (0.64 )% Loans held for sale 82,704 67,847 82,515 88.1 % 0.23 % Loans HFI 9,288,909 9,408,783 9,365,996 (5.12 )% (0.82 )% Allowance for credit losses on loans HFI 151,667 150,326 138,809 3.59 % 9.26 % Total assets 12,548,320 12,604,403 13,101,147 (1.79 )% (4.22 )% Interest-bearing deposits (non-brokered) 8,191,962 8,179,430 8,693,515 0.62 % (5.77 )% Brokered deposits 130,845 150,475 251 (52.5 )% NM Noninterest-bearing deposits 2,182,121 2,218,382 2,489,149 (6.57 )% (12.3 )% Total deposits 10,504,928 10,548,287 11,182,915 (1.65 )% (6.06 )% Borrowings 360,821 390,964 312,131 (31.0 )% 15.6 % Allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments 7,700 8,770 18,463 (49.1 )% (58.3 )% Total common shareholders' equity 1,479,526 1,454,794 1,369,696 6.84 % 8.02 % Book value per common share $ 31.55 $ 31.05 $ 29.29 6.48 % 7.72 % Tangible book value per common share* $ 26.21 $ 25.69 $ 23.86 8.14 % 9.85 % Total common shareholders' equity to total assets 11.8 % 11.5 % 10.5 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets* 9.99 % 9.74 % 8.68 % *Non-GAAP financial measure; A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Company's First Quarter 2024 Financial Supplement.

Balance Sheet and Net Interest Margin The Company reported loans HFI of $9.29 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, a decline of $119.9 million compared to $9.41 billion at the end of the prior quarter. This was driven by a decline in construction loans of $128.4 million, which contributed to multifamily and non-owner occupied commercial real estate balance increases of $11.3 million and $48.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company had a larger commercial and industrial credit payoff during the quarter, which accounted for $48.9 million of the decrease. Net of the decrease in construction loans and the commercial and industrial credit payoff, the loans HFI portfolio increased by $57.4 million, or 2.46% annualized. Near the end of the first quarter, the Company executed a balance sheet restructure by electing to sell $207.9 million in available-for-sale securities with a weighted average yield of 2.14% and reinvested the proceeds of the sales into available-for-sale securities with a weighted average yield of 5.94%. The securities sales resulted in a loss of $16.2 million included in the first quarter results. The Company reported total deposits of $10.50 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to $10.55 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company's total cost of deposits increased to 2.76% during the first quarter from 2.65% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $2.18 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $2.22 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company’s net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2024 to $100.2 million from $101.9 million in the prior quarter. NIM decreased to 3.42% for the first quarter of 2024 from 3.46% for the previous quarter. NIM was impacted as the Company recognized less from loan fees and loan origination expenses in comparison to previous quarters due to an updated methodology for deferrals of these items. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased to 3.49% from 3.40% in the previous quarter and the contractual yield on loans HFI increased to 6.55% from 6.43% from the fourth quarter of 2023. Holmes continued, “Net interest margin was in line with expectations for the quarter and exceeded the prior quarter when adjusting for loan fees. The Company continued to reduce exposure to construction lending during the quarter, resulting in a decrease in loan balances. The team is focused on growing relationship-based customers versus transactional business, and this resolve for growing relationships will create long term value for the Company and our shareholders.” Noninterest Income Core noninterest income* was $23.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $18.7 million and $22.6 million for the fourth and first quarters of 2023, respectively. On a percentage basis, core noninterest income* was up 26.5% from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.69% from the first quarter of 2023. Core noninterest income* for the first quarter of 2024 reflected adjustments for a $16.2 million loss from sale of securities and a $0.6 million gain on sale of other real estate owned; detail on adjustments for prior periods is available in the non-GAAP reconciliations. Despite the interest rate environment, mortgage banking income increased to $12.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $8.4 million in the prior quarter and $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. Chief Financial Officer, Michael Mettee commented, “After adjusting noninterest income for the loss related to our securities trade, which enhanced the earnings and liquidity profile of the Company, the Company had good growth in fee income led by strong performances from both our mortgage and investment teams.” Noninterest Expense Core noninterest expense* during the first quarter of 2024 was $71.9 million compared to $74.4 million for the prior quarter and $80.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. These amounts reflect adjustments to expenses of $0.5 million for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment in the first quarter and compare to adjustments of $2.2 million for early retirement and severance costs, $1.8 million of loss on lease terminations and $1.8 million for the FDIC special assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a $0.1 million gain on lease terminations in the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company's core efficiency ratio* was 58.1%, compared to 61.7% in the previous quarter and 63.4% in the first quarter of 2023. Core banking noninterest expense* was $59.8 million for the quarter, compared to $62.6 million in the prior quarter. Mettee noted, “Continued efficiency improvements and proactive expense management remain a focus of the Company in this operating environment. At the same time, we are intent on adding seasoned revenue producers to add scale to the operating platform that we have developed over the prior two years.” Credit Quality In the first quarter, the Company recorded a provision expense of $1.9 million related to loans HFI and a provision reversal of $1.1 million related to unfunded loan commitments, resulting in a net provision expense of $0.8 million. Through an intentional effort to derisk the balance sheet, the Company ended the quarter with $590.6 million in unfunded commitments for construction and land development loans, a decline of $135.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2023 and $749.6 million from the first quarter of 2023. The Company had an allowance for credit losses on loans HFI as of the end of the first quarter of 2024 of $151.7 million, representing 1.63% of loans HFI compared to $150.3 million, or 1.60% of loans HFI as of December 31, 2023. The Company experienced net charge-offs of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2024, representing annualized net charge-offs of 0.02% of average loans HFI, which compares to annualized net recoveries of 0.04% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and annualized net charge-offs of 0.02% in the first quarter of 2023. The Company's nonperforming loans HFI as a percentage of total loans HFI increased to 0.73% as of the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to 0.65% at the previous quarter-end and 0.49% at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 0.75% as of the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to 0.69% at the end of the prior quarter and 0.61% as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Holmes commented, “The Company continued to modestly build its allowance for credit losses during the quarter as we remain cautious on the economy and cognizant of certain asset classes. Our loan portfolio continues to perform as expected, demonstrated by 2 basis points of annualized net charge-offs during the quarter and stable nonperforming metrics.” Capital Strength Holmes continued, “Our capital position provided us the opportunity to partially restructure our balance sheet and reauthorize our share repurchase program. While we continue to build our capital levels through our earnings power, we are working to deploy capital as opportunities present themselves.” ______________ *Non-GAAP financial measure;A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Company's First Quarter 2024 Financial Supplement. Summary Holmes finalized, “The first quarter results reflect the efforts of the team over the last two years to improve on a solid foundation that we can leverage to build scale, increase returns and build long term shareholder value. The quarter reflects progress towards those goals and towards our goal of industry leading performance metrics.” WEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION FB Financial Corporation will host a conference call to discuss the Company's financial results on April 16, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. (Central Time).

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements contained in this Earnings Release that are not historical in nature may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the Company’s future plans, results, strategies, and expectations, including expectations around changing economic markets. These statements can generally be identified by the use of the words and phrases “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “goal,” “plan,” “potential,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “target,” “aim,” “predict,” “continue,” “seek,” and other variations of such words and phrases and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based upon management's current expectations, estimates, and projections, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond the Company’s control. The inclusion of these forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that such expectations, estimates, and projections will be achieved. Accordingly, the Company cautions shareholders and investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements including, without limitation, (1) current and future economic conditions, including the effects of inflation, interest rate fluctuations, changes in the economy or global supply chain, supply-demand imbalances affecting local real estate prices, and high unemployment rates in the local or regional economies in which the Company operates and/or the US economy generally, (2) changes in government interest rate policies and its impact on the Company’s business, net interest margin, and mortgage operations, (3) any continuation of the recent turmoil in the banking industry, including the associated impact to the Company and other financial institutions of any regulatory changes or other mitigation efforts taken by government agencies in response, (4) increased competition for deposits, (5) the Company’s ability to effectively manage problem credits, (6) any deterioration in commercial real estate market fundamentals, (7) the Company’s ability to identify potential candidates for, consummate, and achieve synergies from, potential future acquisitions, (8) the Company’s ability to successfully execute its various business strategies, (9) changes in state and federal legislation, regulations or policies applicable to banks and other financial service providers, including legislative developments, (10) the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity controls and procedures to prevent and mitigate attempted intrusions, (11) the Company's dependence on information technology systems of third party service providers and the risk of systems failures, interruptions, or breaches of security, and (12) the impact of natural disasters, pandemics, and/or acts of war or terrorism, (13) events giving rise to international or regional political instability, including the broader impacts of such events on financial markets and/or global macroeconomic environments, and (14) general competitive, economic, political, and market conditions. Further information regarding the Company and factors which could affect the forward-looking statements contained herein can be found in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and in any of the Company’s subsequent filings with the SEC. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s ability to control or predict. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if the underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, shareholders and investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this Earnings Release, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict their occurrence or how they will affect the Company. The Company qualifies all forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements. GAAP RECONCILIATION AND USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Earnings Release contains certain financial measures that are not measures recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and therefore are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may include, without limitation, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per common share, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue, consolidated core revenue, consolidated core and segment noninterest expense and consolidated core noninterest income, consolidated core efficiency ratio (tax equivalent basis), and adjusted return on average assets and equity. Each of these non-GAAP metrics excludes certain income and expense items that the Company’s management considers to be non-core/adjusted in nature. The Company refers to these non-GAAP measures as adjusted (or core) measures. Also, the Company presents tangible assets, tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, tangible common equity to tangible assets, return on average tangible common equity, and adjusted return on average tangible common equity. Each of these non-GAAP metrics excludes the impact of goodwill and other intangibles. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company’s performance, financial condition and the efficiency of its operations as management believes such measures facilitate period-to-period comparisons and provide meaningful indications of its operating performance as they eliminate both gains and charges that management views as non-recurring or not indicative of operating performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhance comparability of results with prior periods as well as demonstrate the effects of significant non-core gains and charges in the current and prior periods. The Company’s management also believes that investors find these non-GAAP financial measures useful as they assist investors in understanding the Company’s underlying operating performance and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. In addition, because intangible assets such as goodwill and the other items excluded each vary extensively from company to company, the Company believes that the presentation of this information allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results to the results of other companies. However, the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which the Company calculates the non-GAAP financial measures discussed herein may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. Investors should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures the Company has discussed herein when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the Company's First Quarter 2024 Financial Supplement, which is available at https://investors.firstbankonline.com.

Negative SG&A expenses rose by 33.3% in the fiscal 2024 second quarter, reaching $592,202. The company experienced a net loss of $657,456 in fiscal Q2 2024, despite reducing it by 4% compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. Pineapple's net loss increased to $1,530,696 in the first half of fiscal 2024, compared to $1,403,748 in the same period in fiscal 2023. Financial Analyst When dissecting financial earnings, it's important to note the considerable revenue growth of 59.04% year-over-year for the quarter, which showcases a positive trend in the company's sales performance. However, an astute investor would observe that despite this increase, the company reported a net loss, which actually improved by 4% compared to the previous year. This suggests that while revenue is growing, profitability is still a challenge.The increase in SG&A expenses by 33.3% is significant and attributed to expansion and travel costs. These are often necessary costs for growth but must be monitored closely as they can erode profitability if not managed effectively. It's also worth noting the improved cash position, which indicates some degree of liquidity and financial stability. Market Research Analyst A rise in residential mortgage loan generation by 17.6% is a robust indicator of market share growth within the mortgage sector. This performance should be weighed against market averages and competitor performance to fully gauge its impact. However, investors should be cautious as the company's bottom line doesn't reflect the same success due to the net loss reported.Furthermore, the strategic expansion into new metropolitan areas and the rollout of new technologies implies an aggressive growth strategy, which could potentially increase market penetration and lead conversion in the longer term. Yet, such investments take time to reflect in net profitability and their success is not guaranteed. Tech Industry Expert The deployment of an improved online mortgage application signifies investment in tech infrastructure, aiming to streamline operations and enhance customer experience. This move is important in an industry that is increasingly becoming digitized. The launch of custom advertising banner management software could also indicate a focus on more targeted and efficient marketing efforts. These tech advancements could be a differentiator in the competitive mortgage landscape and might contribute to higher conversion rates and customer retention in the long run, although they will also incur short-term costs. 04/15/2024 - 05:05 PM TORONTO, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Pineapple Financial Inc.

Jewett-Cameron Announces 2nd Quarter Financial Results,2024-04-15T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Jewett-Cameron Trading Company  reported its second-quarter financial results for fiscal 2024, showing a slight increase in sales but a decrease in net income.

The company is focusing on innovation and cost reductions to combat economic pressures. They are also seeking new funding arrangements after a reduction in their bank line of credit. Positive Sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased slightly to $8.23 million compared to $8.14 million in the same period last year. Loss from operations decreased to ($726,687) from ($1,210,085) in the previous year's quarter. Net loss for the quarter was ($534,145), or ($0.15) per share, compared to a net loss of ($972,038), or ($0.28) per share, in the year-ago quarter. For the six months ended February 29, 2024, sales were $18.0 million, down from $20.7 million in the same period last year. After a one-time gain from an arbitration settlement, net income for the current six months was $757,395, or $0.22 per share, compared to a net loss of ($1,045,798), or ($0.30) per share, in the first six months of fiscal 2023. The company's cash position as of February 29, 2024, was approximately $1.15 million, with no borrowing against their bank line of credit. The bank reduced their line of credit from $10 million to $5 million, and the revised line will expire on June 30, 2024. Jewett-Cameron Trading Company is in negotiations with other lenders to establish a new line of credit of $5 million or less by May 31, 2024. Negative Sales for the six months ended February 29, 2024, decreased compared to the same period last year. The company's net loss per share increased from the previous year's quarter. The reduction in the bank line of credit may indicate financial challenges for the company. Negotiations with other lenders for a new line of credit could result in unfavorable terms or conditions. Financial Analyst The reported increase in sales to $8.23 million from $8.14 million reflects a modest revenue growth year-over-year for the second quarter. However, the reduction in losses from operations from ($1,210,085) to ($726,687) suggests an improvement in operational efficiency. For investors, this could signal a company moving in the right direction, potentially leading to a positive market response in the short term. Comparing the per-share loss figures year-over-year also indicates a decreased loss per share, but the mention of a one-time gain implies that these numbers may not be entirely indicative of ongoing performance.A critical point for shareholders is the company's announcement of cost reduction strategies and innovation. While this is typically a positive move, tangible results will be necessary to assess its effectiveness. The introduction of new product lines suggests diversification, which could mitigate risks, but also requires successful market penetration.Reducing the line of credit could imply that the company is seeking to minimize debt exposure, which can be favorable in terms of financial health. However, the bank's decision not to meet their criteria for a line of credit may raise concerns about the company's creditworthiness. The search for new lenders could lead to different terms and affect the company's capital structure. Market Research Analyst It is worth noting the emphasis on innovation and the development of core product lines, such as fencing, pet containment and sustainable products under the MyEcoWorld® brand. This strategic focus suggests an effort to capitalize on consumer trends towards sustainability, which can resonate positively with customers and investors seeking ESG-friendly investments. The expansion into sustainable goods could open new market segments and drive long-term growth.CEO Chad Summers' comment on consumer spending being affected by inflation and economic pressures indicates that the company is operating in a challenging environment. This could help explain the sales decrease over the six-month period. For investors, these macroeconomic insights are important for adjusting expectations and understanding the broader context in which the company operates. 04/15/2024 - 04:30 PM NORTH PLAINS, Ore., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Jewett-Cameron Trading Company Ltd.

As of February 29, 2024, the Company's cash position was approximately $1.15 million, and there was no borrowing against our bank line of credit.

Negative Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders was $10.2 million. Net loss per diluted share was $18.81, excluding non-cash expenses. Gross profit margins decreased to 18.3% in the fourth quarter. Net loss per diluted share attributable to common stockholders was $3.7 million in the fourth quarter. Conference call details were not provided in the PR. Financial Analyst The report from Digital Brands Group highlights a reduction in net loss per share from a staggering $1,233.10 to a more manageable $20.46 year-over-year, which is a significant improvement. The gross profit margin increase to 43.9% from 42.5% suggests efficiency improvements in cost management or pricing strategies. Analyzing the decrease in general and administrative expenses by 35.7% (excluding non-cash items), it's indicative of stringent cost control measures. The reduction in sales and marketing expenses could signal a shift towards more targeted, digital-first strategies, which are typically more cost-effective. Market Research Analyst Digital Brands Group's strategy of spinning out Harper & Jones indicates an operational restructure which may aim to streamline the brand portfolio and focus on core assets. This move, coupled with the mention of revenue growth re-acceleration, could pique the interest of investors looking for companies on the path to profitability. Another noteworthy point is the opening of an outlet store, suggesting a multichannel retail approach which could diversify revenue streams and enhance brand visibility. Retail Investor Analyst For retail investors, the emphasis should be on the decreased net loss and the improved operating expense structure. The net income loss of $0.6 million (excluding non-cash expenses) in the fourth quarter could suggest that the company is approaching a breakeven point. Investors might also find the projection of an 'inflection point' in 2024 compelling, but should balance this against the historical performance and understand the potential risks in a brand-centric, consumer discretionary market. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM Net income loss was only $0.6 million in the fourth quarter, excluding non-cash expenses AUSTIN, Texas, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Brands Group, Inc.

The company grants the underwriters an option to purchase additional notes. The offering is expected to close on April 17, 2024, with the intention to list the notes on the NYSE under the symbol 'MFAO'. The net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including investing in residential mortgage-related assets and working capital. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MFA Financial, Inc. regarding the public offering of senior notes is a strategic move aimed at diversifying the company's capital structure and raising funds for general corporate purposes, including potential repayment of existing debt. With an aggregate principal amount of $75 million and an additional over-allotment option for underwriters, this influx of capital is significant for the firm's liquidity. The fixed 9.000% interest rate on these notes, notably higher than the current average for senior notes, could be indicative of an aggressive attempt to attract investors amidst a competitive fixed-income market.The BBB- investment grade rating suggests moderate risk and may assure potential investors of the notes' creditworthiness. Such a rating is pivotal as it balances the higher interest offering with the perceived risk of investment. The timing of the offering and the ability for the company to redeem the notes starting three years after issuance provide flexibility for MFA Financial, Inc. to adjust its financial strategies in response to changing market conditions. Debt Capital Markets Expert Listing the new senior notes on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'MFAO' represents MFA Financial, Inc.'s confidence in their offering's attractiveness and their commitment to ensuring liquidity for investors. The decision to use a shelf registration statement expedites the offering process, which is a common strategy for companies with established market presence to raise funds efficiently. However, investor appetite for such instruments is highly dependent on market conditions and the perceived stability of the issuing company.The planned use of proceeds for investment in more residential mortgage-related assets suggests a strategic focus on expanding their portfolio in this area. It's important to note that such investments carry inherent risks linked to the property market's volatility, which could affect the company’s financial health should the housing market face headwinds. 04/15/2024 - 04:20 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MFA Financial, Inc. (NYSE:MFA) (the “Company”) announced today the pricing of an underwritten public offering of $75 million aggregate principal amount of its 9.000% senior notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Company has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $11.25 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes to cover over-allotments. The offering is expected to close on April 17, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company intends to apply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “MFAO” and, if the application is approved, expects trading in the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange to begin within 30 days after the Notes are first issued. The Notes have received an investment grade rating of BBB- from Egan-Jones Ratings Company, an independent, unaffiliated rating agency. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include investing in additional residential mortgage-related assets, including but not limited to, residential whole loans, business purpose loans, MBS and other mortgage-related investments, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of existing indebtedness, including amounts outstanding under the Company’s repurchase agreements and the repurchase or repayment of a portion of the Company’s 6.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company, and pay interest quarterly in cash on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2024. The Notes will mature on August 15, 2029, and may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, at the Company’s option on or after August 15, 2026. Morgan Stanley & Co.

The contract falls within the $500 million to $1 billion range and will be reflected in Q2 2024 orders. Positive TechnipFMC (FTI) awarded a substantial contract by ExxonMobil Guyana for the Whiptail project in Guyana's Stabroek Block. The contract includes the supply of 48 subsea trees, 12 manifolds, and associated equipment, with a total value falling between $500 million and $1 billion. TechnipFMC will provide project management, engineering, and manufacturing services for the subsea production systems. The award will be recorded in the company's inbound orders for the second quarter of 2024. ExxonMobil Guyana will utilize TechnipFMC's Subsea 2.0® systems and manifolds for the Whiptail project. TechnipFMC has a history of successful collaboration with ExxonMobil Guyana, dating back to the Liza Phase 1 contract in 2017. The company is committed to hiring and training local staff in Guyana to support the project. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst TechnipFMC's recent contract for the Whiptail project in Guyana represents a significant business engagement, underlining ExxonMobil's commitment to developing the Stabroek Block, one of the fastest developing basins in the world. As an Energy Sector Analyst, it's important to note the financial magnitude of such a contract, which falls between $500 million and $1 billion. This engagement not only showcases TechnipFMC's capacity to handle large-scale projects but also signals potential future revenue streams aligning with the industry's expansion in that region. The provision of subsea systems, including 48 subsea trees and 12 manifolds, is critical for the extraction of hydrocarbons. Subsea trees are an assembly of valves and other components used to monitor and control the production of a subsea well. Manifolds aid in the regulation of oil or gas flow from the well. The application of TechnipFMC's Subsea 2.0® systems is intended to offer schedule certainty, which can mitigate operational risks and potentially lower costs over time. The continued hiring and training of local Guyanese workforce by TechnipFMC could foster goodwill and smoother operations within local regulatory frameworks, which is a long-term benefit for stakeholders. Moreover, this could potentially lead to reduced labor costs and contribute to socio-economic development in the region, aligning corporate growth with sustainable development goals. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, such a large contract could be a positive indicator for investors interested in TechnipFMC's stock performance. Considering that this order will be included in inbound orders in the second quarter of 2024, it could serve as a catalyst for reassessment of the company's future earnings potential. Investors often look for order backlog as a sign of a company's health and projected growth. Additionally, TechnipFMC's capability to secure repetitive business from a major player like ExxonMobil reflects positively on its market position and reliability as a service provider. This could translate into investor confidence and possibly, an improved stock valuation. Notably, the long-term aspect of such projects could mean a stable income stream for TechnipFMC, which is a vital consideration for dividend-seeking shareholders. However, the energy sector is subject to volatility, driven by fluctuating oil prices and geopolitical events. As such, while the contract is substantial, investors should weigh it against the backdrop of broader market conditions and the inherent risks associated with the industry. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM NEWCASTLE & HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TechnipFMC (NYSE: FTI) (the “Company”) has been awarded a large(1) contract in Guyana’s Stabroek Block by Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) affiliate ExxonMobil Guyana Limited to supply subsea production systems for the Whiptail project. TechnipFMC will provide project management, engineering, and manufacturing to deliver 48 subsea trees and associated tooling, as well as 12 manifolds and associated controls and tie-in equipment. Jonathan Landes, President, Subsea at TechnipFMC, commented: “ExxonMobil Guyana will utilize our Subsea 2.0® systems and manifolds, which help provide schedule certainty. We have already delivered more than 100 subsea trees for ExxonMobil Guyana – the location of one of the world’s fastest developing basins – and we look forward to deepening our relationship with them through Whiptail.” TechnipFMC currently employs nearly 140 Guyanese, and expects to continue to hire and train additional local staff in support of this award. Whiptail is TechnipFMC’s most recent award from ExxonMobil Guyana, where the Company has been awarded subsea production system contracts since the first contract award in 2017 for Liza Phase 1. (1) For TechnipFMC, a “large” contract is between $500 million and $1 billion. This award will be included in inbound orders in the second quarter of 2024.

CitiGroup Announces Full Redemption of Series D Preferred Stock,2024-04-15T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Citigroup Inc. announces the full redemption of Series D Preferred Stock, totaling $1.25 billion, with a redemption date of May 15, 2024. The cash redemption price per Depositary Share is $1,000, with holders receiving a quarterly dividend of $22.5865. The redemption aligns with Citigroup's liability management strategy and aims to enhance funding and capital efficiency.","CitiGroup Announces Full Redemption of Series D Preferred Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Citigroup Inc. announces the full redemption of Series D Preferred Stock, totaling $1.25 billion, with a redemption date of May 15, 2024. The cash redemption price per Depositary Share is $1,000, with holders receiving a quarterly dividend of $22.5865. The redemption aligns with Citigroup's liability management strategy and aims to enhance funding and capital efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a financial institution like Citigroup announces a full redemption of preferred securities, it is a signal of the bank's confidence in its capital structure and liquidity. The redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock removes higher-cost capital from Citigroup's balance sheet, as preferred stocks typically carry higher dividend rates than common stock or debt. This move can be seen as an effort to streamline funding costs and improve net interest margins—key indicators of a bank's profitability.For retail investors, the redemption means that Citigroup is replacing a form of capital that may have been seen as more secure due to its fixed dividends. It is important for investors to observe the bank’s alternative strategies for raising capital that may replace this preferred stock, as it could affect the investment's risk profile. In the short-term, shareholders of the preferred stock will receive a final dividend and the redemption value, but in the long-term, the implications for both Citigroup’s capital structure and investors will hinge on how this capital is redeployed. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the redemption of preferred stock must be evaluated against current market conditions and interest rates. Given that Citigroup is actioning this change in 2024, the redemption aligns with a forecast where current interest rates may be different, potentially more favorable. This could imply expectations of lower borrowing costs in the future, which would make alternative forms of raising capital more attractive than the fixed rate offered by the preferred stock.This move could also reflect on the anticipated regulatory landscape, as banks must navigate through a complex environment of capital requirements. If Citigroup is optimizing its capital structure to be more agile in a changing regulatory framework, it may suggest a proactive stance in maintaining regulatory compliance while also pursuing cost efficiency. Investors should keep an eye on how Citigroup's strategy aligns with the broader industry trends and regulatory shifts to evaluate the potential impact on the stock's performance. Economist An economist's view might focus on the implications of such a redemption for the wider economy. By retiring its preferred stock, Citigroup is essentially signaling a shift in capital allocation, which has broader consequences. This could be interpreted as an indicator of Citigroup’s reading of future economic conditions, potentially preparing for an environment where capital can be more efficiently utilized in other areas.Looking at the impact on the cost of capital, this redemption suggests a possible strategic perspective towards an anticipated change in the interest rate environment or a prediction of stabilization following a period of volatility. This is particularly relevant for retail investors as it reflects the bank's expectations of future economic conditions, which can have a rippling effect on other investments and the overall economy. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citigroup Inc. is redeeming, in whole, all $1.25 billion aggregate liquidation preference of Series D Depositary Shares representing interests in its 5.350% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series D (the “Preferred Stock”).

Management Commentary""As the new CEO of 4Front Ventures, I'm thrilled to take the helm at such a pivotal juncture for our company. Having navigated the many challenges of 2023, I couldn't be more excited to turn the page to 2024,"" said Andrew Thut, CEO of 4Front Ventures. ""Our growth strategy, particularly in Illinois with the imminent opening of our Matteson facility and two new stores, is expected to double our production capacity and significantly boost our revenue and profitability in the state. Additionally, we anticipate further growth in Massachusetts that is expected to accelerate starting in the second quarter, as we expand our wholesale channels and continue to benefit from investments in our cultivation facilities, adjustments made to our product lines, and an improved menu offering."" Mr. Thut continued, ""Over the past year, we achieved substantial growth in our wholesale revenue, with a 75% increase in Illinois and 42% in Massachusetts. This growth is a testament to our capacity to deliver high-quality products at the right price. The Washington facilities enjoyed a significant revival, with flower revenue nearly doubling from the first to the last quarter. It's noteworthy that these positive achievements helped to balance out a year fraught with headwinds, particularly in California, and in other competitive local environments as well. While these challenges were costly, they have ultimately paved the way for a more focused, streamlined, and profitable business. We have learned a great deal from our experiences, and our team is stronger and better prepared for the future as a result. With the advancement of our Matteson facility and our ongoing expansion into Illinois retail, I believe that 2024 and 2025 will truly showcase our ability to compete and win in battleground markets."" ""As we look ahead, our strategy encompasses more than just expansion; it focuses on innovation, quality, and market engagement. We're leveraging data along with our extensive industry and consumer insights to develop products that meet market demands and appeal to a diverse audience across the entire price-quality spectrum. Our enhanced vape technology includes unique features like the Blast button on Crystal Clear disposables and compact, innovative devices for the Marmas Bar. Additionally, we're broadening our product range with more minor cannabinoids, a greater variety in pre-rolls, and upcoming introductions like liquid diamonds in Marmas Bar vapes, Terp Stix, and Infused 1988 blunts. ""Our efforts to boost the quality and diversity of our flower products have yielded significant results. By diversifying our crop rooms, adopting new dry and cure methods, and switching to rockwool media, we've substantially improved both our harvests and quality control. Our products now feature an average THC level of 25%, with some strains exceeding 30%, and an overall cannabinoid content approaching 31%. These achievements are clear indicators of our operational progress and our commitment to R&D, particularly in the rapidly evolving vape segment, ensuring we maintain a competitive edge."" Mr. Thut concluded, ""As the new CEO, I am honored to lead 4Front into this transformative period. Having been with the company for a decade, my commitment to our mission is unwavering. Our team's resilience and adaptability have been outstanding. With a streamlined cost structure, additional innovative products soon to launch, and a clearly defined strategic plan, 4Front is poised for enduring and profitable growth.""

As there are no standardized methods of calculating non-GAAP measures, our methods may differ from those used by others, and accordingly, the use of these measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by others. Accordingly, non-GAAP measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or used as a substitute for or superior measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 4Front uses the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA which, as defined by the Company, excludes from Net Loss: Interest income and expense, including interest expense related to leases;Current income tax expense;Non-cash depreciation and amortization expense, including amortization of leases;Non-cash equity-based compensation expense;Non-cash impairment charges, as the charges are not expected to be a recurring business activity;Non-cash changes in fair value of derivative liability and contingent consideration; andLoss on disposal of assets and lease terminations.Although Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, amounts determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The closest comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is Net Loss. A reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA follows. Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:(Amounts expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, unless otherwise stated) For the Years Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Net loss (U.S. GAAP) $(91,632) $(46,877) Less: Net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 46,914 25,586 Net loss from continuing operations (44,718) (21,291) Adjusted for: Interest income (3) (32) Interest expense (1) 30,920 26,733 Income tax expense 7,092 10,077 Depreciation and amortization (2) 9,373 8,397 EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) $2,664 $23,884 Share-based compensation (3) 6,860 7,214 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets — 6,484 Change in fair value of derivative liability 385 (3,502) Change in fair value of contingent consideration — (2,393) Loss on disposal and lease termination 149 228 Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) $10,058 $31,915 ___________________ 1) For the current period, interest expense includes interest related to leases of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Prior year amounts of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Non-cash interest expense related to leases was previously presented as a reconciling item from EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP). (2) For the current period, depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization related to leases of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Prior year amounts of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. Non-cash amortization expense related to leases was previously presented as a reconciling item from EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP) to Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP). (3) Although share-based compensation is an important component of employee and executive compensation, determining the fair value of share-based compensation involves a high degree of judgment and as a result the Company excludes share-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA because its believes that the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon future exercise or termination of any related share-based compensation award.

My Size Announces Reverse Stock Split,2024-04-15T20:15:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"My Size, Inc. (NASDAQ: MYSZ) announces a one-for-eight reverse stock split to increase per share price and bid price, aiming to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements and attract institutional investors.","My Size Announces Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary My Size, Inc. (NASDAQ: MYSZ) announces a one-for-eight reverse stock split to increase per share price and bid price, aiming to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements and attract institutional investors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by MySize, Inc. regarding a reverse stock split is a tactical financial maneuver aimed at bolstering the company's stock price to maintain NASDAQ listing compliance. The reduction in total outstanding shares from 5.1 million to approximately 0.64 million, a 1-for-8 ratio, implies a nominal increase in the value of each share held post-split. This action does not intrinsically add value to the company but is often perceived as a tool to make shares more appealing to institutional investors due to a higher per-share price. It's important for shareholders to consider the implications of such a move. While the ownership percentage for each investor remains unchanged, except in cases where fractional shares occur, the market's reaction to a reverse split can be mixed. Historically, reverse splits have been associated with companies facing potential delisting and as such, it may flag concerns about underlying business performance. However, should this action succeed in stabilizing the stock price and attracting more established investors, the long-term outlook could be positively influenced. Market Research Analyst In relation to MySize's core business in the e-commerce sector, the reverse stock split does not directly impact the operational effectiveness of their AI-driven measurement solutions. However, from a market perception standpoint, it could signal a strategic shift in the company's approach to capital structure management. Retail investors evaluating MySize should assess this move within the broader context of the company's current financial health, growth prospects and competitive positioning. Retail investors may also want to monitor the stock's behavior post-split to gauge institutional investor interest, which may serve as a proxy indicator of the company's future financial robustness. It is noteworthy that the number of authorized shares remains unchanged, suggesting potential for future equity offerings, which could dilute shareholder value if exercised. It's important for investors to stay abreast of such developments and weigh them against the company's operational performance and market trends. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM AIRPORT CITY, Israel, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MySize, Inc. (NASDAQ: MYSZ) (""MySize"" or the ""Company""), an omnichannel e-commerce platform and provider of AI-driven measurement solutions to drive revenue growth and reduce costs for its business clients, announced that its Board of Directors has approved a one-for-eight reverse stock split of its common stock that is scheduled to become effective after trading closes on April 19, 2024. Beginning on April 23, 2024, the Company's common stock will trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a split adjusted basis under a new CUSIP number 62844N 406. The Company's common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""MYSZ."" As previously disclosed, at the My Size Special Meeting of Stockholders held on April 15, 2024, the Company's stockholders approved a proposal authorizing the Company's Board of Directors, among other things, to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio in the range of 1-for-2 and 1-for-15 in order to increase the per share price and bid price of the Company's common stock to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq and make the common stock more attractive to certain institutional investors, which would provide for a stronger investor base.

ORIC Pharmaceuticals Announces First Patients Dosed Across Three Expansion Cohorts in Phase 1b Trial of ORIC-114 in Patients with Mutated NSCLC,2024-04-15T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"ORIC Pharmaceuticals announces the dosing of the first patients across three expansion cohorts in the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-114 for mutated NSCLC, with promising Phase 1b data reported and plans to release updated data in the first half of 2025.","ORIC Pharmaceuticals Announces First Patients Dosed Across Three Expansion Cohorts in Phase 1b Trial of ORIC-114 in Patients with Mutated NSCLC Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary ORIC Pharmaceuticals announces the dosing of the first patients across three expansion cohorts in the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-114 for mutated NSCLC, with promising Phase 1b data reported and plans to release updated data in the first half of 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst In terms of investment potential, the progression of ORIC Pharmaceuticals' Phase 1b trial for ORIC-114 is a significant development. The trial is aimed at determining the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with specific mutations, which can be a important factor in the drug's commercial success. Given that NSCLC remains a cancer with high incidence rates and the fact that EGFR and HER2 mutations are known targets in oncology, the pursuit of targeted therapies has become a lucrative area. The company's focus on a Medical Research Analyst From a medical perspective, the advancement of ORIC-114 in the Phase 1b trial is noteworthy due to the inclusion of patients who are often excluded from clinical trials, such as those with central nervous system (CNS) metastases. This suggests that ORIC-114 may have a broader patient applicability compared to existing treatments. If successful, the drug could potentially fulfill an unmet need for CNS-active agents in NSCLC, possibly leading to a competitive advantage in the oncology market.The extension cohort for treatment-naïve patients also indicates that ORIC Pharmaceuticals is aiming to position ORIC-114 as a first-line treatment, which could significantly enhance its market potential. This shift towards a first-line therapy could disrupt current treatment paradigms and offers a potential growth trajectory for ORIC, subject to favorable trial outcomes and subsequent regulatory approvals. Oncology Doctor Exploring the clinical implications, ORIC-114's capacity to elicit systemic and CNS responses suggests potential efficacy in treating NSCLC, including difficult-to-treat brain metastases. The trial's design, which explores different mutations and includes first-line, treatment-naïve patients, could lead to a more robust understanding of the drug's efficacy and safety profile across a diverse NSCLC patient population.However, it is imperative to remain cautious until the updated Phase 1b data, expected in the first half of 2025, is released. Long-term efficacy and safety must be established, along with a comparison to current standard-of-care treatments. For retail investors, the outcomes of this trial could significantly impact ORIC's stock performance, but it is important to consider the inherent risks associated with clinical trials and drug development. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM Initiated multiple Phase 1b expansion cohorts to determine the RP2D of ORIC-114 in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20, HER2 exon 20, or EGFR atypical mutations Additionally, the company initiated an extension cohort to evaluate ORIC-114 for the treatment of patients with first-line, treatment-naïve EGFR exon 20 NSCLC Expect to report updated Phase 1b data in the first half of 2025 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. and SAN DIEGO, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ORIC), a clinical stage oncology company focused on developing treatments that address mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, today announced the completion of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-114 in patients with advanced solid tumors with EGFR and HER2 exon 20 alterations or HER2 amplifications. Based upon these data, ORIC selected the two provisional recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) levels of ORIC-114 at 80 mg and 120 mg QD, which are being further evaluated in three dose expansion cohorts for dose optimization and final RP2D selection. These expansion cohorts have now been initiated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 (EGFR exon 20 inhibitor naïve), HER2 exon 20, or EGFR atypical mutations. The company also announced the initiation of an extension cohort for the treatment of patients with first-line, treatment-naïve EGFR exon 20 NSCLC. “Following the positive dose escalation data reported at ESMO 2023, we are excited to announce the advancement of ORIC-114 into Phase 1b dose expansion,” said Pratik Multani, M.D., chief medical officer of ORIC. “Encouraging findings from the Phase 1b dose escalation phase of the trial demonstrated a potential best-in-class profile for ORIC-114, with notable systemic responses and CNS responses, as well as a favorable safety profile, in heavily pre-treated patients. Based on these results, we have identified the two dose levels that we are now advancing into Phase 1b expansion cohorts to determine the final RP2D for further development, including potential registrational cohorts. At the request of many of our investigators and because of the lack of other CNS-active agents against EGFR exon 20, we are also extending our trial to include a cohort evaluating first-line, treatment-naïve NSCLC. We are hopeful that the expansion portion of the trial will validate and build upon the encouraging efficacy seen in the dose escalation, and plan to report results in the first half of 2025.” The Phase 1b dose escalation part of the trial evaluated ORIC-114 in patients with advanced solid tumors with EGFR and HER2 exon 20 alterations or HER2 amplifications. Patients previously treated with an exon 20 targeted agent were eligible, including patients with CNS metastases that were either treated or untreated but asymptomatic. Nearly all other clinical trials with EGFR exon 20 inhibitors severely restricted the eligible patient population and excluded patients with active or untreated brain metastases and patients previously treated with an EGFR exon 20 inhibitor. The primary objectives were to determine the provisional RP2D, and additional objectives included characterization of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and preliminary antitumor activity. The Phase 1b expansion portion of the trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of ORIC-114 at the provisional RP2D levels of 80 mg and 120 mg QD in patients with mutated NSCLC, including EGFR exon 20 (EGFR exon 20 inhibitor naïve), HER2 exon 20, and EGFR atypical mutations. The primary objectives are to determine the RP2D, and additional objectives include assessment of efficacy in terms of objective response rate, duration of response and progression-free survival, including intracranial activity, as well as further characterization of the safety profile of ORIC-114. About ORIC-114ORIC-114 is a highly selective, brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with high potency against exon 20 insertion mutations, making it a promising therapeutic candidate to address the unmet medical need of having both meaningful systemic as well as CNS antitumor activity. About ORIC Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ORIC Pharmaceuticals is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patients’ lives by Overcoming Resistance In Cancer.

This funding will support the development of an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for retinal diseases in the US and the EU. Positive Outlook Therapeutics secures $5.0 million in upfront gross proceeds from a private placement with Syntone Ventures, The company has the potential to receive an additional $8 million upon full cash exercise of warrants issued in the private placement. Funding will aid in the development of an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for retinal diseases in the US and the EU. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of a $5.0 million private placement for Outlook Therapeutics signifies an infusion of capital that is essential for the company’s operational and developmental strategies, particularly as it seeks approval for an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab. It's important for investors to note that private placement often comes with less regulatory scrutiny compared to public offerings, potentially making it a quicker route for fundraising, though it may also suggest a certain level of sophistication or confidence from the investing party, in this case, Syntone Ventures.For retail investors, the noteworthy aspect here is the issuance of warrants alongside common stock, which indicates a possible future share dilution, should these warrants be exercised for up to an additional $8 million. However, it does align interests between the company and investors, as warrants are valuable only if the company's stock price appreciates. Overall, while this does provide immediate working capital, the long-term impact on shareholder value will depend on how effectively the funds are deployed and whether the company achieves its regulatory milestones. Medical Research Analyst When evaluating the impact of this transaction within the biopharmaceutical industry, it's important to understand the significance of the drug involved. Bevacizumab is widely used in cancer treatment but repurposing it for ophthalmic use requires rigorous clinical trials and regulatory approval. The capital raised here is likely earmarked for such endeavors. From a medical standpoint, the success of such a formulation could mean a new, potentially more affordable treatment option for retinal diseases.Should Outlook Therapeutics succeed in getting approval, they would be tapping into a significant market, increasing their value proposition. However, investors should be aware of the risks inherent in drug development, including potential clinical trial failures or regulatory rejections, which could adversely affect the company’s financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Outlook Therapeutics' position in the competitive landscape of the ophthalmology sector could be strengthened by this capital raise. The additional funding may bolster their ability to reach the market faster and sustain the costs associated with the final stages of drug approval. Market trends show a growing demand for innovative ophthalmic treatments, driven by an aging population and rising prevalence of retinal diseases.Investors should consider that the company's future market share will be influenced by the efficacy and safety profile of their product compared to existing treatments. It's also worth noting that the biotech sector is subject to high volatility based on such news and the company's stock may see increased trading volumes and price sensitivity in the short term following this announcement. 04/15/2024 - 04:15 PM ISELIN, N.J., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: OTLK), a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve the first approval for an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of retinal diseases in the US and the EU, today announced that it has closed its previously announced private placement with Syntone Ventures, LLC, an existing stockholder, for upfront gross proceeds of approximately $5.0 million from the issuance and sale of shares of the Company’s common stock and accompanying warrants, before deducting offering expenses. In addition, Outlook Therapeutics has the potential to receive additional gross proceeds of up to $8 million upon the full cash exercise of the warrants issued in the private placement, before deducting offering expenses. About the Private Placement Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement entered into on January 24, 2024, Outlook Therapeutics issued to Syntone an aggregate of 714,286 shares of common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,071,429 shares of common stock, at a price of $7.00 per share and accompanying warrant to purchase one and one-half shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $7.70 per share and are exercisable only for cash until their expiration on the fifth anniversary of the issuance date. The warrants include a feature that allows Outlook Therapeutics to require Syntone to cash exercise the warrants if certain stock price and milestone conditions are met. All of the securities in the private placement were offered by the Company. Outlook Therapeutics intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement to fund its ONS-5010 clinical development programs, including the ongoing NORSE EIGHT clinical trial, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As previously disclosed, Outlook Therapeutics also entered into, and received proceeds from, a securities purchase agreement with Great Point Partners, LLC, GMS Ventures, and other investors to purchase $60 million in shares of common stock and warrants on substantially the same terms as the private placement. The offer and sale of the foregoing securities were made by Outlook Therapeutics in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and such securities have not been registered under the Act or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and such applicable state securities laws. Outlook Therapeutics has agreed to file a resale registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of registering the resale of the common stock issued or issuable in connection with the private placement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. About ONS-5010 / LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. Because no FDA or European Commission approved ophthalmic formulations of bevacizumab are available currently, clinicians wishing to treat retinal patients with bevacizumab have had to use repackaged IV bevacizumab provided by compounding pharmacies—products that have known risks of contamination and inconsistent potency and availability. If approved, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ would provide an approved option for physicians to treat wet AMD. Bevacizumab-vikg/bevacizumab gamma is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively binds with high affinity to all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of the binding of VEGF to its receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Following intravitreal injection, the binding of bevacizumab-vikg to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation in the retina. About Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Outlook Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve FDA and European Commission approval for the launch of ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg or bevacizumab gamma) as the first approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications, including wet AMD, DME and BRVO. If ONS-5010 ophthalmic bevacizumab is approved, Outlook Therapeutics expects to commercialize it as the first and only FDA and/or EC approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in treating retinal diseases in the United States, EU, United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, and other markets. As part of the Outlook Therapeutics' multi-year commercial planning process, Outlook Therapeutics and Cencora entered into a strategic commercialization agreement to expand the Outlook Therapeutics’ reach for connecting to retina specialists and their patients. Cencora will provide third-party logistics (3PL) services and distribution, as well as pharmacovigilance services and other services in the United States.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent release of ArrowMark Financial Corp.'s estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) provides a snapshot into the company's financial state as of late March. NAV, which is the total value of a firm's assets minus its liabilities, is a important metric for closed-end funds like BANX. Although this figure is unaudited and not a full financial statement, it can influence investor sentiment, as it reflects the value of their investments. The reported NAV of $21.24 could signal to investors how the company's investments have performed, which is especially relevant in market conditions subject to volatility. It's important to note that changes in NAV can result from both market movements and the firm's managerial decisions, such as asset allocation and cost management. Market Research Analyst To understand the potential impact of ArrowMark Financial Corp.'s NAV disclosure on their stock, one must consider the broader market context. NAV figures for investment firms like ArrowMark are closely monitored, as they can provide early signals about the direction of the firm's investment performance, especially when other financial data isn't available. Investors tend to benchmark the released NAV against industry averages and historical performance. A disparity between expected and reported NAV can lead to market reactions. However, without comparative figures from previous months or additional context, it's challenging to assess the full significance of the reported NAV on its own. 04/15/2024 - 06:30 PM DENVER, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArrowMark Financial Corp., (NASDAQ: BANX) (""ArrowMark Financial""), today announced that BANX’s estimated and unaudited Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as of March 28, 2024, was $21.24.

Financial Analyst Naturally, investors are inclined to fixate on revenue growth and net loss reduction as key indicators of a company's performance. In the case of Novo Integrated Sciences, the reported 24% increase in revenue suggests robust sales activity, potentially leading to greater market share. This uptick, when dissected, appears primarily driven by product sales, which could imply successful product development or enhanced market penetration strategies. Furthermore, the conversion of debt to equity, as seen with the Mast Hill Fund promissory note, may alleviate short-term liquidity pressures, yet dilutes current stockholders' equity. However, the 41% decrease in net loss requires a more nuanced examination. A shrinking net loss, while ostensibly positive, needs to be contextualized against the backdrop of operational efficiencies and cost-saving measures. The critical question for shareholders is whether this decrease is due to sustainable operational improvements or one-time gains. Long-term viability hinges on the former. Market Research Analyst Investors should consider the competitive landscape and the company's ability to sustain its growth trajectory. Novo's emphasis on a holistic healthcare ecosystem and its patient-first approach can be compelling differentiators in the healthcare services industry. Yet, the modest 3.4% increase in healthcare services revenue—despite the overall rise in total revenue—might signal slower growth in this core area, which warrants scrutiny. Furthermore, the strategic move to work with financial partners on non-traditional financing might position Novo for accelerated growth, but also raises questions about potential financing terms and future financial flexibility. Stakeholders should weigh the potential for increased financial leverage against the opportunity for expansion. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the conversion of debt to equity, as seen with Novo's promissory note, often raises questions on corporate governance and investor rights. Existing investors might be concerned about the dilution of their shares, impacting their voting power and share value. The terms of such conversions, including the pricing of converted shares, should be meticulously reviewed for fairness and compliance with market regulations. This action also has implications for the company's capital structure, potentially affecting future borrowing capacity and strategic financial decisions. 04/15/2024 - 04:30 PM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVOS) (the “Company” or “Novo”), pioneering a holistic approach to patient-first health and wellness through a multidisciplinary healthcare ecosystem of multiple patient and consumer touchpoints for services and product innovation, today reported its financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2024. Robert Mattacchione, Novo’s CEO and Board Chairman, stated, “The Company’s fiscal year 2024 second quarter period emphasized maximizing operational efficiencies pointed towards future cost savings and margin improvement. The Company continues to work with certain prospective financial partners to close previously announced non-traditional financing opportunities to raise foundational capital with repayment terms necessary to support and accelerate the further growth of Novo’s three-pillar business model. The Company remains committed to the commercialization of its proprietary product offerings and the expansion and delivery of its essential services and solutions for how non-catastrophic healthcare is delivered both now and in the future.” Financial Highlights for the three-month period ended February 29, 2024: Cash and cash equivalents were $651,747, total assets were $34,949,271, total liabilities were $13,058,987, and stockholders’ equity was $21,890,284. Revenues were $3,170,592, representing an increase of $614,083, or 24%, from $2,556,509 for the three months ended February 28, 2023. The increase in revenue is principally due to an increase in product sales. Acenzia’s and Terragenx’s revenue for the three months ended February 29, 2024 were $884,396 and $103,399, respectively. Revenue from our healthcare services increased by 3.4% when comparing the revenue for the three months ended February 29, 2024 to the three months ended February 28, 2023. Operating costs were $2,863,854, representing an increase of $106,141, or 4%, from $2,757,713 for the three months ended February 28, 2023. The increase in operating costs was principally due to higher fair value of stock options issued during the three months. Net loss attributed to the Company for the three months ended February 29, 2024 was $2,746,128, representing a decrease of $1,875,227, or 41%, from $4,621,355 for the three months ended February 28, 2023. The decrease in net loss was principally due to the increase in gross profit and lower amount of other expenses. On December 21, 2023, the total principal and interest of $449,535 owed on the $445,000 Mast Hill Fund, LP promissory note, dated June 20, 2023, was converted to 457,128 shares of the Company’s common stock and paid in full. About Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. is pioneering a holistic approach to patient-first health and wellness through a multidisciplinary healthcare ecosystem of services and product innovation. Novo offers an essential and differentiated solution to deliver, or intend to deliver, these services and products through the integration of medical technology, advanced therapeutics, and rehabilitative science. We believe that “decentralizing” healthcare, through the integration of medical technology and interconnectivity, is an essential solution to the rapidly evolving fundamental transformation of how non-catastrophic healthcare is delivered both now and in the future. Specific to non-critical care, ongoing advancements in both medical technology and inter-connectivity are allowing for a shift of the patient/practitioner relationship to the patient’s home and away from on-site visits to primary medical centers with mass-services. This acceleration of “ease-of-access” in the patient/practitioner interaction for non-critical care diagnosis and subsequent treatment minimizes the degradation of non-critical health conditions to critical conditions as well as allowing for more cost-effective healthcare distribution. The Company’s decentralized healthcare business model is centered on three primary pillars to best support the transformation of non-catastrophic healthcare delivery to patients and consumers: First Pillar: Service Networks. Deliver multidisciplinary primary care services through (i) an affiliate network of clinic facilities, (ii) small and micro footprint sized clinic facilities primarily located within the footprint of box-store commercial enterprises, (iii) clinic facilities operated through a franchise relationship with the Company, and (iv) corporate operated clinic facilities. Second Pillar: Technology. Develop, deploy, and integrate sophisticated interconnected technology, interfacing the patient to the healthcare practitioner thus expanding the reach and availability of the Company’s services, beyond the traditional clinic location, to geographic areas not readily providing advanced, peripheral based healthcare services, including the patient’s home. Third Pillar: Products. Develop and distribute effective, personalized health and wellness product solutions allowing for the customization of patient preventative care remedies and ultimately a healthier population. The Company’s science-first approach to product innovation further emphasizes our mandate to create and provide over-the-counter preventative and maintenance care solutions. Innovation through science combined with the integration of sophisticated, secure technology assures Novo Integrated Sciences of continued cutting-edge advancement in patient-first platforms.

The offering includes an option for the underwriter to purchase additional shares, subject to market conditions.","RYVYL Inc. Announces Launch of Proposed Underwritten Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary RYVYL Inc. announces the launch of a proposed underwritten public offering to raise capital for working capital and general corporate purposes. The offering includes an option for the underwriter to purchase additional shares, subject to market conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst RYVYL Inc.'s announcement on the initiation of an underwritten public offering of common stock is a strategic move to raise capital. The decision to grant the underwriter an option to purchase additional shares could potentially increase the total capital raised by up to 15%. This could suggest confidence from the underwriter in the company's market value and prospects. Investors should note that the use of the net proceeds for 'working capital and general corporate purposes' is quite broad and may indicate either a buffer for operational expenses or funding for upcoming projects that are not yet disclosed.The execution of the offering under a previously filed shelf registration statement expedites the process, providing flexibility to the company in timing the market. The effectiveness of the shelf registration allows a more immediate response to market conditions, which could be advantageous in a volatile market environment. The role of Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC, a relatively less known firm, as the sole book-running manager, might indicate a targeted approach for the offering, which could aim to attract specific institutional investors or investment communities. Market Research Analyst The involvement of blockchain ledger and electronic token technology in RYVYL's product offerings positions the company within two high-growth potential sectors: fintech and blockchain. Given the market trends, investors are showing increased interest in companies at the intersection of these technologies due to their disruptive potential. However, the inherent volatility of blockchain-related markets could influence the risk profile of the investment. Prospective investors should consider current market sentiment towards blockchain technologies, regulatory outlook and the competitive landscape when evaluating this offering.The offering's success will likely depend on the market's perception of RYVYL's prospects and its current financial health, as well as the broader market conditions. A successful capital raise could signal market confidence in the company's growth trajectory, potentially impacting the stock positively in the short term. Long-term effects, however, will hinge on how effectively RYVYL deploys the capital towards revenue-generating initiatives. Legal Expert The fact that RYVYL is proceeding with an underwritten public offering under a shelf registration statement indicates their legal preparedness to access public markets swiftly. This move shows regulatory diligence, as the offering is contingent upon the legal framework set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. An effective shelf registration has a validity of three years, allowing companies like RYVYL to act opportunistically. The details provided in the preliminary prospectus supplement are critical for investors, as they include risk factors, management's discussion and analysis and financial statements, which are key for informed decision-making.It is important for investors to review these legal documents to understand the specifics of the offering, including potential dilution, the company's strategic direction and the rights that will come with the securities being offered. The legal structure of the offering and the conditions set forth may also impact the stock's performance, as they determine how new shares will integrate with the existing capital structure. 04/15/2024 - 04:27 PM San Diego, CA, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RYVYL Inc. (NASDAQ: RVYL) (""RYVYL"" or the ""Company""), a leading innovator of payment transaction solutions leveraging proprietary blockchain ledger and electronic token technology for the diverse international markets, today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock.

In addition, RYVYL intends to grant the underwriter in the offering a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 15% of the number of shares of common stock offered in the offering at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The offering is subject to market and other conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering. RYVYL intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. A shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File Nos. 333-257798) relating to the securities being offered was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 9, 2021 and became effective on July 19, 2021. The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus that form a part of the shelf registration statement. A preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the proposed offering have been filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC's website, located at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, copies of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus may be obtained, when available, from Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC, Attn: Syndicate Department, 40 Wall Street, Suite 3004, New York, NY 10005, by calling (212) 440-9600.

The company plans to host an Investor Day in Fall 2024 to present a comprehensive strategic plan.

Financial Analyst Gildan Activewear's announcement encompasses several essential points that investors should consider. Firstly, the reconfirmation of 2024 full year guidance suggests a confident outlook by the management, indicating stability and potential predictability in the company's financial performance. Given the volatile market conditions, this could be seen as a positive indicator of management's belief in the company's resilience and strategic plan execution. The focus on supply chain initiatives and maintaining industry-leading margins is particularly noteworthy. This implies an emphasis on operational efficiency which is important for maintaining profitability, especially in the competitive apparel industry where margins are often thin. Investors would do well to closely monitor future announcements that detail these initiatives for their potential to enhance the company's cost leadership and impact on share price. Lastly, the mention of capital expenditures as a percentage of sales being maintained indicates disciplined capital management. This is an essential metric for investors as it can affect the company's free cash flow, which is a key determinant of dividend payments and share buybacks. Market Research Analyst From a marketing perspective, the strategic priorities outlined by CEO Vince Tyra reflect a proactive approach to growth and brand differentiation. The intention to deepen relationships with retail partners and to leverage unique brands suggests that Gildan is aiming to strengthen its competitive moat. Investors should appreciate strategies that potentially increase customer loyalty and create barriers to entry for competitors. Additionally, expanding into select international markets could open up new revenue streams, which is vital for long-term growth. However, it's essential to evaluate how well Gildan can adapt its business strategy to varying international market conditions and consumer preferences. Success in these endeavors could positively impact the company's stock performance, provided execution is handled effectively and aligns with global market trends. Human Resources Analyst The emphasis on empowering and building world-class talent is a forward-looking component of Gildan's strategic priorities. Human capital is a significant driver of innovation and operational success in the apparel industry. By focusing on leadership and talent development, Gildan could enhance its adaptive capacity and innovation potential. For investors, this could translate into improved corporate governance and a more agile response to industry challenges, supporting sustained growth and potentially leading to increased shareholder value over the long term. 04/15/2024 - 04:18 PM Company Reconfirms 2024 Full Year GuidanceAnnounces Preliminary Q1 2024 RevenueCompany to Host Investor Day in Fall 2024 MONTREAL, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL; TSX and NYSE) today announced that its President and CEO, Vince Tyra has unveiled his key focus strategic priorities. Concurrently, the Company also reconfirmed its 2024 full year guidance and announced preliminary Q1 revenue. Furthermore, the Company intends to hold an Investor Day in the Fall of 2024 to provide a comprehensive strategic plan. Reflecting on his first 90 days, Vince Tyra said, “I’m excited to be leading Gildan at this pivotal time. Having completed 90 days at the helm of Gildan, I wanted to share with you my key focus strategic priorities and articulate how we can leverage our strengths and accelerate value creation for all stakeholders. Importantly, these priorities reflect feedback received from shareholders and their desire for us to continue sustainably growing Gildan. As we continue to execute on the key components of the Gildan Sustainable Growth strategy, my first few months as CEO have confirmed my belief that Gildan’s core fundamentals are strong and that we are in a great position to unlock further potential and launch the next phase of our growth. My management team and I will continue to review the business and we look forward to presenting a fuller view at an Investor Day this Fall.” With its three key pillars, Growth, Innovation, and ESG, the Gildan Sustainable Growth (GSG) strategy has set the foundation for the Company’s future. Capitalizing on this strong foundation and the continued execution of the GSG plan which remains core to Gildan’s business, today Vince Tyra outlined his key focus strategic priorities to unlock further growth potential while amplifying the Company’s commercial capabilities. These five key priorities are: Successfully execute supply chain initiatives to maintain availability, cost leadership and industry leading margins;Leverage Gildan’s unique brands and develop distinct commercial capabilities to accelerate growth and strengthen the Company’s market position;Deepen Gildan’s relationships with existing and prospective retail partners, strengthening the Company’s position as the supplier of choice;Complement Gildan’s strong North American market position with renewed focus on select international markets to drive growth; andEmpower and build world-class talent and leadership to ensure long term resilience of Gildan’s business. Medium-term Targets Assuming no deterioration in the current macroeconomic environment, Gildan is confident that the targeted priorities will position the Company to continue to drive market share gains in key product categories, unlock further opportunities in targeted markets and deliver on key financial metrics over the 2025-2028 period, reflecting the following: Net sales growth at a compound annual growth rate in the mid-single digits rangeAnnual adjusted operating margin(1) in the range of 18% to 21%Capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of sales of about 5% per year, on average, to support long-term growth and vertical integrationAdjusted diluted EPS(2) growth per annum in the high-single to low double-digit range Gildan expects to maintain its capital allocation priorities which, beyond planned capex deployment, focus on annual dividend growth, continued share repurchases now in line with a leverage framework of 1.5x to 2x, and value accretive M&A. The combination of the above is expected to drive strong shareholder returns. 2024 Outlook and preliminary Q1 2024 revenue Gildan today reconfirmed its 2024 full year guidance as announced on February 21, 2024 in its Q4 2023 press release as well as the assumptions underpinning this guidance: Revenue growth for the full year to be flat to up low-single digits;Adjusted operating margin(1) slightly above the high end of the 18% to 20% annual target range. This compares to fiscal 2023 adjusted operating margin of 17.3%; fiscal 2023 operating margin was 20.1%.Capex to come in at approximately 5% of sales;Adjusted diluted EPS(2) in the range of $2.92 to $3.07, up significantly between 13.5% and 19.5% year over year. This compares to 2023 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.57; fiscal 2023 GAAP diluted EPS was $3.03;Free cash flow above 2023 levels driven by increased profitability, lower working capital investments and lower capital expenditures than in 2023. In addition, Gildan today announced that its preliminary Q1 2024 net sales are expected to come in at approximately $695 million, or down about 1% year over year, as previewed in our Q4 2023 press release. The above outlook as well as the medium-term targets assume no meaningful deterioration from current market conditions including the pricing and inflationary environment, and no further deterioration in geopolitical environments. They reflect reasonable industry growth and expected market share gains. Though the timing of the potential enactment of legislation remains uncertain, we have also incorporated the estimated impact of the implementation of draft Global Minimum Tax legislation in Canada and Barbados on our effective tax rate, retroactive to January 1, 2024, as well as certain refundable tax credits expected. In addition, they reflect Gildan’s expectations as of April 15, 2024 and are subject to significant risks and business uncertainties, including those factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” in this press release and the annual MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and RatiosThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). However, we use non-GAAP financial measures and ratios to assess our operating performance and liquidity. Securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earnings and other measures adjusted to a basis other than IFRS do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation. In this press release, we use non-GAAP financial ratios, including adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, to measure our performance and financial condition from one period to the next, which excludes the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our operating performance, and because we believe such measures provide meaningful information to investors on the Company’s financial performance and financial condition. We refer the reader to section 16.0 of the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“FY2023 MD&A”) entitled “Definition and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures”, which section is incorporated by reference into this press release, filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company’s website at www.gildancorp.com under the “Investors” section, for the definition and complete reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used and presented by the Company to the most directly comparable IFRS measures. (1) Adjusted operating margin: Adjusted operating income is calculated as operating income before restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Adjusted operating income also excludes impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiatives, net insurance gains, gain on sale and leaseback (new in 2023) and CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023). Adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales, excluding the sales return allowance for anticipated product returns related to discontinued SKUs. Further details, including an explanation of the composition and usefulness of this ratio, as well as a calculation of this ratio, are provided at section 16.0 of the FY2023 MD&A, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, which section is incorporated by reference into this press release. (2) Adjusted diluted EPS: Adjusted net earnings are calculated as net earnings before restructuring and acquisition-related costs, Impairment (impairment reversal) of intangible assets, net of write-downs, the impact of the Company's strategic product line initiatives, net insurance gains, gain on sale and leaseback (new in 2023), CEO separation costs and related advisory fees on shareholder matters (new in 2023), and income tax expense or recovery relating to these items. Adjusted net earnings also excludes income taxes related to the re-assessment of the probability of realization of previously recognized or de-recognized deferred income tax assets, and income taxes relating to the revaluation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of statutory income tax rate changes in the countries in which we operate. Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated as adjusted net earnings divided by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Further details, including an explanation of the composition and usefulness of this ratio, as well as a calculation of this ratio, are provided at section 16.0 of the FY2023 MD&A, available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca, which section is incorporated by reference into this press release.

The oversubscribed facility maintains the pricing spread from the prior one while enhancing the financial covenant package. The credit facility matures on April 15, 2028, with expansion options and an accordion feature to increase to $900 million. The successful execution signifies strong support from capital providers, providing capital and flexibility for growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Acadia Realty Trust's expansion of their credit facility by $50 million and the extension of the maturity date suggests a strategic move to bolster financial flexibility. This oversubscribed credit facility, retaining prior pricing spread, indicates strong lender confidence in the company's creditworthiness. The financial covenant improvements should provide Acadia with enhanced terms that may contribute to more favorable debt management and potential for strategic investments.The accordion feature, which can potentially increase the facility up to $900 million, underscores additional liquidity that is available if needed. This could be instrumental in pursuing growth opportunities that are accretive, meaning they have the potential to increase earnings per share. Investors could view this access to capital positively, as it reflects the company's proactive approach to managing its capital structure in a potentially accretive manner. Real Estate Market Analyst In the context of commercial real estate, Acadia's expanded credit aligns with the industry trend of real estate investment trusts (REITs) securing flexible financing to navigate market conditions. Considering Acadia's focus on retail and mixed-use properties, the credit facility's terms could support the REIT in optimizing its portfolio in response to the evolving retail landscape. The term 'accruing external growth' often signifies strategic property acquisitions or developments that can enhance a REIT's portfolio quality and rental income streams.The timing of this credit facility also reflects strategic financial planning, as the extension grants the company a longer runway to execute its growth strategies amidst economic uncertainties. As a result, the ability to potentially expand the facility may serve as a buffer against liquidity constraints, enabling Acadia to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise. 04/15/2024 - 06:13 PM RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acadia Realty Trust (NYSE: AKR) (the “Company”) announced today that it closed on a $750 million amended and restated credit facility, which replaces and extends the Company’s existing $700 million credit facility.

Roth CH Acquisition Co. Announces Voluntary Delisting From Nasdaq,2024-04-15T22:08:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Roth CH Acquisition Co. (USCT) has decided to voluntarily delist its Class A Ordinary Shares, Units, and Warrants from the Nasdaq Global Market, filing a Form 25 with the SEC for removal.","Roth CH Acquisition Co. Announces Voluntary Delisting From Nasdaq Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Roth CH Acquisition Co. (USCT) has decided to voluntarily delist its Class A Ordinary Shares, Units, and Warrants from the Nasdaq Global Market, filing a Form 25 with the SEC for removal. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision of Roth CH Acquisition Co. to delist from Nasdaq is a significant move that can have multiple implications. Firstly, it can indicate a strategic pivot away from public markets, possibly due to the costs and regulatory requirements associated with maintaining a Nasdaq listing. Investors should consider the company's reasons for delisting, as it may affect the liquidity and marketability of the shares. Furthermore, the voluntary delisting typically precedes a move to over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where there is generally less visibility and regulatory oversight, potentially impacting the stock's volatility and investor interest.Another aspect to consider is the timing and manner of the announcement, which can often signal management's confidence in the operation outside of the stringent requirements of larger exchanges. The use of a Form 25 to officially commence the delisting process will lead to the cessation of trading on the exchange, which is a move that typically leads to a shift in the shareholder base. Retail investors, in particular, may find it more challenging to trade the shares if the stock moves to a less accessible market. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Roth CH Acquisition Co.'s delisting could reflect broader market trends or sector-specific issues. It's important to analyze the performance of similar companies and the overall health of the sector. If the delisting is an isolated event, it may not significantly impact the market. However, if it's part of a larger trend of companies retreating from public markets, it could signal a shift in the corporate finance landscape. Investors need to stay informed about these market dynamics as they may influence investment strategies and the perception of public equity markets. 04/15/2024 - 06:08 PM MIAMI BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Roth CH Acquisition Co. (Nasdaq: “USCT”) (""we"", ""us"", ""our"", or the ""Company""), today announced that it has notified the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) of its decision to voluntarily delist its Class A Ordinary Shares, Units and Warrants exercisable for one Class A Ordinary Share at an exercise price of $11.50 from the Nasdaq Global Market. The Company intends to file a Form 25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to remove its Class A Ordinary Shares, Units, and Warrants from listing on the Nasdaq Global Market on or about April 25, 2024 and as a result, the delisting is expected to become effective on or about April 25, 2024. The Company will remain subject to such reporting obligations under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. As previously noted in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 16, 2023, the Company had received written notice from Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(2), which requires the Company to have at least 400 shareholders for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market. Additionally, as previously disclosed in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 29, 2024, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5620(a), which requires that Nasdaq-listed companies hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of their fiscal year end because the Company did not hold an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of its fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Following the delisting, the Company expects to have its Class A Ordinary Shares, Units, and Warrants quoted on a market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTC”) so that a trading market may continue to exist for such securities. There is no guarantee, however, that a broker will continue to make a market in the Company’s Class A Ordinary Shares, Units, and Warrants and that trading thereof will continue on an OTC market or otherwise.

Reports Second Quarter Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Platinum Group Metals reports second quarter financial results for the six months ended February 29, 2024, focusing on advancing the Waterberg Project and collaboration with Lion Battery Technologies Inc. The Company also announces a Cooperation Agreement with Ajlan & Bros Mining and Metals Co. to study a PGM smelter and base metal refinery in Saudi Arabia. Positive Platinum Group Metals reports a net loss of $2.37 million for the six months ended February 29, 2024, with lower general and administrative expenses and stock-based compensation compared to the previous period. The Company entered into a Cooperation Agreement with Ajlan & Bros Mining and Metals Co. to study the establishment of a PGM smelter and base metal refinery in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on global PGM concentrate sources and potential joint venture formation. Platinum Group Metals continues to advance the Waterberg Project, with recent budget approvals and ongoing work programs to reach a development and construction decision, including concentrate offtake agreements. The Company's collaboration with Lion Battery Technologies Inc. aims to develop next-generation platinum and palladium-based battery chemistries, with a focus on lithium-sulfur and enhanced lithium-ion technology to improve battery performance and specific energies. Platinum Group Metals received its third annual Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure report from Digbee , achieving an overall score of BBB for 2023, indicating improvement in ESG performance. The Company's financial results for the six months ended February 29, 2024, reflect a focus on cost management and strategic partnerships to advance the Waterberg Project and explore new opportunities in battery technology and PGM processing. Negative None. Financial Analyst The key figure here is the company's reported net loss of $2.37 million for the six months ended February 29, 2024, which, while still a loss, is an improvement from the $2.81 million loss over the similar period in 2023. Operational expenditures have seen a decrease, with general and administrative expenses and stock based compensation both falling. These reductions suggest management's effective cost control measures during the period. The cash and financing position of the company also warrants attention. An at-the-market equity program was established, though no new shares have been sold in fiscal 2024 so far. The company's equity raise in a private placement suggests that liquidity needs are being actively managed, which is a sign of responsive corporate strategy.From an investor's perspective, these financials reflect a company in a capital-intensive phase, with key infrastructural and expansion plans in progress which could potentially affect future earnings positively. As such, the company's ability to manage their expenditures while progressing on strategic initiatives around the Waterberg Project and their battery technology initiative is commendable. Mining Industry Analyst The updated outlook on the Waterberg Project indicates a transition phase from exploration and design to seeking arrangements for project concentrate offtake or processing. This phase is crucial, as it will determine the future revenue streams and the project's viability. The company's move to assess the feasibility of constructing a PGM Smelter and Base Metals Refinery in Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with Ajlan, signals strategic thinking to reduce dependency on a single project's success by potentially capitalizing on lower operational costs in another region.Another point to note is the potential dilution of Implats' interest in the Waterberg JV, which suggests shifting dynamics within the joint venture partnership. While the immediate financial implications are unclear, this could alter the power balance and decision-making within the JV, potentially impacting the project's progression.For retail investors, it's important to recognize that the exploration results from borehole WE153 highlight the potential for resource expansion. This is potentially positive as it can add to the project's overall resources, however, it also indicates that the company remains in an investment phase with associated risks and without immediate revenues from these activities. Renewable Energy and Battery Technology Analyst The industry is closely watching the battery technology initiative through Lion Battery Technologies Inc., given the increasing importance of energy storage solutions. The advancement of proprietary lithium-sulfur and enhanced lithium-ion technology using platinum and palladium could position the company to tap into a high growth market segment. As electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions gain traction globally, having a proprietary technology in the energy storage space could provide diversified revenue streams and increase the company's appeal to forward-looking investors.However, this area is highly competitive, with significant R&D costs and a long path to commercialization. Investors should weigh the potential long-term benefits against current financial costs and the technological development risks inherent in such initiatives.Collaborations with entities like BIC for commercialization efforts and with FIU for research development could mitigate some of these risks through sharing expertise and possibly expenses, but the payoff for these investments is yet to be determined and likely on a longer-term horizon. 04/15/2024 - 05:30 PM Vancouver, British Columbia and Johannesburg, South Africa--(Newsfile Corp. - April 15, 2024) - Platinum Group Metals Ltd. (TSX: PTM) (NYSE American: PLG) (""Platinum Group"", ""PTM"" or the ""Company"") reports the Company's financial results for the six months ended February 29, 2024, and provides an update and outlook. The Company is focused on advancing the Waterberg Project located on the Northern Limb of the Bushveld Complex in South Africa (the ""Waterberg Project""). The Waterberg Project is planned as a fully mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium (""4E"") mine and is projected to be one of the largest and lowest cost underground platinum group metals (""PGM"" or ""PGMs"") mines globally.The Company's near-term objectives are to advance the Waterberg Project to a development and construction decision including the arrangement of construction financing and concentrate offtake agreements. The Company is also advancing an initiative through Lion Battery Technologies Inc. (""Lion"") using platinum and palladium in lithium battery technologies in collaboration with Anglo American Platinum Limited (""Amplats"") and Florida International University (""FIU""). For details of the consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended February 19, 2024 (the ""Financial Statements"") and Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") for the six months ended February 29, 2024 please see the Company's filings on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) or on EDGAR (www.sec.gov).

Changes in exchange rates may create variances in the cash holdings or results reported.Recent EventsOn April 3, 2024, the directors and shareholders of Waterberg JV Resources (Pty) Ltd. (""Waterberg JV Co."") approved a $1.35 million stage four budget (the ""Stage Four Budget"") to allow the continuation of work programs underway while the update to the DFS Update (as defined below) is finalized. The Stage Four Budget, covering the period from March 2024 to approximately August 2024, is a subcomponent of a two year, $21.0 million pre-construction work program (the ""Work Program"") approved for the Waterberg Project by the directors and shareholders of Waterberg JV Co. on October 18, 2022.On December 20, 2023, the Company announced a Cooperation Agreement (the ""Cooperation Agreement"") with Ajlan & Bros Mining and Metals Co. (""Ajlan"") to study the establishment of a stand-alone PGM smelter (""PGM Smelter"") and base metal refinery (""BMR"") in Saudi Arabia. Ajlan is a subsidiary of Ajlan & Bros Holdings, one of the largest private sector diversified conglomerates in the Middle East. The Cooperation Agreement encompasses three phases: a global PGM concentrate market study (the ""Market Study""), a Definitive Feasibility Study for the construction and operation of the PGM Smelter and BMR in Saudi Arabia (the ""Smelter DFS""), and an option to form an incorporated 50:50 joint venture following the completion of the Smelter DFS. The Market Study will seek to identify potential global sources of PGM concentrate that could augment the processing of the Waterberg Project concentrate in Saudi Arabia and minimize the risk of sourcing concentrate from only one project.Upon the completion of the Market Study, and assuming a favourable outcome, Ajlan and the Company may together commission the Smelter DFS at an estimated cost for the study of approximately US$4.0 million. The Smelter DFS will assume the export of PGM concentrate from the Waterberg Project in South Africa to a port facility in Saudi Arabia and will encompass options related to infrastructure, location, technical specifications, capital, and operating costs. All expenses related to the Smelter DFS are to be split on a 50:50 basis between Platinum Group and Ajlan, including certain costs already incurred by Platinum Group in previous independent beneficiation studies.The Company believes Saudi Arabia offers an attractive investment climate that includes highly competitive energy costs, a lower taxation rate, and significant government financing incentives. An initial trade-off study has been completed to determine the viability of exporting PGM concentrate from South Africa to Saudi Arabia. Shipping costs are generally offset by lower energy costs and water costs. The PGM Smelter and BMR would benefit from existing infrastructure. A key requirement would be to secure a long-term permit for the export from South Africa of unrefined precious metals in concentrate.On December 11, 2023, the directors, and shareholders of Waterberg JV Resources (Pty) Ltd. (""Waterberg JV Co."") unanimously approved a stage three budget of $1.62 million (the ""Stage Three Budget"") for continued work on the Waterberg Project covering the period from September 2023 to approximately February 2024 In conjunction with its approval, Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (""Implats"") advised that due to its own internal cost savings efforts, it would not be funding its 15% share of the Stage Three Budget. As a result, Implats' interest in Waterberg JV Co. will be diluted to approximately 14.951% during the third fiscal quarter of 2024. Shareholders of Waterberg JV Co. have the right to contribute the cash contribution shortfall of any diluting shareholder, pro rata to the aggregate shareholding of all shareholders who elect to fund such shortfall. Platinum Group alone has elected to fund all Implats funding shortfall for the Stage Three Budget. Implats stated they would consider the funding of subsequent cash calls as future circumstances allowed. On September 18, 2023, the Company reported the closing of a non-brokered private placement of common shares at a price of $1.18 per common share. An aggregate of 2,118,645 common shares were subscribed for and issued to existing major beneficial shareholder, Hosken Consolidated Investments Limited (""HCI"") through its subsidiary Deepkloof Limited, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.5 million (the ""Private Placement""). Closing of the Private Placement allowed HCI to return to more than a 26% interest in the Company.On June 21, 2023, the Company reported that Lion Battery Technologies Inc.

The foreign exchange gain recognized in the current period was $.03 million (February 28, 2023 - $0.30 million) due primarily to the to the U.S. Dollar increasing in value relative to the Canadian Dollar during the period. At February 29, 2024, finance income consisting of interest earned in the six month period amounted to $0.25 million (February 28, 2023 - $0.32 million). Basic and diluted loss per share for the year was $0.02, compared to $0.03 for the period ended February 28, 2023. Accounts receivable at February 29, 2024 totalled $0.11 million (August 31, 2023 - $0.22 million) while accounts payable and other liabilities amounted to $0.40 million (August 31, 2023 - $1.37 million). Accounts receivable was comprised primarily of value added taxes repayable to the Company in South Africa. Accounts payable consisted primarily of payables related to project engineering and maintenance costs on the Waterberg Project.On July 27, 2022, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. and BMO Capital Markets for a new at-the-market equity program (the ""2022 ATM"") to distribute up to $50.0 million (or the equivalent in Canadian dollars) of common shares of the Company. No Common Shares were sold pursuant to the 2022 ATM prior to August 31, 2022. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had issued 1,089,503 Common Shares, through BMO Capital Markets on the NYSE American pursuant to the 2022 ATM, at an average price of $1.81, for gross proceeds of $1.97 million. Directly attributable expenses and legal fees to maintain the 2022 ATM in good standing, and for commissions on equity sales, totaled $0.45 million during fiscal 2023. No Common Shares have been sold to date in fiscal 2024 pursuant to the 2022 ATM.Total expenditures on the Waterberg Project, before partner reimbursements, for the six months ended February 29, 2024 were approximately $1.63 million (February 28, 2023 - $2.04 million). At period end, $42.5 million in accumulated net costs were capitalized to the Waterberg Project. Total expenditures on the property since inception to February 29, 2024 are approximately $87.2 million. For more information on mineral properties, see Note 4 of the Financial Statements.OutlookThe Company's primary business objective is to advance the Waterberg Project to a development and construction decision. PTM is the operator of the Waterberg Project as directed by a technical committee comprised of representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo Wethu Consultants Proprietary Limited (""Mnombo""), and HJM. Before project financing and a construction decision can be undertaken, arrangements will be required for project concentrate offtake or processing. On October 18, 2022, Waterberg JV Co. approved in principle the pre-construction Work Program. The Work Program includes proposed work on project infrastructure including initial road access, water supply, essential site facilities, a first phase accommodation lodge, a site construction power supply from state utility Eskom and advancement of the Waterberg Social & Labour Plan. Work to prepare an update to the 2019 Waterberg Definitive Feasibility Study (the ""DFS Update""), including updated mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, was also approved and is currently in process. The DFS Update is to include a review of cut-off grades, mining methods, infrastructure plans, scheduling, concentrate offtake, dry stack tailings, costing and other potential revisions to the project's financial model. The DFS Update is expected to be completed in mid 2024.The Company continues to work closely with regional and local communities and their leadership on mine development plans to achieve optimal outcomes and best value to all stakeholders.Before project financing and a construction decision can be undertaken, arrangements will be required for project concentrate offtake or processing. In addition to seeking reasonable terms for Waterberg concentrate offtake from an existing smelter/refiner in South Africa, the Company must also consider alternatives. As described above, the Company is studying the economic feasibility of constructing a PGM Smelter and BMR to process the Waterberg Project concentrate. As the world seeks to decarbonize and look for solutions to climate change, the adoption of battery electric vehicles is forecast to reduce the future demand for PGMs used in autocatalysis. The unique properties of PGMs as powerful catalysts are being applied to various technologies as possible solutions for more efficient energy generation and storage, which may create new demand for PGMs. The Company's battery technology initiative through Lion with partner Amplats represents one such new opportunity in the high-profile lithium battery research and innovation field. The investment in Lion creates a potential vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy to bring new technologies to market which use palladium and platinum. Research and development efforts by FIU on behalf of Lion continue. Technical results from Lion's research may have application to most lithium-ion battery chemistries and the scope of Lion's research work is being expanded.Environmental, Social and GovernancePlatinum Group recently received its third annual Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") disclosure report from Digbee Ltd.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, INOVIO's capital raise through the stock and pre-funded warrants offering represents a strategic move to bolster the company's balance sheet. The pricing of the shares and warrants suggests a discount compared to the recent market price, which is a common practice to entice investors during capital raises. By securing approximately $36 million before expenses, INOVIO is likely aiming to fund its ongoing research and development activities. Investors should note that such offerings can dilute existing shareholders' stakes, which can have a short-term negative impact on the stock price.However, the capital injection also provides the resources necessary for INOVIO to pursue its clinical programs. The funds raised can accelerate the company's DNA medicine projects, which may have long-term benefits if these products reach the market and are successful. It is imperative for retail investors to assess the potential for dilution against the growth opportunities financed by this capital raise. Biotechnology Market Analyst For those interested in the broader implications, this financing move by INOVIO offers insights into the current state of the biotech sector's funding environment. A funding round of this nature indicates that while INOVIO has a foothold in the development of DNA medicines, the company still requires external capital to sustain its momentum. The biotech sector is known for its high burn rate due to expensive and lengthy R&D processes, making such financial strategies commonplace.With a focus on HPV-related diseases, cancer and infectious diseases, INOVIO is operating in areas with significant unmet medical needs and substantial market potential. Success in these areas could lead to considerable revenue streams in the future. However, investors should be aware of the inherent risks involved with biotechnology investments, including regulatory hurdles and the uncertainty of clinical trial outcomes. Keeping tabs on the company's R&D progress is critical for understanding potential future valuation. 04/15/2024 - 06:39 PM PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Financial Analyst The positive shift to a quarterly net income of $572,000 for Agrify Corporation indicates a pivotal turnaround from the previous year's substantial losses. This change is primarily driven by a robust reduction in gross loss and operational expenses. The company's implementation of new sales policies, including upfront deposits, seems to have effectively improved cash flows and receivables management.However, investors should note the stark revenue decline from $58.3 million in fiscal 2022 to $16.9 million in 2023. Such a drop could reflect market challenges or strategic shifts in operations. The reduction in general and administrative expenses from $73 million to $19 million also suggests aggressive cost-cutting measures, which may either contribute to efficiency or challenge scalability in the future.Long-term, the commitment to innovation and embracing new technologies like the VFU could position Agrify as a leader in the competitive cannabis market. Yet, the short-term financial health is subject to the success of these initiatives and the company's ability to maintain profitability. Market Research Analyst Agrify's strategy to concentrate on newly licensed states is a tactical move that may capitalize on the expanding cannabis market. As more states legalize cannabis, equipment and services like those provided by Agrify will likely see increased demand. Their focus on VFU technology promotes efficiency and quality, potentially attracting discerning operators in the industry.The mention of managed service agreements signifies a shift towards a more service-oriented business model, creating recurring revenue streams while enhancing customer loyalty. Agrify's attention to offering comprehensive warranties and support reflects a deep understanding of customer needs, which could drive client retention and attract new business. Legal Expert Agrify's aggressive legal measures to collect receivables and settle payables and litigations demonstrate a hands-on approach to financial management. These efforts can help mitigate risk and protect the company's assets, which is important for investor confidence. The new policy requiring substantial deposits also serves as a hedge against default risk.While there are no details provided on specific legal challenges, it's evident that Agrify is actively working to minimize legal exposure, which can have costly ramifications if not properly managed. Investors should appreciate the proactive stance but remain aware of any unresolved or future legal issues that could impact the company's performance. 04/15/2024 - 05:42 PM Company achieves first positive quarterly net income of approximately $572,000TROY, Mich., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agrify Corporation (Nasdaq:AGFY) (“Agrify” or the “Company”), a leading provider of innovative cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis industry, today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company achieved its first positive quarterly net income of approximately $572,000. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Summary Revenue was $2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.Gross profit was $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a gross loss of $33.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.Operating loss was $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $60.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $0.572 million, compared to a net loss of $57.94 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Summary Revenue was $16.9 million for the fiscal year compared to $58.3 million for fiscal year 2022.Gross profit for the fiscal year was at $5.3 million compared to a gross loss of $31.8 million in fiscal year 2022.Operating expenses decreased by 85% to $24.3 million for fiscal year 2023 compared to $161.5 million in fiscal year 2022.Net loss for fiscal year 2023 was $18.7 million or $12.51 per diluted share compared to $188.2 million, or $902.19 per diluted share in fiscal year 2022. “We continued to see improvements and make progress on our turn-around,” said Raymond Chang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Agrify. “Despite continuous industry headwind, we are starting to see a pick-up in capital expenditures, especially in newly licensed states. This could not come at a better time, as we continue to see amazing yield and top-quality flowers produced from our existing TTK facilities. These strong and undeniable results demonstrate the superiority of our VFU technology. As such we expect to see more interest in our VFUs both domestically and internationally. Similarly, our ability to provide an end-to-end turnkey solution for any type of extraction needs allows us to win larger and more meaningful projects. In 2023, we implemented a new policy requiring a 50-75% deposit upfront on all new sales orders and the remaining before shipment. Although such a drastic change in our policy resulted in lower top-line growth, it significantly reduced our receivables and improved our cash collection. We also dramatically reduced our headcount and cut our expenses as we consolidated our offices and warehouses down from seven to three locations. General and administration expenses were reduced from $73 million in 2022 to $19 million in 2023, with a further reduction to less than $3 million per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2023 to align with our current business scale. We also made conscious efforts to aggressively sell down slow-moving inventory, especially items which we have taken full or partial reserves. Lastly, we pursued various legal measures to collect outstanding receivables and settle various payables and litigation matters. All these initiatives have helped to boost our fourth quarter financial results and turnaround of the company.” Recent Business Highlights Extraction Division In the ever-evolving landscape of cannabis extraction equipment, the demand for reliability paired with comprehensive support is reaching new heights. Today, operators are increasingly recognizing the indispensable value of product warranties and dedicated support, steering clear of the challenges posed by the fluctuating second-hand market that can lead to costly downtimes and profit reductions. As operators nationwide seek sustainable, long-term solutions, the availability of old second-hand machines has dwindled. This realization, combined with the imperative for unwavering reliability, has underscored the critical need for dependable warranties and ongoing support. In response to this pivotal industry shift, Agrify proudly announces its new initiative aimed at delivering unparalleled service to our esteemed customers. In recent months, there has been a notable increase in the adoption of our managed service agreements, as operators prioritize not only top-tier machinery but also the peace of mind essential for seamless day-to-day operations. ""Our commitment to excellence extends beyond the product itself,"" stated Brian Towns, Executive Vice President & General Manager at Agrify. ""We recognize that operators are investing in more than just equipment; they are investing in the reliability and efficiency of their entire operations."" The recent signing of a Letter of Intent (LOI) with PDS Ventures in Warren, MI, serves as a testament to Agrify’s dedication to providing holistic solutions. Furthermore, Agrify is actively in discussions with several other esteemed industry leaders, cementing its position as a trusted partner in the cannabis ancillary market, offering both cutting-edge equipment and unparalleled support services. With this groundbreaking initiative, operators can confidently trust that their investments are safeguarded by the industry's leading warranties and continuous support. As we navigate this dynamic landscape together, Agrify remains unwavering in its mission to deliver unmatched quality, reliability, and innovation to every facet of the cannabis industry.

(OTCQB:CHUC) (""Charlie's"" or the ""Company""), an industry leader in the premium vapor products space, today reported results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and provided an update on recent business highlights.Key Financial Highlights for 2023Revenue decreased 39% to $16.3 millionGross profit decreased 39% to $6.0 millionOperating expenses decreased 30% to $8.2 millionOperating loss increased 22% to $2.2 millionNet loss increased 32% to $2.1 millionKey Business Highlights from 2023Developed, tested, and trademarked Metatine nicotine substitute alkaloid; launched SPREE BAR product lineAwarded eleven large customers SPREE BAR Master Distributor and Distributor contractsAccepted purchase orders and corresponding 50% cash deposits for each SPREE BAR Distributor's initial orderAnnounced a new strategic initiative to develop patented ""age-gating"" technology to address significant concerns raised by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") over the use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (""ENDS"") products by underage consumersManagement CommentaryRyan Stump, Charlie's Chief Operating Officer, explained, ""We are very excited about SPREE BAR and Metatine. In late 2024 and beyond, we believe our nicotine substitute products will be very important market leaders. Our plans for 2024 include cost-effectively expanding and strategically refocusing our sales team. Part of our sales focus will be on direct-to-retail (smoke shops, chain stores, adult beverage/liquor stores, gas stations, and grocery stores) with the goal of acquiring 1,000 new customer accounts in 2024. Another sales team focus will be on satisfying the requirements of mega-distributors (traditional big tobacco distributors) in order to sell into the nation's largest chain store accounts. Additionally, we plan to build-out a dedicated international team, including country managers and marketing coordinators, to market and sell a suite of custom-made products to new and existing international customers.""""As we pivoted in 2023 to focus Company resources on the development of proprietary Metatine and on the SPREE BAR product line, we greatly reduced our cash burn by right-sizing overhead to match our decline in revenue,"" stated Matt Montesano, Charlie's Holdings, Inc. Interim Chief Financial Officer. ""In this effort we significantly lowered headcount, non-commission salaries, and tradeshow-related costs in preparation for the customer education campaign and commercial launch of Charlie's nicotine substitute products. Further, in January 2023, Charlie's executive officers Henry Sicignano and Ryan Stump voluntarily elected to reduce their salaries by 20% and 25%, respectively, until such time that the Company returns to growth. Indeed, in the second half of 2024, we believe Metatine and SPREE BAR will put us on this path.""Henry Sicignano III, Charlie's President, commented, ""We took a step back in 2023: to reassess our strategic priorities, to develop Charlie's proprietary nicotine substitute alkaloid that is Metatine, and to launch Version One of the SPREE BAR product line. In mid to late 2024, it is our intention not only to secure SPREE BAR distribution in several of the nation's larger c-store chains, but also to grow significantly Pacha™ disposable sales in this same channel.""Mr. Sicignano continued, ""Though we have a challenging runway to navigate, we believe that increased sales of our Pacha disposables - which remain in substantive review with the FDA - combined with SPREE BAR sales in national chains in the second half of 2024, could position Charlie's for an uplist to a national securities exchange. It is our plan to do everything possible to affect these achievements.""SPREE BARDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 the Company launched new disposable vape products, under the ""SPREE BAR™"" brand, that the Company believes could (i) replace many of Charlie's legacy products, and (ii) become the single largest, most important commercial opportunity in Charlie's history. The Company and its attorneys believe SPREE BAR products with Metatine™ inside, are not subject to FDA Premarket Tobacco Application (""PMTA"") review. In short, the Company's SPREE BAR vape liquids are not made or derived from tobacco, nor do they contain nicotine from any source. Based on the information provided by the Company's contracted chemical suppliers and its consultants, the proprietary Metatine™ alkaloid (patented in the United States and in China by the Company's chemical supplier) does not meet the definition of nicotine set forth in 21 U.S.C. § 387(12) and therefore Charlie's products that contain Metatine as their active ingredient are not subject to regulation as ""tobacco products"" under 21 U.S.C. § 321(rr).In late 2023 the Company began shipping its new Metatine-based, SPREE BAR™ disposable vape products to master distributors. Charlie's believes that its transition to Metatine-based products will give the Company an extraordinary opportunity to capture significant sales and market share in the vapor products marketplace in late 2024 and beyond. SPREE BAR, with Metatine, is indistinguishable from a conventional disposable vape; SPREE BAR provides adult consumers with the same satisfaction that typical nicotine disposables provide, but without nicotine. As a disposable pod system - with a reusable battery - 6,000-puff SPREE BAR flavor pods have a retail price that is significantly less than that of the industry-leading 5,500-puff disposables. Because Metatine is not made or derived from tobacco, and because Metatine does not consist of or contain nicotine from any source, SPREE BAR is not subject to FDA Pre-Market Tobacco Application (""PMTA"") requirements.Age-Gating TechnologyThe Company has also begun to develop intellectual property around technologies designed to prevent youth access to nicotine vapor products. Edward Carmines, Ph.D., a member of Charlie's Board of Directors and an accomplished scientist and regulatory affairs expert, is spearheading Charlie's development of patented ""age-gating technology"" for both Charlie's and potential licensees of the Company. Currently, there is a need for age-gated product technologies that can satisfy or accommodate concerns the FDA has related to under-age youth access in the ENDS market. If Charlie's age-gated e-cigarettes-in-development are recognized as ""products of merit"" by the FDA, the Company's e-cigarettes could emerge among the select minority of flavored nicotine disposables able to be sold legally in the $7 billion U.S. vapor products market.Underlining the importance of Charlie's work with age-gating technology is an initiative taken by JUUL Labs, one of the largest competitors in Charlie's industry. In July 2023 JUUL announced that it had submitted a PMTA to the FDA for a new e-cigarette device that also included information on novel, data-driven technologies to restrict underage access. JUUL's chief product officer explained, ""With our next-generation platform, we have designed a technological solution for two public-health problems: improving adult-smoker switching from combustible cigarettes and restricting underage access to vapor products..."" Similar to the age-gating technology under development at Charlie's, the JUUL device includes a mobile and web-based app that enables age-verification technology, including device-locking, and real-time product information and usage insights for age-verified consumers with industry-leading data-privacy protections.PMTA UpdateAs December 31, 2023, Charlie's 2020 PMTA remains among the select minority of applications submitted to the FDA for a tobacco-derived nicotine Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (""ENDS"") product that has not received a Marketing Denial Order (""MDO"") or Refuse-to-File designation.Financial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023: Revenue: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, revenue was $16.3 million, a decrease of $10.2 million, or 39%, compared with $26.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to a $8.6 million decrease in Charlie's nicotine-based vapor product sales and a $1.6 million decrease in hemp-derived products. The decrease in Charlie's nicotine-based vapor product sales was related to a decline in sales of the Pacha Disposable line, which was launched during the first half of 2022. Pacha Disposables became Charlie's first-ever entrant into the rapidly expanding, disposable e-cigarette market and offers users a variety of premium flavors containing synthetic nicotine (not derived from tobacco) in a compact, discrete format. The nicotine and synthetic nicotine-based disposable category faced significant pressure during the year ended December 31, 2023 due to increased competition from lower-priced Chinese products being sold direct to US retailers, as well as further shortening of product lifecycles, making it challenging to market effectively. Uncertainty regarding FDA's position on flavored nicotine products, specifically disposable vapes, continued to drive the market underground, creating significant challenges for brands like Charlie's that choose to adhere to state and Federal legislation. The decrease in sales for Charlie's hemp-derived products business declined due to regulatory challenges with specific product formulations as well as an intentional reallocation of resources to the launch of evergreen product categories such as SPREE BAR. During the second half of 2023, Charlie's made the strategic decision to contract the Company's hemp-derived products business and utilize working capital to fund development of Metatine and the SPREE BAR line of non-nicotine vapor products. Gross Profit: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, gross profit was $6.0 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, or 39%, compared with $10.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The resulting gross margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was 37.2%, compared with 37.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Gross margin declined slightly due to lower overhead cost absorption resulting from reduced sales activity, as well as a decrease in the amount of shipping costs passed on to customers. Total Operating Expenses: For the twelve months ended Deember 31, 2023, total operating expenses, including general and administrative, sales and marketing and research and development costs, were $8.2 million, a decrease of $3.6 million, or 30%, compared with $11.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Operating Loss: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, operating loss was $2.2 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 22%, compared with $1.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Net Loss: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, net loss was $2.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 32%, compared with $1.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Of note, net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 included a $0.5 million gain in fair value of derivative liabilities and a $0.5 million interest expense, compared with $0.3 million gain in fair value of derivative liabilities and a $0.2 million interest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. EPS: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, diluted earnings loss per share was ($0.01), compared with diluted earnings loss per share of ($0.01), for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.About Charlie's Holdings, Inc.Charlie's Holdings, Inc.

(TSRI) reported financial results for Q3 ending February 29, 2024. Revenue decreased by 18.8% to $19.7 million, with net income of $411,000. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with $15.2 million in net working capital. CEO Thomas Salerno highlighted cost control measures and optimism for improved revenue and income in the second half of 2024. Positive None. Negative Revenue decreased by 18.8% compared to the same quarter last year. Despite cost control measures, selling, general, and administrative expenses were reduced by $401,000 from the previous year. The company experienced mandatory furloughs of contractors during the holiday season, impacting revenue. The uncertain macro-economic environment poses challenges for TSR, Inc. Financial Analyst The reported reduction in revenue by 18.8% for TSR, Inc. is a significant figure that investors will eye critically. It's a clear indicator of decreased demand for the company's services, likely reflecting broader market trends. However, the increase in net income to $411,000, up from $80,000, despite the revenue drop, suggests effective cost management, which can be viewed favorably. Investors should consider the company's seasonally weak quarter in their analysis, noting that the holiday season and associated payroll tax expenses can skew results. The improved earnings per share should be weighed against the decrease in top-line sales to determine the sustainability of such profitability. Market Research Analyst While TSR's strong balance sheet and $15.2 million in net working capital provide a cushion, the underlying cause of the decline in clerical and administrative contractors is important to understand. The shift could suggest an industry-wide transition or be symptomatic of a weakening economy. The macro-economic environment, as referred to by the CEO, will have a substantial impact on the company's ability to rebound in the second half of the calendar year. Current and potential investors should monitor industry trends and economic indicators closely for signs of improvement or further decline that could affect TSR’s business. Risk Management Expert From a risk perspective, the mention of mandatory furloughs and the reliance on reversing advances from customers (which contributed to 'Other Income') could be seen as red flags. These are not sustainable strategies for long-term profitability and could lead to volatility in future earnings. Stakeholders should appreciate the proactive measures to control costs, but also remain aware of the potential for these actions to affect the company’s operational capabilities and customer service standards, which could hinder future revenue growth. 04/15/2024 - 05:00 PM HAUPPAUGE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TSR, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSRI) (“TSR” or “the Company”), a provider of information technology consulting and recruiting services, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2024. For the quarter ended February 29, 2024, revenue decreased 18.8% from the same quarter last year to $19.7 million. Net income attributable to TSR for the current quarter was $411,000, or $0.19 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $80,000, or $0.04 per share, in the prior year quarter. The Company ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with $15.2 million in net working capital or approximately $7.03 per share. Thomas Salerno, our CEO, stated: “Primarily as the result of decreases in the number of clerical and administrative contractors on billing with customers, revenue decreased 18.8% from the prior year quarter. Our fiscal third quarter is traditionally the most challenging of the year. Workdays are reduced due to the holiday season and payroll tax expenses are at their highest at the beginning of the calendar year. This year was particularly hard hit with mandatory furloughs of contractors during the holiday season. As always, we continue to focus on controlling costs, which has helped our profitability while customers are reducing their spending. In the current quarter, selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by $401,000 from last year’s comparable quarter, despite an additional $136,000 spent in the current quarter on professional fees associated with the review of strategic alternatives. The current quarter benefited from “Other Income” of $547,000 resulting from the reversal of advances from customers. We continue to navigate an uncertain macro-economic environment, but we are optimistic that revenue and income will be stronger in the second half of calendar 2024. The team continues to make progress with new customers and I am proud of their effort to offer our legacy customers some of the best service in the business. We believe that TSR is well-positioned in the industry and has a strong balance sheet.” The Company will file its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 29, 2024 today with further details at www.sec.gov.

The offering involves the purchase of 1,500,000 subordinate voting shares at C$92.90 per share. Bain and its affiliates will reduce their multiple voting shares holdings post-offering. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From the perspective of a Financial Analyst, the secondary offering signals a liquidity event for the Selling Shareholder, Bain Capital, which can have various implications. Firstly, the market may interpret this as a sign that Bain sees the current price as attractive for selling, potentially reflecting a mature investment seeking to realize gains. Secondly, this offering will introduce a considerable number of shares into the market, which could dilute the stock's value in the short term due to increased supply.Moreover, the fixed price of C$92.90 per share provides an immediate benchmark for the market. If this price is above the current trading level, it could suggest an undervalued stock, whereas a price below could indicate an overvalued stock. The market reaction to this offering will be an important indicator of investor sentiment towards BRP.Long-term effects are more uncertain, as the reduction in Bain's voting power from 29.7% to 27.1% slightly decreases its influence. This could be seen favorably if investors perceive a more decentralized ownership as beneficial for governance. Conversely, Bain's reduced involvement might be viewed negatively if their oversight was considered a stabilizing factor for BRP. Market Research Analyst Approaching from a Market Research Analyst standpoint, the Offering's impact on BRP's market positioning should be considered. With BRP not receiving any proceeds, there is no direct financial benefit to the company such as increased working capital or funding for expansion. Hence, this event does not reflect a change in BRP's operational or strategic initiatives.However, the secondary offering may affect investor perceptions. If BRP's market competitors are not engaging in similar capital market activities, BRP could be seen as either more dynamic or less stable, depending on investor interpretation. As the Offering is on a 'bought deal' basis, BMO Capital Markets is taking on the risk of selling the shares, which can be seen as a vote of confidence in BRP's stock, potentially affecting investor sentiment.Lastly, the presence of a large institutional seller exiting or reducing their position could be seen as a signal about the industry outlook. Investors might question whether Bain's sell-off is indicative of a broader trend or specific to BRP's future prospects. Securities Law Expert Analyzing the legal framework, as a Securities Law Expert, it is notable that the Offering follows the U.S./Canada Multijurisdictional Disclosure System. This system simplifies the cross-border sale of securities by allowing for a coordinated regulatory approach. The fact that BRP is using this system indicates their intent to reach investors in both countries efficiently.The precursor to the Offering, the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement, suggests due diligence and transparency on the part of BRP, aligning with best practices and legal requirements. This is an important indicator for investors about the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and risk management.Additionally, the reduction in Bain's voting power aligns with corporate governance practices that favor broader shareholder representation. However, investors should be mindful of the implications this may have on company control dynamics and board decisions, which could have subtle long-term effects on company strategy and performance. 04/15/2024 - 04:54 PM VALCOURT, Quebec, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BRP Inc.

Furthermore, the expectation of aligning revenues and profit margins with company-owned units suggests an effective operational model that can be replicated across new acquisitions. Market Research Analyst The acquisition's focus on North Carolina reflects a targeted geographical growth approach. The mention of 'white space' in the market area suggests there are untapped opportunities for First Watch, which the company aims to capitalize on organically. Analyzing this move, it's clear that First Watch is poised to strengthen its brand dominance and potentially increase its market share within the daytime dining segment. The strategic assimilation of new employees into its corporate culture, referred to as 'You First', could also foster a cohesive brand experience that might contribute positively to customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Cash on hand decreased to $23.5 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $76.5 million at December 31, 2022. Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial results, the revenue growth of 68% is impressive, especially within the Earth Observation (EO) sector. The strategic investment by Tether Investments Limited is significant as it brings liquidity and perhaps confidence in the company's future.However, the report indicates a substantial net loss increase, which is concerning. While gross profit and margin have improved, cost control measures hint at an operational pivot. The withdrawal of future guidance suggests underlying uncertainty. Investors should monitor this alongside the company's strategic realignment, particularly the emphasis on U.S. contracts post-redomicile. Market Research Analyst The EO market is gaining traction and Satellogic's focus on the U.S government contracts post-redomiciling could be a lucrative pivot. The note on delayed revenue growth is a red flag that may indicate competitive pressures or execution risks.Satellogic's partnerships in India and Southeast Asia demonstrate its international market penetration. However, the retail investor should scrutinize the sustainability of these international agreements amidst the company's strategic shift towards the U.S market. Space Industry Analyst Satellogic's advancements in small-satellite technology and recent launches indicate strong technical capabilities. The approval for a remote sensing license from NOAA is a strategic win, critical for U.S. market compliance. However, the space sector's long sales cycles and reliance on government contracts can introduce volatility and risk to revenue predictability, which must be factored into the long-term investment outlook.Their planned satellite with Uzma and collaboration with TASL to build satellites in India are indicative of industry trends towards privatization and localization of space assets. However, retail investors should consider the execution risk and potential market reception of these advanced EO data products. 04/15/2024 - 05:09 PM Revenue up 68% to $10.1 million in FY 2023 Received $30 Million Strategic Investment from Tether Investments Limited Planned Redomicile to U.S. to Position the Company to Compete for U.S. Government and Allied Contracts NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Satellogic Inc. (NASDAQ: SATL), a leader in sub-meter resolution Earth Observation (“EO”) data collection, today provided financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a business update. “The second half of 2023 was highlighted by new partnerships, continued revenue growth, and milestone accomplishments in our strategy to capitalize on high-value opportunities in the U.S.,” said Satellogic CEO, Emiliano Kargieman. “As the EO market and macroeconomic environment continue to evolve, we are strategically realigning our business to capture high value opportunities in the U.S. With our focus on the U.S., we have taken two important steps. First, we commenced the process of redomiciling to Delaware from the British Virgin Islands, with an aim to completing the conversion in the first half of 2024. As a result, once this process is complete, we will report results on a quarterly basis consistent with being a domestic filer. Second, in late 2023, we were granted approval for a remote sensing license for our constellation with the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The license results in Satellogic being subject to NOAA’s oversight as we pivot operational control of our satellite constellation to U.S. personnel and expand the Satellogic ground station network to include U.S. based ground stations. These actions are crucial in terms of satisfying requirements for expanding business in the U.S. market and better positioning us to compete for U.S. government and allied contracts. With these two steps, we anticipate targeting new U.S. government contract opportunities in 2024, in addition to our current pipeline of international government and commercial opportunities. “To support our new strategy, we recently announced a $30 million strategic investment from Tether Investments Limited, the company behind the world's leading stablecoin. With this transaction now completed, we are excited to continue advancing our U.S. strategy, including our redomiciliation to Delaware.” Matt Tirman, Satellogic President, added, “During the second half of 2023 we had several compelling wins for our pipeline. With Tata Advanced Systems Limited (“TASL”), we are establishing and developing local space technology capabilities in India. Together we developed a new satellite design and worked together to integrate multiple payloads on a single satellite that will generate a diverse range of data over India. This collaboration is a first step in TASL’s satellite strategy and a significant milestone as we enter the fast-growing Indian defense and commercial markets. We also partnered with Uzma, a leading energy and technology company, to evolve the landscape of satellite imagery capabilities and geospatial services in Southeast Asia. The agreement includes leveraging a state-of-the-art EO satellite designed and manufactured by Satellogic that is planned to be launched in the second half of 2024 as “UzmaSAT-1” aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, and extensive tasking access to the Satellogic constellation. “The results of our efforts were revenue growth of 68% year-over-year primarily as a result of our Space Systems and Asset Monitoring businesses gaining momentum. We have proven that it is possible to provide high-quality satellite imagery through a constellation of small, low-orbit satellites at what we believe to be the lowest price, while retaining strong margins. We also recently celebrated our 16th consecutive successful launch and the continued expansion of our constellation, adding a NewSat Mark-V satellite to our fleet in orbit on board SpaceX’s Transporter-10 mission to support our partners and growth. We are consistently delivering more capacity, more reliability, and next-gen capabilities for our customers. “Looking ahead, we are highly focused on a plan to meet the developing needs of our customers and the broader EO market, while making our organization more streamlined and efficient. We are closing in on the strategic realignment of our business to capitalize on what we believe to be our highest growth opportunities in the U.S.,” concluded Tirman. Rick Dunn, Satellogic CFO, commented, “We ended 2023 with $23.5 million of cash on hand and significantly reduced our cash used in operations by $18.9 million, or 28%. Our revenue grew 68% to $10.1 million and gross profit excluding depreciation increased 84% to $5.0 million, with a corresponding 500 bps increase in gross margin to 50%, for the full year 2023. As we move into 2024, we have seen positive momentum in terms of revenue, backlog and pipeline with over $12 million signed strategic contracts in the second half of 2023. “While we are encouraged by our positive momentum, we experienced slower than anticipated revenue growth. As a result, we undertook cost and spending control measures in 2023. These actions primarily related to the moderation of capital expenditures, a reduction of certain discretionary spending, as well as a headcount reduction, which represented approximately 25% of the total headcount at the beginning of 2023. Cumulative reductions in headcount are expected to result in approximately $7.5 million of annual savings in 2024. “We continue to expect that our revenue for 2024 will largely be dependent on closing opportunities within our Space Systems line of business, which we anticipate will contribute considerable per unit cash flow and strong gross margin, although that revenue may be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we are focused on executing on our strategic realignment and growth opportunities in the U.S. market. We continue to expect our revenue will be driven by our further growth in Space Systems, Asset Monitoring, and Constellation-as-a-Service. “Lastly, our ability to accurately forecast annual revenue and profitability relies on the speed and decision-making of our large commercial partners. This sales cycle is often long and subject to many variables beyond our control. For these reasons, the Company is withdrawing its previously communicated guidance. We have no current plans to publish guidance in the near term, but look forward to providing periodic updates as we achieve strategic and commercial milestones,” concluded Dunn. Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased 68% to $10.1 million, as compared to revenue of $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was driven primarily by Space Systems and Asset Monitoring lines of business. Gross profit, excluding depreciation expense, for the year ended December 31, 2023, totalled $5.0 million, an 84% increase, as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Gross margin was 50% in the full year 2023, as compared to 45% for the prior year period, due primarily to the year over year increase in revenue. General and administrative expenses were $23.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives in 2023, lower professional fees related to elevated merger activity during 2022, and lower insurance and other administrative expenses. Research & Development expenses decreased to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in other research and development expenses and professional fees, as a result of cost control measures implemented in 2023. Additionally, employee related expenses decreased due to lower average headcount in 2023 as compared to 2022. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased to $61.0 million, as compared to a net loss of $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a decrease in the change in fair value of financial instruments. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased to $44.1 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $56.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue, as well as a decrease in non-merger related costs and expenses and as a result of cost control measures implemented in 2023. Cash was $23.5 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $76.5 million at December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities decreased to $49.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a reduction in headcount, research and development expenses, and professional fees. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We monitor a number of financial performance and liquidity measures on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business. Included in these financial performance and liquidity measures are the non-GAAP measures, Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. We believe these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business, as they remove the impact of items that we believe are not reflective of our underlying operating performance. The non-GAAP measures are used by us to evaluate our core operating performance and liquidity on a comparable basis and to make strategic decisions. The non-GAAP measures also facilitate company-to-company operating performance comparisons by backing out potential differences caused by variations such as capital structures, taxation, capital expenditures and non-cash items (i.e., depreciation, embedded derivatives, debt extinguishment and stock-based compensation) which may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance. However, different companies may define these terms differently and accordingly comparisons might not be accurate. Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure. For the definitions of Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net loss, see below. We define Non-GAAP EBITDA as net loss excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We did not incur amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. We define Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA as Non-GAAP EBITDA further adjusted for merger-related transaction costs and other income (expense). Other income (expense) consists of foreign currency gains and losses, changes in the fair value of financial instruments, loss on extinguishment of debt and stock-based compensation. The following table presents a reconciliation of Non-GAAP EBITDA and Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to its net loss for the periods indicated.

The company aims to provide easy pricing, superior customer service, and advanced data and voice services to residential and commercial customers in Ohio and adjacent states. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst Fiber-optic technology is rapidly transforming the telecommunications landscape, offering significant advantages over traditional copper lines. The rebranding of Horizon Telcom to Glo Fiber signifies a strategic move by Shenandoah Telecommunications to unify its brand identity across its acquisitions. This move may enhance brand recognition and customer loyalty, which are important in a competitive market where churn rates can significantly impact a company's bottom line.Shentel's strategy to deploy fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and offer high-speed symmetrical upload and download speeds positions the company as an innovator in the industry. The emphasis on straightforward pricing and short-term contracts is indicative of a customer-centric approach that can help reduce barriers to adoption and thus potentially improve market penetration rates. For stakeholders, this could translate into sustained revenue growth and an uptick in customer acquisition rates, provided that Shentel maintains service quality post-rebranding. Financial Analyst The announcement of a rebranding, while not as impactful as earnings reports or mergers, can still have financial implications for a company like Shenandoah Telecommunications. By investing in brand and service differentiation, Shentel is likely aiming to capture a larger share of the market in Ohio and surrounding areas, thereby potentially driving up its revenue and EBITDA margins in the long term.In the short term, however, investors should be aware that rebranding efforts often require substantial marketing and operational expenditure. It is essential to monitor how these costs are managed, as they may temporarily affect profit margins. Also, investors should consider how effectively Shentel can integrate Horizon's operations under the Glo Fiber brand to realize cost synergies and tap into economies of scale. Market Research Analyst The consumer demand for higher broadband speeds, reliable service and customer-friendly business models is driving a shift in the telecommunications industry. By focusing on these aspects, Glo Fiber may be well-positioned to capture and retain a robust customer base amidst growing competition. The claim of superior local customer service could resonate with a demographic that values community ties and personalized support, which can be a differentiating factor in brand choice.In terms of market positioning, Glo Fiber’s commitment to symmetrical high-speed connectivity and the provision of advanced data services bodes well for future-proofing its service offerings. However, it is important to assess the competitive response from other local and national providers, as they might intensify promotional efforts or innovate their own services in response to Glo Fiber's market entry. 04/15/2024 - 04:55 PM EDINBURG, Va., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (""Shentel"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: SHEN) announced the rebranding of Horizon Telcom (""Horizon"") to Glo Fiber.

Acorda Therapeutics Announces Delisting from Nasdaq,2024-04-15T21:03:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Acorda Therapeutics faces delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with listing rules and Chapter 11 proceedings, now trading on OTC Pink under 'ACORQ' ticker symbol.","Acorda Therapeutics Announces Delisting from Nasdaq Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Acorda Therapeutics faces delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with listing rules and Chapter 11 proceedings, now trading on OTC Pink under 'ACORQ' ticker symbol. Positive None. Negative Delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with listing rules and Chapter 11 proceedings Failure to maintain stockholders' equity of at least $10 million Trading suspended on Nasdaq on April 12, 2024 Financial Analyst The delisting of Acorda Therapeutics represents a significant shift in the company's financial stability and accessibility to investors. Delisting typically occurs when a company fails to meet the exchange's stringent financial and regulatory requirements. Acorda's Chapter 11 proceedings indicate it is attempting to reorganize its debts, which often leads to a reassessment of the company's operational strategy and financial health.For stakeholders, this transition from Nasdaq to the OTC Pink Open Market generally entails a decrease in liquidity, potentially leading to more volatile stock prices and less stringent financial reporting requirements. Investors might experience difficulty buying or selling shares and may face increased risks. Long-term, the company's ability to raise capital may be challenged, necessitating a critical evaluation of their business rebound strategy and subsequent execution. Legal Expert The legal ramifications surrounding Acorda's delisting due to non-compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rules are indicative of significant underlying issues. Chapter 11 proceedings provide companies with protection while they restructure their debt, suggesting that Acorda has substantial financial hurdles. This process requires intricate legal maneuvering and can affect investor confidence due to the uncertainty over the company's future structure and operations.Shareholders should be aware of their positions during this restructuring. Typically, common stocks may be devalued or wiped out as creditors are prioritized. This event should remind investors of the legal complexities inherent in restructuring and the potential implications for their holdings. Market Research Analyst The effect of Acorda's delisting on the broader market and its sector could be minimal if it's a smaller player. However, it may reflect broader challenges within the pharmaceutical sector, particularly for companies facing financial management issues or those with a risky drug pipeline. It's critical to assess if this is an isolated incident or part of a larger trend of financial distress within the sector.Investors often look to market listings as a stamp of credibility and stability. When a company is delisted, it's seen as a red flag, potentially causing a ripple effect on peer companies' valuations and investor perceptions, especially those with similar risk profiles. 04/15/2024 - 05:03 PM PEARL RIVER, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. today announced that its common stock is no longer listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Trading in the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq exchange was suspended on April 12, 2024.

Remark Holdings faced challenges due to slow economic recovery in China and rising political tensions between the U.S. and China. 04/15/2024 - 04:30 PM LAS VEGAS, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Remark Holdings, Inc. (OTCQX: MARK), a diversified global technology company with leading artificial intelligence (""AI"") powered computer vision solutions, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. For complete details of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying management's discussion and analysis, please see Remark's filings with the SEC (www.sec.gov). Management Commentary ""We spent much time and effort during 2023 on building a global sales network to help our Remark AI platform to more rapidly expand. We previously relied on our staff to sell directly to customers, but with partnerships like ours with Microsoft—and soon to be with others—we expect our sales will grow rapidly,"" said Kai-Shing Tao, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Remark Holdings. ""We have spent the last month planning and will soon launch our go-to market with Microsoft, which excites us for what is to come. We are finding significant interest in our respective security, construction, and infrastructure AI solutions."" Mr. Tao continued, ""We also recently began our first proof of concept with one of the largest construction developments in the world, which is located in Saudi Arabia. We expect this will lead to many other significant opportunities in the region given our experience in deploying our smart construction platform."" ""Finally, we expect that our recent success with the Clark County School District will, given that such school district is one of the top five school districts in the U.S., lead to our ability to expand our solutions into many other school districts throughout the U.S.,"" concluded Mr. Tao. Fiscal Year 2023 Business Highlights The company's Remark AI subsidiary, with its AI-powered Smart Safety Platform (""SSP""), won the first phase of a roll-out by the Rio De Janeiro police department to equip their existing police car fleet with license plate and facial recognition capabilities. The value of the contract is $6.0 million, which Remark will recognize as revenue over a 30-month period once deployment can begin.Remark AI has joined the NVIDIA Metropolis program to increase the sale and delivery of Remark AI's smart city AI solutions. The program nurtures a rich ecosystem and offers powerful developer tools to supercharge vision AI applications that are designed to make the world's most important spaces and operations safer and more efficient. Remark also joined NVIDIA as part of PNY Technologies's booth at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona held in November 2023.During 2023, Remark AI released its natural-language smart chat agent to investigate, file, and fulfill real-time 311 service requests, alleviating the backlog that arises from the lack of human agent support during busy and critical times.Remark AI also released version 1.0 of its Aero-engine Inspection Kit (the ""AIK"", which was originally called the Airline Engine Safety Inspection System). The AIK is intended for use by airlines, airline maintenance teams, engine manufacturers, airplane manufacturers, aircraft leasing companies, insurance companies, and regulators, among others. In early 2024, the AIK became a part of Remark AI's aviation suite of products known as the Aviation Safety Platform, which uses a large multimodal model to provide several functionalities included in three essential components: the AIK; an aircraft towing anti-collision system, and a large multimodal model for business intelligence and reporting.The company's business was affected during 2023 initially by a slow economic recovery in China and then by rising political tensions between the U.S. and China, which led the company to reduce staffing levels in China to save on operating costs until political tensions ease and the business environment becomes more conducive for American companies in the AI space.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue for fiscal year 2023 totaled $4.4 million, reflecting a 62% decrease from $11.7 million during fiscal year 2022.Revenue contributed by Remark's U.S. businesses remained unchanged at $0.3 million during the fiscal year 2023 when compared to the fiscal year 2022.Revenue from China decreased to $4.1 million in fiscal year 2023 from $11.4 million in fiscal year 2022, primarily due to project completions slowing significantly in China, first as business and economic recovery efforts that began after China lifted most of its onerous COVID-19 related restrictions at the end of 2022 continued to be sluggish, and then as increased political tensions between the U.S. and China continued to make it more difficult than expected for us to complete projects.We completed certain projects in China during the year ended December 31, 2023 worth approximately $1.4 million, but the agreement did not meet the criteria for revenue recognition on an accrual basis. We will recognize the revenue from such agreement as we receive the cash, but we have not yet recorded a material amount from this agreement as revenue.The company's operating loss of $17.2 million during the fiscal year 2023 reflected a decrease of $4.1 million from an operating loss of $21.3 million during the fiscal year 2023. In addition to recording less revenue during 2023, Remark's cost of revenue decreased $8.0 million in conjunction with the decrease in project completions in China and because the prior year's cost of revenue included $1.3 million of inventory obsolescence that did not recur materially during 2023. General and administrative expense decreased by $5.0 million as bad debt expense, legal and professional fees, certain business development costs and stock-based compensation all declined during 2023. Partially offsetting the decreases in cost of revenue and general and administrative expense were increases of $1.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in asset impairments and sales and marketing expense.Remark reported a net loss of $29.1 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $55.5 million, or $5.22 per diluted share, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. The company's net loss decreased primarily because the company reported a $26.4 million loss on investment during the year ended December 31, 2022, whereas no investment gain or loss was reported in 2023. The decrease in Remark's operating loss described above was offset by the net effect of a $1.8 million decrease in interest expense, which resulted from less debt principal outstanding and a decrease in debt fee and debt discount amortization, and a $6.3 million increase in finance cost, which increased due to the company's issuance of additional convertible debentures and draws on an equity line of credit pursuant to agreements with Ionic Ventures, LLC.On December 31, 2023, the cash balance totaled $0.1 million, compared to a cash balance of less than $0.1 million on December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was $10.5 million during fiscal year 2023.Conference Call Information Management will hold a conference call this afternoon at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss the Company's financial results and provide an update on recent business developments.

Despite this, the company maintained a high gross margin level and saw significant growth in tailored job readiness training and smart campus solutions services. The company's total cash also increased substantially. Looking ahead, China Liberal aims to expand partnerships and develop new growth drivers to generate greater profits for shareholders.","China Liberal Education Holdings Limited Reports Financial Results for Fiscal Year 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary China Liberal Education Holdings reported a decline in revenue for fiscal year 2023 due to the termination of Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs. Despite this, the company maintained a high gross margin level and saw significant growth in tailored job readiness training and smart campus solutions services. The company's total cash also increased substantially. Looking ahead, China Liberal aims to expand partnerships and develop new growth drivers to generate greater profits for shareholders. Positive Revenue decreased by 44.7% to $2.89 million in fiscal year 2023 compared to $5.22 million in fiscal year 2022. Gross profit decreased by 59.1% to $1.65 million in fiscal year 2023 from $4.03 million in fiscal year 2022. Loss from operations decreased by 40.0% to $0.93 million in fiscal year 2023 from $1.55 million in fiscal year 2022. Net loss increased by 193.6% to $4.96 million in fiscal year 2023 from $1.69 million in fiscal year 2022. Basic and diluted loss per share decreased by 14.9% to $1.65 in fiscal year 2023 from $1.94 in fiscal year 2022. Negative Revenue decline due to termination of Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs. Significant decrease in gross profit and gross margin. Increase in net loss for fiscal year 2023. Negative impact on basic and diluted loss per share. Financial Analyst The financial performance of China Liberal Education Holdings Limited unveils a sharp revenue decline of approximately 44.7% year-over-year. Analyzing these figures, one must consider the implications of strategic business decisions, particularly the discontinuation of Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs, which significantly impacted revenue streams. While gross margins remain above the 50% threshold, a noteworthy industry benchmark, the precipitous drop to 57.1% from the previous year's 77.2% signals a concerning contraction in profitability. Stakeholders should weigh the surge in tailored job readiness training services and technological consulting revenues, which could indicate a pivot towards potentially lucrative sectors amidst restructuring.From a liquidity perspective, the substantial increase in cash holdings to $20.34 million suggests improved fiscal fortitude. The net loss widening by an alarming ~193.6%, however, paints a grim picture for immediate financial health, exacerbated by a spike in interest expenses. The disclosed share transfer agreement could reconfigure debt obligations and enable strategic realignment but requires careful scrutiny regarding its eventual impact on the company's balance sheet. Market Research Analyst China Liberal Education Holdings Limited's transition away from traditional academic programs towards job readiness and smart campus solutions reflects a strategic adaptation to market demands. The substantial growth rates in these emerging business lines (74.2% and 144.5% respectively) are indicative of a growing appetite for such services in China's educational sector. This pivot aligns with broader industry trends that emphasize technology integration and vocational training to enhance employability in a rapidly evolving job market.Investors should consider the potential long-term benefits of this shift, despite the stumbling blocks encountered in the short term. The contraction in net loss per share, despite an overall increase in net loss, suggests a nuanced financial dynamic that factors in capital structure changes, possibly due to equity financing or adjustments in outstanding shares. 04/15/2024 - 05:00 PM BEIJING, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- China Liberal Education Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: CLEU) (""China Liberal"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""our"", or ""us""), a China-based company that provides technological consulting services for smart campus solutions and other educational services, today announced its audited financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Ms. Ngai Ngai Lam, Chairwoman and CEO of China Liberal, commented, ""Our revenue experienced a decline in fiscal year 2023 due to termination of education programs offered by joint ventures of the PRC and foreign institutions (""Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs""), but we still managed to maintain a relatively high gross margin level at around 57.1% during the fiscal year. Despite the major business restructuring under way, it is worth noting that our existing business has witnessed a rapid growth, with the revenue from tailored job readiness training services and technological consulting services for smart campus solutions surging by 74.2% and 144.5%, respectively, compared to fiscal year 2022. Meanwhile, our total cash had risen substantially to $20.34 million as of December 31, 2023. These solid data showcase the resilience of our business model and operation which is moving in the right direction. Looking ahead, we will strive to keep the current momentum, expand our partnerships, and develop new growth drivers, with the goal of generating greater profits for our shareholders. Service quality is at the core of our journey for long-term development, which we believe will continue to push us forward for faster growth.""

Revenue was $2.89 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $5.22 million for fiscal year 2022.Gross profit was $1.65 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $4.03 million for fiscal year 2022.Gross margins were 57.1% and 77.2% for fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively.Loss from operations was $0.93 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.55 million for fiscal year 2022.Net loss was $4.96 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.69 million for fiscal year 2022.Basic and diluted loss per share were $1.65 for fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.94 for fiscal year 2022.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue Revenue decreased by $2.33 million, or 44.7%, to $2.89 million for fiscal year 2023 from $5.22 million for fiscal year 2022. The decrease in our revenue was mainly attributable to the discontinued revenue from Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs as this service was terminated after disposal of colleges in December 2023. The Company did not generate revenue from Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs for fiscal year 2023. Revenue from Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs was $3.34 million for fiscal year 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to two factors (i) revenue generated from Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs were accounted for as transactions between Wanwang Investment Limited (""Wanwang"") and China Liberal (Beijing) Education Technology Co., Ltd. (""China Liberal Beijing"") and were eliminated upon consolidation, and (ii) the termination of this line of service after disposition of two colleges in 2023. Revenue from tailored job readiness training services increased by $0.94 million, or 74.2%, to $2.20 million for fiscal year 2023, from $1.26 million for fiscal year 2022, mainly attributable to revenue contribution from our newly acquired entity, Oriental Wisdom Cultural Development Co., Ltd. (""Oriental Wisdom"") in July 2022. Oriental Wisdom contributed only five months of revenue in 2022, as opposed to 12 months of revenue in 2023. On July 14, 2022, the Company closed the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement entered into on June 9, 2022 by and among the Company, China Liberal Beijing, Oriental Wisdom, the acquired company, and Beijing Cloud Class Technology Co., Ltd., the seller of the acquired company, and completed its acquisition of Oriental Wisdom, an integrated education services provider focusing on operating jointly-managed academic programs in the vocational higher education industry in China. The Company did not generate revenue from Overseas Study Consulting Services for fiscal year 2023. Revenue from Overseas Study Consulting Services was $0.32 million for fiscal year 2022. We discontinued our Overseas Study Consulting Services in January 2023 after all existing contracts with Beijing Foreign Studies University came to completion and all existing performance obligations were satisfied, in accordance with the administration guidelines issued by General Office of the Ministry of Education in December 2021, which provide that universities and colleges shall cease projects and cooperation with external parties. Revenue from smart campus related technological consulting services and technical support services for other entities increased by $0.40 million, or 144.5%, to $0.68 million for fiscal year 2023, from $0.28 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of projects undertaken from six projects in 2022 to seven projects in 2023. The increase in revenue was also attributable to the increase in average project size from $46,563 per project in 2022, to $97,579 per project in 2023. The Company did not generate revenue from textbooks and course material sales for fiscal year 2023. Revenue from textbooks and course material sales was $13,948 for fiscal year 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to decreased demand for our textbooks and course materials. According to our agreement with the publisher, we will be able to receive a fee only when the number of copies printed by the publisher exceed a pre-determined volume of 5,100 copies. In 2023, 24,841 copies were printed. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue increased by $0.05 million, or 4.3%, to $1.24 million for fiscal year 2023, from $1.18 million for fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cost of revenue associated with tailored job readiness training services by $0.3 million and cost of revenue associated with technological consulting services for smart campus related projects by $0.3 million. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of cost of revenue associated with Sino-foreign jointly managed academic programs by $0.5 million and cost of revenue associated with overseas study consulting services by $0.1 million. Gross Profit Gross profit decreased by $2.38 million, or 59.1%, to $1.65 million in fiscal year 2023, from $4.03 million in fiscal year 2022, while gross profit margin decreased by 20.1%, to 57.1% for fiscal year 2023, from 77.2% for fiscal year 2022. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreased gross profit contribution of $2.9 million from Sino-foreign Jointly Managed Academic Programs and gross contribution of $0.2 million from overseas study consulting services. The decrease was partially offset by increased gross profit contribution of $0.6 million from tailored job readiness training services and gross profit contribution of $0.1 million from technological consulting services for smart campus. Operating Expenses Selling expenses decreased by $0.05 million, or 18.4%, to $0.23 million for fiscal year 2023, from $0.28 million for the fiscal year 2022. The decrease in selling expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction of headcount in our sales and marketing force and related travelling expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.88 million, or 41.2%, to $2.68 million for the fiscal year 2023, from $4.57 million for the fiscal year 2022, primarily due to decreased in share-based compensation of $2.8 million. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in staff salaries and related benefit expenses of $0.9 million due to full year impact of Oriental Wisdom staff expenses in 2023 as compared to six months impact in 2022 as Oriental Wisdom was newly acquired in June 2022. Interest Expenses Interest expenses increased by $0.15 million, or 112.1%, to $0.29 million for fiscal year 2023 from $0.14 million for fiscal year 2022, primarily due to interest expenses on short-term bank loan, loans from third parties and loans from related parties. Other Income (Expense) Other income was $0.12 million for fiscal year 2023, as compared to other expenses of $0.15 million for fiscal year 2022. Other income related to forfeiture of advance from a supplier of $0.1 million due to project cancellation. Other expenses in 2022 related to miscellaneous non-operating expenses incurred in 2022. Income Tax Expenses Income tax expenses were $1,973 and $0.46 million for fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022, respectively. The decrease in income tax expenses was due to a net loss incurred by the Company and its subsidiaries. Net Loss Net loss was $4.96 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to a net loss of $1.69 million for fiscal year 2022. Basic and diluted loss per share were $1.65 for fiscal year 2023, compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $1.94 for fiscal year 2022. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash of $20.34 million, compared to $12.12 million as of December 31, 2022. Net cash used in operating activities was $3.78 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $0.42 million for fiscal year 2022. Net cash used in investing activities was $2.24 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $32.55 million for fiscal year 2022. Net cash provided by financing activities was $12.72 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to $12.90 million for fiscal year 2022. Recent Development On December 28, 2023, the Company entered into a share transfer agreement (the ""Share Transfer Agreement"") with Wanwang and Xiaoshi Huang, pursuant to which the Company agreed to transfer all of the equity interests in Wanwang to Xiaoshi Huang in consideration for US$40 million.

The company's lead product candidate, LTI-03, is expected to deliver topline results from a Phase 1b study in the third quarter of 2024.

This is particularly noteworthy given the burn rate reflected in the reported R&D and G&A expenses. The reduction in R&D expenses, from $18.0 million in the full-year 2022 to $4.0 million in 2023, indicates a strategic pivot or scaling back of development activities, likely aligning with the company's focus on prioritizing its lung disease pipeline post-acquisition. The increased G&A expenses from $9.7 million in full-year 2022 to $11.4 million in full-year 2023 demonstrate the costs associated with integrating Lung Therapeutics.From an investor's perspective, the net loss widening from $4.5 million in Q4 2022 to $7.3 million in Q4 2023 raises concerns about profitability and sustainability. Still, the lower loss per share from the full-year perspective ($3.42 in 2023 vs. $6.02 in 2022) could indicate an improved financial discipline or impact from the recent financial transaction. Shareholders need to consider the company's strategy to manage expenditures and their expectations for revenue generation, especially with the upcoming clinical trial results. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of LTI-03 and LTI-01 into later stages of clinical trials is a critical juncture for Aileron. LTI-03's dual mechanism of action targeting both epithelial cells and fibroblasts could represent a significant therapeutic advance for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a condition with limited treatment options. The specific targeting of Caveolin-1-related pathways reveals Aileron's strategic focus on novel drug mechanisms. The anticipation of Phase 1b study results in the next year could serve as a catalyst for increased investor interest, especially if the data aligns with the preclinical findings.Investors should understand that orphan drug and Fast Track designations for LTI-01 signify both the unmet medical need and the potential for expedited development and review by regulatory agencies. However, the actual impact on the company's valuation will heavily depend on the outcomes of these trials and the regulatory path forward. It is the data from these trials that will inform the true potential of the company's pipeline to satisfy unmet medical needs and drive future revenue. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector, particularly the orphan drug space Aileron is targeting, is often characterized by high risk but potentially high reward. The acquisition of Lung Therapeutics appears to be a strategic move to strengthen Aileron's position in this niche market. The funds secured through the sale of Series X preferred stock and warrants, led by Bios Partners and Nantahala Capital, enhance the company's financial runway and support its strategic initiatives.Investors should monitor the evolving competitive landscape for IPF and LPE treatments. Adoption rates, pricing strategy and partnership opportunities post-trial results will be essential factors in assessing Aileron's market potential. The company's collaboration with key opinion leaders, as evidenced by their expert panel discussion, could bode well for market penetration and physician acceptance of their product candidates should they gain approval. 04/15/2024 - 05:20 PM Topline results from Phase 1b study of LTI-03, a novel Caveolin-1-related peptide in development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, expected to be reported in the third quarter of 2024 Cash runway expected to fund operations and key milestones into the fourth quarter of 2024 AUSTIN, Texas, April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aileron Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aileron”, the “Company”, “we”, “our” or “us”) (NASDAQ: ALRN), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a novel pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a business update. “We ended the year in a solid position after the successful completion of our merger with Lung Therapeutics, which provided a focused pipeline of promising clinical-stage candidates for life-threatening lung conditions, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet from the successful closure of a $18.4 million financing,” said Brian Windsor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Aileron. “We anticipate 2024 as a pivotal year of execution as we continue to progress our lead product candidate, LTI-03. We expect to report topline results from the ongoing Phase 1b study of LTI-03 in the third quarter of this year. LTI-03 and its potential dual mechanism of action on both epithelial cells and fibroblasts is gaining support from the medical community, and we look forward to building upon encouraging preclinical data that LTI-03 has the potential to protect healthy lung epithelial cells and to reduce pro-fibrotic signaling.” Recent Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones Corporate Updates In October 2023, Aileron acquired Lung Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lung”), shifting the Company’s disease focus to advance a pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis diseases. The Company’s lead clinical programs include LTI-03 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and LTI-01 for loculated pleural effusion (LPE).Immediately following the closing of Aileron’s acquisition of Lung (“Lung Acquisition”), the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of shares of its Series X non-voting convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of Aileron common stock in a private placement to a group of accredited investors led by Bios Partners, the majority stockholder of Lung prior to the Lung Acquisition, and including Nantahala Capital, as well as additional undisclosed investors. The private placement resulted in gross proceeds to Aileron of approximately $18 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses.In March 2024, the Company announced the appointment of Brian Windsor, Ph.D., as President and Chief Executive Officer and to the Board of Directors. Dr. Windsor previously served as Aileron’s Chief Operating Officer and President, and Chief Executive Officer and director of Lung. Pipeline In February 2024, Aileron hosted a pulmonary care expert panel to discuss the potential implications of LTI-03 for IPF, featuring pulmonary care experts Fernando J. Martinez, M.D., M.S., Chief of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division at Weill Cornell Medicine; Tejaswini Kulkarni, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine and Director of the Interstitial Lung Disease Program at University of Alabama at Birmingham Medicine; and Andreas Günther, M.D., Senior Physician of Pulmonology and Intensive Care Medicine and Chief Physician of Pulmonology and Internal Intensive Care Medicine at Agaplesion Evang. Central Hesse Hospital and Professor of Interstitial and Rare Lung Diseases at Justus Liebig University.

The company aims to deliver a reliable and advanced interceptor to protect the nation from long-range ballistic missile threats.","U.S. Missile Defense Agency selects Lockheed Martin to provide its Next Generation Interceptor Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Lockheed Martin has been selected by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to provide the Next Generation Interceptor, a cutting-edge missile defense system. The company aims to deliver a reliable and advanced interceptor to protect the nation from long-range ballistic missile threats. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The selection of Lockheed Martin to provide the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) represents a substantial commitment by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to advance national defense capabilities. This decision is likely to have significant financial implications for Lockheed Martin, considering the scale and longevity of defense contracts. The NGI program, being at the forefront of missile defense technology, indicates a step towards modernizing and potentially expanding the current Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system.In terms of market implications, such contracts typically result in long-term revenue streams for defense contractors. However, the cost efficiency and technological advances of the NGI program compared to legacy systems will be of interest to investors. Given the strategic nature of this defense contract, it is expected to have a positive impact on Lockheed Martin's stock, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to deliver complex defense solutions. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Lockheed Martin's role as the prime contractor for the NGI enhances its position in the defense sector and is expected to contribute positively to its earnings and cash flows. Defense contracts like this often involve substantial initial investments in research and development, followed by long-term, stable income once production and deployment commence. Both the scale of the contract and the reliability of government funding are elements that mitigate financial risk for Lockheed Martin.Investors should monitor the progression towards key project milestones such as the Critical Design Review and integration with the broader weapon system, as these can affect the timing of revenue recognition and project costs. Shareholders should also be aware of the potential for cost overruns and schedule delays, common risks in defense contracting that can impact financial projections and stock performance. 04/15/2024 - 05:45 PM HUNTSVILLE, Ala., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On April 15, the Missile Defense Agency selected Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] to deliver the nation's new homeland missile defense capability, the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). Lockheed Martin, as the MDA's NGI prime contractor, will provide the most modern, reliable, and technically advanced interceptor in the history of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. The multiple-kill vehicle interceptor is designed to protect the homeland against long range ballistic missile threats from rogue nations. ""Lockheed Martin is proud to partner with the MDA on a revolutionary interceptor to advance our nation's security. We are committed to delivering reliable interceptors that will seamlessly integrate with the GMD system and can rapidly evolve with the threat,"" said Sarah Hiza, vice president and general manager of Strategic and Missile Defense at Lockheed Martin. ""We stand ready to support our customer for decades to come with a solution capable of protecting the nation from current and future threats."" Protecting What Matters MostLockheed Martin remains focused on providing MDA an interceptor solution that is capable, mature, reliable, and affordable. The program continues on its path to the Critical Design Review, integration with the broader weapon system and flight testing. Lockheed Martin's NGI program embraces digital tools, processes, and technologies as an enabler to meet our customers' production needs today and well into the future. Lockheed Martin is committed to delivering the first NGI in advance of the warfighter's need. Partnering for the Future of Missile Defense Lockheed Martin has an extensive understanding of the end-to-end missile defense mission and is committed to maintaining a positive and transparent relationship with the MDA. For NGI, the company is leveraging investments in kill vehicle technology, combat-proven exo-atmospheric threat intercept experience, and nearly seven decades providing the nation with strategic missile systems. The company pioneered hit-to-kill intercept technologies our customers rely on today. New and modern Lockheed Martin facilities, built for the homeland missile defense mission, recently opened in Huntsville, Alabama and under construction in Courtland, Alabama represent corporate dedication to NGI. About Lockheed MartinLockheed Martin is a global defense technology company driving innovation and advancing scientific discovery. Our all-domain mission solutions and 21st Century Security® vision accelerate the delivery of transformative technologies to ensure those we serve always stay ahead of ready.

(CCEL) reported fiscal first quarter 2024 financial results with revenues of $7.85 million, a slight increase from the previous year. Net income was approximately $556,000, down from $767,000 in 2023 due to higher expenses. Positive Revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $7.85 million, a slight increase from $7.82 million in 2023. Net income for the three months ended February 29, 2024, was approximately $556,000, down from $767,000 in the same period in 2023. The increase in net income was attributed to a less than 1% increase in revenue, a 5% increase in cost of sales, and a 12% increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Research, development, and related engineering expenses increased to $503,000 for the three months ended February 29, 2024, compared to $79,000 in the same period in 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was due to the Clinical Study and Research Agreement with Duke and expenses related to the development of a manufacturing laboratory. Cryo-Cell International is the world's first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells, established in 1992. Negative Net income decreased from the previous year, indicating a potential financial challenge for the company. An increase in expenses, including cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses, may impact the company's profitability. The significant rise in research, development, and related engineering expenses could strain the company's financial resources. The slight increase in revenue may not be sufficient to offset the higher expenses incurred by the company. Financial Analyst Looking at Cryo-Cell International's recently reported fiscal first-quarter results from a financial perspective, the slight revenue growth from $7.82 million to $7.85 million year-over-year is a modest positive development. However, the increase in net income is not as robust as investors might prefer, dipping from $767,000 to $556,000. This decline in profitability, particularly when revenues are nearly static, suggests that the company's operating efficiency may be under pressure.Moreover, the substantial uptick in both cost of sales by 5% and selling, general and administrative expenses by 12% indicate escalating operational costs that the company is facing. This could be a cause for concern if the trend continues, as it may squeeze margins and affect future earnings potential. Biotechnology Market Analyst From a market standpoint, the significant increase in R&D expenditures from $79,000 to $503,000 is an important strategic move. Cryo-Cell is showing its commitment to innovation and its long-term vision by investing heavily in the Duke IMPACT study and in developing a manufacturing laboratory. These investments could yield new treatments and revenue streams, particularly in the high-growth area of regenerative medicine.Yet, it's important to note that such R&D projects carry significant risk and the payoffs are often long-term. Retail investors should be aware that the benefits of these investments may not be immediate and should weigh these R&D expenses against potential future benefits when considering Cryo-Cell's stock. 04/15/2024 - 05:00 PM OLDSMAR, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cryo-Cell International, Inc. (NYSE American LLC: CCEL ) (the “Company”), the world’s first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992, announced results for the fiscal first quarter ended February 29, 2024. Financial Results Revenue The revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $7.85 million compared to $7.82 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 consisted of $7.81 million in processing and storage fee revenue, $3,000 in product revenue and approximately $44,000 in public banking revenue compared to $7.56 million in processing and storage fees, approximately $32,000 in product revenue and approximately $231,000 in public banking revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net Income The Company reported net income of approximately $556,000 or $0.07 per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended February 29, 2024 compared to net income of approximately $767,000, or $0.09 per basic and diluted common share for the same period in 2023. Net income for the three months ended February 29, 2024, resulted from a less than 1% increase in revenue, an increase in cost of sales of 5% and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses of 12%. For the three months ended February 29, 2024, the Company recorded $503,000 in research, development and related engineering (“R&D”) expenses versus $79,000 for the three months ended February 28, 2023.

Zevra Therapeutics Presents New Data on the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Arimoclomol as a Treatment for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C at the SIMD 45th Annual Meeting,2024-04-15T21:01:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,Zevra Therapeutics presents new data on the long-term safety and efficacy of Arimoclomol as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C at the SIMD 45th Annual Meeting.,"Zevra Therapeutics Presents New Data on the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Arimoclomol as a Treatment for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C at the SIMD 45th Annual Meeting Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Zevra Therapeutics presents new data on the long-term safety and efficacy of Arimoclomol as a treatment for Niemann-Pick Disease Type C at the SIMD 45th Annual Meeting. Positive New long-term real-world data from Zevra's Expanded Access Program for Arimoclomol in treating Niemann-Pick Disease Type C was highlighted at the SIMD 45th Annual Meeting. The data showed a consistent safety profile and a clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression in adults with NPC. The presentation by Kristina Julich, M.D., showcased positive clinical benefits and added to the evidence supporting Arimoclomol's effectiveness in treating NPC. Zevra remains committed to collaborating with the FDA for the review of Arimoclomol's NDA ahead of the PDUFA date on September 21, 2024. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Arimoclomol's expanded access program (EAP) data contributes significantly to our understanding of long-term treatment effects for Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), a condition with limited therapeutic options. The data suggests that arimoclomol may stabilize disease progression in adults, which is noteworthy considering the progressive nature of NPC and the scarcity of effective treatments.As a Medical Research Analyst, the focus on the consistency of the safety profile is pivotal. A drug's safety profile is as important as its efficacy, especially for long-term treatments. From the data presented, arimoclomol appears to have a safety profile consistent with earlier trials, an encouraging sign for its continued development.Moreover, the mention of collaboration with the FDA and the upcoming PDUFA date provides a timeline for potential market entry, which, if positive, could affect Zevra Therapeutics' stock performance. If approved, arimoclomol could meet a high unmet medical need, potentially leading to significant revenue for Zevra Therapeutics in a niche market. Biotech Financial Analyst The presentation of arimoclomol's long-term data at prestigious meetings like SIMD and AANAM raises the visibility of Zevra Therapeutics within the investment community. Such visibility often correlates with increased investor confidence, particularly when the data supports both efficacy and safety over an extended period.Investors should note the upcoming PDUFA date as a critical milestone that could have a significant impact on the company's stock valuation. A positive FDA decision could lead to a sharp increase in Zevra's market capitalization, while a negative outcome might have the opposite effect. Considering the drug's potential in a market with unmet needs, approval could also attract partnership opportunities or even make Zevra a buyout target.It's also important to consider the market size for NPC treatments and potential sales figures, balanced against development costs and future research investments. The financial performance of biotech firms like Zevra is heavily influenced by their R&D pipeline's success, making these clinical updates critical for investors. 04/15/2024 - 05:01 PM The oral presentation highlighted data from Zevra’s Expanded Access Program demonstrating a consistent safety profile CELEBRATION, Fla., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ZVRA) (Zevra, or the Company), a rare disease therapeutics company, today announced that new long-term real-world data from the arimoclomol expanded access program (EAP: NCT04316637) for the treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) was featured in an oral presentation during the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) 45th Annual Meeting taking place at the Sheraton/Le Meridien Charlotte Hotel Complex in Charlotte, NC, from April 14-17, 2024. “These real-world data collected in the arimoclomol US EAP represent the first evidence to support the use of arimoclomol in adults with NPC, demonstrating a clinically meaningful slowing of disease progression,” noted Kristina Julich, M.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Neurology, at The University of Texas at Austin, Dell Medical School. “NPC presents a therapeutic challenge, lacking approved treatment options in the U.S. and invariably leading to progressive loss of independence due to physical and cognitive impairments. We are very pleased with the positive new data that brings hope for a community with a high unmet medical need.” “These observed long-term clinical benefits add to the body of evidence for arimoclomol that supports its tolerability and effectiveness in the treatment of NPC, bringing us one step closer to helping patients suffering from this relentless and fatal disease,” remarked Neil F. McFarlane, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zevra. “We remain committed to continue collaborating closely with the FDA as it reviews arimoclomol's NDA ahead of our PDUFA date on September 21, 2024.” Highlights from the Presentation: The results were presented by Kristina Julich, M.D., Chief, Neurogenetics Center, and Assistant Professor of Pediatric Neurosciences at Dell Medical School from The University of Texas. The first patient in the EAP was enrolled in June 2020. As of July 19, 2023, 41 participants from 11 U.S. centers were ≥18 years at arimoclomol initiation; 26 had baseline Physician-reported 5-domain NPC Clinical Severity Scale (5DNPCCS) assessments with ≥1 year of follow-up. Among these 26 adults, mean (standard deviation, SD) age at NPC diagnosis and arimoclomol initiation was 23.7 (9.0) and 28.5 (6.5) years, respectively. Patients continued arimoclomol treatment for a mean of 21 months (range: 12-32) and 69% (18/26) had recorded miglustat use. Adults treated with arimoclomol, including those with and without miglustat use, generally had a stable disease course over two years of treatment and follow-up and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the Phase 2/3 study where no new safety adverse events were identified. In addition to this scientific presentation, Marc C. Patterson, MD, Professor of Pediatrics at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, also presented the data at the 2024 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting (AANAM), during the Society Spotlight: Child Neurology Society session. Dr. Patterson’s talk was entitled “Evaluation of the Long-Term Effect of Arimoclomol in NPC - 48 Months Data from CT-ORZY-NPC-002.” About Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an ultra-rare, progressive, and neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and other lipids within the cell, leading to an accumulation of these substances in various tissue areas, including brain tissue. The disease is caused by mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes, which are responsible for making lysosomal proteins. Both children and adults can be affected by NPC with varying clinical presentations. Those living with NPC lose independence due to physical and cognitive limitations, with key neurological impairments presenting in speech, cognition, swallowing, ambulation, and fine motor skills. Disease progression is irreversible and can be fatal within months or take years to be diagnosed and advance in severity. About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol, Zevra’s orally delivered, first-in-class investigational product candidate for the treatment of NPC, has been granted Orphan Drug designation, Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA, and Orphan Medicinal Product designation for the treatment of NPC by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The FDA has accepted the resubmission of the NDA for arimoclomol and has set a user fee goal date (PDUFA date) of September 21, 2024.

Negative None. Financial Analyst NuStar Energy L.P.'s announcement of a conditional special distribution is a strategic move that hinges on a pivotal upcoming event – the approval of its acquisition by Sunoco LP. Investors should note the conditionality of this distribution, which is not a guaranteed payout but rather contingent upon the completion of the acquisition. This scenario presents a speculative element; if the acquisition is not approved, the special distribution may be delayed or completely off the table. Such conditional distributions can lead to increased volatility in stock prices as investors react to the unfolding developments. M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) Expert The proposed acquisition of NuStar Energy L.P. by Sunoco LP marks significant industry consolidation that may result in operational synergies and expanded market reach for the combined entity. However, for current NuStar shareholders, the critical factor is the approval of the acquisition itself, which will determine the payout of the special distribution. This can be seen as an incentive for shareholders to vote in favor of the acquisition. It's essential to analyze the terms and potential strategic benefits of the merger to understand whether the long-term advantages outweigh the immediate financial incentive provided by the special distribution. Tax Expert It's important for investors, especially those based internationally, to pay attention to the tax implications of such distributions. NuStar Energy L.P.’s notice emphasizes that 100% of its distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective rate. This stipulation may affect the net income received by international shareholders and could influence their investment decisions, particularly in the context of the special distribution's conditionality. 04/15/2024 - 04:52 PM SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NuStar Energy L.P.

The company is on track to meet its full-year 2024 production guidance of 220,000 to 240,000 ounces. Expansion projects at Segovia and Marmato mines are progressing well, aiming for 500,000 ounces of production in 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining the recent operational performance and growth strategy of Aris Mining is imperative for understanding their potential market position. The reported production of 50,768 ounces of gold in the first quarter is a tangible measure of current capabilities. This figure, in conjunction with the full-year production guidance of 220,000 to 240,000 ounces, provides a clear production trajectory. Investors should note the consistency in processed gold grades, here at 9.4 g/t from the Segovia mine, which suggests operational stability.Furthermore, the significance of the expansion projects cannot be understated. Increasing the Segovia processing capacity and advancing the Marmato Lower Mine show a strategic move towards scaling operations. The long-term goal to boost production to 500,000 ounces by 2026 signals aggressive growth, but it's important to consider the capital expenditure and potential operational risks associated with such expansions. Delays or cost overruns in these projects could impact future earnings and thus investor returns. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, achieving the forecasted production levels is essential for the company's revenue stream. The reported alignment with budget expectations in Q1 is a positive indicator of financial management. Yet, investors should scrutinize the company's quarterly financial statements for cost implications of the planned maintenance and the capital investment in expansion projects. The efficiency of the firm's capital allocation towards these projects will be a determinant in their ability to meet the ambitious 2026 production target.Additionally, the gold mining sector is influenced by gold prices, which are subject to international market fluctuations. Investors would be wise to monitor these trends, as any significant changes could alter the anticipated return on investment. The company's hedging strategies against price volatility should also be a point of consideration. Mining Expert An insight into the technical aspects of Aris Mining's operations reveals key points for consideration. The Segovia mine's transition to higher-grade zones in later quarters is a strategic move, as higher-grade ore generally leads to more efficient production and better margins. The finalized geotechnical studies and the ongoing engineering and design phases are critical steps in de-risking the expansion projects.However, the complexities involved in scaling up mining operations should not be overlooked. For instance, the construction of new infrastructure, such as the portal and decline at the Marmato Lower Mine, requires meticulous planning and execution. Potential geological challenges or unforeseen environmental issues could impact the project timelines. Investors should recognize the inherent risks of mining activities, which can affect both the short-term and long-term profitability of the company. 04/15/2024 - 05:00 PM VANCOUVER, BC, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Aris Mining Corporation (Aris Mining or the Company) (TSX: ARIS) (NYSE-A: ARMN) announces its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (Q1 2024). Neil Woodyer, CEO of Aris Mining, commented ""In line with our budget, our mines produced 50,768 ounces of gold in Q1. Plant throughput was slightly reduced in Q1 because of planned maintenance at the Segovia processing facility and we achieved averaged processed gold grades of 9.4 g/t, consistent with our Segovia mine plan. Our gold production is scheduled to increase from Q2 to Q4 as the Segovia mine plan progresses to higher-grade zones, and we are on-track to deliver full year 2024 production guidance of 220,000 to 240,000 ounces. In addition, we are pleased with the progress of the expansion projects at the Segovia and Marmato mines. Following completion of the expansions, Aris Mining is targeting 500,000 ounces of production in 2026. At the Segovia expansion project, which includes increasing processing capacity from 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes per day, geotechnical studies for the plant area have been finalized, engineering and design is well underway, and preparations for the new installations are progressing smoothly. Once complete, Segovia is expected to produce over 300,000 ounces per year. At the Marmato Lower Mine expansion project, the access road to the new processing facility area is now complete and earthworks in the plant area will commence soon. The contractor for the new portal and decline is fully mobilized and cutting of the portal face has commenced. Once complete, the Marmato Upper and Lower mines are expected to produce 162,000 ounces per year over a 20-year mine life.""

The company focuses on decentralized production for cell and gene therapies, aiming to reduce costs and expand production capacity. Despite industry challenges, Orgenesis remains optimistic about the future, leveraging grants and partnerships to advance its therapeutic pipeline and meet growing demand. Positive None. Negative None. Biotechnology Industry Analyst Orgenesis Inc.'s recent business update underscores a strategic pivot towards full ownership of Octomera, which could enhance their operational control and synergy within their CGT processing capabilities. This is a substantial move for a company in the biotech sector, specifically within the promising yet capital-intensive cell and gene therapy segment. The specialty of CGT is the development of personalized medicines, which have shown the potential for curative effects in some cases, but face challenges in terms of cost and production scalability.Their approach to decentralized production through Orgenesis Mobile Processing Units and Labs (OMPULs) may disrupt traditional centralized production methods. By placing these units closer to the point of care, Orgenesis positions itself to potentially reduce lead times and costs associated with cell therapies. This could be particularly transformative for therapies like CAR-T, which have hitherto been logistically complex and expensive to produce and administer.The strategic collaboration agreement, which includes initial payments of over $8 million, signifies a bolstering of the company’s financial position. It provides non-dilutive capital, which is essential for a biotech firm since it avoids shareholder dilution, preserving value. Furthermore, the significant premium paid on new investments could be interpreted as investor confidence in Orgenesis' direction and technology. However, investors must weigh this against potential risks, such as the execution challenges associated with implementing a decentralized production model and the broader funding environment for early-stage development companies in the cell and gene sector. Financial Analyst The investment of $2.3 million at a 50% premium to the market price is indicative of strong investor confidence in Orgenesis’ business model and future prospects. It represents an infusion of capital at favorable terms for the company, a robust signal in the financial markets. However, the reliance on future collaboration payments and grant funding to advance the pipeline suggests that the company's financial health is still partly contingent on successful milestones and partnerships.From a valuation standpoint, the receipt of collaboration payments in excess of $6 million is a positive indicator and the strategic collaboration agreement may provide sustained financial benefits over the 10-year period. Nevertheless, it is critical to monitor how the capital raised will be allocated, especially regarding the advancement of their immune-oncology pipeline and the deployment of OMPULs internationally. The balance between aggressive growth and prudent financial management will be key in determining Orgenesis' ability to optimize shareholder value in both the short and long term. Healthcare Market Research Analyst Orgenesis’ dedication to decentralized production of ATMPs, such as CAR-T therapies, aligns with global healthcare trends emphasizing personalized medicine and localized treatment. This positions the company favorably within the healthcare innovation ecosystem. The move to regain full control of Octomera and subsequent strategic collaborations to enhance the production and distribution capabilities of OMPULs might address capacity and cost constraints faced in the healthcare industry.Moreover, the government grants to support decentralized production technologies signal regulatory support and potential for policy-driven market opportunities. Being awarded these grants not only financially supports Orgenesis but also adds an additional layer of credibility to their business model and technology. It is important to track how these initiatives translate into tangible product advancements and market adoption, which will be pivotal in assessing the long-term viability and impact of Orgenesis in the cell and gene therapy market. 04/15/2024 - 05:07 PM Major transformation underway commencing with recent acquisitionreasserting full ownership and control over Octomera Secured a $2.3 million investment from a group including sophisticated healthcare professionals at $1.03 per share and accompanying warrants, a more than 50% premium to prior-day closing price Entered into asset purchase and strategic collaboration agreement which will provide Octomera with over $8 million of initial collaboration payments GERMANTOWN, Md., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orgenesis Inc. (NASDAQ: ORGS) (“Orgenesis” or the “Company”), a global biotech company working to unlock the full potential of cell and gene therapies (CGT) in order to improve access and outcomes in healthcare, today provided a business update for the year ended December 31, 2023. “Orgenesis is a company that has set as its goal to make cell and gene therapies available and affordable. The cell and gene industry has continued to grow year over year driven by the curative potential of these groundbreaking therapies, and yet, the challenges of reducing costs of products and the ability to enable quick expansion of production capacity have not been overcome,” commented Vered Caplan, CEO of Orgenesis. “The Company has pioneered decentralized production for these personalized therapies by setting up what we believe is the only existing global decentralized production platform with a capability to accommodate a wide-range of therapies. We continue to invest in expanding the platform and validating our decentralized approach so that it can serve as a viable and cost-effective solution to the industry.” “Unfortunately, the last year was an extremely difficult one for the industry. Although there has been widespread acceptance of the field with multiple approvals of new products, the lack of funding has hit early-stage development companies the hardest. A majority of Octomera’s customers fall into the early-stage category. Many of them are innovative companies that are developing potentially lifesaving therapies that have based their entire development on a decentralized strategy and invested millions of dollars by means of service payments to Octomera.” “Even as we continue to engage these customers, we are taking a conservative accounting approach as to their future outlook. We remain hopeful that, as the funding environment improves, they will secure additional funding and thank them for their bedrock support in turning decentralized supply into a reality for the industry. Moreover, with new regulatory initiatives underway that align with our decentralized approach, we believe both the public and private sectors are now acutely aware of the need to address industry-wide capacity and cost constraints. Stakeholders are realizing that decentralized production is an undeniable reality, making it not only a viable option, but a critical pathway for the long-term success of this industry.” ”We are appreciative of our dedicated employees, suppliers, partners and investors who have stood by us, realizing both our potential and the significance of our achievements. With their unwavering support, we have not only survived, but are poised for growth, with major initiatives now underway that we expect will transform the Company.” “Looking forward, our first major step in the transformation was the recent transaction to regain 100% ownership of Octomera, our strategic CGT processing subsidiary. We believe that the Octomera platform featuring the Orgenesis Mobile Processing Units and Labs (OMPULs)not only provides a synergistic solution for our products, but provides the wider industry a rapid, standardized industrial cleanroom alternative at or near the point of care, which can be rapidly deployed and scaled at a significantly lower cost than centralized production.” “Leveraging our decentralized services platform, we are advancing our therapeutic pipeline with a focus on our immune-oncology portfolio while leveraging non-dilutive grants to fund a significant portion of our activities. As a recent example of the broad pipeline of grants awarded but not fully spent, an Orgenesis’ consortium was awarded two grants from the Walloon Government in Belgium for a total of €3.5M EUR to advance technologies for the decentralized production of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), as well as the development of therapeutic exosomes that can be utilized for immuno-oncology, gene and cell therapies, and tissue regeneration."" ""Most notably, the grant funding accelerates the placement of a CAR-T dedicated OMPUL in Belgium, an important step in making more affordable and more advanced CAR-T therapies available in the region. Overall, we believe our therapeutic pipeline holds substantial potential and we look forward to announcing upcoming developments that will shed further light on our immuno-oncology progress and plans.” Victor Miller, Chief Financial Officer of Orgenesis, further noted, “To support our growth plans, we recently secured an investment of $2.3 million from a group of accredited investors, including a group of sophisticated, long-term healthcare professionals,at a purchase price of $1.03 per share and accompanying warrants, which was a more than 50% premium to the prior day closing price, which we believe is a strong validation of our business model. We also entered into a strategic collaboration agreement that we believe will substantially enhance our ability to meet the demand for OMPULs and add a commercial footprint to service our customers. Under this 10-year strategic collaboration agreement, our partner will manufacture, co-market, distribute and service OMPULs. The $8,340,000 non-dilutive payments to be paid under the agreement reduces our capital requirements while accelerating the rollout of OMPULs around the world.” “I am encouraged by the global demand I have witnessed firsthand, coupled with our cell processing expertise and the extraordinary talent that has been assembled within the organization. We are rapidly advancing our proprietary portfolio of potential therapies, which have the potential to help make our goal of improving access and outcomes in healthcare a reality. We believe that we are now on more solid financial footing having already received collaboration payments in excess of $6 million. We look forward to unleashing Orgenesis’ full potential in our efforts to optimize shareholder value.” The complete financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 are available on the Company’s website in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"JBG Smith Achieves Goal to Preserve 3,000 Housing Units With Washington Housing Initiative Impact Pool",2024-04-15T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"JBG Smith surpasses goal to preserve 3,000 housing units with Impact Pool, investing in Franklin Apartments and other properties across Washington region.","JBG Smith Achieves Goal to Preserve 3,000 Housing Units With Washington Housing Initiative Impact Pool Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary JBG Smith surpasses goal to preserve 3,000 housing units with Impact Pool, investing in Franklin Apartments and other properties across Washington region. Positive JBG Smith's Impact Pool has exceeded its target of creating and preserving 3,000 affordable housing units by 2025, achieving this milestone ahead of schedule. The Impact Pool has invested in various properties, including the Franklin Apartments in Takoma Park, MD, to combat the loss of housing for middle-income families. The Franklin Apartments investment exemplifies the Impact Pool's mission to preserve affordable housing units and provide resources for residents to age in-place. JBG Smith's collaboration with Montgomery Housing Partnership (MHP) and other mission-driven sponsors reinforces their commitment to preventing displacement and preserving affordability in the Washington region. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst Observing the recent achievements of JBG Smith's Impact Pool, the acceleration of their affordable housing goals holds significance for both the local community and investors. Achieving the target of preserving over 3,000 housing units well before the 2025 deadline indicates strong operational capabilities and a successful investment strategy. This proactive approach in the affordable housing segment, often characterized by tight margins and high regulatory complexity, can lead to long-term stability for the firm, as it solidifies their position as a socially responsible entity. The surplus capital suggests potential for further growth opportunities within their portfolio.Furthermore, the partnership with Montgomery Housing Partnership (MHP) underlines an effective collaboration with non-profit entities, which often unlocks access to various subsidies and grants, improving the financial viability of such projects. The dual approach of leveraging private capital and non-profit collaboration may set a precedent in the real estate investment sector, especially in high-demand metro areas facing affordable housing shortages. Financial Analyst The financial structure highlighted by the Impact Pool's recent deal, involving mezzanine financing and Freddie Mac loans, is critical to assess. Mezzanine financing is a hybrid of debt and equity financing that provides lenders with rights to convert to an ownership or equity interest in the company in case of default, after senior debt holders are paid. This form of financing is higher risk than senior debt but provides higher returns, which can be attractive to certain investors.The Impact Pool's ability to secure a $26.2 million Freddie Mac loan also signals confidence by institutional lenders in the viability of their affordable housing investments. The extension of a soft loan from Montgomery County is an additional positive indicator, not only of the project's social value but also of its financial prudence. Investors would find such information reassuring, as it reflects a diversified risk profile and a strategic approach to funding. Market Research Analyst With an emphasis on the loss of naturally occurring affordable housing units, JBG Smith's strategy aligns with market needs. The specific focus on workforce housing caters to a critical segment of the market that often falls between the cracks—too high a salary for subsidized housing yet unable to afford market-rate rents in urban areas. The Impact Pool's success could signal an attractive market niche for other investors seeking socially responsible investment opportunities with stable returns.The societal impact, coupled with the potential economic benefits of stable, affordable housing—such as reduced employee turnover and increased local spending power—should not be underestimated.

Investing at scale allows us to have a meaningful impact, and this milestone reinforces our commitment to preventing displacement and preserving affordability in rapidly changing neighborhoods vulnerable to rising housing costs. Consequently, we plan to continue to finance workforce housing through other vehicles even after the Impact Pool’s funds have been fully deployed.” The 3,000+ units include: Parkstone Alexandria (Alexandria, VA) 326 units; Crystal House (Arlington, VA) 825 units; Hamilton Manor (Hyattsville, MD) 245 units; Huntwood Courts (Washington, DC) 214 units; Earle Manor (Wheaton, MD) 140 units; The Gale Eckington (Washington, DC) 603 Units; Loree Grand (Washington, DC) 212 units; Falkland Chase (Silver Spring, MD) 268 units; Franklin Apartments (Takoma Park, MD) 185 units. Launched by JBG SMITH in 2019, the Impact Pool is a key component of the Washington Housing Initiative (WHI) created by JBG SMITH and the Federal City Council. The Impact Pool, managed by a subsidiary of JBG SMITH, leverages private capital to help combat the loss of housing for middle-income families. The Impact Pool works with non-profit and for-profit mission driven sponsors to acquire privately owned and unsubsidized housing that’s affordable to everyday working households, lock in affordability, invest in the buildings, and operate them using strategies designed to stabilize residents rather than push rents. The Impact Pool surpassed its goal with the deployment of $6 million in mezzanine financing to Montgomery Housing Partnership (MHP) for the refinancing of Franklin Apartments, a 185-unit age-restricted housing community in Takoma Park, MD. Concurrent with the closing of the Impact Pool’s loan, the property obtained a new $26.2 million Freddie Mac loan, provided by Key Bank, along with an extension of an existing $3.75 million soft loan from Montgomery County. “The Franklin Apartments investment is a perfect example of what we sought to accomplish when we created the Impact Pool. Montgomery County is projected to lose up to 11,000 naturally occurring affordable housing units by 2030. Our collaboration with a non-profit owner, dedicated to the property’s preservation, will provide residents with the ability to age in-place in a resource rich neighborhood of Montgomery County,” commented Jackson. Located at 7620 Maple Avenue in Takoma Park, MD, the Class B mid-rise Franklin Apartments was built in 1952 and renovated in 2011. The building was acquired by MHP in 2022 and is currently managed by Humphrey Management. The property includes 135 parking spots, green community features, a grilling area, and multi-purpose entertainment room and is pet friendly. MHP provides onsite resources to residents including the operation of a food pantry, health and safety seminars, and programming. MHP is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization serving more than 4,000 residents of Montgomery County and neighboring communities by providing more than 2,880 quality affordable homes. The organization is committed to housing people, empowering families, and strengthening neighborhoods. Since 1989, MHP’s mission has been to preserve and expand access to quality, affordable housing. The Impact Pool previously partnered with MHP to provide financing for the 140-unit Earle Manor apartments, located in Wheaton, MD. About the Impact Pool The Washington Housing Initiative Impact Pool is an approximately $115 million investment vehicle that targets after-tax returns equivalent to many traditional investment funds. The Impact Pool is managed by JBG SMITH Impact Manager, a subsidiary of JBG SMITH Properties. To date, the Impact Pool has invested in more than 3,000 units across DC, Maryland and Virginia.

Owens Corning Commences Tender Offer and Masonite Commences Consent Solicitation,2024-04-15T20:10:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Owens Corning and Masonite International  have announced a Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation in connection with Owens Corning's anticipated acquisition of Masonite. The offer involves the purchase of outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2028 issued by Masonite. The Total Consideration for the notes is $1,003.75 per $1,000 Principal Amount, with an Early Participation Payment of $30.00.

The Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation are subject to specific conditions and deadlines, with Holders eligible to receive the Total Consideration if they tender their notes by certain dates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company like Owens Corning announces a tender offer, it often indicates a strategic maneuver to restructure its debt ahead of significant corporate actions, in this case, the acquisition of Masonite. The tender offer for the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2028 could be a move to alleviate potentially unfavorable financing terms or reduce future interest payments. By adjusting these debt obligations, Owens Corning could be trying to optimize its capital structure, reflecting on the company's proactive financial management and possibly leading to a more favorable view from investors.Additionally, by setting an early participation payment, the company incentivizes quick response from note holders, which could accelerate the process and provide Owens Corning with a clearer financial picture sooner. However, investors should consider the potential risks associated with such debt restructuring, such as the chance of not reaching the requisite participation level or the implications of the consent solicitation on the company's governance flexibility post-acquisition. M&A Legal Expert In the context of a pending acquisition, managing consent solicitations is a delicate legal process. It involves negotiating with debt holders to amend covenants and restrictions, which indicates Owens Corning's intention to realign Masonite's debt framework with its own operational strategies post-acquisition. These Proposed Amendments hint at a desire for greater strategic freedom, which could bode well for the execution of Owens Corning's long-term vision for integrating Masonite.However, the requirement of majority consent from note holders adds a layer of uncertainty to the process. The successful amendment of the Masonite Indenture is important from a legal standpoint, as it could affect Owens Corning's liability and operational latitude. Investors should be aware of the legal intricacies of these amendments and monitor the consent solicitation's progress, as it may impact the company's post-acquisition strategy and eventual financial performance. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Masonite by Owens Corning is poised to have industry-wide implications, potentially consolidating Owens Corning's position in the building and construction material sector. This tender offer may be perceived as a confident stride towards a successful acquisition. Its outcome could provide insights into market sentiment regarding Masonite's valuation and Owens Corning's strategic direction following the acquisition.Market reception to the tender offer and consent solicitation, especially concerning the early participation payment, will also illustrate the current investment climate and the appetite for corporate bonds amidst industry peers. The impact of these developments on both Owens Corning’s and Masonite’s stock could vary, but a successful tender offer might indicate strong post-merger prospects, which could be interpreted positively by the market. 04/15/2024 - 04:10 PM TOLEDO, Ohio & TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owens Corning (NYSE: OC), a leader in global building and construction materials, and Masonite International Corporation (“Masonite”) (NYSE: DOOR), a leading global provider of interior and exterior doors and door systems, today announced that Owens Corning has commenced an offer to purchase for cash (the “Tender Offer”) any and all outstanding 5.375% Senior Notes due 2028 issued by Masonite (the “Masonite Notes”) in connection with Owens Corning’s anticipated acquisition of Masonite.

Patrick, Tidewater President. “We have proactively installed ion exchange resin for PFAS treatment at four locations. We continue to monitor our water supplies to ensure compliance with the new EPA regulations.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 04:10 PM WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Trustees of First Trust Energy Infrastructure Fund (the ""Fund"") (NYSE: FIF), CUSIP 33738C103, previously approved a managed distribution policy for the Fund (the ""Managed Distribution Plan"") in reliance on exemptive relief received from the Securities and Exchange Commission which permits the Fund to make periodic distributions of long-term capital gains as frequently as monthly each tax year. The Fund has declared a distribution payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of April 2, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of April 1, 2024. This Notice is meant to provide you information about the sources of your Fund’s distributions. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of its distribution or from the terms of its Managed Distribution Plan. The following tables set forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date for the Fund from the following sources: net investment income (""NII""); net realized short-term capital gains (""STCG""); net realized long-term capital gains (""LTCG""); and return of capital (""ROC""). These estimates are based upon information as of March 31, 2024, are calculated based on a generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") basis and include the prior fiscal year-end undistributed net investment income.

(2) The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ""yield"" or ""income."" (3) Based on Net Asset Value (""NAV"") as of March 31, 2024. (4) Total Returns are through March 31, 2024. (5) The Fund anticipates that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by Master Limited Partnerships in which the Fund invests, a portion of distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. You should not use this Notice as a substitute for your Form 1099-DIV. First Trust Advisors L.P. (""FTA"") is a federally registered investment advisor and serves as the Fund's investment advisor. FTA and its affiliate First Trust Portfolios L.P. (""FTP""), a FINRA registered broker-dealer, are privately-held companies that provide a variety of investment services. FTA has collective assets under management or supervision of approximately $226 billion as of March 28, 2024 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts. FTA is the supervisor of the First Trust unit investment trusts, while FTP is the sponsor. FTP is also a distributor of mutual fund shares and exchange-traded fund creation units. FTA and FTP are based in Wheaton, Illinois. Energy Income Partners, LLC (""EIP"") serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and other energy infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors specializing in this area. As of March 31, 2024, EIP managed or supervised approximately $5.4 billion in client assets. Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. Investments in securities of MLPs involve certain risks different from or in addition to the risks of investing in common stocks. The number of energy-related MLPs has declined since 2014. The industry is witnessing the consolidation or simplification of corporate structures where the MLP sleeve of capital is being eliminated. As a result of the foregoing, the Fund's MLP investments could become less diverse and the Fund may increase its non-MLP investments consistent with its investment objective and policies. Changes in tax laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof in the future, could adversely affect the Fund or the MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utility companies in which the Fund invests. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework. Financial professionals are responsible for evaluating investment risks independently and for exercising independent judgment in determining whether investments are appropriate for their clients.

Former Fund shareholders will hold shares of JGYIX, an open-end fund with approximately $1.17 billion in net assets. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposed merger of John Hancock Tax-Advantaged Global Shareholder Yield Fund into John Hancock Global Shareholder Yield Fund represents a strategic consolidation that may result in operational efficiencies and a streamlined fund offering for investors. Considering the Fund's aim to provide total return with a focus on tax-advantaged income, the merger could potentially enhance the value proposition to current and prospective shareholders by offering a more focused investment strategy under the larger umbrella of JGYIX.Investors should note the cessation of trading on the NYSE for the Fund, as it could influence the liquidity and marketability of their investments in the short term. Over the long term, the reorganization into an open-end fund like JGYIX may provide shareholders with increased flexibility in terms of share redemption, potentially improving liquidity. However, transitional costs associated with the merger could affect net asset values in the short term.It is imperative for investors to understand that the tax-advantaged nature of the Fund's returns is a key feature that might align well with their portfolio strategies, especially for those in higher tax brackets seeking to minimize the impact of federal income tax on investment income and gains. Market Research Analyst With $1.17 billion in net assets, JGYIX positions itself as a substantial player in the closed-end fund space. The fund's reorganization could resonate positively in the market by potentially attracting a broader investor base.

The updated release reads: MITEK REPORTS FISCAL 2024 FIRST QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES PRELIMINARY SECOND QUARTER REVENUE RESULTS Company Reiterates Guidance for Fiscal 2024 Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MITK, www.miteksystems.com, “Mitek” or the “Company”), a global leader in digital identity and fraud prevention, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2023, and provided select preliminary results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2024. Mitek also reiterated its previously provided guidance for its 2024 fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Financial Results Total revenue was $36.9 million, compared to $45.7 million a year ago. GAAP operating loss was $6.9 million, an operating margin of negative 19%, compared to GAAP operating income of $8.4 million, an operating margin of 18% a year ago. GAAP net loss was $5.8 million, or negative $0.13 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $4.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 15%, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 million and a non-GAAP operating margin of 40% last year. Non-GAAP net income was $6.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $14.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share last year. Cash flow from operations was a negative $9.5 million, primarily driven by $7.8 million in cash taxes paid for FY2023 during the quarter. Total cash and investments was $123.9 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $134.9 million on September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the $7.8 million cash taxes paid mentioned above and $4.6 million in cash paid for the final ID R&D earnout payment. Preliminary Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Revenue Results Mitek expects fiscal second quarter revenue to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The Company’s independent auditor has not reviewed or audited these preliminary estimated financial results. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from these preliminary financial results, and may be outside the estimated ranges. This preliminary financial data has been prepared by and is the responsibility of the Company. The Company has not fully completed its review of these preliminary financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. Mitek CEO Max Carnecchia’s Comments “As previously discussed, in the first quarter of last year we had a large one-time multi-year mobile deposit reorder that pulled forward about $7 million of future year revenue into that quarter, including $2.7 million that would have been recognized in fiscal Q1’24, creating a very difficult year over year comparison. It’s important to note that this quarter’s results are not representative of a business trend, in fact, to the contrary. With our fiscal 2024 guidance, which we are reiterating today, we expect our Deposits product revenue to grow 10 to 12% year over year on a normalized basis and our Identity product revenue to grow 10 to 12% year over year. We anticipate that much of this growth will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, with growth continuing in fiscal 2025. Having achieved product market fit with our new products, including Check Fraud Defender, MiVIP, MiPass and ID R&D biometrics software products, we have several growth drivers in place leveraging advanced AI and machine learning to meet evolving customer needs to enhance trust and convenience in digital interactions.” Fiscal 2024 Full Year Guidance Mitek is reiterating its previously provided guidance for its fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, as follows: Mitek expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $180.0 million to $185.0 million, a 6% growth rate at the midpoint of the range. In fiscal 2023, Mitek signed a large multi-year mobile deposit reorder with one customer that locked in favorable pricing over a four-year period. Due to the unique terms of this contract, Mitek recognized additional license revenue relating to future years of approximately $7.0 million in fiscal 2023. If the Company backs out the future year revenue of $7 million from its fiscal 2023 revenue and attributes the $2.7 million that would have been attributable to fiscal 2024 to the midpoint of the fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, it would represent growth of approximately 12.0% at the revised midpoint. Mitek expects its non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 to be between 30.0% and 31.0%. Conference Call Information Mitek management will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss the Company’s financial results for the first quarter ending December 31, 2023.

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements Statements contained in this news release relating to the Company or its management’s intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future, including, but not limited to, statements relating to the Company’s select preliminary revenue results for the second quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company’s fiscal 2024 guidance, its expectation regarding timing of revenue growth, its intent to use its growth drivers in place that leverage advanced AI and machine learning to meet evolving customer needs and its intent to enhance trust and convenience in digital interactions, are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to the Company’s ability to withstand negative conditions in the global economy, a lack of demand for or market acceptance of the Company’s products, the impact of the Company’s acquisition of HooYu Ltd. including any operational or cultural difficulties associated with the integration of the businesses of Mitek and HooYu Ltd., the Company’s ability to continue to develop, produce and introduce innovative new products in a timely manner, the Company’s ability to capitalize on a growing market, quarterly variations in revenue, the profitability of certain sectors of the Company, the performance of the Company’s growth initiatives, the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation, and the timing of the implementation and launch of the Company’s products by the Company’s signed customers. Additional risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are contained from time to time in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, but not limited to, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2024 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Collectively, these risks and uncertainties could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in its forward-looking statements and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update, amend or clarify these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release contains non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude acquisition-related costs and expenses, litigation and other legal costs, executive transition costs, stock compensation expense, non-recurring audit fees, enterprise risk, portfolio positioning and other related costs, and restructuring costs. These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors of the Company utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company’s comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of its forward outlook for non-GAAP operating margin with its forward-looking GAAP operating margin in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to quantify share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from our non-GAAP operating margin, as it requires additional inputs such as the number of shares granted and market prices that are not ascertainable due to the volatility of the Company’s share price. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company’s operations are in foreign countries and the transactional currencies are primarily Euros and British pound sterling and the Company is not able to predict fluctuations in those currencies without unreasonable efforts.

The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated annual tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances, and the utilization of research and development tax credits which currently have an overall effect of reducing taxes payable. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net income for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 23% and 28%, respectively. MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.

Additionally, our hotel roll-up strategy, the Caliber Hospitality Trust (“CHT”), offers Caliber an attractive vehicle to grow AUM with income-producing hotels.” Loeffler continued, “The strategic investments we made to scale our business last year coincided with macroeconomic headwinds and a challenging fundraising environment. While we remain confident in Caliber’s growth prospects, we are committed to ensuring we grow profitably. To that end, we have initiated a review of our current cost structure and will be evaluating potential measures that reflect current market dynamics. “We remain focused on meeting the three-year financial targets we announced in November 2023, which include achieving cumulative fundraising of $750 million from 2024 to 2026, increasing our AUM to $3 billion by year-end 2026, and generating annualized Platform Revenue of $50 million by year-end 2026. These ambitious targets underscore our commitment to deliver consistent growth and returns to our shareholders over the long term.” Business Update The following are key milestones completed during and subsequent to the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. On October 13, 2023, Northsight Crossing AZ, LLC, a Caliber co-sponsored single asset syndication, sold Northsight Crossing Retail Center in Scottsdale, Ariz., for $27.4 million, resulting in cash proceeds, net of loan repayment, closing costs and fees, of approximately $12.2 million, a gain on the sale of real estate of approximately $5.0 million, and a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $0.2 million. The property was purchased in January 2022 for $21.1 million. On December 28, 2023, the company sold South Ridge, an 80-acre parcel of land in Johnstown, Colo., to Journey Homes for $7.6 million. Caliber purchased the land in September 2021 for $5.38 million as part of its Johnstown Development, an approximately 750-acre master-planned, mixed-use development project. As of December 31, 2023, Caliber was actively developing 2,986 multifamily units, 2,386 single family units, 2.8 million square feet of commercial and industrial, and 1.3 million square feet of office and retail. On March 7, 2024, CHT acquired the Holiday Inn Newport News located in Newport News, Virginia. This is the first of nine hotel assets included in the previously announced contribution agreement with L.T.D. Hospitality. In total, the portfolio of nine assets represents a contribution value of $224 million, which will bolster Caliber’s AUM, upon transaction closing. As of March 27, 2024, Caliber’s new wholesale fundraising team had signed 26 selling agreements with regional broker dealers and registered investment advisors for investments in company-sponsored products. In total, these partners have approximately 381 representatives with $3.4 billion of accessible AUM. (1) With the evolution and growth of the Company, the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses performance and resource allocation on an aggregate basis under the Company’s asset management platform, and no longer reviews operating results for development or brokerage activity separately. As such, management concluded that the Company operates through one operating segment, presented as “Platform Results” or “Unconsolidated Results”. (2) Asset management revenue includes fund set-up fees, fund management fees, financing fees, development and construction fees, and brokerage fees. (3) Performance allocations are defined as an arrangement in which we are entitled to an allocation of investment returns, generated within the investment funds which we manage, based on a contractual formula. (4) Caliber Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. (5) Fund management fees are generally based on 1.0% to 1.5% of the unreturned capital contributions in a particular fund and include reimbursement for costs incurred on behalf of the fund, including an allocation of certain overhead costs. The Company earns a fund management fee of 0.70% of CHT’s enterprise value and is reimbursed for certain costs incurred on behalf of CHT. Fund management fees are included in asset management revenue. (6) Fair value assets under management is defined as the aggregate fair value of the real estate assets the Company manages from which it derives management fees, performance revenues and other fees and expense reimbursements as of December 31, 2023. (7) Managed capital is defined as the total capital raised from investors and invested in our funds, including capital raised from investors in CaliberCos Inc. through corporate note issuances that was further invested in or loaned to our funds. We use this information to monitor, among other things, the amount of ‘preferred return’ that would be paid at the time of a distribution and the potential to earn a performance fee over and above the preferred return at the time of the distribution. Our fund management fees are based on a percentage of managed capital or a percentage of assets under management, and monitoring the change and composition of managed capital provides relevant data points for Caliber management to further calculate and predict future earnings.

We believe that these measures enhance the understanding of ongoing operations and comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they provide investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use these measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly identified measures of other companies because not all companies use the same calculations. These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. Fee-Related Earnings and Related Components Fee-Related Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure used to assess our ability to generate profits from fee-based revenues, focusing on whether our core revenue streams are sufficient to cover our core operating expenses. Fee-Related Earnings represents the Company’s net income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense and extraordinary or non-recurring revenue and expenses, including performance allocation revenue and gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, public registration direct costs related to aborted or delayed offerings and our Reg A+ offering, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, litigation settlements, and expenses recorded to earnings relating to investment deals which were abandoned or closed. Fee-Related Earnings is presented on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations) and eliminates noncontrolling interest. Eliminating the impact of consolidated funds and noncontrolling interest provides investors a view of the performance attributable to CaliberCos Inc. and is consistent with performance models and analysis used by management. Distributable Earnings Distributable Earnings is a supplemental non-GAAP performance measure equal to Fee-Related Earnings plus performance allocation revenue and less interest expenses and provision for income taxes. We believe that Distributable Earnings can be useful as a supplemental performance measure to our GAAP results assessing the amount of earnings available for distribution. Caliber Adjusted EBITDA Caliber Adjusted EBITDA represents the Company’s Distributable Earnings adjusted for interest expense, the share repurchase costs related to the Company’s Buyback Program, other income (expense), and provision for income taxes on a basis that deconsolidates our consolidated funds (intercompany eliminations), Loss on CRAF Investment Redemption, Gain on extinguishment of Payroll Protection Program loans, and eliminates noncontrolling interest.

Despite revenue decline, the company saw positive net income and EBITDA in Q4 2023. Positive Successful revenue diversification with the launch of all-electric auxiliary power units for the trucking industry in Q4 2023 Achieved successful deposition of cathode electrodes and double-sided dry deposition of anode and cathode electrodes at scale using patented battery manufacturing process Expanded market share in the recreational vehicle industry with Forest River Inc. and OGV Luxury Coach Reported net sales of $10.4 million in Q4 2023, gross profit of $2.0 million, net income of $3.0 million, and EBITDA of $7.4 million Full-year 2023 financial highlights include net sales of $64.4 million, gross profit of $15.4 million, and EBITDA of $3.4 million Operational highlights include partnerships with Ameresco, Coachmen RVs, and entrance into the heavy-duty trucking market Negative Net sales decline from $20.2 million in Q4 2022 to $10.4 million in Q4 2023 Gross profit decrease from $4.0 million in Q4 2022 to $2.0 million in Q4 2023 Adjusted EBITDA negative at $(2.1) million in Q4 2023 compared to $(4.7) million in Q4 2022 Full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA worsened to $(17.1) million from $(7.9) million in 2022 Financial Analyst The report from Dragonfly Energy indicates a significant reduction in net sales and gross profit for Q4 2023 compared to the same quarter of the previous year. This drop could reflect market saturation, increased competition, or operational inefficiencies. However, operating expenses have been considerably reduced, which has resulted in net income instead of a net loss. The positive net income and EBITDA could indicate that cost control measures and restructuring efforts are yielding results, despite the decline in sales and gross profit.From a stock evaluation perspective, the slashed operating expenses and positive net income could be seen as a potential sign of a company stabilizing financially after a tumultuous period. For long-term stakeholders, the question remains whether the company can scale its operations and sustain profitability through further market diversification and innovation without compromising on revenue growth. Market Research Analyst Dragonfly Energy's launch of all-electric auxiliary power units (APUs) marks a strategic move to diversify revenue streams, anticipate regulatory trends and address environmental concerns. This positioning towards anti-idling regulations and emission reductions aligns with the growing eco-conscious consumer base and regulatory landscape. The company's expansion into the heavy-duty trucking market with its all-electric APU could tap into an increasing demand for sustainable trucking solutions. However, the commercial success of these ventures hinges on market adoption rates and the company's ability to outpace competitors in innovation and cost-efficiency.In the recreational vehicle market, the decision to include Battle Born Batteries as standard equipment in OGV Luxury Coach units underlines the strengthening of brand presence and product integration in the RV ecosystem. This could potentially increase brand loyalty and stabilize revenue inflows from the segment. However, it is important to monitor consumer response and market trends to assess the long-term viability of this strategy. Environmental Technology Analyst The environmental technology landscape is rapidly evolving to embrace sustainability. Dragonfly Energy's patented dry electrode battery manufacturing process and its role in powering the non-profit John Lennon Educational Tour Bus are indicative of an industry shift towards sustainable solutions. Dry electrode technology, in particular, is a breakthrough in battery manufacturing, eliminating the use of solvents and potentially reducing the environmental footprint. This methodology could place the company at the forefront of a cleaner, more eco-friendly approach to energy storage, appealing to stakeholders interested in green technology and sustainability.However, the actual market impact of such technologies depends on scalability, cost factors and consumer acceptance. The novelty of dry electrode technology is promising, yet the business model's success will be measured by its commercialization and the ability to secure a solid position within the competitive landscape. 04/15/2024 - 04:10 PM Successful diversification of revenue underway, with launch in Q4 2023 of all-electric auxiliary power units (“APU”) to the trucking industry; Enables compliance with increasing anti-idling regulations, reduction in fuel costs, increased uptime and payloads, and the reduction of harmful emissions In Q4 2023, achieved successful deposition of cathode electrodes, and double-sided dry deposition of both anode and cathode electrodes, at scale, using the Company’s patented dry electrode battery manufacturing processContinued expansion of recreational vehicle market share, with OGV Luxury Coach, a division of Forest River Inc., to provide Battle Born lithium batteries as standard equipment on all OGV units RENO, Nev., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dragonfly Energy Holdings Corp.

We are extremely excited about 2024 as the convergence of the new cell manufacturing, the expansion of our customer base and market segments, and the stabilization and return to growth of the RV markets sets the stage for an expected return to growth.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial and Operating ResultsFourth quarter 2023 Net Sales were $10.4 million, compared to $20.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 Net Sales were $64.4 million, compared to $86.3 million in 2022. Direct-To-Consumer (“DTC”) revenue decreased by $15.6 million as a result of decreased customer demand, particularly in the RV market, due to rising interest rates and inflation. Fourth quarter 2023 Gross Profit was $2.0 million, compared to $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 Gross Profit was $15.4 million, down from $23.6 million in 2023. The year-over-year decline in 2023 gross profit was primarily driven by lower unit volume sales, a change in revenue mix that included a larger percentage of lower margin OEM sales, as well as higher material costs. Operating Expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $(5.4) million, compared to $(32.9) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 Operating Expenses were $(42.9) million, down from $(58.0) million. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of expenses associated with the Business Combination in 2022 and lower overall employee-related costs, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation costs, as well as higher compliance, insurance, and professional fees related to public company costs. Total Other Income in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.3 million, compared to a Total Other Expense of $(2.7) million in the prior year quarter. Other Income for fiscal 2023 was approximately $13.6 million, compared to an Other Expenses of $(6.3) million in 2022. The income contribution in 2023 was primarily due to a change in fair market value of a warrant liability in the amount of $29.6 million, partially offset by interest expense of $16.0 million. The Company had Net Income of $3.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to a Net Loss of $(32.5) million or $(0.76) per diluted share in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2023, the Company had a Net Loss of $(13.8) million, or $(0.26) per diluted share, compared to a Net Loss of $(40.0) million or $(1.04) per diluted share for the full year 2022. The full year results were driven by reduced demand in the RV market, partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, lower operating expenses and increased other income. EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $7.4 million, compared to a negative $(28.0) million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 EBITDA totaled $3.4 million, compared to a negative $(32.8) million in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, changes in the fair market value of our warrants, and other one-time expenses, was a negative $(2.1) million, compared to a negative $(4.7) million for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year 2023, Adjusted EBITDA excluding stock-based compensation, changes in the fair market value of Dragonfly Energy’s warrants, and other one-time expenses, was a negative $(17.1) million, compared to negative $(7.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Q1 2024 OutlookThe Company believes that the RV market appears to have stabilized and is showing early signs of recovery. In addition, the Company’s entry into the heavy-duty trucking market, while still in its early stages, is gaining traction and has the potential to be a more meaningful revenue contributor in the second half of 2024. Net Sales are expected to range between $12.0 - $13.0 millionGross Margin is expected in the range of 24.0% - 26.0%Operating Expenses are expected to be in a range of $(8.0) - $(9.0) millionOther Income (Expense) is expected be an expense in the range of $(3.5) – $(4.5) millionNet Loss is expected to be between $(8.0) - $(10.5) million for the first quarter of 2024, or $(0.13) - $(0.17) per share based on approximately 61.0 million shares outstanding Webcast InformationThe Dragonfly Energy management team will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results this afternoon, Monday, April 15, 2024, at 5:00 pm E.T.

beginning of year17,781 28,630 Cash and cash equivalents - end of year$ 12,713 $ 17,781 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP financial information to enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s financial performance and to assist investors in evaluating the Company’s results of operations, period over period. Adjusted non-GAAP measures exclude significant unusual items. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures as a supplement to, and not a substitute for financial information prepared on a GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under the rules of the SEC because it excludes certain amounts included in net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, the Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, business combination related expenses and other one-time, non-recurring items. The Company has included Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by Dragonfly’s management team to evaluate its operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses. As such, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is helpful in highlighting trends in the ongoing core operating results of the business. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of net loss or other results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay taxes;although amortization and depreciation are non-cash charges, the assets being amortized and depreciated will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items for which the Company may adjust in historical periods; andother companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDAThe following table presents reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for each of the periods indicated.

The sickle gene is found in every ethnic group, not just among those of African descent; and in the United States an estimated 1-in-365 African Americans and 1-in-16,300 Hispanic Americans are born with SCD.1 The genetic mutation responsible for SCD causes an individual's red blood cells to distort into a ""C"" or a sickle shape, reducing their ability to transport oxygen throughout the body. These sickled red blood cells break down rapidly, become very sticky, and develop a propensity to clump together, which causes them to become stuck and cause damage within blood vessels. The result is reduced blood flow to distal organs, which leads to physical symptoms of incapacitating pain, tissue and organ damage, and early death.2 1Source: Data & Statistics on Sickle Cell Disease – National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, December 2020.2Source: Committee on Addressing Sickle Cell Disease – A Strategic Plan and Blueprint for Action -- National Academy of Sciences Press, 2020.

Negative The decrease in net income available to common shareholders compared to the previous quarter. The decrease in loans compared to year-end 2023. The increase in the 's efficiency ratio. The decrease in total revenue compared to the previous quarters. Financial Analyst The reported earnings of CNB Financial Corporation for Q1 2024 indicate a mixed financial health of the company. With a decline in net income available to common shareholders as reported, primarily due to increased deposit costs stemming from Federal Reserve rate hikes, investors may raise concerns over the company's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate changes. This is particularly relevant given the current landscape of monetary policy tightening. The decrease in loans quarter-over-quarter, although slight, when coupled with a disciplined approach to loan pricing and portfolio concentration, may reflect prudent risk management during an uncertain economic period. However, continuous loan payoffs could also signal a potential stagnation in loan growth or competitive pressures. Furthermore, the growth in deposits suggests robust customer acquisition and retention strategies, especially in the municipal and retail segments. The dynamic within deposits also deserves attention, as changes in the balance of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing accounts could influence the net interest margin, a key metric for profitability in the banking sector. The reduction in syndicated loan balances, while reducing diversification, signifies a strategic shift towards organic growth through customer relationships, aligning with a more conservative risk posture. Lastly, the detailed analysis of nonperforming assets and their slight decline could be seen as a positive sign for credit quality, although the year-over-year increase may suggest a need for vigilance in credit risk management. Net loan charge-offs have also slightly increased, a trend that stakeholders should monitor in relation to portfolio health and provision for loan losses. Market Research Analyst The report provided by CNB Financial Corporation highlights several strategic initiatives that are of interest from a market positioning perspective. The continued expansion in key markets such as Cleveland, Roanoke and Columbus, as well as the growth of CNB Bank’s Private Banking division, indicates an aggressive approach towards regional expansion and customer base diversification. The introduction of targeted accounts like the “At Ease” account and Impressia Bank suggests that CNB is actively developing niche banking services to cater to specific customer segments, potentially enhancing its competitive edge. The emphasis on reducing syndicated loans and increasing focus on organic loan growth may reflect a broader industry trend of regional banks seeking to strengthen core business lines amidst a challenging interest rate environment. This could have implications for CNB's branding as a community-focused lender, which can be an asset in marketing and customer acquisition efforts. From a liquidity standpoint, the excess reserves and available borrowing capacity indicate strong liquidity buffers. This could position CNB favorably in the event of market volatility or economic downturns, reassuring stakeholders of the Corporation's ability to manage liquidity risks effectively. Risk Management Consultant The disclosed financial results provide a glimpse into CNB Financial Corporation’s risk profile. The reduction in pre-tax net unrealized losses on securities and the sufficiency of capital ratios even when these losses are fully recognized highlight the company’s capacity to absorb valuation shocks in its investment portfolio. The strategies in place, such as the holding company maintaining ample liquid funds to support the banking subsidiary, suggest that CNB Financial has implemented effective capital management practices to mitigate potential capital adequacy issues. Furthermore, the lack of reliance on short-term borrowings from the FHLB or Federal Reserve's Discount Window as of the reporting dates may be indicative of healthy liquidity management without over-reliance on external funding sources. The detailed discussion of the loan portfolio exposure, specifically to commercial real estate segments like office, hospitality and multifamily, reflects a cautious approach in managing industry-concentration risk. The absence of high volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) credits in the portfolio and the due diligence on nonaccrual loans demonstrate a commitment to maintaining loan quality. However, the increase in net nonperforming assets year-over-year warrants continued scrutiny, especially in an environment where economic indicators might suggest an increased risk of defaults. 04/15/2024 - 04:05 PM CLEARFIELD, Pa., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CNB Financial Corporation (“Corporation”) (NASDAQ: CCNE), the parent company of CNB Bank, today announced its earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Executive Summary Net income available to common shareholders (""earnings"") was $11.5 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to earnings of $12.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The quarterly decrease was primarily a result of decreases in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by decreases in certain personnel costs, technology expenses and adverting expenses, as discussed in more detail below. The decrease in earnings and diluted earnings per share comparing the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to the $15.4 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was primarily due to the significant year-over-year increase in deposit costs primarily resulting from Federal Reserve rate increases throughout 2023 and the resulting market impact to the Corporation's deposit base. At March 31, 2024, loans totaled $4.4 billion, excluding the balances of (i) syndicated loans, and (ii) any remaining balances on Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loans, net of PPP-related fees (such loans being referred to as the ""PPP-related loans""). This adjusted total of $4.4 billion in loans represented a decrease of $7.0 million, or 0.16% (0.65% annualized), compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of December 31, 2023 and an increase of $199.6 million, or 4.81% compared to the same adjusted total loans measured as of March 31, 2023. The decrease in loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 compared to year-end 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in early loan payoffs combined with the Corporation remaining strategically focused on both managing the concentration in its commercial real estate loan portfolio, and remaining disciplined with loan pricing in support of its net interest margin. The growth in loans as of March 31, 2024 compared to loans as of March 31, 2023, resulted primarily from growth in the Corporation's recent expansion markets of Cleveland and Roanoke, combined with growth in the Columbus market and CNB Bank’s Private Banking division. At March 31, 2024, the Corporation's balance sheet reflected a decrease in syndicated lending balances of $30.0 million compared to December 31, 2023 and a decrease of $69.4 million compared to March 31, 2023, resulting from scheduled paydowns or early payoffs of certain syndicated credits. The syndicated loan portfolio totaled $78.7 million, or 1.78% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $108.7 million, or 2.43% of total loans at December 31, 2023 and $148.1 million, or 3.44% of total loans, at March 31, 2023. The Corporation continues to de-emphasize syndicated loans as it focuses on prioritizing funding on organic loan growth from its customer relationships. At March 31, 2024, total deposits were $5.0 billion, reflecting an increase of $38.8 million, or 0.78% (3.12% annualized), from the previous quarter end of December 31, 2023. The increase in deposit balances compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily attributed to an increase in municipal and retail deposits, partially offset by seasonal fluctuations in business deposits. In addition, the total number of deposit households increased by approximately 0.77% (3.11% annualized) between December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. Additional deposit and liquidity profile details were as follows: At March 31, 2024, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.4 billion, or approximately 27.70% of total CNB Bank deposits. However, when excluding $101.1 million of affiliate company deposits and $437.9 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $884.6 million, or approximately 17.21% of total CNB Bank deposits as of March 31, 2024. The level of adjusted uninsured deposits at March 31, 2024 was approximately 5.60% lower than the prior quarter end's level. At December 31, 2023, the total estimated uninsured deposits for CNB Bank were approximately $1.4 billion, or approximately 28.21% of total CNB Bank deposits; however, when excluding $101.3 million of affiliate company deposits and $400.5 million of pledged-investment collateralized deposits, the adjusted amount and percentage of total estimated uninsured deposits was approximately $937.1 million, or approximately 18.37% of total CNB Bank deposits as of December 31, 2023. At March 31, 2024, the average deposit balance per account for CNB Bank was approximately $33 thousand. CNB Bank had increases in municipal deposits, as well as retail customer household deposits, including those added from the 2023 launches of (i) CNB Bank’s “At Ease” account, a service for U.S. service member and veteran families, and (ii) CNB’s women-focused banking division, Impressia Bank.At March 31, 2024, the Corporation had $259.5 million of cash equivalents held in CNB Bank’s interest-bearing deposit account at the Federal Reserve. These excess funds, when combined with $3.6 billion in (i) available borrowing capacity from the Federal Home Bank of Pittsburgh (""FHLB"") and the Federal Reserve, and (ii) available unused commitments from brokered deposit sources and other third-party funding channels, including previously established lines of credit from correspondent banks, result in the total on-hand and contingent liquidity sources for the Corporation to be approximately 4.3 times the estimated amount of adjusted uninsured deposit balances discussed above. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Corporation had no outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLB or the Federal Reserve's Discount Window, while at March 31, 2023, the Corporation had $102.1 million in outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLB and no outstanding borrowings from the Federal Reserve's Discount Window. At March 31, 2024, the Corporation's pre-tax net unrealized losses on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities totaled approximately $85.0 million, or 14.69% of total shareholders' equity, compared to $82.2 million, or 14.40% of total shareholders' equity, at December 31, 2023. The change in unrealized losses was primarily due to changes in the yield curve in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, relative to the Corporation’s scheduled bond maturities. Importantly, all regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation would still exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 if the net unrealized losses at the respective dates were fully recognized. Additionally, the Corporation maintained $100.3 million of liquid funds at its holding company, which more than covers the $85.0 million in unrealized losses on investments held primarily in its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, as an immediately available source of contingent capital to be down-streamed to CNB Bank, if necessary. Total nonperforming assets were approximately $30.7 million, or 0.53% of total assets, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $31.8 million, or 0.55% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023, and $23.7 million, or 0.42% of total assets, as of March 31, 2023. The decrease in nonperforming assets for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to paydowns and payoffs combined with a $596 thousand charge-down of one owner-occupied commercial real estate relationship (remaining balance of $308 thousand). The increase in non-performing assets at March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023 was due to a commercial and industrial relationship as previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2023, coupled with one commercial real estate relationship as previously disclosed in the third quarter of 2023. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.12% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $686 thousand, or 0.07% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in net loan charge-offs during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily related to the one owner-occupied commercial real estate relationship discussed above. Pre-provision net revenue (""PPNR""), a non-GAAP measure, was $16.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $18.4 million and $21.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The first-quarter 2024 PPNR when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 reflected decreases in net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by decreases in certain personnel costs as well as technology expenses, as discussed in more detail below.1 The decrease in PPNR for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in deposit costs coupled with increases in certain personnel costs as well as technology expenses. 1 This release contains references to certain financial measures that are not defined under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""). Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results of operations with prior periods and show the effects of significant gains and charges in the periods presented. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section. Michael D. Peduzzi, President and CEO of both the Corporation and CNB Bank, stated, “Our first quarter results reflect several areas where our team is focused on translating potential revenue growth and cost-savings opportunities to realizing greater performance in the current interest rate environment. Though our total loan balances were down and our interest income was lower, this was a function of both (i) more early paydowns in the early part of the year, including some favorable payoffs of previously criticized loans, and (ii) a number of loans where term sheets with borrowers were approved, but the borrowers delayed obtaining financing expecting some reduction in rates. As the quarter progressed and the Federal Reserve seems to be staying put on rates for now, more borrowers are finalizing their borrowing plans, and both late quarter loan volume and pipeline build were stronger leading into the second quarter. This same pause by the Federal Reserve in interest rates has not provided as much opportunity to reduce pricing on interest-bearing deposit accounts as we would have wanted, but we were able to increase the number of our households and organic funding sources, and continue to increase our noninterest-bearing account relationships. Expense management - both through resuming positive operating leverage and reducing our efficiency ratio - continues to be a priority. Our largest expense category, staffing costs, reflect our approach to managing these expenses through normal attrition, as well as through expense reductions in our profit-sharing plan. Technology expense was reduced as we continue to challenge relationships with existing vendors to restructure contracts to better align with our current operating profile, customer utilization of technology, and account volumes. As discussed in more detail below, in the third quarter of 2023 we made changes to our Card Services customer scorecard program that have led to an improvement in the margin associated with card transactions under this program. In addition, we are increasing fees on certain elements of wealth management and deposit services, with such increases fully taking effect in the second quarter, reflective of customers more reasonably covering the costs for services and product enhancements previously implemented by the Corporation for their benefit. Though we are not satisfied with the compression of our net interest margin, a still higher-than-desired efficiency ratio, and lower quarterly net income and earnings per share, we believe the disciplined revenue generation and cost-savings measures we have put into place, and the still sound pipelines supporting future loan, deposit, and wealth management growth, collectively provide a reasonable basis for us to expect improved performance moving forward."" Other Balance Sheet Highlights Book value per common share was $24.77 at March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase from $24.57 at December 31, 2023 and $23.14 at March 31, 2023. Tangible book value per common share, a non-GAAP measure, was $22.67 as of March 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $0.21, or 3.76% (annualized) from $22.46 as of December 31, 2023 and an increase of $1.62, or 7.70%, from $21.05 as of March 31, 2023.1 The positive increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to December 31, 2023 were primarily due to a $7.8 million increase in retained earnings partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily from the after-tax impact of temporary unrealized valuation changes in the Corporation’s available-for-sale investment portfolio in the first quarter of 2024. The increases in book value per common share and tangible book value per common share compared to March 31, 2023 were primarily due to a $35.2 million increase in retained earnings for the past twelve months partially offset with a $1.1 million increase in treasury stock driven by the repurchase of 226,459 common shares at a weighted average price per share of $18.33 in the second and third quarters of 2023. Loan Portfolio Profile As part of our lending policy and risk management activities, the Corporation tracks lending exposure by industry classification and type to determine potential risks associated with industry concentrations, and if any risk issues could lead to additional credit loss exposure. In the current post-pandemic and inflationary economic environment, the Corporation has evaluated its exposure to the office, hospitality, and multifamily industries within its commercial real estate portfolio. Even given the Corporation’s historically sound underwriting protocols and high credit quality ratings for borrowers in these industries, the Corporation monitors numerous relevant sensitivity elements at both underwriting and through and beyond the funding period, including projects occupancy, loan-to-value, absorption and cap rates, debt service coverage and covenant compliance, and developer/lessor financial strength both in the project and globally. At March 31, 2024, the Corporation had the following key metrics related to its office, hospitality and multifamily portfolios: Commercial office loans 120 outstanding loans, totaling $114.3 million, or 2.58%, of the Corporation loans outstanding;Nonaccrual commercial office loans (one customer relationship) totaled $508 thousand, or 0.44% of total office loans outstanding. One customer relationship had a related specific loss reserve of approximately $289 thousand, at March 31, 2024; andThe average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $952 thousand. Commercial hospitality loans 171 outstanding loans, totaling $263.5 million, or 5.95%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;There were no nonaccrual commercial hospitality loans at March 31, 2024; andThe average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $1.5 million. Commercial multifamily loans 208 outstanding loans, totaling $213.8 million, or 4.82%, of total Corporation loans outstanding;Nonaccrual commercial multifamily loans (one customer relationship) totaled $300 thousand, or 0.09% of total multifamily loans outstanding. The one customer relationship did not have a related specific loss reserve at March 31, 2024; andThe average outstanding balance per commercial office loan was $1.0 million. The Corporation had no commercial office, hospitality or multifamily loan relationships considered by the banking regulators to be a high volatility commercial real estate (""HVCRE"") credit. Performance Ratios Annualized return on average equity was 8.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 9.97% and 12.60% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Annualized return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 9.77% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 11.27% and 14.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.1 The Corporation's efficiency ratio was 69.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 67.66% and 61.04% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The efficiency ratio on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 68.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 66.93% and 60.47% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.1 The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income coupled with rising deposit costs, partially offset by a decrease in quarterly personnel costs as a result of timing of incentive compensation accruals, as well as a decrease in technology expenses as the fourth quarter of 2023 included a one-time contract renegotiation expense. Revenue Total revenue (net interest income plus non-interest income) was $54.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $56.8 million and $55.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Net interest income was $45.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $47.7 million and $47.6 million, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. When comparing the first quarter of 2024 to the fourth quarter of 2023, the difference in net interest income of $2.5 million, or 5.18% (20.85% annualized) reflected both the slight reduction in total loans outstanding quarter over quarter, plus the fourth quarter of 2023 including approximately $1.4 million in nonrecurring interest income related primarily to early payoffs in the syndicated loan portfolio. When comparing the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2023, the decrease in net interest income of $2.4 million, or 5.07%, was attributable to an increase in the Corporation's interest expense in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of the year-over-year previously noted deposit rate increases, as well as targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases to ensure both deposit relationship retention, and new deposit growth in recently entered expansion markets.Net interest margin was 3.40%, 3.54% and 3.81% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis, a non-GAAP measure, was 3.38%, 3.51% and 3.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively.1 Included in the fourth-quarter 2023 net interest margin and net interest margin on a fully tax-equivalent basis is approximately $1.4 million, or 10 basis points, in nonrecurring interest income related primarily to early payoffs in the syndicated loan portfolio. The yield on earning assets of 5.81% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased 1 basis point from December 31, 2023 and increased 52 basis points from March 31, 2023. The yield on earning assets for the three months ended December 31, 2023 included the previously mentioned $1.4 million, or 10 basis points, in syndicated loan one-time interest income. Additionally, the increase in yield compared to March 31, 2023 was attributable to the net benefit of higher interest rates on both variable-rate loans and new loan production.The cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 3.03% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased 14 basis points from December 31, 2023 and 109 basis points from March 31, 2023 primarily as a result of the Corporation’s targeted interest-bearing deposit rate increases for deposit retention and growth initiatives given the competitive environment from numerous Fed rate hikes over the past twelve months. Total non-interest income was $9.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $9.1 million and $8.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, notable changes compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023 included a decrease in service charges on deposits and net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities, partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management fees and an increase in quarterly other non-interest income primarily driven by higher pass-through income from small business investment companies (""SBICs""). The increase compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher pass-through income from SBICs coupled with an increase in net realized and unrealized gains on equity securities. Non-Interest Expense For the three months ended March 31, 2024 total non-interest expense was $37.4 million, compared to $38.4 million and $34.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease of $1.0 million, or 2.67%, from the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of a decrease in salaries and benefits and technology expenses. The reduction in salaries and benefits primarily resulted from a decrease in full-time equivalent employees, as the Corporation continues to focus on improving efficiencies and processes, coupled with the timing of incentive compensation accruals. While the decrease in technology expenses was the result of approximately $394 thousand in one-time contract restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2023, the fourth quarter of 2023 also reflected higher advertising expenses due to timing. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation also reduced the accrual related to card processing and interchange expenses as a result of changes made to its program that will lead to a lower relative expense level (when compared to related program revenues) in 2024 and beyond. The increase in non-interest expense compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to higher salaries and benefits driven by an increase in personnel costs related to merit increases and growth in the Corporation's staff and new offices in its expansion markets, coupled with year-over-year investments in technology applications aimed at enhancing both customer online banking capabilities, customer call center communications, and in-branch technology delivery channels. In addition, card processing and interchange expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.2 million, or 58.48% of card processing and interchange income, compared to $1.5 million, or 72.37% of card processing and interchange income for the first quarter of 2023. Income Taxes Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $2.8 million, representing an 18.36% effective tax rate, compared to $3.2 million, representing a 18.45% effective tax rate, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and $3.9 million, representing a 19.18% effective tax rate, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Asset Quality Total nonperforming assets were approximately $30.7 million, or 0.53% of total assets, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $31.8 million, or 0.55% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023, and $23.7 million, or 0.42% of total assets, as of March 31, 2023, as discussed above. The allowance for credit losses measured as a percentage of total loans was 1.03% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 1.03% as of December 31, 2023 and 1.02% as of March 31, 2023. In addition, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was 159.41% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 154.63% and 209.54% as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans was primarily attributable to the levels of nonperforming assets, as discussed above. The provision for credit losses was $1.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and remained relatively stable compared to $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net loan charge-offs were $1.3 million, or 0.12% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale, compared to $1.2 million, or 0.11% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $686 thousand, or 0.07% (annualized) of average total loans and loans held for sale during the three months ended March 31, 2023, as discussed above. Capital As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation’s total shareholders’ equity was $578.6 million, representing an increase of $7.4 million, or 1.29%, from December 31, 2023 and an increase of $32.2 million, or 5.90%, from March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in the Corporation's retained earnings (quarterly net income, partially offset by the common and preferred dividends paid in the quarter). Regulatory capital ratios for the Corporation continue to exceed regulatory “well-capitalized” levels as of March 31, 2024, consistent with prior periods. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of common shareholders' equity to total assets was 8.98% compared to 8.93% at December 31, 2023 and 8.75% at March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation’s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP measure, was 8.28% compared to 8.22% at December 31, 2023 and 8.02% at March 31, 2023. The increases compared to December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 were primarily the result of an increase in retained earnings.1 About CNB Financial Corporation CNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $5.8 billion.

The publication in Leukemia & Lymphoma highlights birtamimab's ability to clear amyloid deposits in vital organs, showing a significant survival benefit in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis. Positive Birtamimab designed to clear amyloid deposits from vital organs Significant survival benefit in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis Published in Leukemia & Lymphoma, a peer-reviewed journal Birtamimab binds and neutralizes toxic LC aggregates Complementary mechanism of action to current standard of care for AL amyloidosis Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 04:05 PM DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Prothena Corporation plc (NASDAQ:PRTA), a late-stage clinical biotechnology company with a robust pipeline of investigational therapeutics built on protein dysregulation expertise, today announced the publication related to the mechanism of action, pharmacological characteristics, and clinical utility of birtamimab, a potential best-in-class anti-amyloid treatment for AL amyloidosis. The publication can be found in the latest issue of Leukemia & Lymphoma, an international peer-reviewed journal that publishes research on all aspects of hematological malignancies. AL amyloidosis is an idiopathic, rare, progressive and often fatal disease characterized by amyloid deposits that build up in vital organs leading to damage, dysfunction and failure. The risk of early mortality is especially high in patients with significant cardiac involvement as there are no current treatment options that target existing amyloid deposits in these patients. Birtamimab binds to a highly conserved cryptic epitope which is only exposed in misfolded kappa and lambda light chain (LC) protein. Birtamimab binds and neutralizes soluble, toxic LC aggregates and binds and clears insoluble AL amyloid deposits, without affecting normally folded LC proteins. This mechanism of action is complementary to the current standard of care therapy for AL amyloidosis which does not target the existing toxic LC aggregates and amyloid deposits. “Birtamimab was designed to clear deposited amyloid from vital organs and is the only treatment that has shown a significant survival benefit in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis, which was demonstrated in a post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 VITAL placebo-controlled clinical trial,” said Hideki Garren, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, Prothena. “Birtamimab is being evaluated in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis, who are at high risk of early mortality, in the ongoing confirmatory Phase 3 AFFIRM-AL clinical trial.” A copy of the peer-reviewed article can be found here in Leukemia & Lymphoma: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10428194.2024.2337803 About Birtamimab Birtamimab is an investigational, humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically and selectively target and clear the amyloid that accumulates and causes organ dysfunction and failure in patients with AL amyloidosis. Birtamimab specifically binds to a defined epitope on kappa and lambda AL protein involved in the disease process. Birtamimab is the only investigational drug that has shown a significant survival benefit in patients with Mayo Stage IV AL amyloidosis post-hoc in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. Birtamimab has been granted orphan drug designation for AL amyloidosis by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency and has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA.

Edgewise Therapeutics Announces Positive Two-Year Topline Results from the ARCH Open Label Trial of Sevasemten (EDG-5506) in Adults with Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Becker),2024-04-15T20:05:00.000Z,High,Neutral,"Edgewise Therapeutics announces positive two-year topline results from the ARCH Open Label Trial of Sevasemten in adults with Becker Muscular Dystrophy, showing stabilization of NSAA scores, significant decreases in muscle damage biomarkers, and favorable safety profile.","Edgewise Therapeutics Announces Positive Two-Year Topline Results from the ARCH Open Label Trial of Sevasemten (EDG-5506) in Adults with Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Becker) Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Edgewise Therapeutics announces positive two-year topline results from the ARCH Open Label Trial of Sevasemten in adults with Becker Muscular Dystrophy, showing stabilization of NSAA scores, significant decreases in muscle damage biomarkers, and favorable safety profile. Positive Positive two-year topline results from the ARCH trial show stabilization of NSAA scores with sevasemten treatment in adults with Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Significant decreases in muscle damage biomarkers CK and TNNI2 were observed in participants treated with sevasemten. Sevasemten was well-tolerated with no discontinuations or dose reductions due to adverse events. The results support the potential of sevasemten to preserve function and halt disease progression in Becker Muscular Dystrophy. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The reported stability in NSAA scores over a two-year period is a significant outcome when considering the treatment of Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Becker), a condition that typically sees a progressive decline in muscular function. From a research perspective, this suggests that sevasemten has the potential to alter the disease's trajectory, which is an important consideration for therapeutic agents targeting degenerative diseases.Further, the observed reduction in circulating levels of biomarkers such as creatine kinase (CK) and fast skeletal muscle troponin I (TNNI2) aligns with preclinical expectations and is indicative of a reduction in muscle damage. These biomarkers are critical indicators that researchers use to measure the extent of muscle injury and response to therapy. Therefore, these results not only point to the biological efficacy of sevasemten but also help in validating the drug's mechanism of action. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The positive results from the ARCH trial represent a potentially disruptive development in the treatment market for neuromuscular disorders, particularly Becker Muscular Dystrophy. As there are currently no treatments specifically approved for Becker, sevasemten may capitalize on an unmet medical need, which is a strong market driver. The well-tolerated profile of the drug further enhances its market potential.Moreover, the focus on maintaining daily living activities, as highlighted by the NSAA score stabilization, touches directly on patient quality of life, a factor increasingly considered in drug valuation and reimbursement discussions. If sevasemten were to gain regulatory approval, its market penetration would depend not only on its clinical efficacy but also on how well it can demonstrate cost-effectiveness compared to existing standards of care, or lack thereof, in this case. Health Economics Expert The economic implications of a therapy such as sevasemten, if approved, could be substantial. Stabilizing a progressive disease translates into potential cost savings in healthcare, due to a reduced need for interventions related to complications and disease progression. For payers and healthcare systems, medications that can demonstrate disease-modifying abilities offer long-term cost benefits.On the other hand, the research, development and production costs of novel therapies like sevasemten need to be recovered, often resulting in high initial pricing. This can affect market access and affordability, raising the need for negotiations with healthcare providers and insurers to ensure that patients who need such therapies can receive them. The long-term financial impact on the healthcare system must be evaluated against the benefits of improved patient outcomes and reduced disease burden. 04/15/2024 - 04:05 PM – The North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) remained stable relative to declines reported in Becker natural history studies – – Significant decreases were observed in circulating levels of creatine kinase (CK) and fast skeletal muscle troponin I (TNNI2), biomarkers associated with skeletal muscle damage – – Sevasemten was well-tolerated – – Edgewise leadership to discuss ARCH findings on Tuesday, April 16 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time at virtual investor event – BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Edgewise Therapeutics, Inc., (Nasdaq: EWTX), a leading muscle disease biopharmaceutical company, today announced positive two-year topline results from the ARCH trial. ARCH is an open label, single-center study assessing safety, tolerability, impact on muscle damage biomarkers, pharmacokinetics (PK) and functional measures with sevasemten (EDG-5506) in adults with Becker. Sevasemten is an orally administered small molecule designed to prevent contraction-induced muscle damage in dystrophinopathies including Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Duchenne). This press release features multimedia.

Sevasemten was well-tolerated in all 12 participants with no discontinuations or dose reductions due to adverse events. Preserving NSAA functions that correlate to activities of daily living are important to individuals living with Becker. As seen in Figure 1, during two years of sevasemten treatment, participants’ NSAA scores stabilized and continued to diverge relative to functional declines reported across multiple Becker natural history studies, in which two-year mean decreases of 2.4 NSAA points were reported1, 2,3. In addition, significant decreases in key biomarkers of muscle damage including CK and TNNI2 were observed in participants treated with sevasemten, which are consistent with prior observations. “We are pleased by the promising and consistent functional results observed over two years of treatment with sevasemten, together with the favorable safety and tolerability profile,” said Joanne Donovan, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Edgewise. “We thank the Becker community for engaging with us on this promising therapy.” “Becker is a devastating neuromuscular disease that currently has no treatment,” said Barry J. Byrne, M.D., Ph.D., Director, Powell Gene Therapy Center, University of Florida and Chief Medical Adviser for MDA. “Once symptoms of muscle weakness occur, individuals with Becker have a relentless course of disease progression. In my experience, each one-point decrease in NSAA represents a loss of function important to daily activities. I have been closely following the progress of sevasemten in the clinic and am encouraged by the two-year results and the potential of this novel muscle-targeted therapy for individuals with Becker.” The positive results from the two-year ARCH trial further support the hypothesis that a reduction in contraction-induced muscle damage in muscular dystrophies has the potential to preserve function and halt disease progression in Becker. Upcoming ARCH 24-Month Data Presentations with Investor, Medical and Patient Communities: Virtual Investor Event Members of the Edgewise management team will hold a live webcast on Tuesday, April 16, at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss the ARCH two-year data, and will be joined by Dr. Byrne, who will share his perspective of sevasemten and Becker.

The trial evaluated sevasemten administered daily over two years. Safety, tolerability, PK, changes in biomarkers of muscle damage such as CK and fast skeletal muscle troponin I, measures of function and patient-reported outcomes were evaluated. Go to clinicaltrials.gov to learn more about this trial (NCT05160415). About GRAND CANYON, a Global Pivotal Study in Becker The Company is advancing GRAND CANYON, a global pivotal study of EDG-5506 in individuals with Becker. GRAND CANYON is an expansion of the CANYON placebo-controlled trial. CANYON, which was over-enrolled, includes cohorts of 40 adults and 29 adolescents and a treatment period of 12 months. The Company expects to report CANYON data in the fourth quarter of 2024. GRAND CANYON is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EDG-5506 in adults with Becker. Data from GRAND CANYON, if positive, could support a marketing application. The primary endpoint of GRAND CANYON is NSAA. In addition, other functional assessments, biomarkers of muscle damage and safety will be assessed. GRAND CANYON is anticipated to recruit approximately 120 individuals with Becker, aged between 18 and 50 years old, at up to 50 sites in 10 countries. The treatment period for participants will be 18 months. To learn more, go to clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05291091) or the GRAND CANYON microsite: https://www.beckergcstudy.com. About Becker Muscular Dystrophy Becker is a rare, genetic, life-shortening, debilitating and degenerative neuromuscular disorder. The disease predominantly affects males and imposes significant physical, emotional, financial, and social impacts on the individual and their caregivers. Individuals with Becker experience contraction-induced muscle damage, which is the primary driver of muscle loss and impaired motor function in muscular dystrophies. Functional decline can begin at any age, and once that muscle loss occurs, the decline in function is irreversible and continues throughout the individual’s life. Some individuals living with Becker experience heart failure from cardiomyopathy, which may result in heart transplantation or early death. Currently, there is no cure for Becker; early and long-term multidisciplinary care is critical for optimized disease management. There is a great need for more Becker-specific scientific research, clinical programs, and treatment guidelines to improve management of this disease. To learn more about Becker, go to https://beckermusculardystrophy.com/ About Sevasemten (EDG-5506) for Becker and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophies Sevasemten is an orally administered small molecule designed to prevent contraction-induced muscle damage in dystrophinopathies including Becker and Duchenne. Sevasemten presents a novel mechanism of action designed to selectively limit the exaggerated muscle damage caused by the absence or loss of functional dystrophin. By minimizing the progressive muscle damage that leads to functional impairment, sevasemten has the potential to benefit a broad range of patients suffering from debilitating neuromuscular disorders. Its unique mechanism of action provides the potential to establish sevasemten as a foundational therapy in dystrophinopathies, either as a single agent therapy or in combination with available therapies and those in development. In Becker, Edgewise is advancing sevasemten in a Phase 2 trial, called CANYON, evaluating safety and effects on function and biomarkers of muscle damage in adult males with Becker. The CANYON trial, which is fully enrolled, has been expanded to include an additional 120 adult participants in a pivotal cohort called GRAND CANYON. This study is currently enrolling at sites in the United States and Europe. In Duchenne, Edgewise is advancing its LYNX Phase 2 clinical trial, assessing safety, PK, biomarkers of muscle damage and functional measures in boys with Duchenne. It also is advancing a second Phase 2 trial, called FOX, assessing safety, PK, biomarkers of muscle damage and functional measures in children and adolescents previously treated with gene therapy.

Preliminary second quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The company reiterates guidance for fiscal 2024.","Mitek Reports Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Financial Results and Provides Preliminary Second Quarter Revenue Results Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Mitek Systems, Inc. reports fiscal 2024 first quarter financial results with total revenue of $36.9 million, a GAAP operating loss of $6.9 million, and a non-GAAP net income of $6.3 million. Preliminary second quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The company reiterates guidance for fiscal 2024. Positive Mitek reported a total revenue of $36.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a decrease from $45.7 million a year ago. The GAAP operating loss for the first quarter was $6.9 million, resulting in a negative operating margin of 19%, compared to a GAAP operating income of $8.4 million and an operating margin of 18% in the previous year. Non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter was $5.6 million with a non-GAAP operating margin of 15%, down from $18.4 million and a margin of 40% in the same period last year. The company reported a non-GAAP net income of $6.3 million for the first quarter, a decrease from $14.3 million in the previous year. Cash flow from operations was negative $9.5 million, impacted by cash taxes paid for FY2023 and the final ID R&D earnout payment. Total cash and investments decreased to $123.9 million at December 31, 2023, from $134.9 million on September 30, 2023. Mitek expects second quarter revenue to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The company's independent auditor has not reviewed or audited the preliminary estimated financial results. Actual results may differ from the preliminary financial results, and the company has not completed its review of these results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the fiscal 2024 first quarter financial results of Mitek Systems reveals a significant decline in revenue and profitability from the comparable quarter a year ago. The reported total revenue dropped over 19% from $45.7 million to $36.9 million. This dip, alongside a transition from a GAAP operating income of $8.4 million to a GAAP operating loss of $6.9 million, reflects a shift to a negative operating margin of 19%, suggesting substantial pressure on the company's cost structure or potential changes in the competitive landscape.Examining the non-GAAP metrics, which exclude certain non-recurring items, the picture does not improve much. The non-GAAP operating margin has decreased from 40% to 15% and non-GAAP net income has more than halved, from $14.3 million to $6.3 million. Such a stark contrast year-over-year raises concerns about Mitek's ability to manage expenses or maintain pricing power in its market.Furthermore, the negative cash flow from operations, primarily driven by cash taxes and earnout payments, is another red flag. A decline in cash reserves from $134.9 million to $123.9 million in just one quarter could limit Mitek’s ability to invest in growth opportunities or withstand prolonged market downturns. Investors should monitor whether these trends are anomalous or indicative of deeper issues within the company or industry. Market Research Analyst The preliminary second quarter revenue outlook provided by Mitek, forecasting between $46 million to $47 million, suggests a potential rebound. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the fact that these figures have not been reviewed or audited by the company's independent auditor. From a market perspective, fluctuations in estimates can introduce uncertainty and risk for investors, especially when such estimates are not backed by external verification.Another concern arises from the management's comment regarding a large one-time mobile deposit reorder in the previous year, which indicates that part of the prior success was not due to recurring revenue streams. This underscores the importance for Mitek to diversify and stabilize its revenue sources to ensure sustainable long-term growth. If the company fails to do so, it may face more volatility and scrutiny from the market.It's vital for stakeholders to consider both the short-term potential revenue rebound and the longer-term need for a stable and predictable business model. In the fast-evolving digital identity and fraud prevention industry, Mitek must demonstrate strategic adaptability to uphold investor confidence. Legal Expert It is worth noting the company's acknowledgment that the preliminary financial results for the second quarter have not been subjected to formal review or audit. This lack of external validation can pose legal and financial risks, as any material discrepancies found later could lead to legal consequences, including litigation or regulatory scrutiny. Companies in the public domain are expected to maintain transparency and accuracy in their financial reporting and any deviation from these expectations could impact their reputation and trust among stakeholders.Moreover, the completion of the final ID R&D earnout payment, as mentioned in the cash flow statement, indicates that Mitek has settled its acquisition-related obligations. While this may resolve certain legal contingencies, it is important for Mitek to thoroughly review its preliminary results and clarify any risks or uncertainties that could affect the financials to maintain compliance with legal and financial regulations. 04/15/2024 - 04:05 PM Company Reiterates Guidance for Fiscal 2024 SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: MITK, www.miteksystems.com, “Mitek” or the “Company”), a global leader in digital identity and fraud prevention, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended December 31, 2023, and provided select preliminary results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2024. Mitek also reiterated its previously provided guidance for its 2024 fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Financial Results Total revenue was $36.9 million, compared to $45.7 million a year ago. GAAP operating loss was $6.9 million, an operating margin of negative 19%, compared to GAAP operating income of $8.4 million, an operating margin of 18% a year ago. GAAP net loss was $5.8 million, or negative $0.13 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $4.7 million, or $0.10 per diluted share a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 15%, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $18.4 million and a non-GAAP operating margin of 40% last year. Non-GAAP net income was $6.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to $14.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share last year. Cash flow from operations was a negative $9.5 million, driven by $7.8 million in cash taxes paid for FY2023 during the quarter and $4.6 million in cash paid for the final ID R&D earnout payment. Total cash and investments was $123.9 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $134.9 million on September 30, 2023. Preliminary Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Revenue Results Mitek expects fiscal second quarter revenue to be in the range of $46 million to $47 million. The Company’s independent auditor has not reviewed or audited these preliminary estimated financial results. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from these preliminary financial results, and may be outside the estimated ranges. This preliminary financial data has been prepared by and is the responsibility of the Company. The Company has not fully completed its review of these preliminary financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. Mitek CEO Max Carnecchia’s Comments ""As previously discussed, in the first quarter of last year we had a large one-time multi-year mobile deposit reorder that pulled forward about $7 million of future year revenue into that quarter, including $2.7 million that would have been recognized in fiscal Q1’24, creating a very difficult year over year comparison. It’s important to note that this quarter’s results are not representative of a business trend, in fact, to the contrary. With our fiscal 2024 guidance, which we are reiterating today, we expect our Deposits product revenue to grow 10 to 12% year over year on a normalized basis and our Identity product revenue to grow 10 to 12% year over year. We anticipate that much of this growth will occur in the second half of the fiscal year, with growth continuing in fiscal 2025.

Fiscal 2024 Full Year Guidance Mitek is reiterating its previously provided guidance for its fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, as follows: Mitek expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $180.0 million to $185.0 million, a 6% growth rate at the midpoint of the range. In fiscal 2023, Mitek signed a large multi-year mobile deposit reorder with one customer that locked in favorable pricing over a four-year period. Due to the unique terms of this contract, Mitek recognized additional license revenue relating to future years of approximately $7.0 million in fiscal 2023. If the Company backs out the future year revenue of $7 million from its fiscal 2023 revenue and attributes the $2.7 million that would have been attributable to fiscal 2024 to the midpoint of the fiscal 2024 revenue guidance, it would represent growth of approximately 12.0% at the revised midpoint. Mitek expects its non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2024 to be between 30.0% and 31.0%.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks related to the Company’s ability to withstand negative conditions in the global economy, a lack of demand for or market acceptance of the Company’s products, the impact of the Company’s acquisition of HooYu Ltd. including any operational or cultural difficulties associated with the integration of the businesses of Mitek and HooYu Ltd., the Company’s ability to continue to develop, produce and introduce innovative new products in a timely manner, the Company’s ability to capitalize on a growing market, quarterly variations in revenue, the profitability of certain sectors of the Company, the performance of the Company’s growth initiatives, the outcome of any pending or threatened litigation, and the timing of the implementation and launch of the Company’s products by the Company’s signed customers. Additional risks and uncertainties faced by the Company are contained from time to time in the Company’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, but not limited to, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 19, 2024 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, which you may obtain for free on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release contains non-U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) financial measures for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share that exclude acquisition-related costs and expenses, litigation and other legal costs, executive transition costs, stock compensation expense, non-recurring audit fees, enterprise risk, portfolio positioning and other related costs, and restructuring costs. These financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. In evaluating the Company’s performance, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial statements prepared under GAAP. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful measure of the Company’s operating results, a meaningful comparison with historical results and with the results of other companies, and insight into the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Further, management and the Board of Directors of the Company utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to gain a better understanding of the Company’s comparative operating performance from period-to-period and as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial statements, are useful to investors because they provide a basis for meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s ongoing operating results, including results of operations against investor and analyst financial models, which helps identify trends in the Company’s underlying business and provides a better understanding of how management plans and measures the Company’s underlying business. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of its forward outlook for non-GAAP operating margin with its forward-looking GAAP operating margin in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to quantify share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from our non-GAAP operating margin, as it requires additional inputs such as the number of shares granted and market prices that are not ascertainable due to the volatility of the Company’s share price. Additionally, a significant portion of the Company’s operations are in foreign countries and the transactional currencies are primarily Euros and British pound sterling and the Company is not able to predict fluctuations in those currencies without unreasonable efforts.

The estimated cash tax rate is the estimated annual tax payable on the Company’s tax returns as a percentage of estimated annual non-GAAP pre-tax net income. The Company uses an estimated cash tax rate to adjust for the historical variation in the effective book tax rate associated with the reversal of valuation allowances, and the utilization of research and development tax credits which currently have an overall effect of reducing taxes payable. The Company believes that the cash tax rate provides a more transparent view of the Company’s operating results. The Company’s effective tax rate used for the purposes of calculating GAAP net income for fiscal 2024 and 2023 was 23% and 28%, respectively. MITEK SYSTEMS, INC.

Financial Analyst Examining Skillsoft Corp's disclosed financial results reveals key insights into the company's performance. The reported increase in full-year Adjusted EBITDA above the top end of their outlook range indicates operational efficiency and possibly effective cost management, which can be attractive to investors looking for companies with strong bottom-line control. An accelerated 4% revenue growth in the subscription-based Content & Platform segment suggests that the company's strategic focus on this area is yielding positive results, considering this sector's scalability and recurring revenue potential.The increase in long-term dollar retention rates to 101% for the fourth quarter is particularly significant, as it suggests customer satisfaction and an inclination towards renewals, which is paramount in the Subscription as a Service (SaaS) business model. However, the 16% decline in the Instructor-Led Training segment revenue might raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain growth across all its service lines.From a forward-looking perspective, the GAAP net loss, including a substantial non-cash charge for goodwill and intangible impairment, paints a complex picture. While the reduction in GAAP net loss year-over-year is positive, the impairment charge could be indicative of overvaluation of assets in prior periods or changing market conditions affecting asset values. The free cash flow improvement is a healthy sign, supporting the narrative of a turnaround, but the negative free cash flow for the full year warrants monitoring. As for the financial outlook for the fiscal year 2025, the projected stability in Adjusted EBITDA offers a conservative but stable growth narrative. Market Research Analyst The data reflects an industry-wide shift towards digital and AI-driven learning platforms, with Skillsoft's new GenAI capabilities and partnerships like Accenture LearnVantage being directly in line with market trends towards upskilling in technology sectors. By integrating advanced tools like ChatGPT and AI-powered systems within their Codecademy platform, Skillsoft is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for AI literacy in the workforce.Recognition with a 2024 AI Excellence Award indicates industry acknowledgment and could potentially influence customer perceptions positively. This strategic alignment with emergent AI opportunities is important for maintaining competitive advantage and customer relevance. However, there is a juxtaposition at play here—with rapid technological advancements, there is an inherent risk that today's cutting-edge technology might become tomorrow's obsolete offering, necessitating continuous innovation and investment.Furthermore, the company's upward adjustment in EBITDA and positive outlook for the next fiscal year is an indicator of management's confidence in their business strategy. However, it's imperative to consider market saturation and intensifying competition in the e-learning space, which could impact long-term growth prospects and profitability. The focus on enterprise customers for workforce AI training is a smart move, given the expansive growth potential in corporate training expenditure amidst digital transformation trends. 04/15/2024 - 04:05 PM Delivers Full-Year Adjusted EBITDA Above the Top End of Outlook Range Accelerates Revenue Growth in Subscription-Based Content & Platform Segment to 4% for the Fourth Quarter Increases LTM Dollar Retention Rates to 101% for the Fourth Quarter DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Skillsoft Corp.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures And Key Performance Metrics We track the non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics that we believe are key financial measures of our success. Non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many of which present non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics when reporting their results. These measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of U.S. GAAP financial disclosures. For example, a company with higher U.S. GAAP net income may not be as appealing to investors if its net income is more heavily comprised of gains on asset sales. Likewise, excluding the effects of interest income and expense moderates the impact of a company’s capital structure on its performance. However, non-GAAP measures and key performance metrics have limitations as analytical tools. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. They are not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity, and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, these performance measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided at the back of this release reconciliations of our historical non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures. We do not reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures, due to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections and/or certain information not being ascertainable or accessible; and because not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is available to us without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. We provide non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will be achieved, however we cannot accurately predict all of the components of the adjusted calculations and the U.S. GAAP measures may be materially different than the non-GAAP measures. We disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics in this press release because we believe these non-GAAP financial measures and key performance metrics provide meaningful supplemental information. Bookings - Bookings in any particular period represents the dollar value of orders received during that period and reflects (i) subscription renewals, upgrades, churn, and downgrades to existing customers, (ii) non- subscription services, and (iii) sales to new customers. Bookings generally represents a customer’s annual obligation (versus the life of the contract), and, for the subscription business, revenue is recognized for such bookings over the following 12 months. We use bookings to measure and monitor current period business activity with respect to our ability to sell subscriptions, and accompanying services to our platform. Bookings are adjusted and presented on a pro forma basis as if Codecademy had merged on February 1, 2022, to enhance comparability. Pro forma revenue – Pro forma revenue is defined as GAAP revenue adjusted in accordance with Regulation S-X, Article 11 as if Codecademy had merged on February 1, 2022, to enhance comparability. Pro forma revenue is reconciled to the reported GAAP revenue for all periods presented. Dollar retention rate (“DRR”) - For existing customers at the beginning of a given period, DRR represents subscription renewals, upgrades, churn, and downgrades in such period divided by the beginning total renewable base for such customers for such period. Renewals reflect customers who renew their subscription, inclusive of auto-renewals for multi-year contracts, while churn reflects customers who choose to not renew their subscription. Upgrades include orders from customers that purchase additional licenses or content (e.g., a new Leadership and Business module), while downgrades reflect customers electing to decrease the number of licenses or reduce the size of their content package. Upgrades and downgrades also reflect changes in pricing. We use our DRR to measure the long-term value of customer contracts as well as our ability to retain and expand the revenue generated from our existing customers. Adjusted net income (loss) - Adjusted net income/(loss) is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash items, discrete and event-specific costs that do not represent normal, recurring, cash operating expenses necessary for our business operations, and certain accounting income and/or expenses that management believes are necessary to enhance the comparability and are useful in assessing our operating performance, include the following (including the related tax effects): Stock-based compensation expense – Non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation. Restructuring charges – Severance costs and the abandonment of right-of-use assets resulting from the acquisition integration process and cost saving initiatives. Fair value adjustments – Mark-to-market adjustments of warrants and hedge instruments. Foreign currency impact – Unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains or losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Acquisition and integration related costs – Costs incurred to effectuate an acquisition, including contingent compensation expenses, and integration related costs. Transformation costs – Costs incurred to transform our operations through significant strategic non-ordinary course transactions. System migration costs – Costs of temporary resources needed for the migration of content and customers from our legacy system to a global platform. Income from discontinued operations – Income from discontinued operations that do not reflect our current operating performance. (Gain) loss sale of business – Gain or loss on non-routine sale on business. Impairment charges - Non-cash goodwill, intangible or other asset impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted net loss excluding interest expense or income, benefit from or provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses - GAAP operating expenses, less depreciation, stock-based compensation, system migration costs, transformation costs, other non-cash charges and pro forma adjustments, as applicable. Pro forma adjusted net income (loss) – Pro forma adjusted net income (loss) is defined as adjusted net income (loss) adjusted in accordance with Regulation S-X, Article 11 as if Codecademy had merged on February 1, 2022, to enhance comparability. Pro forma adjusted net income (loss) per share – Pro forma adjusted net income (loss) per share is defined as adjusted net income (loss) defined above divided by weighted average common shares outstanding. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA – Pro forma adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted EBITDA adjusted in accordance with Regulation S-X, Article 11 as if Codecademy had merged on February 1, 2022, to enhance comparability. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA % of pro forma revenue – Pro forma adjusted EBITDA % of pro forma revenue is defined as pro forma adjusted EBITDA defined above as a percentage of pro forma revenue defined above. Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in prior years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications had no effect on total assets, total liabilities, total stockholders' equity, or net income (loss) for the prior year.

The all-stock deal, valued at approximately $510.3 million, heightens Wintrust’s competitive edge in this market. The mention of 'exceptional asset quality' indicates Macatawa's balance sheet strength, which may reassure investors about the quality of assets Wintrust is acquiring. It’s also noteworthy that the transaction isn’t expected to materially affect Wintrust’s earnings per share in 2024, suggesting that the acquisition is being financed in a way that maintains earnings stability. However, investors typically keep an eye on post-merger integration, which is where the promise of 'combined synergies' will be put to the test.For market participants, the key lies in evaluating how this deal could reshape market dynamics in Michigan’s banking sector. Considering the transaction is subject to regulatory approval, it’s a reminder of the oversight such mergers attract, especially when the consolidation has the potential to affect the competitive landscape. Financial Risk Analyst The terms outlined, while initially promising, do carry inherent risks associated with mergers and acquisitions. Although the expectation is for this merger to enhance product and service offerings, potential integration challenges can arise, such as cultural misalignment and customer retention issues. The fact that both banks emphasize community banking and customer service as core values may help mitigate some of these risks.Furthermore, the deal specifics mention retaining the Macatawa Bank name and key employees, which can be viewed as a strategic move to preserve the acquired bank's local brand equity and customer loyalty. However, the absence of material impact on Wintrust’s 2024 EPS could be seen as a conservative estimate, factoring in the costs associated with merger-related activities. It is essential for stakeholders to consider the long-term potential for cost savings and revenue growth against the short-term expenses that accompany such a transaction. Banking Industry Analyst This merger highlights a trend towards consolidation in the banking industry, particularly among community banks seeking to leverage scale while maintaining a local presence. The move to operate Macatawa as a separately chartered bank under the Wintrust umbrella is a method often employed to address regulatory considerations and maintain community banking models. This strategic approach could provide Wintrust with the flexibility to cater to specific local market needs while benefiting from the broader capabilities of a larger banking organization.Analysts looking at the merger's regional implications will likely focus on how the expanded range of products and services offered by Wintrust could impact customer acquisition and retention in the competitive West Michigan market. Further, the ability to increase operational efficiencies through shared technology and resources could offer long-term benefits to shareholders and customers alike, through improved service offerings and potentially enhanced shareholder value. 04/15/2024 - 04:04 PM ROSEMONT, Ill. and HOLLAND, Mich., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wintrust Financial Corporation (“Wintrust”) (Nasdaq: WTFC) and Macatawa Bank Corporation (“Macatawa”) (Nasdaq: MCBC) today jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement for Wintrust to acquire Macatawa in an all-stock transaction. Macatawa is the parent company of Macatawa Bank, a Michigan state-chartered bank, which is headquartered in Holland, Michigan and operates a network of 26 full-service branches located throughout communities in Kent, Ottawa and northern Allegan counties, including Grand Rapids. Founded in 1997, Macatawa has an exemplary history of serving its communities. As of December 31, 2023, it had approximately $2.7 billion in assets, $2.4 billion in deposits and $1.3 billion in loans. Macatawa’s approach to customer service is similar to that at each of the fifteen Wintrust Community Banks and their more than 170 banking locations. Like Wintrust, Macatawa prides itself on delivering outstanding service to both consumer and commercial clients. Timothy S. Crane, President and CEO of Wintrust, said, “Macatawa provides an ideal platform to expand into West Michigan with a very solid bank. The bank has a strong core deposit base, exceptional asset quality, a client focused culture, and a committed leadership team. Together, we will be a formidable, community-minded competitor to the other banks in the area. We look forward to the combined synergies that our two firms can realize while providing Macatawa’s customers with an expanded array of products and services.” Richard L. Postma, Chairman of the Board of Macatawa, said, “Wintrust provides Macatawa with the ability to retain and enhance its uniquely personalized consumer and commercial community presence in the West Michigan area by retaining the Macatawa Bank name, its key employees, branches, and a legally constituted community bank board, as a separately chartered bank. We anticipate a seamless transition to becoming the 16th successful community bank subsidiary of Wintrust, and the only subsidiary located within the State of Michigan. We are confident that this transaction, which combines similar cultures and operating philosophies, will result in a continued community bank that offers all the enhanced services, products and technology of Wintrust to meet the evolving banking needs of our customers.” Jon W. Swets, President and CEO of Macatawa, stated, “This transaction brings together two companies that share a core community banking philosophy. Wintrust’s track record of serving families, individuals and businesses with exemplary products and services make it an attractive partner. This partnership offers our customers, employees and communities the long-term benefits that being part of a successful, growing and caring organization brings.” Mr. Swets emphasized that joining forces with Wintrust, “allows us to continue focusing on serving our customers and growing our presence by providing our customers with access to a wider range of products, services and resources. We see many advantages for our customers and shareholders, and we look forward to joining the Wintrust family.” Terms of the Transaction Subject to possible adjustment as provided in the merger agreement, the aggregate purchase price to Macatawa shareholders is currently estimated to be approximately $510.3 million, or $14.85 per share. In the transaction, each share of Macatawa common stock outstanding will be converted into the right to receive merger consideration paid in shares of Wintrust common stock based on Wintrust’s average trading price at closing determined in accordance with the merger agreement. The transaction is subject to approval by banking regulators, approval of Macatawa’s shareholders and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2024 and is not expected to have a material effect on Wintrust’s 2024 earnings per share. Advisors Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as financial advisor and Warner Norcross + Judd LLP acted as legal advisor to Macatawa in the transaction. ArentFox Schiff LLP served as legal advisor to Wintrust.

(NASDAQ: OCCI) provided an update on its net asset value (NAV) estimate for March 31, 2024, ranging between $7.42 and $7.52 per share. The company cautioned that future NAV estimates may differ due to various factors like interest rates, geopolitical events, and market volatility. Positive None. Negative Future net asset value (NAV) estimates may differ from the current estimate due to various factors like interest rates, geopolitical events, and market volatility, potentially impacting the company's financial condition and results of operations. The company's NAV estimate for March 31, 2024, is unaudited and subject to change based on future determinations, potentially leading to material impacts on net investment income and the underlying value of investments. Financial Analyst The recent net asset value estimate provided by OFS Credit Company serves as an interim indicator of the company's financial condition, specifically concerning its investments in collateralized loan obligation securities. The range of $7.42 to $7.52 per share reflects the company's assessment of the fair value of their portfolio as of March 2024. This figure is particularly noteworthy for investors as it hints at potential valuation changes in the short term. However, the absence of quarter-end financial closing procedures suggests that this estimate may not fully encapsulate the company's financial health.Investors should also consider the macroeconomic factors highlighted by the company, such as interest and inflation rates, geopolitical conflicts and market volatility. These elements can significantly affect the performance of CLOs and, consequently, OFS Credit's NAV. Given the company's candidness about the potential material impact of these events, a degree of caution is warranted. The disclaimer regarding the unaudited nature of this estimate further emphasizes the preliminary status of the data. The lack of assurance from their auditing firm, KPMG LLP, leaves room for future financial revelations that could materially alter investor perceptions. Risk Management Expert In the context of OFS Credit's NAV announcement, it's critical to dissect the numerous risk factors provided. The mention of elevated interest and inflation rates, international conflicts and systemic banking instability outlines a gamut of risks that could adversely affect CLO equity and debt securities. Such factors may not only impact the fair value of the portfolio but also the underlying financial condition of the individual portfolio investments. As these securities are tied to corporate loans, any economic downturn or increased default rates could diminish the portfolio's value and the company's net investment income.Moreover, the potential for a U.S. government shutdown or service interruptions could introduce substantial volatility, affecting liquidity and market sentiment. For stakeholders, this means there could be significant short-term NAV fluctuations, necessitating a more comprehensive risk assessment and strategic response plan to offset any potential negative impacts on investment returns. The nuanced understanding of these risk factors and their possible interplay, is important for maintaining portfolio resilience in the face of uncertainties. 04/15/2024 - 04:00 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFS Credit Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: OCCI) (“OFS Credit”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”), an investment company that primarily invests in collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity and debt securities, today announced the following net asset value (“NAV”) estimate as of March 31, 2024.

(OSS) CEO and Chairman share a letter with shareholders outlining the company's successes in 2023 and expectations for a transformative 2024. Positive None. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 04:04 PM Looking forward to a Transformative 2024ESCONDIDO, Calif., April 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One Stop Systems, Inc. (“OSS” or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: OSS), a leader in rugged Enterprise Class compute for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and sensor processing at the edge, today issued a shareholder letter, which reviews the successes championed in 2023 and outlines expectations for a transformative 2024. Dear Fellow Shareholders, We are excited about the opportunity ahead of us and the positive momentum underway at OSS. Since my appointment as President and CEO in June 2023, I am proud of the progress the OSS team has made advancing our growth strategies, optimizing our business processes, and building a strong team and Board of Directors. As a result of these investments, we believe we have developed a robust infrastructure that is well positioned to take advantage of growing demand for the Company’s rugged enterprise class compute solutions. Throughout 2023 we made strategic investments in our leadership team and Board to align OSS with the long-term opportunities we are pursuing. In addition to my appointment, Robert Kalebaugh joined OSS as Vice President of Sales and Business Development. Robert brings over 35 years of defense and commercial experience to OSS and has quickly built a strong sales platform and culture. In addition, we have recently added new program management personnel, and a highly experienced business development executive to further our sales reach across U.S. and international defense and commercial markets. As the tenure of our sales team grows, we are focused on converting our strong pipeline into orders throughout 2024 and beyond. We also added several new Board members as part of a multi-year strategy to reprofile our Board of Directors. Vice Admiral (Ret) Michael Dumont, USN, Mitch Herbets and Joseph Manko all joined our Board in 2023. Mike, Mitch, and Joe are proven leaders, bringing defense, technology, governance, and capital markets experience to OSS. I am pleased with the support, leadership, and guidance they have already brought to the Board and the OSS team. I also want to use this opportunity to say thank you to David Raun, our prior CEO, for his guidance and leadership during this transition. Throughout the year the OSS leadership team was able to effectively manage the business as we transitioned away from $13.7 million of low-margin legacy media revenue. In fact, backing out this impact revenue in 2023 increased year-over-year by 4%. I am pleased to report that despite this impact to overall sales, we maintained positive adjusted EBITDA in 2023 reflecting our shift to higher margin revenue opportunities, our focus on controlling costs, and the compelling financial model we have created. In addition, during 2023 we implemented process improvements to drive efficiencies, and successfully achieved our Department of Defense facility clearance paving the way for OSS to execute classified work. Our Bressner team delivered on its 2023 financial objectives while expanding their business, enabling the strategic shift for the OSS business overall. Looking forward to 2024, I am excited about leveraging the capabilities that differentiate OSS in the market. As a company we have proven to be pioneers at bringing enterprise class capabilities to challenging environments. We offer unique product solutions that provide low latency, high throughput, scalable solutions in real time applications. We leverage configurable, off-the-shelf, and custom high-performance solutions that enable OSS to rapidly develop cost-effective products for our customers. We are seen by customers as technology experts with a legacy of solving customer challenges and have built strong partnerships with leading enterprise AI compute suppliers. We believe the technology, product development, and partnership structure we have developed is unique, as we deliver best-in-class performance, and scalable products and solutions to enable AI/ML, sensor fusion, sensor processing, and autonomy for global defense and commercial markets. These markets continue to be backed by strong and growing demand for AI/ML and will be for years to come. In fact, we see that in defense markets the spend on integration of AI/ML, sensor fusion, and autonomy are increasing rapidly as the military seeks to create a winning advantage on new and existing platforms. We refer to our markets as AI Transportables, which aligns with our strategic focus on providing ruggedized solutions at the edge to support AI/ML, sensor fusion and autonomy for global defense and commercial customers. In the commercial space, we have seen a delay in the full implementation of autonomous trucking primarily due to evolving government regulations. We remain committed to this market, and we continue to design, develop, and prototype compute, storage, and cooling solutions for our customers including some of the world’s leading commercial vehicle manufacturers. We also successfully expanded our reach within the commercial sector with a new 5-year agreement with FLYHT for their commercial aerospace airborne data recorder and developed a new relationship with Andretti Racing and Zapata AI for race analytics. We believe these are the early adopters, and we expect new applications, solutions, and investments in AI/ML to support a growing need for our enterprise edge compute solutions for years to come. On the Defense side, we expanded existing programs such as the Army 360 Degree Situational Awareness program and the Navy P-8. We added multiple new customers and platforms for AI and sensor fusion processing including U.S. Armed Services and U.S. intelligence agencies. We are motivated and driven by the fact that our solutions can advance AI, propel commercial markets, and create winning advantages for our warfighters. Based on execution of our strategy, we will prioritize our focus on translating efforts into profitable pipeline and backlog growth, building an effective and talented team, driving continued product leadership, maturing processes as we scale, and driving development of key partnerships to include AI software providers. With the majority of our short-term initiatives behind us, our leadership team, in collaboration with the Board, is in the process of updating our multi-year strategic growth plan. We look forward to sharing the key actions we are taking, as well as the financial objectives we are focused on achieving once the plan is finalized in the coming months. We believe 2024 will be a transformational year for OSS and we are excited by the long-term opportunities we are pursuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders. The OSS team, Board of Directors, and I would like to extend our appreciation to all of our team members for their contribution and commitment to our customers, quality, and profitable growth of the company. We also would like to thank our shareholders and customers for their continued support as we continue to bring innovative solutions to market. Continued execution of our strategies will result in further enabling our customers’ success and bring enhanced shareholder value to our investors.

"ClearBridge Investments Sends Letter Urging Board of Directors of Model N, Inc. to Reconsider Proposed Acquisition by Vista Equity Partners",2024-04-15T20:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ClearBridge Investments, Inc. has sent a letter urging Model N, Inc. to reconsider the proposed acquisition by Vista Equity Partners.

ClearBridge Investments owns 6.97% of Model N's outstanding common stock and believes the acquisition undervalues the company's potential. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst In an acquisition scenario, the priority is to scrutinize the valuation metrics used to determine the offer price relative to the intrinsic value of the target company. A stakeholder owning 6.97% of a company holds significant influence and can drive critical discussions. If the acquisition undervalues the company, it might not reflect the true future cash flows, growth prospects, or the strategic positioning within the industry. This could lead to a potential underpayment for shareholders, hence it's imperative to examine the acquisition premium, peer transaction multiples and the historical trading range. Model N's standing in the market, competitive advantages and financial health, including revenue growth patterns and profitability margins, are key factors to consider. One must compare these parameters with industry benchmarks and the known acquisition strategies of Vista Equity Partners to ascertain if there is a mismatch in valuation. It's also noteworthy that such pushbacks can either lead to improved offers or to a re-evaluation of the strategic alternatives available. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the fiduciary duties of Model N’s board involve acting in the best interests of all shareholders. Therefore, when significant shareholders voice concerns, it spurs a closer examination of the acquisition terms and fairness opinions. Typically, the board must demonstrate due diligence in considering the offer, which involves understanding the buyer's motivations and any synergies expected from the transaction. Furthermore, disclosures to shareholders and the accuracy of public statements will come under scrutiny, particularly if the acquisition is challenged. The involvement of equity firms like Vista often indicates a plan for operational or strategic reformation, which may or may not align with the current management's vision for Model N’s future. A shareholder vote introduces another layer of complexity, as it presents an opportunity for dissenting shareholders to formally oppose the deal, potentially leading to renegotiations or, in some cases, to litigation if they perceive a breach of fiduciary duties. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market context is essential to evaluate such an acquisition offer. Model N operates within a specific market niche and its value proposition may be augmented by industry trends and forecasts. Analysts must investigate how similar deals have been valued and completed in recent times, taking note of the economic conditions, sector-specific challenges and opportunities.Considering the demand for Model N’s services, the competitive landscape and its customer base are also integral to understanding the long-term potential that an acquirer like Vista Equity Partners may be seeing—or undervaluing. ClearBridge's opposition could either reflect a strong belief in Model N's standalone potential or point to larger industry dynamics that they feel are not being adequately factored into the acquisition price. Market sentiment following ClearBridge's letter could influence other investors and analysts, which may affect the stock's performance leading up to the shareholder vote. 04/15/2024 - 04:00 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ClearBridge Investments, Inc. has sent a letter to the Chairman of the Board of Model N, Inc. (NYSE: MODN). The purpose of the letter is to urge Model N’s Board of Directors to reconsider its recently announced agreement to be acquired by Vista Equity Partners. The full text of the letter follows. Jeffrey Bailin and Aram Green ClearBridge Investments, LLC 620 8th Avenue, 48th Floor New York, NY 10018 April 15, 2024 Baljit Dail Model N, Inc. 777 Mariners Island Boulevard, Suite 300 San Mateo, CA 94404 Dear Mr. Dail and Members of the Model N Board of Directors, We are writing on behalf of several strategies at ClearBridge Investments, a $188 billion global equity manager, to offer our thoughts on the proposed acquisition of Model N by Vista Equity Partners. We own 6.97% of the outstanding common stock of Model N as of Dec. 31, 2023. We believe the proposed acquisition materially undervalues Model N’s outlook as a public company or value to strategic or financial buyers. With the proposed acquisition contingent on a shareholder vote, we intend to carefully consider whether this appropriately values Model N for our own investors. About ClearBridge Investments By way of background, ClearBridge is a global long-only equity asset manager and affiliate of Franklin Templeton. The firm had over $188 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2024. We co-manage several strategies, and seek to be long-term holders of our companies. Our strategies have below-average turnover and targeted holding periods of three to five years. Exploring Maximizing Value for Model N Shareholders We have been long-term shareholders of Model N, having first acquired a holding in September 2020. Originally, we were attracted to Model N’s unique competitive positioning, dominating a niche, high-value market selling to a resilient customer base in life sciences and high tech. We were aware the company had embarked on a cloud/SaaS subscription transition, something we have lived through in other software business models, and saw the potential for long-term upside in revenue dollars, long-term growth, and profitability. Our diligence uncovered that Model N’s product offering had limited competitive alternatives in life sciences revenue management software. With increasing regulatory burden, we anticipated there would be expansion module opportunities over time, a fact echoed by numerous management statements on the company’s cross-sell potential. The company has executed well on the SaaS transition, new logo additions, and geographic/product expansions with existing customers, all while meaningfully increasing margins. With the heavy lifting of the model transition largely finished, the company is well-positioned for accelerating performance in the medium term. Over many years, we have had numerous investments in the software space serving life science customers and have seen a variety of consolidation activities in the space by both strategic players and financial private equity buyers. Moreover, we have historically seen vertical software businesses command relatively high valuations, even as the software valuation paradigm has seen froth come out in recent years. We appreciate that the Board of Directors is balancing the risk of execution as a stand-alone entity, which is inherently uncertain and can be impacted by external factors beyond management’s control, with the certainty of a private equity cash offer. With that said, looking at a variety of private equity deals in software over the last two years, to account for the latest valuation regime, the proposed acquisition carries one of the lowest take-out multiples, and is far below the averages we see of 7-9x NTM EV/Sales. While near-term revenue growth is a little slower at Model N, the company’s targeted double-digit revenue growth and mid-20% EBITDA margin profile, coupled with competitive differentiation serving an attractive customer base, ought to warrant a higher valuation. We believe the Board of Directors and the company’s advisors should remain open minded to potentially superior offers available from either strategic or financial buyers or Model N shareholders should strongly consider the potential long-term value creation in staying a stand-alone public entity. Continuing to execute on the company’s mid-term targets should offer much higher value for patient shareholders who have endured relative under-performance on a trailing 12-month and trailing 36-month basis. Thank you for your time and consideration. Please let us know if you would like to discuss any of this further.

The company's metals products see significant adoption and growth, with April ADV reaching 1 million contracts, up 92% YoY. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst Observing the record-breaking volume in the metals complex at CME Group paints a vivid picture of market dynamics, especially in the context of geopolitical unrest. The surge to over 1.7 million contracts indicates heightened activity, possibly as investors seek hedges against inflation or currency fluctuations. This uptick, notably in precious metals, aligns with their status as traditional safe havens. The rise in base metals, on the other hand, could signal broader economic activity or supply concerns, given their industrial uses.Moreover, the diverse participation across client segments suggests a robust market acceptance of CME's product suite. This could infer a growing sophistication among market participants in utilizing derivatives for risk management. That the volume increase coincides with tangible geopolitical shifts underscores the derivatives market's sensitivity to global events, positioning CME's offerings as critical tools for investors' risk mitigation strategies. Commodities Expert Delving into the record volumes for specific products such as Micro Gold and Micro Silver futures highlights the increasing appeal of smaller-sized contracts. This suggests retail participation and a democratization of commodities trading. Accessibility to these markets allows for more nuanced portfolio diversification, spreading the previously institutional-dominated domain of risk management to individual investors.Additionally, the escalated trading in options and the records in metals options contracts reflect a strategic approach to leverage and hedging. This is particularly interesting as it may signal both a short-term response to current market conditions and a long-term strategic positioning by traders. Financial Risk Analyst The derivatives market's role in risk management is further exemplified by the significant increase in average daily volume (ADV) reported by CME Group. A 92% year-over-year growth is a substantial leap and while it signals strong market engagement, it also raises questions about market volatility and the potential for increased systemic risk. This highlights a dual role for risk analysts to both capitalize on the growth and monitor derivatives' influence on market stability.The resulting demand for deeper market analysis and risk assessment tools may also stimulate innovation within financial technology services. Financial institutions and individual traders alike will need to adapt to these evolving market indicators to maintain a competitive edge. 04/15/2024 - 03:05 PM CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that volume in its metals complex reached a record 1,728,362 contracts on Friday, April 12, 2024, surpassing the previous record of 1,670,920 contracts traded on February 28, 2020.

The collaboration aims to combine Appian's AI capabilities with Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker to provide secure and private AI solutions. Appian's private AI approach ensures data security and control for customers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic alliance between Appian and AWS heralds a significant evolution in process automation, highlighting the trend towards integrating generative AI into enterprise operations. Appian's commitment to this direction comes at a critical juncture when businesses are grappling with data security and the gap in specialized AI talent. The promise of streamlined workflow integration and easier AI adoption through low-code platforms can enhance operational efficiency and create a competitive edge. This collaboration could potentially lead to an increased demand for Appian's services, bolstering their market position and affecting the stock value positively. However, the real impact on the financial performance will depend on the adoption rate and how effectively this new offering converts into financial gains for Appian and its clients. Data Privacy Expert Appian's emphasis on private AI and data sovereignty touches on the burgeoning concerns of data privacy in technological advancements. By providing enterprises with the means to leverage AI within their own data control parameters, Appian is addressing a key market need that may influence the decision-making of privacy-conscious industries. This strategic movement might make Appian a preferred partner for companies operating in highly regulated sectors such as finance or healthcare, potentially affecting their subscriber base and recurring revenue streams. However, it remains to be seen how robust the implementation will be in practice and whether it can ensure the stringent standards required for such sensitive data handling. The effectiveness of this approach in protecting client data may have a direct impact on customer trust and, by extension, Appian's reputation and financial health. AI Technology Analyst The integration of Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker into Appian's offerings is a testament to the increasing utility of large language models and machine learning in business applications. The technical synergy between AWS's scalable infrastructure and Appian's process automation expertise could lead to more sophisticated AI solutions, enhancing decision-making and operational processes. With Appian investing in these capabilities, stakeholders should observe how this influences R&D expenses and the balance between innovation spending and profitability. Furthermore, the success of these integrations could set the pace for future tech developments within the sector, possibly sparking further collaborations or competition among cloud and AI service providers. The impact on Appian's stock will largely depend on how these technological advancements translate into tangible business outcomes and market share expansion. 04/15/2024 - 03:00 PM Collaboration leverages Amazon Bedrock and Sagemaker to power Appian's Data Fabric with generative AI capabilities MCLEAN, Va., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Appian (Nasdaq: APPN) announced today that it has signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to make generative artificial intelligence (AI) more accessible to enterprise business processes.

Amazon Bedrock is an important enabler for our private AI vision. Together, we give organizations the ability to effortlessly use AI for process automation with data privacy and security at the forefront."" ""The Appian AI Skill Designer helps us get real value from AI without needing a team of data scientists to figure it out.

The product offers a comprehensive range of pouching solutions with innovative features like gold-standard adhesives, '8-shape' pouch design, and Finite Element Analysis simulations. Positive Convatec introduces Esteem Body™ with Leak Defense™ to cater to the increasing demand for soft convexity ostomy systems. The product offers a wide range of options to fit various body types and stoma shapes, with innovative features like gold-standard adhesives and a patented '8-shape' pouch design. Convatec's use of Finite Element Analysis simulations demonstrates a commitment to data-driven solutions and scientific research in ostomy care management. Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 02:30 PM Latest ostomy system advancement in soft convexity BRIDGEWATER, N.J., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Convatec, a leading global medical products and technologies company, today announces that it has launched Esteem Body™ with Leak Defense™ in the United States. The use of soft convexity ostomy barriers, starting post-surgery, is a growing practice fueled in part by global obesity, which has nearly tripled since 19751. The trend has driven abdominal topography changes and related challenges for ostomy care management, such as skin folds and complicated abdominal contours. Convatec's new offering to address this growing patient need is a comprehensive, one-piece, soft convexity ostomy system portfolio designed to fit a full range of body types and stoma shapes. The portfolio includes drainable, closed-end, and urostomy pouching solutions. There are five principal characteristics2 of convexity design, with two of these – 'tension location' and 'convex depth' - serving as significant drivers for achieving clinical goals of stoma protrusion and/or skin flattening. Convatec's Esteem Body™ offers eight different combinations of these key characteristics, with four 'tension locations' (split centrally and peripherally) across two different 'convex depths'. This range gives greater choice and provides the healthcare provider and ostomate the ability to achieve the best possible fit, given that each person living with an ostomy is unique. Leak Defense™ refers to the exclusive combination of Convatec's gold-standard adhesives (Durahesive® and Modified Stomahesive®) coupled with the comprehensive, soft convexity range, which together are designed to adapt to the body for a secure seal that can help prevent leaks and achieve a predictable wear time. The product also offers Convatec's new 'body' pouch, which comes in a patented3 '8-shape' that has been designed to sag less as it fills4. The soft yet water-repellent 'flocking' material, that covers both sides of the pouch, is a warm gray color that hides content, even when wet, and is also discreet, even when worn under white clothing. The flocking was selected to optimise the functionality and discretion of Convatec's new, modern-looking and feeling pouch design. Convatec has recently published Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations5 that help visualize how both magnitude and location, of the tension applied to the ostomy and its surrounding multi-layer tissue, change in accordance with the product selected. It was clear how both tension location and convex depth are key contributors, working together with all convexity characteristics to achieve clinical stoma management goals. The FEA work is the foundation for the scientific and translational work Convatec is doing in ostomy care, and upon which research will be expanded to support clinicians and ostomates. Bruno Pinheiro, President & Chief Operating Officer, Ostomy Care, said: ""This launch marks a new chapter in ostomy care management, and Convatec's return to leading with data-driven solutions to address evolving, global ostomy care trends. In line with our promise of forever caring, we have listened to our customers and delivered with Esteem Body™, a new, soft convexity system to support the needs of an increasingly diverse global population. We are thrilled to present our comprehensive one-piece soft convexity range, combined with our trusted, gold standard adhesives, and delivered with a new, modern pouch to help people with an ostomy to live the life they want with the confidence of Leak Defense™.""

Negative None. 04/15/2024 - 02:30 PM To date, $130 million in rebates have been distributed through ComEd’s distributed generation rebate program CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Illinois Governor JB Pritzker today joined ComEd to present G&W Electric of Bolingbrook, Ill., with a record high Distributed Generation (DG) Rebate of $2.6 million for the construction of a massive solar-plus-storage project at its global headquarters and manufacturing center southwest of Chicago. Created by the Future Energy Jobs Act in 2017 and expanded by the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021, ComEd’s DG Rebate program has awarded $130 million in rebates since inception. It is available to commercial, industrial, and residential customers that install an eligible distributed electric renewable generation system. Distributed generation refers to a variety of technologies that generate electricity at or near where it will be used. “Since I became Governor, I’ve been focused on propelling Illinois forward into a clean energy future — ushering in a new era of environmental justice and sustainability for every community,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “That’s why, in 2021, I worked with the General Assembly and signed the landmark Climate and Equitable Jobs Act — solidifying Illinois’ status as the first state in the Midwest to commit to 100% clean energy by 2050. In addition to investing over $80 million annually to develop a renewable energy workforce, this nation-leading legislation has so far created nearly 9,800 megawatts of new solar capacity and increased funding for the Distributed Generation Rebate Program. CEJA paved the way for companies to join the fight against climate change by investing in solar power projects just like this one. Congratulations to the ComEd and G&W Electric teams!” G&W Electric, a 119-year-old manufacturer of medium and high voltage power equipment, received a DG Rebate of $600,000 for its investments in rooftop solar and a rebate of $2 million for a battery energy storage system. The solar and battery storage- the largest such installation in a commercial and industrial setting in Illinois - support G&W Electric’s microgrid, a small power grid that can operate connected to, or independently from, the ComEd electric grid to meet demand within a defined electrical boundary. The microgrid’s priority is to enhance the resiliency of the G&W Electric’s power system, while reducing its energy costs and carbon emissions. It can also provide backup power in the event of an interruption to the grid. “G&W Electric is demonstrating its well-earned reputation for industry leadership, innovation, and commitment to customers through the creation of its microgrid,” said Gil Quiniones, CEO, ComEd. “Driving innovation through the deployment of renewable energy solutions is a high priority for the state of Illinois and ComEd, and it’s on full display at G&W Electric.” G&W Electric also benefits from participating in ComEd’s Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS) by expanding the circumstances during which their solar and battery will be able to operate while connected to ComEd’s system. The DERMS alleviates impacts of excess Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to electric distribution system power quality; and enables G&W Electric to deepen its knowledge on how to integrate its microgrid with external partners and controls. G&W Electric’s microgrid project began in August of 2021, transforming the roof at the company’s Bolingbrook headquarters into one of North America's largest rooftop solar systems. With nearly 6,000 bi-facial solar panels installed, the grid covers more than 370,000 square feet, the equivalent of nearly eight football fields. Their first call to kick off the project was to ComEd. “Setting the record for ComEd’s DG rebate program is particularly rewarding to us at G&W Electric as our company was founded by two ComEd Engineers -- Harry Gear and Paul Williams,” said John Mueller, chairman, and owner of G&W Electric. “True to their vision, we set out to build a state-of-the-art microgrid that would ensure reliable and resilient energy for our mission-critical operations and bring us closer to our carbon neutral goals. Our partnership with ComEd, and their proactive involvement and guidance from the start, has been a critical component of the microgrid project’s success.” The microgrid serves as an integral part of G&W Electric’s innovation strategy to explore and test methods that support decentralization and decarbonization today. The DG rebate will be used to offset the significant investment in the microgrid’s design, deployment, and ongoing maintenance, said Mueller. G&W Electric’s microgrid became partially operational in November 2022 and fully operational by the end of 2023, resulting in numerous benefits: creating cost savings and revenue generation, improving uptime to maximize productivity, and reducing the company’s carbon footprint toward carbon neutral goals. The microgrid also has enabled the company to avoid 1,504 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, prevented outages and produced more than 3.6 gigawatt hours of energy. ComEd estimates that solar power on its grid, including rooftop and community solar systems, will grow from about 900 megawatts today (MWs) to 2,700 MWs by 2030. In 2023, ComEd completed more than 14,900 solar systems, including commercial and industrial customers, residential projects, and community solar farms. In 2023, ComEd received a record-high 20,253 applications from residential, commercial, and industrial customers to connect solar panels and other distributed energy resources to ComEd’s grid. About G&W Electric Since 1905, G&W Electric has helped power the world with innovative power grid solutions and products.

New Novartis Fabhalta® (iptacopan) data show clinically meaningful and statistically significant proteinuria reduction of 38.3% versus placebo for patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN),2024-04-15T18:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Novartis presents positive interim results for Fabhalta in treating IgA nephropathy, showing a 38.3% proteinuria reduction compared to placebo, with a favorable safety profile.","New Novartis Fabhalta® (iptacopan) data show clinically meaningful and statistically significant proteinuria reduction of 38.3% versus placebo for patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Novartis presents positive interim results for Fabhalta in treating IgA nephropathy, showing a 38.3% proteinuria reduction compared to placebo, with a favorable safety profile. Positive Fabhalta (iptacopan) demonstrated a 38.3% reduction in proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy compared to placebo. The Phase III APPLAUSE-IgAN study is the first to show significant proteinuria reduction by targeting the complement system in IgAN patients. Up to 30% of IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria may progress to kidney failure within 10 years, highlighting the need for effective therapies. Fabhalta's potential to slow IgAN progression is being evaluated, with a primary endpoint expected in 2025. Novartis continues to advance its renal portfolio to address the unmet needs of patients with kidney diseases. Further data from the renal portfolio, including real-world studies, will be presented at future medical meetings. Negative None. Nephrologist The data presented on Novartis' Fabhalta (iptacopan) from the APPLAUSE-IgAN study highlight a substantive development in the management of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). As a nephrologist, the 38.3% reduction in proteinuria observed over 9 months, which is statistically significant, marks a promising advancement in this clinical area. Proteinuria is a pivotal biomarker for renal health, with reductions often correlating to delayed progression of kidney disease, potentially staving off dialysis or transplantation. This outcome is particularly impactful for patients who experience a significant quality-of-life decline as the disease progresses. The focus on the alternative complement pathway as a therapeutic target underlines a novel approach contrasting with traditional immunosuppression, which can carry substantial side effects.The safety profile, noted as favorable, is critical; as tolerance determines the long-term viability of any chronic therapy. The potential for accelerated FDA approval based on these interim findings provides hope for patients needing more specific and effective treatments. However, the true test will be the primary endpoint of eGFR slope over 24 months, which directly measures kidney function decline. Until then, while the reduction in proteinuria is encouraging, its actual impact on long-term outcomes such as end-stage renal disease remains to be fully quantified. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement regarding Fabhalta's clinical progress represents important information for stakeholders in Novartis' business trajectory. Within the pharmaceutical industry, successful phase III trial outcomes can significantly alter a company's market position, especially in a niche area like rare kidney diseases. The specific targeting of the alternative complement pathway may allow Novartis to carve out a definitive presence within the nephrology market. Moreover, the potential for accelerated approval and priority review by the FDA often leads to heightened investor interest, as these mechanisms can drastically shorten the time to market, offering a competitive edge and the potential for earlier revenue streams.Conversely, investors should be cognizant of the inherent risks involved with drug development, such as the possibility of adverse findings in the ongoing study or regulatory hurdles. It is also worth monitoring how Novartis plans to position Fabhalta within its broader renal portfolio, which might indicate their strategy for capitalizing on synergies between treatments. Given the progressive nature of IgAN and the lack of targeted therapies, a successful new drug launch could meet the unmet needs of patients and may command premium pricing in the market, further impacting the company's financial outlook. Healthcare Economist A closer examination from a health economics perspective reveals that advancements like Novartis' Fabhalta potentially offer considerable economic implications beyond the direct health benefits to patients. Chronic kidney disease and its progression to end-stage renal disease impose a significant economic burden on healthcare systems due to costly treatments like dialysis and kidney transplantations. Effective management of IgAN with a therapy that slows disease progression could yield substantial cost savings over time.Furthermore, reducing the incidence of kidney failure correlates with decreased healthcare spending and improved patient outcomes, including quality of life and productivity. However, it is essential to consider the cost-effectiveness of new treatments such as Fabhalta. While the drug may lessen the frequency of costly interventions, the pricing strategy adopted by Novartis will determine its accessibility and overall impact on healthcare expenditures. Rigorous economic analyses will be vital in assessing the value proposition of Fabhalta once more data on its efficacy and long-term benefits become available. 04/15/2024 - 02:00 PM APPLAUSE-IgAN is first and only Phase III study to demonstrate significant proteinuria reduction by targeting the complement system in patients with IgAN1IgAN is a heterogeneous, progressive, rare kidney disease and is a major cause of chronic kidney disease worldwide2; complement activation is a key driver of glomerular inflammation in IgAN3,4There is a need for effective, targeted therapies for IgAN2,5; up to 30% of patients with persistent proteinuria (≥1 g/day) may progress to kidney failure within 10 years, requiring maintenance dialysis and/or kidney transplantation6Novartis continues to advance broad renal portfolio in late-stage development, exploring the potential to slow disease progression and extend dialysis-free lifeEAST HANOVER, N.J., April 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Novartis today presented results from a pre-specified interim analysis of the Phase III APPLAUSE-IgAN study of Fabhalta® (iptacopan), an investigational Factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN)1. In the analysis, patients treated with Fabhalta achieved a 38.3% (p<0.0001) proteinuria reduction (as measured by 24-hour urine protein to creatinine ratio [UPCR]) at 9 months when compared to placebo on top of supportive care1. Proteinuria reduction is an increasingly recognized surrogate marker correlating with progression to kidney failure and has been used as an endpoint in IgAN clinical trials to support accelerated approvals7. The study also showed that Fabhalta was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile consistent with previously reported data1,8. Results were presented today during a late-breaking clinical trials session at the World Congress of Nephrology (WCN) in Buenos Aires, Argentina1. ""In IgAN, part of the immune system called the alternative complement pathway can become overly activated in the kidneys, which causes an inflammatory response, leading to progressive kidney damage and gradual loss of kidney function. The loss of kidney function, together with potential side effects of IgAN treatments available until recently, significantly impact patients' lives,"" said Professor Dana Rizk, Investigator and APPLAUSE-IgAN Steering Committee Member and professor in the UAB Division of Nephrology. ""Fabhalta is the first potential treatment for IgAN that specifically targets the alternative complement pathway."" This pre-specified interim analysis included 250 patients for the efficacy analysis and 443 for the safety analysis1. The APPLAUSE-IgAN study continues in a double-blind fashion, and therefore only limited interim analysis results can be presented9,10. Submission for possible accelerated approval to the FDA was accepted and has received priority review. The primary endpoint evaluating Fabhalta's ability to slow IgAN progression by measuring the annualized total estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope over 24 months is expected at study completion in 20259,10. ""IgAN progresses over many years, and patients' needs may evolve such that different therapies may be best used at different times,"" said David Soergel, M.D., Global Head, Cardiovascular, Renal and Metabolism Development Unit, Novartis. ""Our renal pipeline includes medicines with a variety of mechanisms which may allow them to be targeted to patients based on their clinical characteristics."" Other data presented at WCN include IgAN and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) real-world studies. Novartis will be presenting further data from the renal portfolio at future medical meetings. About APPLAUSE-IgANAPPLAUSE-IgAN (NCT04578834) is a Phase III multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice-daily oral Fabhalta (200 mg) in 518 adult primary IgAN patients9,10. The two primary endpoints of the study for the interim and final analysis, respectively, are proteinuria reduction at 9 months as measured by UPCR, and the annualized total eGFR slope over 24 months9,10. At the time of final analysis, the following secondary endpoints will also be assessed: proportion of participants reaching UPCR <1 g/g without receiving corticosteroids/immunosuppressants or other newly approved drugs or initiating new background therapy for treatment of IgAN or initiating kidney replacement therapy (KRT), time from randomization to first occurrence of composite kidney failure endpoint event (reaching either sustained ≥30% decline in eGFR relative to baseline or sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or maintenance dialysis or receipt of kidney transplant or death from kidney failure), change from baseline to 9 months in the fatigue scale measured by the Functional Assessment Of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire9,10. The main study population enrolled patients with an eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UPCR ≥1 g/g at baseline9,10. In addition, a smaller cohort of patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 20–30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline) was also enrolled to provide additional information but will not contribute to the main efficacy analyses9,10. About Fabhalta® (iptacopan)Fabhalta (iptacopan) is an oral, Factor B inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway1. Discovered at Novartis, Fabhalta is currently in development for a range of rare diseases including IgAN, C3G, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and lupus nephritis (LN). Fabhalta was approved by the FDA in December 2023 for the treatment of adults with the rare blood disorder paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and received a positive opinion from the CHMP of the EMA in March 202411,12. About IgA nephropathy (IgAN)IgAN is a heterogeneous, progressive, rare kidney disease2. Each year, approximately 25 people per million worldwide are newly diagnosed with IgAN13. Up to 30% of people who have IgAN with persistent higher levels of proteinuria (≥1 g/day) may progress to kidney failure within 10 years6. There is a need for effective, targeted therapies for IgAN that can help slow or prevent progression to kidney failure2,5,14. Novartis commitment in renalAt Novartis, our journey in nephrology began more than 40 years ago when the development and introduction of cyclosporine helped reimagine the field of transplantation and immunosuppression. We continue today with the same bold ambition to transform the lives of people living with kidney diseases. Through our renal portfolio, we are exploring potential therapeutic options to address the current unmet needs of people living with rare kidney diseases, including IgAN, C3G, aHUS, IC-MPGN and LN. New and innovative treatment options that target the underlying causes of rare kidney diseases may slow disease progression and help people live longer without the need for infusions, dialysis or transplantation. IgAN is a heterogeneous disease presenting with a variety of clinical manifestations, phenotypes, and variable speeds of progression2. In addition to Fabhalta, Novartis is advancing the development of two other therapies in IgAN with highly differentiated mechanisms of action: atrasentan, an investigational oral endothelin A (ETA) receptor antagonist, and zigakibart, an investigational subcutaneously administered anti-APRIL monoclonal antibody, which are both in Phase III development15,16. Through our IgAN pipeline, we are committed to creating a portfolio of innovative medicines that improve and extend the lives of people living with kidney disease.
