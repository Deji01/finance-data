The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell about 0.4%, extending Friday's sharp decline in the tech heavy index.Now the market is bracing for a last big test before the Federal Reserve's March 20 policy meeting. The Consumer Price Index report on Tuesday is front of mind after Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed wants to be more confident that inflation is cooling before easing up on borrowing costs. Given that, a surprise rise would undermine the optimism for a Fed policy shift that has boosted stocks.Equities faltered after February's jobs report, which showed hiring remains strong even as unemployment beat estimates — a mixed picture that added little certainty to the debate on rate cuts.In the meantime, a roaring rally in bitcoin sent the token to record highs on Monday after breaking above $72,000 for the first time. The leading cryptocurrency was last changing hands at $72,500, bringing gains for the year so far to roughly 65%.Crypto-linked stocks rose on the rally's tide.

Bitcoin is up roughly 65% since the start of the year when it was trading around $44,200.Last week the token bolted past its November 2021 levels to reach $69,000.The recent move higher is far from the peak expected by some who track the world’s largest cryptocurrency.Lender Standard Chartered anticipates bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of the year. Research firm Fundstrat has a target range of $116,000 to $137,000. Hedge fund Skybridge predicts $170,000 by April 2025.""People think we're nuts and that's fine, but I don't think we're nuts and that's why we have such a big position,"" Anthony Scaramucci, founder and CEO of Skybridge Capital, told Yahoo Finance Live.Some on Wall Street say it is quite difficult to estimate the future price of bitcoin because it has no intrinsic value, and most big firms with large research arms are currently staying away from setting targets. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has likened it to a ""pet rock.""""Bitcoin is like art,"" said a Wall Street research analyst who requested anonymity.

""While we still expect growth to slow, we think the economy might perform better in the middle part of the year than we had previously forecasted.""Feroli's call for increased economic growth in the middle quarters of this year, matches the broad shifts seen in consensus forecasts. In January, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha highlighted in Yahoo Finance's Chartbook that consensus had consistently underestimated economic growth over the past year. That's continued to play out this year, with quarter over quarter projections for economic growth in the first six months of this year increasing significantly since January.Deutsche Bank senior US economist Brett Ryan, whose team removed their call for a recession in 2024 on Feb. 20, said the shifting narrative in the US economy has largely been driven by a stronger than expected labor market preventing a downturn in consumer spending.""The labor market is not usually a leading indicator, but it is a sustaining indicator,"" Ryan told Yahoo Finance.

The 5-month return for the S&P 500 semi-index was 84%, the highest since 1999. A consolidation in the AI trade has been overdue for a while now, so Friday's key reversal day could signal the start of that unwind.” -BTIG“In 2000 years I'm not sure if $250 billion has ever been wiped off a stock in 3 hours before. That's what happened to Nvidia on Friday as the stock went from being around +5% up to -6.5% down intraday before closing -5.55%. Then in after-hours trading on Friday, it was down almost another -3%. Remarkably it was still up +6.38% on the week, +21.3% in March so far, and has still posted a tenth week of consecutive gains. That said, the sell-off late in the week meant the S&P 500 (-0.65% Friday) was down -0.26% for the week, and just missed out on advancing for 17 of 19 weeks for the first time since 1964.” -Deutsche BankMon, March 11, 2024 at 4:30 AM PDTBrian SozziLatest Reddit IPO detailsThe Reddit IPO roadshow kicks off today, a source familiar with the matter tells me.A debut on the New York Exchange is slated to come within the next two weeks.A couple of highlights from the company's amended S-1 filing that just hit the wires:IPO is expected to raise about $450.9 million in proceeds.Valuation range for Reddit targeted at $5.8 billion to $6.4 billion, or $31 to $34 a share.About 1.76 million shares are being set aside for Reddit users."

After closing at record highs 16 times this year, the S&P 500 is showing signs of overheating, spurring warnings for a near-term consolidation.“It would be natural to expect some fly in the ointment, some monkey in the wrench, to bring investor expectations back to Earth,” said Jason De Sena Trennert at Strategas. “Stock prices, credit spreads, and the price of gold and Bitcoin suggest that monetary conditions are far from restrictive.”The S&P 500 hovered near 5,100. Boeing Co. extended its 2024 slump to more than 25% on US criminal probe. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. slid 4%. Tesla Inc. rebounded. Treasuries fell, with traders bracing for another flurry of high-grade corporate debt sales. Bitcoin hit $72,000.US consumer expectations for inflation over the next three years climbed in February — and increased even more sharply for the five-year horizon, according to a Fed Bank of New York survey. Those figures came ahead of data expected to show inflation probably abated only gradually last month — illustrating why US officials are in no rush to cut rates.Signs of a resilient US economy and improving earnings outlooks sent the S&P 500 up in 16 of the past 19 weeks. Some of those gains could be undone if Tuesday’s consumer price index reading continues to show inflation remaining stubbornly sticky.Story continuesWhile the S&P 500 has fallen on just four CPI reporting days in the past 12 months, volatility is picking up in those sessions this year. Over the past six months, the equity gauge has moved about 0.8% in either direction on the day CPI has been released, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the most since April and up from less than 0.5% in September.“Expect more volatility around those releases as investors continue to determine the direction of interest rates,” said Paul Nolte at Murphy & Sylvest Wealth Management.That wariness is also exacerbated by the fact that a number of sentiment indicators are currently pointing to a market that may be overstretched at this stage.Among those, Sam Stovall at CFRA cites the American Association of Individual Investors’ surveying showing an “unusually high” level of bullishness and the CNN Fear/Greed Indicator that recently registered “extreme greed.” He also mentioned the percentage of S&P 1500 sub-industries above 50- and 200-day averages that climbed to a threshold that typically hints at an overbought market.“Even though the S&P 500 is due for, and would benefit from, a digestion of recent gains, history suggests not waiting too long before adding to holdings,” Stovall added.To Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise, investors are likely already incorporating a lot of good news into stock prices and moving ahead of incoming data that supports the soft-landing narrative.“Stocks are likely overdue for some consolidation or even an extended period of modest declines at some point in the year,” he noted. Without a meaningful shift in the fundamental picture, we suspect investors would welcome such a downdraft and treat the event as a buying opportunity.”The rally in US equities that began last year doesn’t reflect conditions seen in prior boom-and-bust cycles, such as big gaps between share prices and their values, or the significant use of leverage, according to Bank of America Corp.’s strategists led by Savita Subramanian.“Sentiment has warmed up on equities since mid-2023, driving our slightly lower level of conviction in an up market, but is nowhere near bullish levels of prior market peaks,” they wrote. “In our view, this bull market has legs.”Another aspect is that robust profits from some of the tech behemoths have also brought down sky-high valuations. They remain relatively stretched — but they’re still well below prior peaks.The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, for example, trade near their average price-to-earnings ratio since 2015, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The group comprises Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc.The ranks of Wall Street strategists playing down concerns around a bubble in US technology megacap stocks only keeps growing.The team at JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the latest to flag that valuations of the seven tech giants that have led the record-breaking rally on Wall Street are currently lower relative to the rest of the S&P 500 than the average of the past five years.“There is a concern over the very strong outperformance of the Magnificent 7, but we note that the group is currently trading less stretched than a few years ago, given earnings delivery,” strategist Mislav Matejka wrote in a note.For investors questioning how much further the S&P 500 can be powered by that narrow group of shares, breadth in the US stock market has actually been improving. While tech remains in the leadership position, an equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 — where the likes of Nvidia Corp. carry the same heft as Dollar Tree Inc. — has recently hit a record.“Market action last week pointed to a broadening of investor appetite for stocks,” said John Stoltzfus at Oppenheimer Asset Management. “This brought a mix of some profit-taking among sectors that have performed exceptionally well since the start of the year in addition to a rotation and rebalancing into sectors, market capitalizations, and styles that have lagged in performance.”To Trennert at Strategas, given the high market’s valuations and relatively low 10-year Treasury yields, it is difficult to know how much incremental stock performance can be achieved from current levels.“We continue to be ‘bullish until the bill comes due’ — which we define as higher long-term Treasury yields.”A bond selloff in February, which pushed Treasury yields to their highs of the year, was due in part to January’s hot consumer price data, which showed surprising strength in core services, an area of concern for the US central bank. Since then, traders have once again stepped up their rate cut bets as economic data reinforced the view the Fed may be able to start lowering interest rates later this year.The positive outlook for bonds reached a record high in Bloomberg’s weekly client survey.Yields on 10-year Treasuries will be lower in a month, according to 60% of 238 respondents in the latest MLIV Pulse poll. That’s the strongest vote on bonds since the survey first started asking the question in August 2022. The survey was conducted March 4-8 but closed before the nonfarm payroll data on Friday.Corporate Highlights:Boeing Co. sank after the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the midair blowout of a fuselage panel on a 737 Max 9 in January.Delta Air Lines Inc. expects deliveries of its Boeing Co. 737 Max 10 aircraft could be pushed out to as late as 2027 as the troubled planemaker undergoes federal safety and criminal reviews.MicroStrategy Inc. bought another 12,000 Bitcoin for $821.7 million, the second-largest purchase by the enterprise-software maker since it began acquiring the cryptocurrency almost four years ago.Reddit Inc. disclosed further details of what is set to be one of the year’s biggest initial public offerings, with the company and some existing shareholders seeking to raise as much as $748 million.US natural gas producer EQT Corp. agreed to buy back former unit Equitrans Midstream Corp. for about $5.5 billion in stock, the latest in a flurry of deals in the oil and gas pipeline industry.Key events this week:Japan PPI, TuesdayUK Financial Policy Committee quarterly meeting, attended by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, TuesdayEU finance ministers meet in Brussels, TuesdayECB Governing Council Member Robert Holzmann, TuesdayUS CPI, TuesdayEurozone industrial production, WednesdayECB Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras speaks, WednesdayVolkswagen, Adidas earnings, WednesdayUS PPI, retail sales, initial jobless claims, business inventories, ThursdayChina property prices, FridayJapan’s largest union federation announces results of annual wage negotiations, just ahead of Bank of Japan policy meeting, FridayBank of England issues inflation survey, FridayUS industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire Manufacturing, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 2:49 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.2%The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.3%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro fell 0.2% to $1.0922The British pound fell 0.4% to $1.2806The Japanese yen was little changed at 147.03 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 4.3% to $72,444.48Ether rose 3.8% to $4,054.55BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced three basis points to 4.11%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 2.30%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 3.97%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changedSpot gold was little changedThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Jessica Menton, Matt Turner, Alexandra Semenova and Kasia Klimasinska.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great Firewall©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
