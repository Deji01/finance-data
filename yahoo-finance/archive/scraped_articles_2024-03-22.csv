Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Devon Energy Stock Is Going to $65. Is It a Buy Around $48?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-200856799.html,Take this analyst's new price target with a tablespoon of salt.,"It may not climb as high as previously thought, but there's still ample room for Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) stock to run, according to Stifel analyst Derrick Whitfield. Whitfield now thinks that shares of the exploration and production company could rise to $65 (down from $75) over the next 12 months or so. That lowered price target represents a 34% upside from Friday's closing price.Despite Whitfield's reduced estimate, energy investors may still want to power their portfolios with this leading upstream energy stock.2024's forecast is underwhelming, but the stock is still a buyAccording to Thefly.com, Whitfield's downgrade is a reaction to Devon Energy's fourth quarter 2023 financial results and the company's 2024 outlook. In Q4 2023, Devon Energy reported revenue of $4.15 billion, representing a 3.6% year-over-year decline. Devon Energy projects daily production of 640,000 to 660,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE). At the midpoint of guidance (daily production of 650,000 BOE), there would be a decline from the daily production of 658,000 BOE reported in 2023.While Devon may face a dip in production, there are valid reasons why the company is worthy of investors' buy lists. For one, Devon is generous with its dividend, which currently provides a forward yield of 5% and is a product of the company's innovative fixed-plus-variable dividend framework. Skeptics may question the high-yield payout, but the dividend is clearly sustained by the company's ample free cash flow generation.DVN Dividend Per Share (Annual) ChartAdditionally, the company is operating from a position of financial strength. As of the end of 2023, Devon had an investment grade balance sheet as rated by Moody's and S&P Global Ratings. Add to this the fact that the company's hanging on the discount rack -- shares are valued at 7.8 times forward earnings -- and it's clear that Devon is a compelling way for investors to power their passive income streams regardless of the lower price target.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

Tesla Inc. led losses in megacaps, while Nike Inc. and Lululemon Athletica Inc. fell on weak outlooks. FedEx Corp. — an economic barometer — surged on solid earnings and a $5 billion buyback plan.In the absence of economic data, traders kept an eye on Fedspeak. Jerome Powell’s remarks during a “Fed Listens” event didn’t include monetary policy. Michael Barr, who oversees bank supervision for the Fed, said he’s not seeing liquidity pressures in the financial sector while noting he expects broad and material changes to capital rule.“Bottom line, focus will return to the Fed today, and anything officials say that challenges the idea of three rate cuts in 2024, amid a stronger economy will likely spur some profit taking after this week’s robust post-Fed decision rally,” said Tom Essaye, founder of the Sevens Report.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,235, with volume 20% below the past-month average. Treasury 10-year yields fell five basis points to 4.22%. Bitcoin has peeled back more than 10% from its all-time high. China’s tentative loosening of its vise-like grip on the yuan unleashed a slide in the currency and pulled down its Asian peers along the way.While a relative sense of calm prevailed at the end of the week, American stocks saw hefty outflows in the run-up the highly anticipated Fed policy meeting.US equity funds suffered redemptions of about $22 billion in the week through Wednesday — the biggest since December 2022, according to a note from Bank of America Corp., citing EPFR Global data. The trend was also a sharp turnaround from the previous week, when stocks had attracted record inflows.Story continuesFollowing the Fed decision, stocks were swept up in rally driven by the perception that the central bank wasn’t as hawkish as feared. Policymakers kept their forecast for three rate cuts this year, and Chair Powell didn’t seem overly concerned about the recent uptick in inflation.Yet examining Fed rate cycles since the 1970s has revealed that, in general, investors have more to fear from the first rate cut in a cycle than a pause, according to Ryan Grabinski at Strategas Securities.On average, the S&P 500 is up more than 5% over 100 days between the last Fed tightening and the first rate cut, he noted. However, the trough in the broader market exceeds a 23% drop over 200 days after the first rate cut in a series.Despite still elevated rates, the recent round of housing, manufacturing and labor-market data pointed to a resilient economy.“Six months ago, investors were largely pessimistic, with ‘good news being treated as bad news’ and ‘bad news treated as bad news’,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide. “The pendulum has shifted almost completely, with strong data being viewed as a sign of a ‘soft landing’ — while sluggish data reinforces the belief that the Federal Reserve will cut rates.”This has driven impressive momentum in the market, Hackett noted. The technicals underlying the recent stock rally were impressive — with more than three-quarters of the S&P 500 above the 200-day moving average — the best level since 2021, he noted.“We retain a neutral allocation to US equities in our tactical asset allocation,” said David Lefkowitz at UBS Global Wealth Management. “With some sentiment and positioning indicators looking elevated, we would not be surprised to see a modest pullback in the coming months. That could offer investors a better opportunity to add to equity positions.”One of few Wall Street forecasters who correctly predicted last year’s stock market rally finds himself in a contrarian position once again. But this time, Brian Belski thinks equities are set up for a plunge — just as many of his peers are turning bullish.A correction is imminent after stocks have run up too far, too fast on false optimism over how soon the Fed will dial back interest rates, the BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist and long-time bull said in an interview.Bill Gross, the one-time bond king, warned that investors are in for a bumpy ride as “excessive exuberance” sweeps financial markets.“It tells me that fiscal deficit spending and AI enthusiasm have been overriding factors, and momentum and ‘irrational’ exuberance have dominated markets since 2022,” Gross, the co-founder and former chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., wrote in his latest investment outlook. “Buckle up for excessive exuberance.”Meantime, HSBC strategists were the latest on Wall Street to say that equities aren’t in a bubble despite the sharp rally since last year. The team led by Max Kettner raises its view on US stocks to “tactically overweight” from “neutral.”“Re-accelerating inflation is a risk, but the key here is when central banks and markets will really start to care,” they said. “We’re still quite some way away from that.”Equity valuations outside the US are relatively more attractive following a recent rally in technology megacaps, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategist Peter Oppenheimer.“We think technology is still going to be crucially important and do well, but as interest rates come down and we get this soft landing, the opportunity for broadening out into some more cyclical parts of the market is improving,” Oppenheimer told Bloomberg Television.“US equities remain in an uptrend but still vulnerable to potential consolidation/correction ahead in our opinion,” according to Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “Momentum is pushing several areas (not just megacap leadership) into overbought/extended territory on a short-term basis — which is what continues to concern us from a technical perspective.”Still, overall market breadth continues to expand, he added, citing the fact that the cumulative advance-decline line for New York Stock Exchange shares is now close to breaking to new all-time highs.“This is an important metric to watch as it indicates the markets are no longer being carried by just a few names (like the Mag 7, for example), but are starting to fire on all cylinders across multiple market caps and sectors, Wantrobski said.Corporate Highlights:Tesla Inc. has reduced production at its plant in China, according to people familiar with the matter, amid sluggish growth in electric-vehicle sales and intense competition in the world’s biggest auto market.Nike Inc. warned that sales will take a hit as it responds to a growing challenge from upstart running-shoe brands like On and Hoka that have exposed the US sporting-goods company’s reliance on classic basketball models such as the Air Force 1.FedEx Corp. topped Wall Street’s third-quarter profit expectations and announced a new $5 billion share buyback plan as the courier said it’s seeing results from a plan to cut costs and boost margins.Lululemon Athletica Inc. said it has seen a shift in the shopping behavior of its high-end US consumer, which drove a lower-than-expected sales outlook for the first quarter and full year.Grifols SA sank as investors evaluated a regulatory review of the Spanish bio-science company’s financial reports, which found “relevant deficiencies” but no major accounting mistakes.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 12:56 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 was little changedThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5%The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.2%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.4%The euro fell 0.5% to $1.0806The British pound fell 0.5% to $1.2596The Japanese yen rose 0.2% to 151.39 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 3.4% to $63,215.26Ether fell 4.9% to $3,313.04BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined five basis points to 4.22%Germany’s 10-year yield declined eight basis points to 2.32%Britain’s 10-year yield declined seven basis points to 3.93%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.7% to $80.54 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.9% to $2,162.49 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Sagarika Jaisinghani, Ye Xie and Alexandra Semenova.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Don Lemon ImplosionWeight-Loss-Drug Users Pay Up for Help Ditching the Pricey MedsMagnificent Seven?

TheStreet,Analyst unveils Google stock price target after Apple rumors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-unveils-google-stock-price-190423251.html,Here's what could happen to Google-parent Alphabet's shares next.,"While Google is a search engine Goliath, the performance of the stock of its parent, Alphabet, has trailed that of its large-cap technology peers because of concern that artificial intelligence will reshape the search market.There's little debate that AI apps are changing how people consume and digest information — but there's also little to suggest that Alphabet's search dominance is over.Alphabet's market share remains intact despite the widespread availability of large language models for searching and creating content, including OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Bing.Nevertheless, the risk that AI could cut into Google's lead has led to analysts to revisit their opinions and update their stock-price targets.Google parent Alphabet's CEO, Sundar Pichai, is navigating big changes in the search market.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesGoogle rides AI tailwindsChatGPT became the fastest app to reach one million users after its launch in December 2022. Since then, everyone has been considering how AI could transform how businesses and people engage with information.Individuals are using generative AI apps to find and create more relevant insight, banks are using it to hedge risks, retailers are evaluating whether it can stop theft, and the military is studying how it may affect the battlefield.Related: Apple's AI plans reportedly could involve a partner like GoogleThe potential for AI to unlock better outcomes by intelligently crafting responses from previously siloed datasets has sparked a tidal wave of investment into training and running increasingly more robust AI solutions.Those solutions will likely affect the search market but might not derail Google's dominance.For example, despite ChatGPT and Microsoft's AI solutions, including Bing and Copilot, being readily available, Google appears to have insulated itself from these challengers via its solution, Gemini (formerly Bard).According to Similarweb, over the past six months, the market shares of ChatGPT and Microsoft search and AI chatbot have inched up 0.32% to 0.14% to 1.84% and 1.44%, respectively.Story continuesMeanwhile, Google’s market share outside China has remained at nearly 92%.The ability to maintain share may stem largely from Google working quickly to launch Gemini and deploy AI tools for Google Cloud customers. These include many of the world's largest companies, which use Alphabet's servers and software to store and analyze data.Alphabet's (GOOG) year-over-year revenue growth over the past four quarters is 3%, 7%, 11%, and 13% and its earnings-per-share growth has changed by -11%, 17%, 42%, and 42%.The improving top-and-bottom-line growth rates suggest that Alphabet's business remains on solid ground, with ongoing advertising interest across its platform, including traditional search and YouTube, and increasing investments by Google Cloud customers to train and run their AI initiatives.Last quarter, Alphabet's $86.3 billion of revenue outpaced Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion, while its $1.64 a share of earnings beat forecasts by 4 cents.Importantly, revenue at Google's Search & Other business segment increased 12.7% year-over-year to $48 billion and YouTube ads jumped 15.6% to $9.2 billion.Analyst says Google search fears are 'overblown'Of course, anything can happen, but Wedbush Securities analysts say that worry about a structural shift in search away from Google is misplaced.More AI Stocks:Analysts revamp C3.ai stock price targets after earningsAnalyst updates stock price target for Super Micro ComputerAnalysts unveil new Nvidia price targets ahead of 'AI Woodstock' conference ""We acknowledge the near-term uncertainty associated with a broader [Search Generative Experience] rollout but have increasing conviction that over the longer term SGE will provide ample monetization opportunity on par with, or potentially above, traditional Google search,"" Wedbush analysts Scott Devitt, Dan Ives, Michael Gerbino and Matthew Weiss recently wrote to institutional investors.The analysts conducted searches on PCs and mobile devices across Alphabet's AI and non-AI tools. They found that AI results with ads generally boasted a similar number of ads to non-AI search results.Currently, those ads are largely above or below the AI-generated results, but over time, Wedbush suspects that Google will increasingly allow ads to be embedded within results, improving their value to advertisers, and opening the door to more revenue opportunities.There's also a big possibility that Alphabet can produce meaningful revenue by licensing its AI to other companies, such as Apple.In March, reports surfaced that Apple was considering a deal to have Google's AI power the AI solutions within future Apple device upgrades. Given the more than two billion active iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple consumer electronics globally, an agreement could be worth big money.""We think Google remains a clear generative AI beneficiary,"" wrote Wedbush. ""Google’s core advertising business is well positioned with growth set to accelerate this year against a strong digital advertising backdrop. Google remains a dominant digital advertising business with healthy underlying growth and significant optionality related to AI across both its advertising and cloud segment.""The opportunity to overdeliver on AI versus expectations could mean that Google's stock heads higher, especially if investors start valuing the company as they have in the past. Over the past five years, Alphabet's shares have boasted an average price-to-earnings multiple of 22. Currently, it's about 19.If earnings rise thanks to cost-cutting, including layoffs during the bear market and increasing sales, investors could be rewarded with gains. As a result, Wedbush upped its stock price target to $175 from $160, adding Alphabet to its ""best ideas list."""
Motley Fool,Why Shares of Bit Digital Stock Were Rising This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-shares-bit-digital-stock-185451931.html,The company loves to talk narratives. But is it creating shareholder value?,"Shares of Bit Digital (NASDAQ: BTBT) rose more than 10% this week after reporting its full-year 2023 earnings, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The cryptocurrency miner and now artificial intelligence (AI) company posted earnings for the fourth quarter. However, the business is still burning tons of cash and heavily diluting shareholders.Here's why shares of Bit Digital are rising, and what it means for investors.More cryptocurrency mining, and now AIBit Digital is a cryptocurrency miner. This means it takes computers and electricity to earn digital currencies like Bitcoin that can sit on its balance sheet. The input costs depend on how expensive electricity is, but the output is determined by the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin has begun to soar in recent months, nearing all-time highs.According to the company's balance sheet, Bit Digital now has over $40 million in digital currencies, up from $27.6 million last year. This is not a monumental sum of cryptocurrencies, but the company is betting on the narrative out there that prices will keep rising. It has minimal debt and raises money by selling stock and diluting shareholders.Now, the company is hopping on a new investment trend and investing in artificial intelligence. It launched Bit Digital AI in October 2023 to sell generative AI tools to other companies. It hopes to generate $100 million in annualized AI revenue by year-end. Investors should hold the company's feet to the fire and track this progress in the coming years as this is a large pivot for the business.The future won't look much differentBit Digital tells a good story. It is hopping on two of the most popular narratives in markets: cryptocurrency mining and AI. But if you look at its underlying financial statements, the story is ugly. Bit Digital is free-cash-flow-negative and has been for a while now. It is also highly dilutive to shareholders, with shares outstanding going up by 10x in the last few years. This is terrible for existing shareholders.Story continuesEven though the stock is rising this week, Bit Digital is down 92% from all-time highs. With no prospects for turning around its cash burn, the company will likely continue to dilute shareholders and destroy per-share value. Expect the stock to continue falling over the long term.Should you invest $1,000 in Bit Digital right now?Before you buy stock in Bit Digital, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bit Digital wasn’t one of them.

This is the first time Bitcoin NFTs fell below US$10 million this week.Solana sales fell 7.62%.These figures reflect a market that, while experiencing a general downturn, still sees fluctuations in activity across different blockchains.BNB Chain had one of the strongest performances on Friday with a 12% sales increase to US$1.22 million. Its “lucky start” collection accounted for US$668,236 of those sales."
