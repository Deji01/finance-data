Benzinga,US Housing Market Soars $2.4 Trillion In Value Over Past Year,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-housing-market-soars-2-200213213.html,"Over the past year, the U.S. housing market has increased $2.4 trillion, elevating its value to $47.5 trillion, according to a Redfin analysis of more than 90 million U.S. residential properties through December. That's a 5.3% increase in value from a year ago — the biggest increase in 11 months — and up 13.3% or $5.6 trillion from 2021. But with high mortgage rates and rising home values, many homeowners are reluctant to put their houses on the market, resulting in a shortage of homes for sale.",
Motley Fool,Why Rivian Stock Was Moving Higher Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-rivian-stock-moving-higher-193141502.html,A positive analyst note and a vehicle launch gave the EV company's shares a boost.,"Shares of Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) were moving higher Thursday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker got an analyst upgrade from Jefferies Wednesday night and unveiled its new R2 electric SUV at a launch event Thursday afternoon and then, in a surprise, revealed two additional compact SUV models -- the slightly smaller R3 and a ""performance"" variant dubbed the R3X.As of 1:29 p.m. ET, Rivian stock was up 8.1% on the news.Image source: Rivian.Rivian shows signs of lifeShares of the EV start-up hit an all-time low after its fourth-quarter earnings report last month, but now investors are eager to turn the page. A bullish analyst note and a new product launch are good catalysts to shift the mood.Jefferies called the stock a buy Wednesday night, saying the EV stock ""has looked closest to Tesla in 'spirit,'"" and noted Rivian's proprietary software stack, strong brand identity, and potential to grow globally. Jefferies gave the stock a price target of $16, implying an upside of 45% from its closing price Wednesday.However, the stock's gains Thursday seem to be more in response to the launch event, where the company pulled the curtain back on the R2, a two-row compact SUV with a battery range of around 300 miles. Rivian said it would be priced starting at $45,000, and that production is scheduled to begin in 2026. Reservations are now open. It also surprised investors by unveiling the R3 and R3X compact SUVs.Can Rivian turn it around?Rivian could desperately use some investor buy-in after its disappointing fourth-quarter results, guidance for flat production in 2024, and news that it's cutting 10% of its workforce.However, a positive analyst note and the unveiling of a vehicle that won't be commercially available for two years are unlikely to change the trajectory of the stock in the near term. Like much of the rest of the EV industry, Rivian is struggling amid plateauing customer demand and higher interest rates. The macro conditions help explain why the company doesn't plan to grow its production this year.Story continuesIt's also rapidly burning cash, though the company said it would deliver a modest gross profit by the fourth quarter, and that will be an important test for the company. With its revenue growth likely to decline this year, Rivian will need to prove it has a viable path to profitability in order to breathe new life into the stock. Considering the industrywide headwinds, that won't be easy even if its new vehicles are well received.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.Treasury two-year yields slipped as Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve is “not far” from confidence to ease policy. He noted that rate reductions “can and will begin” this year while adding policymakers are well aware of the risks of cutting too late. The Fed chief also remarked he could see the case for shortening maturity of central-bank holdings.Across the Atlantic, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde indicated officials may be in a position to ease policy in June. Just like the Fed, the ECB is contemplating when to sound the all-clear on inflation and begin undoing the unprecedented monetary tightening deployed to subdue it.“Risk assets continued to surge after major central bank officials provided the strongest hints yet that monetary policy will be loosened soon,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com.The S&P 500 rose to 5,150 while the Nasdaq 100 added 1.5%. Nvidia Corp. and Microsoft Corp. led gains in tech ahead of Broadcom Inc.’s results. Europe’s Stoxx 600 index also hit a record. The dollar fell against all of its developed-market counterparts. Speculation the Bank of Japan will hike for the first time since 2007 lifted the yen.While Lagarde said officials aren’t “sufficiently confident” at present to commence monetary easing, there’s a definite slowdown in consumer prices. “We will know a little more in April, but we will know a lot more in June,” she noted.Story continuesThe ECB’s latest quarterly outlook offered reassurance, putting inflation at 2.3% this year — from 2.7% in December — and revising the 2025 forecast down to 2%.While data between now and June could move the dial, the only “real take-away” from the ECB decision and press conference was to reinforce an intended first June cut, according to TD Securities’ strategists.“The ECB appears to be on track towards initiating an easing cycle perhaps in June,” said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial. “Given the continuing weakness in Germany, the ECB will want to move as soon as is prudent — but will also be led by confidence that inflation has been quelled and moving closer to its 2% target.”Just 24 hours before the all-important US payrolls report, data showed jobless claims held at historically low levels last week — the latest evidence of a resilient labor market.The government’s monthly employment report due Friday is forecast to show a pullback in hiring and wage growth in February after both advanced significantly in the previous month. Economists expect US employers to have added 200,000 jobs last month.“Barring any major surprises on the job creation or unemployment fronts, we’re of the mind investors’ primary focus will be on “average hourly earnings’,” said Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “After all, inflation outweighs job creation amid the current balance of risks.”Corporate Highlights:General Electric Co.’s aerospace division set plans to return more of its profits to shareholders, including restoration of a significant dividend as it accelerates earnings as an independent company.Micron Technology Inc. was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel, with the broker saying that average analyst estimates for 2025 are “wrong and too low” for the chipmaker.Kroger Co. shares rose after the grocer’s full-year adjusted profit guidance beat analyst expectations, making it the latest retailer to offer an upbeat outlook as customers show resilience.Hess Corp. signaled its $53 billion agreement to be bought by Chevron Corp. may be delayed after Exxon Mobil Corp. filed for arbitration over the deal to preserve its rights to a massive oil discovery off Guyana.Xcel Energy Inc. acknowledged that its equipment was likely involved in igniting the worst wildfire in Texas history. But the utility company also refuted allegations it had acted negligently.Cigna Group has struck deals with obesity drug makers Eli Lilly & Co. and Novo Nordisk A/S that aim to widen coverage by limiting how much employer-sponsored health plans have to pay for the medicines.Novo Nordisk A/S touted the potential of its next-generation obesity treatments, releasing promising data on an experimental daily pill and sending the shares soaring to a record.Media conglomerate Vivendi SE is preparing to consult with investors and employees on its plan to split into four listed units as it seeks better value from its assets, which span from pay-TV to ads, music and publishing.Mondi Plc agreed to buy DS Smith Plc for £5.1 billion ($6.5 billion) in a deal that would create one of the world’s largest makers of packaging.Key Events This Week:Eurozone GDP, FridayUS nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, FridayNew York Fed President John Williams speaks, FridayECB Governing Council member Robert Holzmann speaks, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.9% as of 1:05 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.5%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%The MSCI World index rose 0.9%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.4%The euro rose 0.4% to $1.0939The British pound rose 0.5% to $1.2797The Japanese yen rose 0.9% to 148.08 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 1.7% to $67,620.23Ether rose 0.3% to $3,858.94BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced one basis point to 4.11%Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 2.31%Britain’s 10-year yield was little changed at 4.00%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.3% to $79.38 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.5% to $2,159.08 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
TipRanks,"V, MA, NU: Which “Strong Buy” Fintech Stock Is Best?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-ma-nu-strong-buy-191230126.html,"Fintech and other technological trends have taken a backseat to generative artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year or so.

With various cryptocurrencies heating up again, though, financial technologies’ long-term potential (like those on the blockchain) will be harder to ignore. Add a sprinkle of generative AI into the equation, and the leading financial technology firms — think V, MA, and NU — may be next to join the bullish ascent as growth-hungry investors look for lower-cost firms that can profit from AI.Therefore, let’s check TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to gain a better gauge of the following Strong-Buy-rated fintech firms and the road ahead for an industry that stands to benefit greatly from AI’s next chapter.Visa (NYSE:V)Visa stock broke out in a big way in the fourth and final quarter of last year. So far, in 2024, the credit card king is showing no signs of slowing down, with 8% returns posted year-to-date. Though some may view Visa as an old-fashioned credit card firm, I’m more inclined to view it as a digital payments innovator.Sure, Visa may not be as cutting-edge as some of its smaller peers, given its massive size and impressive credit card leadership position, which has naturally forced the firm to play defense. Regardless, Visa stock seems to be in a sweet spot for the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) investors out there. For that reason, I remain bullish as Visa continues to embrace payment tech with open arms.Indeed, as we’re propelled further into the AI age, Visa and other payment firms need to be vigilant, as it’s not only good-meaning entities that stand to benefit from generative AI. Cyber threats and various fraudsters can also harness the power of AI. As such, all big firms need to take a more proactive approach to protecting users from fraud.Visa has been leveraging AI to detect fraud and manage risks for many decades before AI was a buzzword on Wall Street. As predictive AI becomes more capable, count on Visa to stay on the cutting edge as it seeks to stay many steps ahead of fraudulent actors.Story continuesApart from fighting fraud with AI, look for Visa to keep putting cash toward its Generative AI Ventures fund. Yes, the credit card company has an AI fund, just like the mega-cap tech titans. This goes to show just how much skin in the game the firm has as it looks to defend its dominance in payments and fintech. At 29.1 times forward price-to-earnings, V stock is a fintech firm to continue watching closely.What Is the Price Target of V Stock?Visa stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 22 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average V stock price target of $306.64 implies 9.9% upside potential.Mastercard (NYSE:MA)Speaking of fighting fraud with AI, Mastercard is also a major player on the scene. Arguably, Mastercard has even more to gain from investing heavily in AI as it seeks to chase down the heavyweight champ Visa. Mastercard’s chief technology officer, Ed McLaughlin, recently sat down with Fortune in a chat centered around the company’s involvement with next-generation technologies, like AI.“The way the [AI] systems are working is always making predictions of what’s most likely to happen,” said McLaughlin. “And that’s why these generative [AI] techniques are so exciting, as they’re allowing us to make better predictions.”Undoubtedly, Mastercard seems to be doing its best to stay ahead, perhaps far ahead, of bad actors who seek to use AI for evil. This alone is enough to make anyone bullish. As the company continues to perfect predictive AI, I expect it could prevent a swelling figure of fraud losses. Undoubtedly, AI-driven fraud management is a big deal when it comes to saving money in the never-ending battle against fraud.At this juncture, I don’t think you could go wrong with Visa or Mastercard when it comes to AI-driven payment innovation. As it stands, however, I’m a bigger fan of MA stock, even at the pricier 32.2 times forward price-to-earnings multiple. The number-two credit card behemoth has room to catch up to Visa as it looks to aggressively invest in AI to go on the offensive.What Is the Price Target of MA Stock?Mastercard stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 29 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average MA stock price target of $512.48 implies 9.4% upside potential.Nu Holdings (NASDAQ:NU)Nu Holdings is a relative lightweight compared to Visa and Mastercard, with its mere $53.6 billion market cap. The Brazil-based digital bank has enjoyed exceptional growth as it expanded its financial services (think no-fee credit and debit cards) into emerging nations. I’ll admit, it was the bold investment made by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) a few years ago that put NU stock on my radar.Though shares of NU represent a small portion of the Berkshire portfolio (around 0.3% as of the latest quarter), there’s no denying that Nu Holdings has many traits of a “wonderful” business.And even though shares are scorching hot again, I can’t help but stay bullish on the company’s plans to bring new payment technologies to high-growth Latin American markets. High-growth technology meets high-growth emerging markets? That sounds like a formula for sustainably high growth rates to me.In the latest fourth quarter, NU clocked in $2.4 billion in sales, up just north of 12% year-over-year. That’s not bad, given recent macro headwinds. The bigger headline, though, was that CEO David Velez noted Nu is “investing heavily in new growth avenues” to drive profit.With sights set on “the 100 million customers milestone in 2024,” I find it hard to give up on the fintech darling. At 25.3 times forward price-to-earnings, NU stock seems like an even better bargain than Visa or Mastercard, as it aims to bring banking services to the masses.What Is the Price Target of NU Stock?NU stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with three unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. Nonetheless, the average NU stock price target of $11.33 implies 1.05% downside potential.ConclusionThe fintech scene is full of GARP-like plays these days as they seek to harness AI tech to bolster their moats. Of the trio, analysts see the most year-ahead upside from V stock, and that makes sense. Visa is the biggest and perhaps best value of the batch right now. The company’s tech savviness still seems discounted by many.Disclosure"

Motley Fool,Why Snap Stock Fell 31% Last Month,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-snap-stock-fell-31-180703150.html,"Despite outperforming analyst forecasts, Snap's shares plummeted in February 2024 -- arguably for good reasons. Here's what investors need to know.","Shares of Snap (NYSE: SNAP) plunged 30.7% lower in February 2024, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The sharp move hinged on the Snapchat company's fourth-quarter earnings report, with a single-day price drop of 34.5% the following day. But there's still some mystery to unravel because Snap's results actually exceeded average analysts' expectations. That kind of surprise usually leads to higher stock prices, not lower ones. Snap took the road less traveled.How did a solid earnings surprise inspire a brutal price cut?The fourth-quarter report showed revenues rising 5% year over year to $1.36 billion. On the bottom line, earnings fell from $0.14 per share in the year-ago period to $0.08 per share in the latest report. Wall Street's consensus estimates had called for earnings of roughly $0.06 per share on sales near $1.38 billion, so Snap delivered a solid earnings beat with nearly in-line sales.Not too shabby, right?Well, it was a far cry from the strong results seen in recent earnings reports. Snap tends to outdo those analyst targets by a much wider margin, along with the occasional double-digit percentage surprise on the top line. This mixed performance wasn't anywhere near Snap's usual standard of excellence.Moreover, management's first-quarter guidance suggested a robust 13% growth spurt for revenues, but adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) will slide back into negative territory.Snap's turnaround in ad sales is lagging behind management's plans and Wall Street's expectations, and the headwind only grows stronger when you contrast Snap's slow progress against quicker rebounds for rivaling digital advertising platforms.Does Snap have a future in social media?The digital ad sector is springing back to life after two years of inflation-scented winter. That should be good news for Snap on a fundamental level, but the company competes with a large number of proven winners. Yes, large-scale advertisers are getting richer marketing budgets again, but every dollar will still be invested in the most cost-effective advertising channels. Most of the time, Snap isn't it.Story continuesThe company is revamping its platform to boost user engagement by monetizing clicks at the end of the advertising funnel. Direct purchases resulting from Snapchat's ad clicks rose by 90% year over year, which could be the start of a lucrative future. But it's also a very small part of Snapchat's overall revenue stream, which mainly relies on brand-boosting messages rather than purchase-oriented ads.This report knocked the wind out of Snap's sails after a strong third-quarter update and promising signs of a digital ads recovery over the holidays. The company's privacy-focused social media systems aren't striking a chord with advertisers right now despite robust growth in the user base. The stock has now traded almost exactly sideways in 52 weeks, with just a 1% gain, far behind most sector rivals and the stock market as a whole.Some might call this a buying opportunity, but I'm not so sure. There are too many ways to share quick-hit content across social media services nowadays, and the history-less chat platform never made sense to me in the first place. I don't see a guaranteed long-term winner here, just another former market darling down on its luck -- perhaps for good.Should you invest $1,000 in Snap right now?Before you buy stock in Snap, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snap wasn’t one of them.

Fortune,The housing market’s deep freeze is showing signs of thawing,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-deep-freeze-showing-180433572.html,Low inventory and high housing costs were two major challenges last year—but more supply is entering the market.,"The housing market fell into a deep freeze last year. Home prices rose considerably during the pandemic-fueled housing boom, but then the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to tame inflation, which had reached a four-decade high. As a result, mortgage rates skyrocketed, peaking at just above 8%, after being at historic lows.America embarked on the least affordable housing market in decades. But those with low mortgage rates or simply no mortgage at all were practically fine, so they held onto their homes, further constraining supply in a market that’s already missing homes. And existing home sales fell to their lowest point in nearly 30 years. But things seem to be changing, and the phenomenon referred to as the lock-in effect is easing.“Following eight months of declines, February is the first month the number of homes for sale has increased on an annual basis,” Redfin data journalist Dana Anderson wrote in a Thursday housing market update.New listings of homes for sale leaped 13% from a year earlier during the four weeks ending March 3; it’s the biggest increase in almost three years, according to Redfin. The jump in new listings brought the total number of homes for sale up 1.7%.“There have been two major obstacles for homebuyers over the last year: low inventory and high housing costs,” said Chen Zhao, Redfin’s head of economic research. “Now, the first barrier is starting to come down as more supply comes on the market.”She continued: “Housing costs are still high, but they’re likely to come down a bit as mortgage rates gradually decline through the year and price growth loses some steam. Buyers who can afford today’s mortgage rates may have better luck finding a home now than they have in the past several months, and they also may be less likely to face competition, because inventory is improving.”The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate just fell below 7% and is currently sitting at 6.92%, which is the lowest reading since the beginning of February. It’s a far cry from the around 3% mortgage rates that filled the pandemic, but it’s significantly lower than 8%, and a much easier pill to swallow for prospective buyers. That’s why the lock-in effect is showing signs of easing in terms of more available inventory: Homeowners who were previously refusing to sell are likely realizing those historically low mortgage rates aren’t coming back, at least not anytime soon. And people who have to move for a reason beyond their control—a death, marriage, employment opportunities, whatever it may be—and can no longer wait are doing exactly that.Story continuesThere is some regional variation in inventory, as with most housing-related stuff. In terms of new listings, Fort Worth, Fort Lauderdale, Houston, Jacksonville, and Miami were the metropolitan areas with the biggest annual increases—each one saw new listings rise by more than 24%. In contrast, three major metropolitan areas saw their new listings decline during the same period: Atlanta, Newark, and Chicago.Still, touring activity is up 23% from the start of the year (during the same period last year, it was up only 14%), and mortgage purchase applications are up 11% from the prior week, according to Redfin. Sales, however, might take more time to see a boost.“We’re at a turning point,” Realtor.com’s chief economist said at the end of January. Several economists, toward the end of last year, predicted affordability would ease slightly this year as mortgage rates dropped gradually. In the housing world, spring is seen as a pivotal selling season, so some of these trends are reflective of that. Still, there are signs of improvement—and the season is just beginning.But where there may be improvement in supply, as Redfin’s head of economic research explained, housing costs are still a problem. The median sale price for the four weeks ending March 3 is $368,588—that’s up 5.3% from last year. The median asking price is $399,223, which is up 5.1% from last year, but it was the smallest increase since the middle of January, according to Redfin. And while peak home price appreciation might be behind us, would-be homebuyers still need to make almost $50,000 more to afford to buy a home than they did before the pandemic.This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"

The value of equities held directly and indirectly climbed about $7.8 trillion from a year earlier, while the value of real estate rose nearly $2 trillion.The S&P 500 rallied in the fourth quarter to finish more than 24% higher on the year amid prospects the economic expansion would remain intact despite tighter Fed monetary policy.And while higher borrowing costs battered the residential real estate market, they also suppressed home listings and kept housing prices elevated.Net worth in the fourth quarter increased $4.8 trillion, or 3.2% from the prior three months, as the stock market climbed on expectations the Fed will begin lowering interest rates this year.The Fed’s report also showed that businesses dialed back their borrowing slightly at the end of last year as policymakers maintained tight policy in their battle against inflation. Business borrowing rose about an annualized $173 billion, the slowest pace since the third quarter of 2020.Business debt outstanding increased at a 0.82% annualized rate. For all of 2023, business debt rose just 2.2%, the least since 2010 when it contracted in the aftermath of the Great Recession.Consumer non-mortgage credit climbed an annualized 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, mortgage debt also advanced at a slower rate. For all of 2023, mortgage debt rose the least since 2019.Story continuesMeanwhile, household liquidity continued to ease while remaining markedly higher than before the pandemic. Checkable deposits rose to more than $3.9 trillion. That’s four times higher than in 2019, before the pandemic, and helps explain healthy consumer spending growth.(Adds graphic)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated WorkplaceHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market’s Need for Workers©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,Why SoundHound AI Stock Is Soaring Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-soundhound-ai-stock-soaring-174331707.html,"When it comes to stock performance, Nvidia has been the best friend that SoundHound shareholders could ask for.","SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) stock is making big gains in Thursday's daily trading session. The audio technology company's share price was up 16.9% as of 10:15 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.After some turbulent trading over the last week, SoundHound is roaring higher today thanks to bullish analyst coverage on the market's most closely watched artificial intelligence (AI) stock -- Nvidia. While SoundHound stock is still down roughly 21% from its 52-week high on the heels of a recent post-earnings pullback, its share price has rocketed 178% higher across 2024's trading.Nvidia is boosting SoundHound AI stock againIn addition to producing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that make it possible to run advanced artificial intelligence applications, Nvidia is also the market's most influential AI stock. Bullish or bearish news for the GPU leader tends to have pronounced ripple effects for the valuations of other companies with substantial exposure to artificial intelligence trends.Last month, it was also revealed that Nvidia held roughly $3.7 million in SoundHound AI stock at the end of last year's fourth quarter. Because of the investment position, SoundHound has recently tended to see particularly pronounced moves in conjunction with Nvidia-related news. On balance, this has been a highly bullish catalyst for the audio specialist -- and its stock is getting another boost thanks to this dynamic today.In a note published today, Mizuho raised its one-year price target on Nvidia stock from $850 per share to $1,000 per share. The firm cited Nvidia's advantages in custom AI chip designs and emerging ethernet tailwinds as the reasons for raising its price target. As of this writing, the GPU leader's share price is up roughly 3.6% in today's trading, and the bullish momentum is also lifting SoundHound.What comes next for SoundHound AI?With a market cap of roughly $1.8 billion, SoundHound is still much smaller than Nvidia and potentially has the potential to deliver more explosive upside from current valuation levels. That's why the audio-tech specialist often sees even bigger share price gains following the arrival of bullish news for Nvidia.Story continuesAs a result, it's possible that favorable developments for Nvidia could continue to push SoundHound stock higher in the near term. But it will ultimately be the audio software company's own sales and earnings results that determine long-term performance for its stock.With SoundHound's order backlog roughly doubling to reach $661 million at the end of last year's fourth quarter, it looks like demand for the company's technologies is rapidly ramping up. On the other hand, it will take some time for these backlogged orders to turn into actual sales.For the current fiscal year, SoundHound is guiding for sales to increase roughly 52.5% at the midpoint of its guidance range and reach approximately $70 million. That's a strong growth rate, but with the company valued at roughly 26 times this year's expected revenue, investors should understand the stock is a high-risk, high-reward play.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Names like Peter Lynch, Michael Burry, Jesse Livermore and Warren Buffett often top this list, and for good reason. Large-scale investing is frequently considered a boy's club, and women investors often don't get the publicity of their counterparts. But women can also be Wall Street wizards, and LBR Asset Management's Linda Bradford Raschke has a prop trading track record that stacks up against anyone.Don't Miss: This prop trading firm allows traders to receive 100% of the first $25,000 per account and 90% beyond that. Heres how you can get in on the profit.Finally, a stock trading prop firm! Find out how to trade over 12,000 stocks and ETFs, including penny stocks. Learn how you can get in on the action.The First Woman In Market WizardsIn his Market Wizards book series, finance author Jack Schwager chronicles the life and career of several famous traders, such as Paul Tudor Jones, Ed Seykota and Richard Dennis. In 1992's ""New Market Wizards,"" Schwager interviewed his first female subject, chronicling Raschke's journey from childhood chart watcher to president of LBR Asset Management.Raschke grew up in a trading household and was often by her father's side as he reviewed charts. Her natural curiosity led to a career in financial markets, and Raschke excelled at studying pattern recognition. She got her start on the Pacific Stock Exchange as a commodities trader, later becoming a registered commodities adviser.A strong proponent of technical analysis in asset prices, Raschke credits a love of music from a young age for helping her in pattern recognition. She doesn't believe a sophisticated background in market systems is particularly necessary to become a career trader because systems and rules are often thrown out the window when big sums of money are at play. Recognizing short-term patterns is her key to success, and she's written books, blogs and recorded YouTube videos describing her specific rules.Story continuesSuccessful Rules For Trading According To Linda RaschkePreparation is the most important emphasis for Raschke. All her ideas, trades and positions are planned and rules are rarely (if ever) deviated from. By sticking to her gut, she was able to build not just a successful fund in LBR but one of the most successful commodities trading careers of any woman on Wall Street.Some of her most prominent pieces of trading advice include:Plan your trade and trade your plan. Planning helps keep emotions in check, although most people cannot truly trade emotion-free.Use stop-loss orders. Apply the stop loss when the trade is entered, and don't cancel it once it’s placed.The first and last hours of the day are the most important. Reversals usually occur in the morning, and the first hour dictates the day. The last hour is when sharp investors come in and can be evidence of trend strength.Don't be afraid to buy high and sell low. Buy pullbacks after new highs and sell upswings after new lows.Trade what happens, not what you think should happen. Too many traders insert their point of view into a position instead of just reacting to how a piece of news moves the market.Raschke retired from asset management in 2015 and now only manages her own portfolio. But her trading lessons can inspire a new generation of prop traders who want to test their own rules and systems in a virtual setting.For example, Apex Trader has a program for prop traders looking to put themselves on the map. Its funded trader programs set top traders against each other with the best performers getting increased incentives. Plus, traders can choose from two different types of funded accounts and keep up to 100% of profits on their first $25,000.Read Next:Minimal rules, uncapped earnings' Austin-based prop trading firm puts traders first and is growing rapidly.
