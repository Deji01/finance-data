Motley Fool,1 Dividend Growth Stock Down 35% to Buy Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-dividend-growth-stock-down-200100974.html,"""Fallen angel"": A great company that has temporarily encountered hard times. Dividend King Hormel Foods is likely to fly again at some point soon.","Wall Street loves a good story, on both the positive and negative sides. Right now, unfortunately, the story for Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) is a bad one. Which is why the stock has fallen roughly 35% from its 2022 high-water mark.While the food maker is facing very real headwinds, it is highly likely that it will muddle through and continue to reward investors with strong dividend growth over time. Here's what you need to know and why you should probably buy the stock today.Hormel's dividend growth has slowed downOver the past decade, Hormel has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of roughly 12%. That's a pretty impressive number for a company in the consumer staples sector -- a category known for being slow growth but reliable. But its more recent dividend increases have been much less impressive.Image source: Getty Images.In 2022, the dividend was increased 6.1%. In 2023, it grew 5.7%. And the 2024 hike, assuming no further increases in the year (one increase is the norm), was just 2.7%.So the dividend growth is slowing down. That's not a good sign, even though Hormel's board is still clearly focused on extending its impressive streak of 57 consecutive annual dividend increases. That, by the way, makes the food company a Dividend King.You don't create a record like that by accident, and you don't hike a dividend for 57 years without muddling through some hard times along the way. Right now, unfortunately, is a hard time for Hormel. That's why dividend growth has been slowing and why the stock price has declined so far since peaking in 2022.HRL ChartIf you are a long-term dividend growth investor, however, this is probably a buying opportunity. Notably, the 3.2% dividend yield is near its highest point over the past three decades. But don't buy the stock without understanding the negatives.Hormel has many problemsThe post-pandemic spike in inflation is one of the biggest problems facing Hormel. As the company's costs increased, it tried to hike prices. That's exactly what all consumer staples companies do when faced with rising costs.Story continuesHormel's price hikes weren't as well received as those of many of its peers, so the company's financial results suffered. Notably, earnings per share in 2023 fell to $1.45 from $1.82 in 2022. That's a sizable decline. Notably, the company's gross profit margin, after improving in fiscal 2022, dropped nearly 100 basis points in 2023, an indication of the headwinds Hormel was struggling through.That wasn't all related to the pushback on the company's price increases. Another problem has been avian flu, which hurt supply in Hormel's turkey business. You can't sell turkey, or turkey-based products, if you don't have enough turkeys.Then there's the $3.3 billion Planters Nuts acquisition, which was consummated right as that snack niche was hitting a soft patch. It isn't particularly inspiring to see Hormel ink its largest ever acquisition at what, in hindsight, looks like a bad time. And that's on top of the fact that Hormel bought Planters knowing full well that it needed substantial investment to turn the brand around.Lastly, the company's business in China is still sluggish. That country, a key growth platform for Hormel, simply isn't generating the growth management had anticipated. There's nothing the company can do but wait for consumers to start buying its brands again.There are silver linings on Hormel's many cloudsIndividually, none of these problems are massive, and all of them are likely to resolve themselves given enough time. For example, consumers might be upset by price increases, but eventually they have little choice but to accept them. Notably, volumes increased across all segments of the business in the fiscal first quarter as management continues to focus on innovation to help justify price increases.While Planters is getting off to a slow start, it is actually outperforming the broader nut space as the company introduces new flavors and upgrades its marketing. Avian flu is an ongoing problem that is not unique to Hormel, and history suggests it will get better... eventually. Meanwhile, despite this issue, Hormel grew turkey volumes in the fiscal first quarter, showing that it is still executing quite well in the turkey space.Meanwhile, while growth in China is slow on the consumer side, it is starting to show some promise on the food-service side of the business. That hints that Hormel's future in China could be brightening.The issue is that all of these problems are hitting the company at the same time. And that has some investors justifiably worried. Given that other food makers have been executing better, it makes sense that Wall Street is dropping Hormel in favor of other producers that are performing better right now.Except that, given the stock's decline and the early signs of improvement in the business, this could be the right time to buy, not sell. Moreover, Hormel was forced to shelve important business modernization and streamlining efforts during the pandemic as it had to focus on dealing with snarled supply chains. It is restarting those efforts, which should further help to support improved margins and financial performance.HRL ChartThink long term with HormelNone of the issues is likely to derail the company over the long term. And while dividend growth has slowed, that's exactly what you would expect given the current situation. History suggests that Hormel will muddle through and eventually get back on track. When that happens, investors will likely reward the stock with a higher price, and dividend growth should pick back up again.If you think in decades, buying now while Wall Street is so negative gives you a chance to pick up what might be best viewed as a fallen angel while it has a historically high yield.To that end, Hormel reported solid fiscal first-quarter 2024 earnings despite the lingering headwinds, and the stock jumped sharply higher. That could just be a preview of what's to come for the shares if things continue to get better for this iconic food maker.Should you invest $1,000 in Hormel Foods right now?Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,This Is Hands-Down the Simplest Way to Earn $1 Million or More in the Stock Market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hands-down-simplest-way-earn-200000831.html,"With a few simple steps, you could be on your way to millionaire status.","Investing in the stock market is a tried-and-true way to generate long-term wealth, and while reaching $1 million may seem like a lofty goal, it's not as difficult as it might appear.You don't have to be a stock market expert to earn $1 million or more, but you will need the right investing strategy. There's no single correct way to invest, and the best approach for you will depend on your preferences and risk tolerance.That said, there's a simple and straightforward strategy to maximize your long-term earnings while minimizing risk. Whether you're new to the stock market or just want a no-fuss way to build wealth, this step-by-step process can take you from $0 to $1 million or more.Image source: Getty Images.1. Get started investing right nowThe more time you give your money to grow, the less you'll need to invest each month to reach $1 million. Thanks to compound growth, your investments will accumulate exponentially faster over time. Getting started as soon as possible, then, is key to maximizing your earnings.Even if you can't afford to invest much right now, every year counts. For example, say you're earning a modest 9% average annual return on your investments -- which is just under the market's historic average. Here's approximately how much you'd need to invest each month to reach $1 million, depending on how many years you have to save:Number of YearsAmount Invested per MonthTotal Portfolio Value20$1,700$1.044 million25$1,000$1.016 million30$625$1.022 million35$400$1.035 million40$250$1.014 millionData source: Author's calculations via investor.gov.It's never too early to start investing, and the sooner you begin, the easier it will be to build a substantial amount of wealth. You can always invest more later if you can swing it, but you won't get this precious time back.2. Don't worry about timing the marketThe stock market will always be volatile to a degree, and it can be nerve-wracking trying to determine the best time to buy. Many people are understandably worried about investing right before prices drop, and it can be tempting to hold off on buying until the perfect moment.Story continuesHowever, there's never going to be a perfect time to invest in the stock market, and the longer you wait to invest, the harder it will be to catch up later. While it may seem counterintuitive, it's often safer to simply invest consistently no matter what the market is doing.This approach is called dollar-cost averaging, and it involves investing a set amount at regular intervals throughout the year. Sometimes you'll end up buying when prices are at their peaks, and other times you'll snag investments at steep discounts. Over time, those highs and lows should average out.Dollar-cost averaging can help take the guesswork out of when to buy, making it easier to invest consistently. Again, time is your most valuable resource when building wealth, so consistency is key to reaching $1 million or more.3. Choose long-term investmentsAll investments are subject to short-term volatility, but stocks from healthy companies with solid underlying fundamentals have the best chance of recovering from downturns and earning positive long-term returns.These types of stocks won't see explosive growth overnight, but they are more likely to earn consistent returns over time. This makes them much safer than short-term investments promising to make a quick buck.If you'd prefer a more low-maintenance investment, a broad-market index fund or ETF may be your best bet. The S&P 500 index fund, for example, tracks the S&P 500 index and includes stocks from all 500 companies within the index itself. This can help create an instantly diversified portfolio with next to no effort, limiting your risk while still setting you up for positive long-term returns.^SPX ChartIf you're willing to put in more effort for the chance to earn above-average returns, investing in individual stocks may be a better fit. This approach requires more research, as you'll need to study each stock you're interested in buying as well as keep up with industry trends going forward. But with the right portfolio, you could earn far higher-than-average returns over time.Building a million-dollar portfolio isn't necessarily easy, but it's simpler than it might seem. By getting started early, investing consistently, and keeping a long-term outlook, you'll be on your way to becoming a stock market millionaire.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Are Taking the Fight to Nvidia,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-200000115.html,Nvidia GPUs dominate the AI chip market. These players are hoping to change that.,"If there is one stock that exemplifies the potential to profit from artificial intelligence (AI), it would have to be Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The company pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) that rendered lifelike images in video games. What makes these chips so effective is parallel processing, which takes computationally complex jobs and breaks them up into smaller, more manageable chunks. Nvidia was able to adapt this technology to handle the rigors of AI, making it arguably the most successful company in the AI chip space.However, as demand for AI has accelerated, numerous technology stalwarts have been working furiously behind the scenes to come up with viable alternatives to Nvidia's industry-leading processors. This week saw a number of announcements as rivals unveiled the fruit of these efforts.Let's take a look at three.Image source: Getty Images.1. IntelEarlier this week, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) unveiled its latest AI chip, dubbed Gaudi 3, in a direct challenge to Nvidia's GPU dominance. The company claims that Gaudi can train AI models nearly twice as fast as Nvidia's H100 flagship data center processor and 50% faster for inference -- running AI models that have already been trained. The company also said Gaudi delivered all that performance with 40% better power efficiency than the H100 ""at a fraction of the cost,"" according to Intel.It's important to note that Nvidia recently unveiled the successor to its H100, its Blackwell B200 AI GPU, which will begin shipping later this year. While Gaudi wasn't compared to the B200, the company said, ""We do expect it to be highly competitive"" against Nvidia's latest processor, calling Gaudi ""a strong offering.""Intel is likely not looking to outperform Nvidia's most recent AI chips but rather offer enterprises a cheaper alternative. It's also worth noting that there's been an ongoing shortage of Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips, creating a bottleneck in AI adoption. Intel's latest offering could help alleviate the backlog.Story continues2. Meta PlatformsNot to be outdone, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) announced the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v2, a custom AI chip that runs in the company's data centers. Meta announced that the latest version of its MTIA ""more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth"" of its predecessor. Early results suggest the new processor performs three times better than the first version.Meta noted that it's trying to provide ""the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity"" with its latest chip. The company isn't using these chips for AI processing; at least, not yet. Meta is using the processors to improve the speed and efficiency of its ranking and recommendation systems, used to surface relevant content on its social media sites and target advertising.Meta is one of Nvidia's biggest customers, so if it is successful in its AI chip efforts, the company could reduce its dependency on Nvidia's AI processors.3. AlphabetAt the Google Cloud Next event this week, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced the availability of Cloud Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) v5p, the latest version of its AI-centric processor. The company said its Cloud TPU can train large language models (LLMs) -- which underpin AI systems -- three times faster than version 4.As is generally the case, Google's TPUs won't be sold but will be available on Google Cloud later this year.However, in a blog post, Google noted that it's expanding its Nvidia GPU capabilities with the addition of the A3 Mega Supercomputer, which is powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs. Google Cloud customers will also have access to virtual machines (VM) featuring Nvidia's Blackwell B200 and Grace Blackwell GB200 GPUs.Google also unveiled Axion, its first data center central processing unit (CPU), designed in conjunction with Arm Holdings. Google says Axion is 30% faster than the leading CPU, with 50% better performance and 62% greater efficiency than x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).An important takeaway for Nvidia investorsWhile Intel intends to compete directly with Nvidia for a piece of the AI chip market, Meta Platforms and Alphabet are developing their own AI chips for specific purposes, either in-house or for cloud customers. Furthermore, while Intel claims its AI-centric chips can compete head-to-head with Nvidia's flagship processors, Nvidia has already moved on and will soon be shipping the next version of its state-of-the-art AI processors.This helps highlight Nvidia's enviable position in the industry -- its rivals are always playing catch-up. They claim to best Nvidia in terms of performance, but their bragging rights don't last, as Nvidia's next-generation chips are already on the way.It's also important to point out that the market for generative AI is growing at a rapid clip, increasing the market for these cutting-edge processors. As a result, Nvidia will likely maintain its industry-leading position, even as rivals enter the fray.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is It Too Late to Buy Toast Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-toast-stock-184331177.html,Is Toast stock still a buy after its recent surge? The basic numbers may not tell the whole story.,"Shares of Toast (NYSE: TOST) have been hot lately. The stock has gained 34% in a year, with a 72% gain from a deep price dip last November.But that's all in the rearview mirror. Astute investors should ask whether Toast can find more butter in the years ahead. Is it too late to buy into this restaurant management software specialist?Toast by the numbersThis stock sends mixed messages to data-driven investors.The stock has posted strong gains recently, as noted above. It trades at the lofty valuation of 39 times forward earnings estimates and 139 times free cash flow. Other profit-based valuation ratios aren't helpful since most of the company's profit metrics have been negative over the last four quarters. From this view, Toast looks quite expensive.On the other hand, price to sales (P/S) stands at a perfectly reasonable value of 3.2. And if you zoom out to a long-term view, the share price is down 64% from its all-time peak in November 2021. In that light, Toast seems affordable or downright cheap.But those headline numbers don't tell the whole story. You should also know that Toast's business is growing in all the right places. Top-line sales jumped 35% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023, for example. Gross profit rose at a quicker 42% pace thanks to expanding gross margins.Moreover, the cash flow valuation appears unusually high because Toast's trailing cash flows have only recently surpassed the breakeven point. This recent shift can distort valuation ratios, particularly when the denominator in these calculations -- recently negative or very small -- suddenly increases:TOST Revenue (TTM) ChartThe big business ideaToast sells a sophisticated cloud-based software suite to help with pretty much every aspect of running a restaurant (or a chain of food service locations). From payment processing and menu management to tracking ingredient inventories and creating the right marketing strategy based on local sales details, Toast does it all in a tightly integrated package.Story continuesThis one-stop shop usually replaces several software solutions from different vendors, each focused on just one piece of the restaurant puzzle, and the pieces aren't made to fit together. Having the operating data flow seamlessly from real-time transaction inputs to every other part of the business makes the job easier, and Toast's single package also tends to be more cost-effective than several stand-alone solutions.So, it's no surprise to see Toast's solutions pop up in many sit-down dinners and takeout lunch breaks. Keep an eye out for the Toast-branded order-taking tablets, which the company sells below cost, effectively making the hardware part of Toast's marketing effort.I've seen the brand in Tampa-area coffee shops, Greek gyro chains, full-service Italian restaurants, and more. The Toast clients include single-store family businesses, area-spanning chains, and everything from brand-new businesses to names with decades of operating history.Image source: Getty Images.It may be a different story in your neck of the woods since Toast focuses its expansion efforts on specific target markets. Send out a large team of sales reps to try out hardware in a certain city and keep the marketing effort going until a growing number of happy customers start to build buzz on the streets. It's time to move on to the next city once the word-of-mouth promotion machine is up and running.It adds up to an effective growth engine that only recently switched into a cash-generating mode and should deliver stronger profits as the business scales up. In other words, I don't think you're late to the Toast party at all. The company stares down a massive target market, and its tremendous early growth is just the start of a long and shareholder-friendly growth story.Should you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?Before you buy stock in Toast, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toast wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is This 5.5% Yielding Dividend Grower the Ultimate Income Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-5-yielding-dividend-grower-183600574.html,This company is making all the right moves. But will shareholders be rewarded?,"Analysts estimate that millions of people die prematurely around the globe every year from habitual cigarette usage. This has been an issue for over a century, which is why people and governments are consistently working to reduce smoking levels among the global population. But what if I told you the largest driver of cigarette reduction today is one of the world's largest tobacco companies?Enter Phillip Morris International (NYSE: PM). That's right, over the last decade-plus the global tobacco giant has invested billions and successfully pivoted its business away from cigarettes to ""safer"" nicotine products. Even though it has embraced these fast-growing nicotine products, its stock still trades at a cheap earnings multiple and has a strong dividend yielding over 5.5%. Investors are likely still valuing it as a tobacco stock, a sector that is considered to be in secular decline.Here's why this misunderstood nicotine giant can be a fantastic income grower for your stock portfolio.Moving beyond cigarettesThe best way to reduce cigarette usage is to introduce safer nicotine alternatives. A prime example of this is Sweden, which has popularized the Snus pouch and tobacco-free nicotine pouches in its country. After decades of growth, these products are now more popular than cigarettes in the region.Phillip Morris International is trying to implement this same strategy around the globe. It has a safer inhalation brand called Iqos, which is in the category of ""heat-not-burn"" tobacco products. The brand is popular in Japan and Europe and is now doing $10 billion in annual sales. Recently, it purchased a company that owns Zyn nicotine pouches, which are popular in the United States and Nordic countries. That brand recently passed $2 billion in retail sales in the United States. Over the next few years, it hopes to introduce Iqos to the United States and the Zyn brand to more markets around the globe.Story continuesIn the fourth quarter of 2023, smoke-free products were 39% of company sales compared to under 1% in 2025. That is some impressive growth. By 2030, management expects two-thirds of company revenue to come from smoke-free products like Iqos or nicotine pouches. This sets the company up for more durable and longer-term growth as it moves away from the dying cigarette industry.Pricing power galoreDespite volume declines in cigarettes, there is still a lot of juice left to squeeze from Phillip Morris International's legacy operations. It has a strong history of raising prices to counteract volume declines, which keeps earnings growing in local currencies. The company grew prices by 3.7% in 2020, 2.7% in 2021, 5% in 2022, and 8.9% in 2023 for its legacy cigarette brands and still gained market share across the globe.Even better, given the fact it has the leading smoke-free nicotine brands, that means if a nicotine user quits cigarettes due to price hikes, they will likely switch to another brand that Phillip Morris International owns. This makes the company much safer to invest in compared to other tobacco giants.One thing that hurts Phillip Morris International -- especially with United States investors -- is the fact it earns a lot of its sales from emerging markets. After splitting from Phillip Morris USA, the company now has a lot of foreign currency risks. Even if sales grow in local currencies due to price hikes, if those currencies devalue versus the U.S. dollar it won't show up as revenue growth for U.S. investors. The U.S. dollar has surged in value compared to many other currencies in recent years, presenting a headwind to Phillip Morris International investors. A headwind like this is unpredictable and may continue over the coming years.PM Dividend Per Share (TTM) ChartCan the dividend grow?Today, Phillip Morris International has a dividend yield of 5.73%, which is close to 4x the S&P 500 average of 1.47%. This indicates some investors are bearish on the company's ability to grow or even just maintain its dividend payouts.Historical evidence shows this is likely misguided. Phillip Morris International's dividend per share is up 147% since 2009 when it spun out as its own publicly traded company and has consistently grown each year. Today, with more room left to grow prices and the phenomenal growth coming from the smoke-free brands, I think there is plenty of room for this dividend-per-share payout to climb higher over the next 10 to 15 years.With a high dividend yield that can grow for many years, I think Phillip Morris International is a safe income stock with a lot of growth potential, making it perfect for any investor's portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Philip Morris International right now?Before you buy stock in Philip Morris International, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Philip Morris International wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is Uranium Energy a Millionaire-Maker Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uranium-energy-millionaire-maker-stock-153500221.html,"Uranium Energy made an aggressive bet on uranium prices that has worked out well, but it is still a very high-risk investment choice.","Stock investors usually have some financial goal in mind. A frequent one is to become a millionaire. Sometimes these investors get so locked into the idea of finding that one stock that will make them ""rich,"" preferably as quickly as possible, that it blinds people to the inherent risk of investing.If you're looking at Uranium Energy's (NYSEMKT: UEC) big stock run over the past year and thinking that it could mint some new millionaires (including you), you need to stop. Selling uranium has a long history of being a tough business.Uranium Energy makes a wise choiceUranium Energy sells uranium. What's notable is that, at this point, the company doesn't mine for the nuclear fuel at the moment. Instead, management made what looks like a genius move, at least in hindsight, to ink agreements to buy uranium while it was priced near historic lows. It now has a large stockpile of the fuel that it can sell at a profit, since uranium prices have increased notably since it started buying.Image source: Getty Images.The decision to buy uranium while others were, effectively, selling makes Uranium Energy's management team look extremely good. The profits it makes from this activity can be used to fund its capital investments in actual uranium mines. In a big-picture sense, it has found a way to self-fund its own growth. It is hoping to reopen a mine in August, which, at that point, would be its only operating mine asset. But it has a handful of mine projects spread across North and South America, so there is a larger development opportunity ahead. Assuming Uranium Energy can get all of those mines up and running it will be a big player in the uranium space.Based on this backstory, it is understandable that some investors might see Uranium Energy as a diamond in the rough -- a stock that could turn a small investment into a huge one. Indeed, over the past year, the stock has gained a huge 151%. But step back for just one second before you jump aboard with dreams of becoming a millionaire.Story continuesWhat happened to uranium?The first big issue to consider is that uranium is a commodity. Just like other commodities its price can be very volatile. There are a lot of reasons to like the outlook for the uranium market, most notably that nuclear power doesn't emit carbon. In other words, it can provide clean baseload power to supplement variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind. In a world that is shifting away from carbon-based fuels, that backstory is attractive.The problem is that nuclear power has a bad image. It is often viewed as dangerous. First off, the radiation involved bothers people. But the really big problem is that accidents at nuclear power plants are usually large, newsworthy events. Think Chernobyl or, more recently, Fukushima. Fukushima is a great example of what can happen to the uranium market after headline-grabbing bad news.The price of uranium, which had been starting to climb, plunged after the 2011 event, falling toward all-time lows. Countries around the world began to question whether or not nuclear power was worth the risk. Germany actually decided to start shutting down its reactors. It took more than a decade for uranium prices to recover to their 2011 levels. The shares of companies that mine uranium, meanwhile, followed the price of the nuclear fuel lower.UEC ChartTo be fair, that drop in uranium prices is what Uranium Energy took advantage of to build its low-cost uranium stockpile. But investors shouldn't buy the stock thinking that the future is only going to see the stock price climb. If history is any guide, that isn't going to be the case. And, frankly, it won't take another nuclear plant accident to push uranium prices lower. As noted, uranium is a commodity, so supply and demand dynamics alone will likely keep the price of the nuclear fuel volatile. That, in turn, will result in volatile share prices for uranium stocks like Uranium Energy.Is Uranium Energy a millionaire maker?At the end of the day, Uranium Energy's story is interesting. Perhaps it is even attractive, for those willing to take on more aggressive investments. But you shouldn't view this as a way to get rich quick or even as a singular way to reach a seven-figure nest egg.

Russian metal produced prior to Saturday will still be accepted, as long as the parties delivering it can demonstrate to the LME’s satisfaction that the metal is not subject to the sanctions.The LME’s response means it has stuck closely to the restrictions imposed by the US and UK, and is likely to reignite a debate that has gripped the exchange since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some metal traders and producers have argued that exchange should ban all Russian material to avoid being overwhelmed by a flood of unwanted metal, which they say is depressing prices and reducing its utility as a global benchmark.In a notice to members on Saturday, LME Chief Executive Officer Matthew Chamberlain said the exchange recognized that the sanctions may cause uncertainty, leading traders to dump old Russian stocks on the LME “as a safeguarding move.”As such, he said, “it is possible that a relatively large supply” of Russian metal may be delivered to the exchange.The LME acknowledged that a large share of some of its metals were underpinned by Russian metal (91% of the aluminum on the LME is Russian in origin), but said that Russian aluminum had continued to be delivered out of LME warehouses in January, February and March, indicating that “a sufficiently substantial proportion of the market is still willing to take delivery of Russian aluminium.”Story continuesThe LME considered banning deliveries of Russian supplies in 2022 but ultimately decided against it, arguing that there were still enough buyers willing to take delivery of the metal. While the UK imposed some restrictions on trading in Russian metals by UK entities in December, it included an exemption allowing trade on the LME to continue.The exchange will review requests to deliver metal produced before April 13 on a case-by-case basis, while UK members looking to withdraw old stock will also need to notify the UK Department for Business and Trade, the exchange said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and HyundaiRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data CentersCocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the BeanEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Motley Fool,Here's Why Industrial Stocks Are Set for a Tough Earnings Season,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-industrial-stocks-set-152000962.html,One industrial supply company just gave a disappointing read for the manufacturing sector.,"Expect more volatility to come in the current earnings seasons. At least, that's how it looks in the industrial sector if the earnings report from industrial supply company MSC Industrial Direct (NYSE: MSM) is anything to go by. Here's the lowdown and how you might prepare to invest in the coming earnings season.Another weak quarter for MSC IndustrialIndustrial supply companies serve as reliable indicators for the industrial economy. Their sales cycles are notably short, which means they are quick to experience the effects of market slowdowns and can rapidly expand sales when conditions improve. This sensitivity underscores the need for careful consideration in your investment decisions.Naturally, not all industrial supply companies are equal. In MSC Industrial's case, sales are heavily focused on heavy manufacturing (almost half of its sales) and, to a lesser extent, light manufacturing (around 20%).Unfortunately, those are not great end markets to be in during 2024. First, the U.S. industrial production index has weakened in 2024.US Industrial Production Index data by YCharts.Second, a particular weakness exists in MSC Industrial's core heavy manufacturing end market. Unfortunately, this has been an ongoing issue. For example, MSC Industrial missed its sales expectations over the winter, which led to a disappointing first quarter.That weakness extended into MSC's second quarter, with CEO Erik Gershwind noting that, of its top 100 national accounts, ""only 45 were growing last quarter. As a result, revenue growth to date has been below our expectations.""Consequently, MSC Industrial's average daily sales growth continues to disappoint.MSC IndustrialSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberJanuaryFebruaryMarch EstimateAverage daily sales growth1.3%(1.7)%(1.2)%(2.4)%(3.7)%(2.2)%(3.5)% to (4)%Data source: MSC Industrial Direct presentations.Zeroing in on its manufacturing sales growth, it's clear that end-market conditions remain weak. As such, CFO Kristen Actis-Grande told investors that, given performance so far this year, its full-year average daily sales growth and adjusted operating margin would be ""at the bottom end of"" its guidance ranges.Story continuesIn fact, just to hit the bottom end of its average daily sales growth of (0%-5%), MSC Industrial is relying on an improvement in its heavy manufacturing end markets and an easing of public sector budget constraints.Data source: MSC Industrial presentations. Chart by author.It's an even more disappointing performance when considering that MSC's initiatives in expanding its in-plant programs and vending machines is bearing fruit. For example, MSC now has 312 in-plant programs, compared to 224 in the same quarter of last year. In addition, its vending machines are up to 25,854 from 23,286 a year ago. Management noted that these efforts were performing ahead of expectations.In other words, the company is doing its bit, but end markets are not helping much.Image source: Getty Images.What it means to the industrial sectorMany industrial companies are relying on a back-end-loaded year to meet their full-year expectations, and if what MSC Industrial is saying reads across the sector, then there are likely to be some disappointments in the current earnings season. As such, there could be many references to push-outs and recoveries taking longer than expected in the next few weeks.This is not to argue against buying stocks in this environment. After all, if the valuation is right and a company's long-term prospects remain good, then one or two quarters of trading shouldn't make much difference to a long-term investor. Incidentally, trading on 16 times estimated 2024 earnings (which should prove a trough year), and with good growth opportunities from its vending machines program, MSC Industrial is one of those.However, in general, good entry points are important to generating investment returns. Waiting for the earnings and guidance to come out makes sense before looking to initiate a long-term position. If MSC Industrial's earnings and guidance read well, then there will be plenty of opportunity for that approach to work soon.Should you invest $1,000 in MSC Industrial Direct right now?Before you buy stock in MSC Industrial Direct, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MSC Industrial Direct wasn’t one of them.
