The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 1.8%. All three averages erased earlier session gains.The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) touched 2024 highs to hover around 4.63% as traders scaled back bets on the depth of Fed interest rate cuts this year.Data released on Monday showed retail sales in March rose 0.7% from the prior month. The reading topped economist expectations for a rise of 0.4%, signaling consumers continued to spend despite a higher interest rate environment.Stocks have come under pressure in recent days as earnings season got off to a lackluster start and concerns persisted that inflation cooling to the Federal Reserve's 2% target has stalled.Earlier in the session, investors shrugged off initial concerns of a full-blown war in the Middle East after Iran's direct missile and drone strike on Israel on Saturday. Efforts by the US to encourage Israel not to retaliate appeared to help settle nerves, in part because the well-telegraphed attack allowed damage to be contained.Oil prices pared earlier session losses on Monday as traders awaited a reactions from Israel following Iran's airstrike over the weekend.

But one key to the market rally, resilient economic growth, continued to show signs of optimism on Monday.Retail sales for March increased 0.7% from the previous month, according to Census Bureau data. Economists had expected a 0.4% increase in spending, according to Bloomberg data. Meanwhile retail sales in February were revised up to an increase of 0.9%, from a prior reading of 0.6%.This is the second consecutive monthly uptick in retail sales, suggesting January's surprise 1.1% decrease was more an aberration than a trend. It sent GDP projections higher, too, with the AtlanFed's GDP Now tool forecasting 2.8% growth for the first quarter, up from 2.4% previously.""The strong rise in retail sales in March and upward revision to February’s data will further support the Fed’s stance that there is no rush to start lowering interest rates,"" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Monday.The data reiterates consumers continued to spend despite a higher interest rate environment and Bank of America Institute recently offered a reason why that might be. Workers across all income cohorts are seeing their highest wage increases since early 2023. ""The solid labor market continues to sustain consumer momentum,"" the BofA Institute wrote on April 10. ""March saw strong jobs growth, and this appears to be reflected in strengthening after-tax wages and salaries growth in our data - with growth at the highest level since early 2023.""Mon, April 15, 2024 at 11:52 AM PDTInes FerréOil pares losses as traders anticipate Israel's response to IranOil futures pared earlier losses as traders anticipated an Israeli response to Iran's attack over the weekend.West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) settled at $85.41 per barrel, while Brent futures (BZ=F) sat above $90.10 per barrel.Oil had fallen more than 1% earlier in the session as concerns of a broader war in the Middle East eased following Iran's direct missile and drone strike on Israel on Saturday. The well-telegraphed attack allowed damage to be contained.""The question now is, does Israel launch a counterattack of escalation or do they retaliate in a show of force that again does little damage. I see the second occurrence most likely in that its more about saving face than actual damage,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial said on Monday.Its estimated that Iran produces roughly 3 million barrels of oil per day. Any interruption to that flow could send crude prices higher.""An Israeli attack on oil production or export facilities in Iran would drive the price of Brent crude oil to $100-$105,"" Andy Lipow, president of of Lipow Oil Associates said in a note on Sunday evening.Mon, April 15, 2024 at 11:15 AM PDTInes FerréTrending tickers on MondaySalesforce (CRM)Salesforce was in the #1 trending ticker on Monday after a Wall Street Journal report said the cloud company is in talks to buy software provider Informatica.

There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done.”Read more here. Mon, April 15, 2024 at 8:17 AM PDTBrian SozziReddit takes a dive — is it warranted?Reddit (RDDT) has seen fairly consistent selling since the opening bell after the Street came out with their coverage initiations post-IPO.It's an interesting response by the market. Sure, some of the notes point to the potential for stalled user growth in the near term.But getting overlooked, perhaps, are several clear bullish aspects of the Reddit investment thesis.Deutsche Bank's initiation highlights them:""We initiate on Reddit, Inc. with a buy rating and a $50 target price. We think Reddit is on the early end of a number of positive inflections: Top-of-funnel growth is accelerating, the ad platform is in the early stages of being built to address lower funnel objectives, the data licensing business is in the very early stages of growth, and the company is entering a harvest period in costs after aggressively adding to headcount over the last couple years. So in sum, we have an accelerative user growth profile, upside potential from ad-tech and, therefore, average revenue per user improvements, best-in-class margin expansion (admittedly off a low base), and high margin incremental revenue from data licensing sales.""Mon, April 15, 2024 at 7:36 AM PDTDani RomeroHomebuilder stocks slide as higher mortgage rates stifle April confidence reading Homebuilder stocks fell on Monday after a closely watched housing sentiment index broke a four-month streak of gains amid high mortgage rates.The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) stayed at 51 in April, unchanged from March. To be sure, any number over 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.“April’s flat reading suggests potential for demand growth is there, but buyers are hesitating until they can better gauge where interest rates are headed,” NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz said in a statement.Lennar (LEN), Pulte (PHM), and Toll Brothers (TOL) were all down more than 1% mid-morning, while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was off 0.3%.The flat confidence level among builders underscores how many prospective buyers and sellers, already dealing with high home prices and limited housing stock, are staying put. It comes after a higher-than-expected inflation print last week prompted investors to scale back the number of rate cuts they see this year to two, less than the median of three projected by the Fed at its March meeting.“With the markets now adjusting to rates being somewhat higher due to recent inflation readings, we still anticipate the Federal Reserve will announce future rate cuts later this year and that mortgage rates will moderate in the second half of 2024,” Dietz said.Mortgage rates have stayed slightly higher compared to the beginning of the year, pushing borrowers to the sidelines just as the spring homebuying season kicks into gear. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 6.88%, higher than 6.82% the previous week, Freddie Mac reported.In April, builders pulled back slightly on cutting home prices, with 22% of builders reporting doing so, down from 24% in March and 36% in December last year.Meanwhile, the use of sales incentives ticked down to 57% in April from a reading of 60% in March.Mon, April 15, 2024 at 7:30 AM PDTInes FerréGoldman Sachs stock rallies, leads financial sector higherFinancial stocks (XLF) rose on Monday, led by shares of Goldman Sachs (GS).Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Profits at Goldman Sachs rose 28% in the first quarter as investment banking revenues surged, giving CEO David Solomon some needed momentum at the start of 2024.Net income was $4.1 billion, beating analyst expectations.

It showed Trump Media taking on heavy losses and facing ""greater risks"" associated with the former president's ties to the platform.Trump Media went public on the Nasdaq in late March after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp.The stock rose as high as $66 per share on its first day of trading.

This would be Salesforce's first big deal since buying Slack in 2021 for $28 billion.Informatica's stock is lower as Salesforce may not offer a premium for the company, per reports.Knowing Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff, I am surprised a bit by the potential return to dealmaking. He has told me several times in recent months that Salesforce remains focused on growing profit margins — in fact, the company disbanded its M&A team last year!Nonetheless, Benioff loves doing big deals, and the company has the cash to do them. So why not?Mon, April 15, 2024 at 3:49 AM PDTBrian SozziEyes on Nvidia and IntelCitigroup (C) is opening ""upside catalyst watches"" on shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and Intel (INTC) after the chipmakers' stocks sank in the past month.On Nvidia:""Recent supply chain discussions indicate demand visibility has extended into the first half of 2025 with calendar year 2024/2025 GPU [chip] unit outlook well aligned with our 4.3 million/5.2 million base case model. We expect supply chain commentary from key foundry/memory suppliers during earnings and Computex Taiwan on June 2nd where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote which could be positive catalysts for the stock.""On Intel:""Intel stock is down ~29% year to date and we believe the stock is experiencing negative sentiment due to the foundry businesses losses. Given the positive March notebook data of a 44% month on month increase, we believe there is upside to consensus estimates and expect the stock to trade higher as Intel derives roughly 31% of revenue from notebook CPUs.""Further analysis: In the Sunday Morning Brief newsletter, I took a slightly contrarian view of Nvidia's stock price action. More on that here.Mon, April 15, 2024 at 3:43 AM PDTBrian SozziKeep connecting the dots on the Iran/Israel conflictWhile markets are handling the weekend news of Iran's strike on Israel in their stride, it's important to keep on connecting the dots on these geopolitical risks.Specifically, as it pertains to oil, which Citi thinks could now hit $100 a barrel.I liked the dot-connecting the Deutsche Bank team did on the oil front this morning:""Most directly, the effects of higher oil prices will be felt globally, and this is coming at a time when there’s already concern about sticky inflation in several countries. That’s something that could create a dilemma for central banks, as we also found out after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. On the one hand, there is the risk that a geopolitical shock hurts growth, bringing forward the timing of rate cuts. Indeed, markets were clearly pricing that risk on Friday, with the chance of a Fed rate cut by June moving up from 24% to 30%, although that’s since moved back to 24% this morning. But then again, if higher oil prices lead to more inflation and there are second round effects on other prices, then that could mean monetary policy has to stay in restrictive territory for longer. So the potential effects can work both ways.""View comments"

Apple Inc. led losses in big tech as its iPhone shipments tumbled. Banks outperformed after a surprise profit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Treasuries came under pressure also as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. tapped the US high-grade bond market, the first in a likely parade of bond sales from banks following their results.“The markets have been buoyed by strong corporate profits and the elixir of lower rates, but it seems like those two things are increasingly at odds with each other, so we would exercise some caution in the near term,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,110. Treasury 10-year yields spiked 11 basis points to 4.63%, while those on two-year notes came very close to 5% earlier Monday. West Texas Intermediate oil traded below $85 a barrel, though it pared some losses after Axios reported Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel had no choice but to retaliate against Iran.The strong tailwind from easy financial conditions continues to boost inflation and growth, including consumer spending in March, said Torsten Slok at Apollo Global Management.“Given the ongoing reacceleration in the economy, the Fed will not cut interest rates in 2024,” he noted.Expectations for monetary policy have been shifting toward a later start to Fed rate cuts, which officials have said requires a higher degree of confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path back toward their 2% target. Traders are no longer fully pricing in a rate cut before November.“In our view it’s not about ‘higher for longer’ when it comes to the Fed’s rate regime rather, it’s a continuation of the ‘pause for now’ until inflation gives up its stickiness,” said John Stoltzfus at Oppenheimer Asset Management.Due to the heightened concern that the Fed will be “slower to lower” interest rates, investors now worry that these sticky inflation readings will be viewed as a catalyst for correction, said Sam Stovall at CFRA.For all 24 corrections since World War II, it took the S&P 500 only four months to recover all that was lost in the decline, he added. Better yet, since 1990, the market got back to breakeven in only three months.Story continues“Therefore, history once again reminds us that, for long-term investors, it has typically been better to buy than bail,” Stovall said.Stubborn inflation, a robust economy and signals from Fed officials that interest rates will remain higher for longer have derailed traders’ optimism for an interest rate cut by summer. But that doesn’t mean they’re worried about the stock market.Soothsayers at Jefferies LLC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and State Street Corp. agree that the strength in economic data and corporate earnings is enough to keep this year’s stock market rally going — whether or not interest rates are dialed back.Stickier inflation stemming from strong economic momentum is better for US equities than stagflation, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Ohsung Kwon.“If inflation is sticky because of momentum in the economy, that’s not necessarily bad for stocks,” they wrote, adding “but stagflation is.”“Recent inflation data has laid to rest the notion of a Goldilocks US economy. Instead, investors and the Fed will have to put up with a bumpier disinflation path than they assumed at the start of the year,” said Jason Draho at UBS Global Wealth Management. “But overall macro conditions of trend-level growth, slow and bumpy disinflation, and a Fed ready to exercise its put of rate cuts is still supportive for risk assets.”Don’t bank on an upbeat corporate earnings season to drive equities higher as much of the optimism is already priced in following the record-breaking rally this year, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote.“Equities have already had a good run into the results, suggesting that investors are more optimistic than the downbeat earnings projections by sell-side analysts convey,” they said. “We need to see clear earnings acceleration in order to justify current equity valuations, which we fear might not come through.”Strategists at BlackRock’s Investment Institute see signs of earnings growth broadening beyond US technology behemoths to other sectors like industrials and materials in this reporting period.Strong economic data and corporate earnings have supported risk appetite so far this year despite a jump in bond yields, but “earnings will need to deliver on high expectations,” team led by global chief investment strategist Wei Li said Monday in a weekly commentary note.An improving outlook for the US economy and continued easy financial-market conditions have prompted Wells Fargo Investment Institute to boost its outlook for the US stock market and corporate earnings estimates.The investment adviser raised its S&P 500 Index 2024 year-end forecast to range of 5,100 to 5,300.“A point of emphasis is that these year-end targets allow for potential market disappointments related to the track of inflation and the federal funds rate,” strategists at WII wrote.Without a spike in oil prices on Middle East tensions, markets would go back to trade the Fed, says Citigroup Inc. strategists including Dirk Willer, which recommend investors buy the dip in that case.They this weekend’s Iran attack unlikely to lead to a further escalation for now, even as medium-term risks have risen.“This war may move down the escalation ladder if the Israeli government follows the advice of the White House and forgoes retaliatory action,” RBC Capital Markets LLC analysts including Helima Croft said in a note. While the Iranian action was “far more expansive than previous reprisals, it was still telegraphed in advance.”Corporate Highlights:M&T Bank Corp. shares jumped the most in two years after boosting its 2024 outlook for net interest income, a key source of revenue.Tesla Inc. will slash global headcount by more than 10%, Elon Musk wrote in an email to staff, as the carmaker grapples with a slowdown in electric vehicle demand.The union for American Airlines Group Inc. pilots warned members to be vigilant amid a “significant spike” in safety- and maintenance-related problems at the carrier.Clearlake Capital Group LP has made a sweetened bid to acquire Blackbaud Inc., offering $80 a share about a year after its last approach was rebuffed by the cloud software provider.Charles Schwab Corp.’s first-quarter net revenue topped estimates as the retail brokerage tries to put 2023’s turbulence behind it.CVC Capital Partners revived plans for an initial public offering in Amsterdam, seeking to raise at least €1.25 billion ($1.3 billion) with its investors in a listing that potentially paves the way for other private equity firms to go public.Deutsche Lufthansa AG cut its annual profit outlook, predicting adjusted operating profit will fall as the German airline group absorbs the financial hit from prolonged strikes in recent months.Key events this week:China property prices, retail sales, industrial production, GDP, TuesdayGermany ZEW survey expectations, TuesdayUS housing starts, industrial production, TuesdayMorgan Stanley, Bank of America earnings, Tuesday.Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson speaks, TuesdayBOE Governor Andrew Bailey speaks, TuesdayIMF publishes its latest world economic outlook, TuesdayEurozone CPI, WednesdayFed issues its Beige Book, WednesdayCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester speaks, WednesdayFed Governor Michelle Bowman speaks, WednesdayBOE Governor Andrew Bailey speaks, WednesdayTaiwan Semiconductor earnings, ThursdayUS Conf.

In a world awash in data, larger and faster storage systems are a necessity, not a want, for many clients. Pure Storage is on the cutting edge of that segment.The company has won the attention of analysts, too, and often it's been the positive kind of attention. Many are bullish on its future, including one prognosticator from a big bank who recently tagged it with a buy recommendation.Initiated with a solid buy recommendationIn mid-March, Citigroup analyst Asiya Merchant launched her bank's coverage of Pure Storage. In slapping a buy sticker on the shares, she set a price target of $65 apiece. Given the current price, that implies an upside of 23% over the next 12 months or so for the stock.""With 100% of its portfolio based on all-flash, Pure participates in the highest-growth sub-segment of external storage,"" Merchant wrote in her inaugural research note on the stock.She added that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) functionalities ""are likely to further catalyze growth,"" for flash memory service providers. That's not only a function of the increased space needed to support this technology; Flash is also good for quick storage and retrieval, as its name implies.Growth is in store, however...There's a bit of incongruity between Merchant's very positive take on Pure Storage and the company's recent pronouncements.It's guiding for double-digit percentage rate improvements in both revenue and operating income. While that's certainly encouraging, at the moment the stock is priced more like an explosive growth company than the relatively modest growth story it's laying out for investors. That $65 price target over 12 months, then, might be somewhat extravagant.Should you invest $1,000 in Pure Storage right now?Before you buy stock in Pure Storage, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pure Storage wasn’t one of them.

USA TODAY,Trump Media stock price plummets Monday as company files to issue millions of shares,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-media-stock-price-plummets-190223223.html,Trump Media & Technology Group shares plummeted Monday after the company took the first steps to issuing millions of additional shares.,"Trump Media & Technology Group shares plummeted more than 18% Monday after the company took steps to sell millions of additional shares.Trump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, filed to register up to 146.1 million shares for sale, including nearly 115 million owned by Trump.The company also listed the potential sale of another 21.5 million shares linked to warrants – contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price within a certain time frame.Filing shares for resale is standard among companies that have recently gone public via a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), as Trump Media did last month after merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. But making more shares available for purchase could curb the value of existing shareholder's stake in the company, which meant the already-volatile stock saw another big swing on Monday. In this photo illustration, Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social is shown on a cell phone on March 25, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.Trump Media shares were down more than $6 early Monday afternoon, trading at $26.55 on the Nasdaq as of 2:25 p.m. ET. That’s down more than 60% from its peak in late March, after the company made its stock market debut.Next steps for Trump MediaRegulatory filings from earlier this month showed Trump Media made about $4 million in revenue and lost more than $58 million in 2023. Its operating losses “raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern,” according to an auditor that reviewed the company’s finances.Given the company's performance, some expect it to act quickly with any potential sale.“They’re burning through a lot of cash and their share price is very high now,” said Derek Horstmeyer, a finance professor at George Mason University in Virginia who specializes in corporate finance. “I don’t see any reason why (they wouldn’t jump on this).”Trump Media predicts that exercising the warrants could bring in roughly $247.1 million, according to the company's latest filing.Value of Trump MediaTrump Media’s market cap and Trump’s net worth – both tied to the company’s stock – have taken a hit as its stock price has dipped. The company’s market value as of Monday was more than $3.5 billion, down from a peak of nearly $8 million.As for Trump’s net worth, the former president is no longer listed on the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, a list of the top 500 wealthiest people in the world, each worth at least $5.7 billion. His net worth is currently closer to $4 billion, according to Forbes.Trump owns nearly 60% of Trump Media with 78.75 million shares. He cannot offload his shares until September without approval from the Trump Media board.Story continuesDJT stock hits turbulence: More volatility ahead for Trump's high-flying Truth SocialMore volatility expectedExperts warned early on about the expected volatility of the company, comparing Trump Media to meme stocks like GameStop and AMC. The company's latest filing notes that its success depends, in part, on the reputation and popularity of Trump, who is currently on trial for allegedly falsifying business records to disguise a hush money payment to a porn star.“I expect the stock price to continue to be highly volatile, with the long-term trend down, but on any given day it might jump up,” University of Florida professor Jay Ritter said.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump Media shares are down as companies prepares to sell more stockView comments"

Motley Fool,"Toast Stock Has 25% Downside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/toast-stock-25-downside-according-181716021.html,The company exists in a tough economic environment and hasn't yet proven it can make money consistently.,"A cautionary note for all the stock analyst watchers out there -- a price target increase does not automatically mean a buy recommendation.A notable example of this dichotomy can be seen in a change one pundit made to his price target on specialty tech stock Toast (NYSE: TOST). The analyst is concerned that the company will face mounting competition, and will struggle to win the large clients it needs to power key fundamentals higher.Is Toast toast?The bearish booster is Wells Fargo Securities analyst Jeff Cantwell. In mid-April, while bumping his Toast fair value estimation $2 higher to $17 per share, he nevertheless reiterated his recommendation of underweight (sell, in other words). The price target (which the analyst expects will be reached within the next 12 months) is 25% below the stock's current price.In his research note covering the price target shift, Cantwell zeroed in on the full-year 2024 guidance proffered by Toast, a company that specializes in restaurant ordering and management software. Describing Toast's forecasts for the year as ""a mixed bag,"" the analyst said that the company's key drivers are the signing of new restaurants, the level of gross payment volume (GPV) per location, and average revenue per user (ARPU).Of these, Cantwell wrote that ""While a case can be made for each [key performance indicator] to outperform in isolation, we struggle to envision all three outperforming in unison given our view that average location size should continue to shift lower.""Competition and high valuationsToast hews to the classic model of a tech start-up -- it typically loses money on the bottom line while posting occasionally impressive revenue growth numbers. Additionally, while the company's technology is certainly useful for restaurants and other businesses in the food and beverage space, competitors exist -- a notable example being Block -- and Toast's valuations are rather high. I think Cantwell's take on the stock is accurate.Should you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?Before you buy stock in Toast, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toast wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Spirit Airlines Stock Flew Higher at the Open Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-spirit-airlines-stock-flew-180554257.html,The airline detailed the cash it will get from RTX because of engine issues.,"Spirit Airlines (NYSE: SAVE) has updated its first-quarter guidance just weeks before it intends to announce finalized results. The move appears to have excited speculation among Spirit investors, sending the shares soaring 13% at the open Monday before retreating back to up 3% as of 1:30 p.m.A routine announcement causes a big spikeSpirit shareholders have endured a lot of turbulence in recent years. The company came into 2024 hoping to complete a sale to JetBlue Airways, but in March the two sides called off the deal because of regulatory opposition.The termination left Spirit with the unenviable task of flying alone into some significant headwinds, including schedule disruptions caused by issues with RTX engines.On Monday, Spirit said it expects to recoup between $150 million and $200 million from RTX in damages over the engine issues, cash that will help improve the airline's liquidity. However, the accounting of those payments will temporarily depress margins and slightly affect quarterly results.Spirit said it now expects to post a first-quarter negative adjusted operating margin of between 14.5% and 13.5%, compared with previous guidance for a negative-15% to negative-12% margin. Revenue should come in at around $1.265 billion, in line with the previous forecast for sales of between $1.25 billion and $1.28 billion. The airline is scheduled to release final first-quarter numbers in early May.The update seemingly should not have caused an oversized reaction to the share price, and in premarket trading after the update was released, Spirit shares were actually down. But the update caused significant speculation on social media that the update was a precursor to announcing a new merger agreement, causing the shares to spike higher.Is Spirit Airlines a buy heading into earnings?A new deal is certainly possible. Frontier Group Holdings had tried to buy Spirit before JetBlue stepped in and would still be a logical partner. But there is no indication Frontier is focused on dealmaking, and the airline industry operating environment has gotten more treacherous in the quarters since that initial interest.More likely than not, Spirit will have to navigate through these engine disruptions and questions about the economy while managing a significant debt load on its own.Investors interested in buying in on merger speculation need to be aware that absent a buyout, it will be hard for Spirit shares to get airborne anytime soon.Should you invest $1,000 in Spirit Airlines right now?Before you buy stock in Spirit Airlines, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Spirit Airlines wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Huge News for Tesla Investors: 1 Billion Reasons to Keep an Eye on the Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huge-news-tesla-investors-1-180000458.html,Tesla recently announced that its self-driving technology has collected over 1 billion miles of data.,"One of the most volatile stocks is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a company that's a pioneer in electric vehicles (EVs) and a pillar in the sustainable energy movement.While the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite inch closer to record levels, Tesla can't seem to find its mojo. Shares have plummeted 30% so far this year, and the company's prospects look cloudy.Per usual, Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, gave investors some reason to cheer by distracting them with an update on the company's autonomous driving progress.A few days ago, Musk took to X -- the social media platform formerly known as Twitter -- to post that Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) technology has collected over 1 billion miles of driver data. Let's break down why this is important and what it could mean for the future of the company.Enter the DojoTesla vehicles are equipped with cameras and sensors that are constantly collecting various data. This includes maps of neighborhoods and cities, driving conditions in different areas, and more.In turn, this data is directly fed back to a supercomputer called Dojo, the neural network that processes all of this driver data and helps refine the company's self-driving software.Tesla is not the only company pursuing autonomous driving. General Motors and Alphabet have made significant investments in the technology. While the latter's Waymo subsidiary has made some notable progress in self-driving capabilities, General Motors has faced a number of setbacks as of late.Tesla is considered by many on Wall Street to be in the lead with autonomous driving. The company has more data than its competitors, and as such, it's been able to make big changes to FSD over the years.But even so, the idea of self-driving cars really does seem like science fiction. While the prospects are intriguing, is autonomous driving a reality?Image source: Getty Images.How close is full self-driving?There are a couple of major selling points for autonomous driving. First, ride-hailing platforms such as Uber or Lyft theoretically stand to benefit from the technology since it could replace the cost of human drivers in the long run. The same idea applies to delivery services, including DoorDash or Instacart.If any company can crack the code to self-driving vehicles at scale, it could license the technology to automakers. Subsequently, fleets of robotaxis could dominate the roads and significantly impact the labor market.Around the same time that Musk posted that his company has collected over 1 billion miles of FSD data, he also took to X to proclaim that robotaxis could be here soon. While it's not entirely clear if Tesla's robotaxis will be on the road this year, Musk's cryptic social media posts suggest that something big could be in store over the summer.Story continuesHe has taken to social media before to tease certain ideas or updates about Tesla. Moreover, his intense management style has also played roles in the company missing deadlines on numerous occasions.Is Tesla stock a buy now?Although the prospects of FSD and robotaxis are exciting, investors shouldn't pour into the stock on speculation that Tesla will unveil a new product or service in this category later this year.Instead, zooming out and considering the bigger picture is more important. While the company's core EV business is enormous, its growth has stalled over the last year. This is not surprising, since unusually high inflation and rising interest rates have plagued the economy. As a car company, Tesla is going to be sensitive to high interest rates.Nevertheless, with consistent free-cash-flow generation and $29 billion of cash on the balance sheet, Tesla has done a stellar job investing in high-growth opportunities. Namely, the company's pursuits in artificial intelligence (AI) are being overlooked as other mega-cap tech players take the spotlight.TSLA PS ratio data by YCharts; PS = price to sales.I would not be surprised if we catch the first glimpse of robotaxis this summer. But the bigger idea is that Tesla is collecting more data and developing autonomous driving software at a faster rate than the competition. So in the long run, I see the company as better positioned than its peers to profit from self-driving at the right time.With a modest price-to-sales ratio of just 6.2, the stock trades well below its 10-year average and is significantly off its highs from a couple of years ago. While FSD's public debut remains somewhat of a mystery, I still see now as a compelling time to scoop up shares in Tesla.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.
