Not even solid economic readings were able to move the needle ahead of the release of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge and Jerome Powell’s remarks Friday — when markets will be closed.“When you title a speech ‘There’s Still No Rush’, you have a point to make,” said Peter Boockvar, author of the Boock Report. “Waller joins voting member Raphael Bostic in wanting to wait — and only likely expecting one-two cuts this year.”The S&P 500 wavered around 5,250 after closing at a record. Treasury two-year yields rose five basis points to 4.61%. The bond market will close at 2 p.m. New York time Thursday. Swaps traders trimmed wagers on Fed policy easing, with contracts now showing an implied probability of about 60% for a June cut.“Right or wrong, expectations for a June rate cut probably won’t shift unless inflation continues to rise and the labor market appears to be a major contributor to the increase,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.In economic data, the government’s two main measures of US activity — gross domestic product and consumer spending — posted strong advances at the end of last year. Consumer sentiment rose markedly toward the end of March, supported by strong stock-market gains and expectations that inflation will continue to ease. Pending sales of previously-owned homes in the US recovered.Story continuesTo Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance, a solid economy — driven by a resilient consumer — sets the table for another strong earnings season, which will kick off next month.“For those that are still holding onto the idea that the much-forecasted 2023 recession is right around the corner, they’ve missed an excellent 15 (if not 17) months in the stock market,” Zaccarelli noted.The S&P 500 will end the year at 5,300 as the consensus real US GDP forecast has climbed in a positive sign for stocks, according to RBC Capital Markets’ Lori Calvasina, who raised her target from 5,150.“We think the market’s view of where economic fundamentals are heading, rather than any one economist’s or strategist’s view, is what ultimately drives stock market pricing.”The S&P 500 is blowing past milestones this year, even as its $4 trillion rally leads some to worry about the market running too hot. But now a technical indicator that has an “undefeated” record suggests the momentum isn’t going to fade any time soon.The relative strength index of the benchmark gauge — which measures price momentum — has closed above a value of 50 for 100 straight trading sessions as of Wednesday’s close, data compiled by SentimenTrader showed. After a similar show of strength in its price momentum, the S&P 500 was higher every time over the ensuing two, three, six, and twelve months periods, the analysis found.The valuation of the equal-weighted S&P 500 has increased to a price-to-earnings ratio of 17 — but the index has shown in the past that it can continue to rise even when trading above fair value, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by Ryan Hammond.“For investors concerned about overvaluation or risks to the economic outlook, our options strategists note that downside protection appears attractively priced,” the strategists wrote.The relentless bull run sent the S&P 500 up 10% this year — putting the index on pace for two straight quarters of double-digit percentage gains.Since World War II, such a feat would be followed by mild weakness in the following month — with the gauge climbing by an average of 12.27% one year later, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group.Corporate Highlights:Home Depot Inc. said it would buy building-products distributor SRS Distribution Inc. for about $18.25 billion in a bid to bolster the company’s professional services business.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. narrowed its fiscal 2024 guidance even as the drugstore chain beat Wall Street’s estimates for second-quarter profit and revenue.Palantir Technologies Inc. was cut to sell at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., which cited “egregiously rich” valuation.Estee Lauder Cos. was raised to buy at Bank of America Corp., which said the company’s earnings have now bottomed.Country Garden Holdings Co., once China’s top property developer, warned it will miss its deadline for reporting annual results as more information is needed for appropriate accounting.Key events this week:Good Friday.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks UPS Stock Is Going to $100. Is It a Sell Around $147?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-191059572.html,UPS said it plans to increase revenue by as much as 25% by 2026.,"United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) held an analyst day earlier this week where the company provided investors with an optimistic new three-year strategic plan for revenue and profit margin growth. But not all analysts share that optimism.Following the event, Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shanker raised his firm's price target for UPS stock by $5 per share, but he still thinks investors should sell the stock. The new price target of $100 per share would still represent a decline of 33% from the stock's current price. That's after share prices for the delivery and logistics company have already dropped by more than 20% over the past year.Is it time to sell UPS stock?While Shanker wasn't disappointed with the 2026 financial targets presented by UPS CEO Carol Tomé, the analyst questioned the viability of the path to get there. UPS hopes to achieve annual revenue of between about $108 billion and $114 billion by 2026. That compares to 2023 revenue of $91 billion.UPS said it plans to grow revenue with a multi-pronged approach to grow volume with higher productivity, efficiency, and by winning back lost market share. Revenue in 2023 was more than 9% lower than the prior year. Tomé addressed that decline, stating ""We had more volume leave us than we anticipated,"" as competitors absorbed some of UPS' small package business.However, regaining that business might prove difficult or lead to lower pricing that would impact profitability and make profit margin targets hard to achieve. UPS will also be relying on technology upgrades to ""unlock revenue growth and drive cost optimization efforts.""UPS could surprise the Morgan Stanley analyst with a flawless execution of its strategy. However, competition or the macroeconomic environment could also prevent it from achieving its goals. Investors who don't want to take that risk might want to invest elsewhere at this stage of its turnaround.Should you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?Before you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and United Parcel Service wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Target Hospitality Stock Surged Higher This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-target-hospitality-stock-surged-173113290.html,The company's majority owner would like to take it private again.,"The majority owner of Target Hospitality (NASDAQ: TH) would like to buy the shares it doesn't already own. Investors are excited about the potential payout, sending Target shares up 22% for the week as of Thursday afternoon, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence.A short run as a public company?Target Hospitality is a provider of modular accommodations and related services used in emergencies and in situations with temporary surging demand for lodging. The company went public via a 2019 merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).Arrow Holdings, an affiliate of private equity firm TDR Capital, currently owns 64% of Target's shares, but it is looking to add to its stake. On Monday, Target announced that its board has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire the remaining shares for $10.80 apiece.The board has formed a special committee of independent directors to evaluate the offer. With the stock currently trading at $10.97, investors appear to be betting that the two sides will come to the table and negotiate a price higher than the initial $10.80 offer.Is Target Hospitality stock a buy?Target Hospitality shares still trade nearly 40% below the stock's early 2023 highs. Investors should resist the temptation to buy in today.Even if the board can negotiate a premium price, much of that premium is already built into the share price and it is unclear if there is much upside to be had from those who might buy today. And if the two sides can't reach a deal Target Hospitality shares are likely to fall to around $9 per share, where they were prior to the offer being made public.There is more downside risk than upside opportunity right now, and investors would do best to stay away.Should you invest $1,000 in Target Hospitality right now?Before you buy stock in Target Hospitality, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target Hospitality wasn’t one of them.

TipRanks,"These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Penny Stocks Could Go Boom, Say Analysts",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-strong-buy-penny-stocks-173034915.html,"Nearly three months into 2024, it’s clear that the bullish trends are here to stay. Markets hit a bottom in late October, but since then the S&P 500 has gained 27% and now stands at more than 5,200. The NASDAQ index is up 30% from its own October 27 low point. These are bull-market numbers, and show little sign of stopping. Watching the market from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus comments on the market outlook: “S&P 500 earnings results over the most recent two quarterly","Nearly three months into 2024, it’s clear that the bullish trends are here to stay. Markets hit a bottom in late October, but since then the S&P 500 has gained 27% and now stands at more than 5,200. The NASDAQ index is up 30% from its own October 27 low point. These are bull-market numbers, and show little sign of stopping.Watching the market from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus comments on the market outlook: “S&P 500 earnings results over the most recent two quarterly reporting seasons, economic data that persists in showing resilience, the Fed’s mandate-sensitive monetary policy, and prospects for innovation coupled with cross generational demographic needs that suggest a shift in mindset driven not so much by fear and greed but a need to invest for intermediate to longer-term goals suggest to us an opportunity to tweak our target higher… We are increasing our year-end target price for the S&P 500 to $5,500 (from $5,200).”The growing appetite for risk among investors bodes well for the overall stock market, but it is especially good for the higher-risk stocks. For those willing to embrace this risk, the potential rewards can be substantial. The penny stocks, equities priced below $5 per share, exemplify this combination of risk and reward, with the potential to double or even triple the initial investment.Given the inherent volatility of these investments, Wall Street analysts recommend doing some due diligence before pulling the trigger, noting that not all penny stocks are bound for greatness.With this in mind, we set out on our own search for compelling investments that are set to boom. Using TipRanks’ database, we pulled two penny stocks that have amassed enough analyst support to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Not to mention, each offers massive upside potential.Lineage Cell Therapeutics (LCTX)First up is a micro-cap biotherapeutic firm working to create cell therapies that target severe conditions with high unmet medical needs. The company uses a proprietary cell-based platform to develop its therapies and can create lines of terminally-differentiated human cells capable of supporting or replacing cells that are dysfunctional or absent due to injury or degenerative disease. The company’s drug candidates, designed on this platform, assist the natural immune system in putting up an effective defense against a wide range of conditions.Story continuesLineage currently has five candidates in its research pipeline. Three of these are in preclinical stages – but the other two are undergoing human clinical trials. Of these, the more advanced is OpRegen, an ophthalmological drug being tested in the treatment of dry AMD with geographic atrophy.Lineage is developing this drug in a partnership agreement with Roche affiliate Genentech, which promises lucrative future royalties. For now, the key developments revolve around upcoming data releases. Study results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial, covering 24 months of testing, are set for release at the 2024 Retinal Cell & Gene Therapy Innovation Summit, scheduled for May 3. The company’s presentation will include long-term follow-up data from 10 out of 12 patients, covering anatomical and functional results.OpRegen is the subject of an ongoing Phase 2a study on the optimization of subretinal surgical delivery. The study will evaluate safety and activity in up to 60 patients and began in March of last year. The trial is being run by Roche and interim data from the study is likely to be Lineage’s next major catalyst.Covering Lineage for Baird, analyst Jack Allen is enthusiastic about OpRegen as the company’s main draw for investors. He writes of the program’s overall prospects, “We continue to believe OpRegen’s profile which features both positive anatomical and functional changes is differentiated in the GA space. For context, neither of the approved GA therapies have been shown to improve vision function (not even slow decline), rather they were primarily approved on studies focused on slowing lesion growth… With an estimated ~2.5M GA patient in the developed markets (US and EU) and no approved treatments for this disease we believe that Roche’s annual sales of this asset could easily top $4B, which could translate to over $500M in annual royalties to Lineage, a dynamic that should drive significant upside to Lineage’s valuation in the long term.”“Moving forward, we remain positive on the potential for Lineage’s cell therapy pipeline and anticipate investor appreciation for the OpRegen opportunity will increase in the coming months as additional data are presented,” the analyst added.To this end, Allen rates LCTX shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), while his $5 price target shows his confidence in a robust 275% upside potential for the next 12 months. (To watch Allen’s track record, click here)Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating on Lineage’s shares is unanimous, based on 5 recent positive analyst recommendations. The shares are trading for $1.35 each, and the $5.40 average price target, even more bullish than the Baird view, suggests that a one-year gain of ~303% lies ahead. (See LCTX stock forecast)MDxHealth (MDXH)From biopharmas, we’ll switch over to medical diagnostics. MDxHealth is another micro-cap firm in the healthcare sector, but rather than focus on treatment options, its work is aimed at early detection. The company is working to commercialize precision diagnostics that provide medical professionals and patients with actionable molecular information needed to create personalized treatment plans.MDxHealth does this by using proprietary genomic, epigenetic, and other molecular technologies to develop accurate tests to make diagnoses and prognoses for urologic cancers and other urologic diseases. The company has several diagnostic tests on the market, including three focused on prostate cancer and one on urinary tract infections.The company’s two main products are the Select mdx test for prostate cancer, used pre-biopsy, and the Confirm mdx test for prostate cancer, used post-biopsy. The first is used as a screener for aggressive prostate cancer. It is a urine test, proven to be highly predictive, given to men at risk for the disease before initial biopsies are conducted. The second test is given after a negative biopsy and is used to identify patient populations with clinically significant, but undetected, prostate cancer.This company recently released its financial results for 4Q23 and showed sound revenues and a deeper-than-anticipated earnings loss. At the top line, the company’s quarterly revenue of $19.39 million was up 50% year-over-year – and it skated over the forecast by just under half a million dollars. At the bottom line, the company’s GAAP EPS of 39 cents missed the forecast by 8 cents per share. We should note here that MDxHealth’s revenues have been on an upward trend since the beginning of last year.For BTIG analyst Mark Massaro, this stock shows clear potential in a growth field. Massaro writes of the company, “MDx Health executed nearly flawlessly operationally in 2023 and announced it is evaluating a number of growth opportunities in the form of new partnerships or possible acquisitions… MDXH delivered another strong quarter as it drove a Q4 revenue beat and reiterated that its 2024 revenue guide is above where we/the Street were modeling as they guided for +12-15% Y/Y growth. We think there is upside to this guide and for context, MDXH drove +89% Y/Y revenue growth in 2023 and +42% Y/Y organically. We view MDx Health as an attractive small-cap growth and value stock and a one-stop-shop in prostate diagnostics testing, and trades at just ~1.1x our 2025 rev estimate of $90M, below peer historical averages of ~3-7x.”Looking ahead, Massaro quantifies his stance with a Buy rating and an $8 price target that suggests a 221% upside potential on the one-year horizon. (To watch Massaro’s track record, click here)All in all, there are 3 recent analyst reviews of this micro-cap stock, and they are all positive – giving the shares a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s $7 average target price and $2.49 trading price together imply a one-year upside of 181%.

Benzinga,Warren Buffett's Favorite Stock Market Indicator Is Flashing Red — Dangerously Close To Reaching The Number He Says Is 'Playing With Fire',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-favorite-stock-market-173013346.html,"In the realm of stock market indicators, the Buffett Indicator stands out, especially when it flashes red. Named after Warren Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and a figure synonymous with investing acumen, the indicator compares the total market capitalization of all actively traded U.S. stocks to the latest estimate of quarterly gross domestic product (GDP).

Buffett, in a 2001 Fortune magazine article shared by CNN Money, described it as “probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment.”Don't Miss:Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.The essence of Buffett’s message is straightforward: For stock investments to outpace the growth of U.S. business significantly, the market’s valuation relative to GDP must increase continually.“If GNP is going to grow 5% a year and you want market values to go up 10%, then you need to have the line go straight off the top of the chart,” Buffett said. He noted that when the ratio is in the 70% to 80% range, stock purchases tend to be highly beneficial for investors. Conversely, a ratio near or exceeding 200%, similar to what was observed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, suggests a highly risky market environment.Currently, this indicator has ascended to a two-year peak, hovering around 190%, which could herald a market downturn. Historical data supports this concern, as a previous surge to 211% in 2022 was followed by a 19% decline in the S&P 500 over the subsequent year.In 2001, this indicator was not just flashing, it was in the red zone, highlighting an overvaluation that contributed to the bursting of the dot-com bubble. This led to a stock market crash, particularly affecting technology companies that had reached unsustainable valuations. The fallout was a reduction in investor confidence, leading to a decrease in investment and consumer spending, which further impacted the economy.Story continuesTrending: How to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 Million — and retire a millionaire.Market dynamics have been particularly buoyant recently, driven in part by a surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, cautionary tones are emerging from several quarters. Analysts like John Hussman, who predicted past market crashes, and figures like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have expressed concerns about current market conditions.Despite these warnings, not everyone sees the current market conditions as purely speculative. JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, for example, contends that the excitement around AI is not mere hype but a reflection of its real economic potential.Even as the market exhibits strength, the Buffett Indicator’s current levels suggest a need for caution. Its simplicity and historical significance make it a tool that, despite its limitations, can provide valuable insights into market valuation and potential future direction. As the quarter closes and earnings reports loom, investors and market watchers will be paying close attention to whether market enthusiasm can sustain itself or a correction is on the horizon.Consulting with a financial adviser is a wise decision for navigating the complexities of the stock market.
