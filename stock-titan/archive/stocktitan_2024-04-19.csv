(TSXV: GXU) (OTCQX: GVXXF) (""GoviEx"" or ""Company"") is currently in discussions with the Government of the Republic of Niger regarding the commencement of its mining operations. The Company has received notice that it must commence mining at its Madaouela uranium project (the ""Madaouela Project"" or ""Project"") by 3 July 2024, failing which there is a risk of revocation of its mining permit. The Company is committed to developing the Project and is working with the Nigerien government towards a mutually beneficial solution that complies with applicable law and protects the Company's rights. While there is no guarantee of the outcome of these discussions, GoviEx is committed to exploring all viable options to ensure the best results for the Company and all of its stakeholders. In parallel with the discussions with the Government, GoviEx is in discussions with third parties regarding potential investments to expedite the development of the Project. We will provide further updates as these discussions progress.Govind Friedland, Executive Chairman commented: ""Since the start of our operations in Niger, we have completed an unprecedented 650,000 metre drilling campaign, all with local contractors and employees, to define the potential mineral resource there, which is now amongst the largest known resources in the world. The Company has since worked with local engineers to design a state-of-the-art open pit and underground mine that has an expected life of over 20 years and that will provide hundreds of new jobs to Nigeriens. The Company was able to do this because it cooperated with governments and worked with locals to create a mutually beneficial outcome. Our commitment to the country remains and we will use all appropriate means available to us to ensure that we continue to develop the Project.""GoviEx has successfully advanced the Project from its initial exploration phase, through a period of historically low uranium prices, to the publication of its feasibility study in late 2022. The Project has advanced despite political change since the coup d'Etat on 26 July 2023. Since then, the Company has completed its updated Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, required to commence construction and operations. In March this year, GoviEx announced that due diligence for the Project had started on behalf of prospective lenders and that it had expressions of interest in excess of USD 200 million for project related debt finance, and to date continued discussions with potential lenders and off-takers. More recently, the Company started Front-End Engineering Designs and initial ground works, including the construction of an access road at the Project, and preparation of terracing necessary to commence civil engineering. The Madaouela Project represents a significant investment in the Nigerien economy, with an anticipated initial capital expenditure of USD 343 million, and is expected to generate considerable employment opportunities with the potential of creating up to 800 jobs over its forecast 20-year mine life. The Madaouela Project is also expected to contribute substantial royalty payments and taxes to the Nigerien Government. The Government holds a 20% stake in COMIMA, the Nigerien company set up to develop the Project.Although we continue to be dedicated to Niger, it is important to note that GoviEx is an international company with a diverse portfolio of projects. We continue to progress our mine-permitted uranium project in Zambia which is expected to publish its feasibility study in the second half of this year.

Das wirksam Datum ist der 23. April 2024. Bestehende ADR-Inhaber müssen ihre ADRs im Verhältnis von eins zu vierzig gegen neue umtauschen, während Halter von vorteilhaften ADS über Vermittler keine Maßnahmen ergreifen müssen. Die ADS werden weiterhin unter dem Symbol 'BPTS' am Nasdaq Capital Market gehandelt. Die Änderung des Verhältnisses wird nicht von der Ausgabe neuer Aktien begleitet, und das Unternehmen warnt davor, dass der Handelspreis nicht notwendigerweise mit dem vor der Änderung multipliziertem Preis durch das neue Verhältnis übereinstimmt.

Alecensa is now the first and only ALK inhibitor approved for people with ALK-positive early-stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery to remove their tumour. “With an unprecedented 76% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death versus chemotherapy, Alecensa significantly improves upon the standard of care for people with early-stage ALK-positive lung cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “At Roche, our goal is to give patients the best chance of cure by bringing effective, targeted treatments to early-stage disease before their cancer has spread. This approval brings us one step closer to achieving that mission.” “The approval of Alecensa marks a pivotal moment for people newly diagnosed with early-stage ALK-positive lung cancer, who until now, were not able to receive ALK-specific therapy,” said Ken Culver, Director of Research and Clinical Affairs at ALK Positive, Inc. ""These patients, who are typically diagnosed at a younger age, often face recurrence and have a higher risk of developing brain metastases than those with other types of NSCLC. Now, with this significant advance, it is more important than ever that all people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer undergo testing for ALK and other recommended biomarkers to receive the treatment most appropriate for them.” The approval is based on positive results from the Phase III ALINA study that demonstrated Alecensa reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 76% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.24, 95% CI: 0.13-0.43, p<0.001) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in people with completely resected IB (tumour ≥ 4 cm) to IIIA (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) ALK-positive NSCLC.1 In an exploratory analysis, an improvement of central nervous system (CNS) disease-free survival was observed (HR=0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.58).1 The safety and tolerability of Alecensa in this trial were generally consistent with previous trials in the metastatic setting and no unexpected safety findings were observed.1 These data were presented as a late-breaking oral at the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress 2023 Presidential Symposium in October 2023 and were also recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2024. Alecensa is a kinase inhibitor currently approved as first- and second-line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. It has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients, including those with CNS metastases, and now with this approval, these benefits could extend to people with early-stage disease. Routine testing of resected surgical tissue or biopsy for ALK, EGFR and PD-L1 biomarkers in patients with stage IB to IIIA and select IIIB (UICC/AJCC 8th edition) NSCLC, in addition to in the advanced setting, is recommended by international guidelines, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), to support clinicians’ decision-making. About 5% of people with NSCLC are ALK-positive, equating to approximately 90,000 people worldwide diagnosed each year.3-5 The review of this application was conducted under the FDA’s Project Orbis initiative, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions. For this review, FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada (HC), Israel’s Ministry of Health (IMoH) Pharmaceutical Administration, Switzerland’s Swissmedic, and the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA). Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will also be participating as Type C Project Orbis Partners. Additionally, the FDA reviewed and approved the supplemental application under its Real-Time Oncology Review pilot programme, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Data from the Phase III ALINA study will also be used for filing submissions to additional global health authorities, including the European Medicines Agency About the ALINA studyThe ALINA study [NCT03456076] is a Phase III, randomised, active-controlled, multicentre, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Alecensa® (alectinib) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in people with resected Stage IB (tumour ≥ 4 cm) to IIIA (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The study included 257 patients who were randomly assigned to either the Alecensa or chemotherapy treatment arm. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcome measures include overall survival, central nervous system-DFS, and percentage of patients with adverse events. About lung cancerLung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death globally.6 Each year 1.8 million people die as a result of the disease; this translates into more than 4,900 deaths worldwide every day.6 Lung cancer can be broadly divided into two major types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer. NSCLC is the most prevalent type, accounting for around 85% of all cases.7 Today, about half of all people with early lung cancer (45-76%, depending on disease stage) still experience a cancer recurrence following surgery, despite adjuvant chemotherapy.2 Treating lung cancer early, before it has spread, may help prevent the disease from returning and provide people with the best opportunity for a cure.8 About Alecensa® (alectinib)Alecensa is a highly selective, central nervous system-active, oral medicine created at Chugai, a member of the Roche Group, Kamakura Research Laboratories for people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumours are identified as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive. Alecensa is already approved in over 100 countries as an initial (first-line) and second-line treatment for ALK-positive, metastatic NSCLC, including in the United States, Europe, Japan and China.

Negative None. Financial Analyst Assessing the partnership between SK Telecom, Aptos Labs, Brevan Howard and Microsoft introduces a significant stride in integrating blockchain technology with institutional finance. The Aptos Ascend project emphasizes transaction efficiency, capable of handling over 30,000 transactions per second, which dwarfs the average throughput of most traditional financial systems and even some existing blockchains. This could potentially reduce operational costs for financial institutions by streamlining the settlement process and significantly reducing transaction times.Investors should pay attention to the novel use of Microsoft Azure and Azure OpenAI Service, indicating a robust infrastructure coupled with advanced AI capabilities. This technical foundation may offer a competitive edge in trade finance offerings, potentially increasing SK Telecom's market share in the blockchain-as-a-service space and therefore could affect the stock positively in the long term.It is also noteworthy that by incorporating BCG's strategic consulting experience, the Aptos Ascend project is poised to integrate seamlessly into existing institutional workflows, which can be a major hurdle for new technology adoption. This could accelerate market penetration and be a growth catalyst for the companies involved. Blockchain Technology Analyst The move to leverage Aptos, known for its scalable blockchain infrastructure which is important for the high demand of institutional finance, signals a technological leap forward. Aptos' use of the Move smart contract language offers enhanced security features, including formal verification, which mitigates the risk of smart contract vulnerabilities that have plagued other blockchain platforms.Digital Asset Controls and embedded features for KYC and AML are pivotal for regulatory compliance and are likely to build trust with institutions wary of the historically unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies. These tools could set a new standard for institutional-grade digital asset management and could be highly influential in future regulatory frameworks surrounding digital assets. Market Research Analyst The collaboration aligns with the growing trend of tokenization and the shift towards decentralized finance in the traditional financial sector. Given Brevan Howard's background in investment expertise, their involvement suggests a deepening of institutional interest in digital currency and asset management at scale. This interest from a major investment firm reflects a broader industry trend that could drive adoption and growth in related financial technology sectors.Furthermore, the ability for traditional financial giants to unlock the liquidity of tokenized assets and explore the uncollateralized lending market could transform the landscape of institutional capital flow. Retail investors should observe the evolving digital assets space, as these developments may alter the dynamics of asset management and investment strategies. 04/18/2024 - 10:18 PM SEOUL, South Korea, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SK Telecom (NYSE:SKM, ""SKT"") today announced a collaboration with Aptos Labs, Brevan Howard, and Microsoft to deliver to the global financial market Aptos Ascend, a suite of end-to-end institutional solutions including a permissioned network and Digital Asset Controls powered by SKT's Wallet-as-a-Service product and the scalable, secure Aptos blockchain.

Financial Analyst Cumulus Media's report of preliminary financials indicating a net revenue decrease compared to the previous year points to potential challenges in the company's operations or market dynamics. The projected net loss shows a significant improvement year-over-year, possibly reflecting effective cost management or one-off expenses in the previous period. However, the dip in Adjusted EBITDA, a key measure of profitability which strips out non-operating costs, suggests that core business performance might be under pressure.From a shareholder's perspective, revenue contraction and EBITDA declines can signal headwinds, be they from competitive pressures, market saturation, or operational inefficiencies. While the narrower loss could be seen as a positive, it's essential to scrutinize the underlying causes. For example, was this due to a reduction in interest expenses, or perhaps a lower tax burden? These factors have different implications for long-term financial health and can guide investors on whether this represents a sustainable trend or a temporary fluctuation. Market Analyst Analyzing the broader media market, we must consider the trends affecting the industry – such as shifts in advertising spending, consumer media consumption habits and the impact of digital disruption. If Cumulus Media's revenues are falling in a market where competitors are growing, this might indicate market share loss. Conversely, if the whole sector is facing headwinds, the company's performance might reflect wider industry challenges. The details surrounding these preliminary results will be important to understand.Investors should also examine the consistency of the company's revenue streams. Are they reliant on cyclical advertising contracts, or do they have diversified income sources like subscriptions or syndication deals? A blend of recurring and transactional revenue can buffer the impact of market fluctuations and should be a part of the investment consideration. 04/18/2024 - 09:36 PM ATLANTA, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cumulus Media Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure We utilize a certain financial measure that is not prepared or calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial performance and profitability. Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (""Adjusted EBITDA"" or ""EBITDA"") is the financial metric by which management and the chief operating decision maker allocate resources of the Company and analyze the performance of the Company as a whole. Management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of our core operations to the funding of our corporate resources utilized to manage our operations and the funding of our non-operating expenses including debt service and acquisitions. In addition, consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our Refinanced Credit Agreement. In determining Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude the following from net loss: interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gain or loss on the exchange, sale, or disposal of any assets or stations or early extinguishment of debt, restructuring costs, expenses relating to acquisitions and divestitures, non-routine legal expenses incurred in connection with certain litigation matters, and non-cash impairments of assets, if any. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with GAAP, is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a media company and for comparing the operational and financial performance among media companies. Management has also observed that Adjusted EBITDA is routinely utilized to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for media companies. Given the relevance to our overall value, management believes that investors consider this metric to be extremely useful. We refer to Adjusted EBITDA as the ""Non-GAAP Financial Measure."" The Non-GAAP Financial Measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss, net revenue, operating (loss) income, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the Company’s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Non-GAAP Financial Measure may be defined or calculated differently by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

Settlement of the Exchange Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

Positive None. Negative Net interest income decreased by $1.1 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, and by $2.9 million compared to the same quarter a year ago, reflecting challenges in interest income on loans and increased expenses. Noninterest income decreased by $615,000 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, but increased by $501,000 compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to changes in gain on equity securities and income on investments. Noninterest expenses increased by $997,000 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter, but decreased by $458,000 compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly driven by salaries, employee benefits, and other expenses. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2024 was $252,000, compared to provisions of $2.3 million in the previous quarter and $275,000 in the same quarter last year. Net charge-offs totaled $3.4 million during the first quarter of 2024. Financial Analyst The reported first quarter earnings for BayCom Corp reveal a noteworthy year-over-year decline of 18.3% in net income, which is significant as it may indicate potential challenges in the bank's profitability, especially when juxtaposed with the previous year's stronger performance. This net income decline is primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and noninterest income, as well as an increase in noninterest expenses, despite a reduction in provision for credit losses and provision for income taxes.From an investor perspective, the dip in earnings reflects increased deposit costs coupled with reduced loan demand. This is a classic banking industry challenge that echoes broader economic trends such as interest rate fluctuations and market competition. Paying close attention to the bank's strategies for managing operating costs and its commitment to share repurchases and cash dividends could offer insights into long-term value creation.Another key aspect to consider is the net interest margin (NIM) compression from 4.26% to 3.72% year-over-year. NIM is a fundamental metric for banks as it measures the difference between interest income generated and the amount of interest paid out to lenders, relative to the amount of their interest-earning assets. A shrinking NIM in a rising rate environment suggests that the cost of funds is increasing at a faster pace than the yield on assets, which could be a concern for future profitability. Market Research Analyst Examining the decline in BayCom's first quarter loan portfolio by 7.9% from the previous year should raise questions about the bank's market position and growth strategy, especially in the face of reduced loan demand. This may suggest a need for the institution to diversify its loan products or explore new markets to offset the downward trend.Investors should also monitor the increase in nonperforming loans, as this could be an early sign of credit quality issues, despite the reassurance from the CEO that there are no systemic credit weaknesses observed. Credit quality is a fundamental indicator of a bank's health and risk management efficacy, so any changes in this area merit close attention. Investment Securities Specialist While the overall decrease in earnings could be concerning, the consistent performance in interest income on investment securities, with a 19.3% increase from the first quarter of the previous year, serves as a silver lining. This shows a degree of resilience in the bank's investment portfolio, which could provide some stability to the income statement amidst the other financial headwinds.The detailed disclosures of interest income sources, including federal funds and dividends from Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, are noteworthy. The increase in cash dividends by 25.3% compared to the first quarter of the previous year points to a healthy income stream, which could buffer against the volatility in loan and deposit interest income. 04/18/2024 - 04:30 PM WALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BayCom Corp (“BayCom” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: BCML), the holding company for United Business Bank (the “Bank” or “UBB”), announced earnings of $5.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to earnings of $6.4 million, or $0.55 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $7.2 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2023. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased $521,000, or 8.1%, primarily as a result of a $1.1 million decrease in net interest income, a $615,000 decrease in noninterest income and a $997,000 increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in provision for credit losses and a $138,000 decrease in provision for income taxes. Net income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 decreased $1.3 million, or 18.3%, primarily as a result of a $2.9 million decrease in net interest income partially offset by a $501,000 increase in noninterest income, a $458,000 decrease in noninterest expenses, and a $554,000 decrease in provision for income taxes. George Guarini, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our financial results for the first quarter of 2024 reflect the continuation of many of the challenges we faced in 2023, including increased deposit costs and reduced loan demand. Overall, our financial condition has remained strong, with no observed systemic credit weakness, and our earnings have remained stable.” Looking ahead, Guarini expressed cautious optimism, stating, ""While we approach the remainder of 2024 with some reservation, we remain hopeful for opportunities ahead. Though we anticipate continued challenges in loan demand and M&A prospects, we are confident in our ability to navigate these uncertainties. We remain vigilant in managing operating costs during these times of economic uncertainty and remain committed to strategically repurchase shares and provide cash dividends, reinforcing our dedication to delivering long-term value for both our clients and shareholders.""

The increases in average yield earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter a year ago reflect rising market interest rates. Interest income on loans, including fees, decreased $909,000, or 3.5%, from the prior quarter to $25.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $26.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a one basis point decrease in the average loan yield and a $35.3 million decrease in the average balance of loans. Interest income on loans, including fees, decreased $998,000, or 3.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $26.3 million for three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to a $121.5 million decrease in the average balance of loans, partially offset by an eight basis point increase in the average loan yield. The average balance of loans was $1.9 billion for both the first quarter of 2024 and fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $2.0 billion for the first quarter of 2023. The average yield on loans was 5.32% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 5.33% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 5.24% for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in the average yield on loans from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 was due in part to reversal of interest on new non-accrual loans during the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the average yield on loans from the first quarter of 2023 was due to the impact of increased rates on variable rate loans as well as new loans being originated at higher market interest rates. Interest income on loans included $98,000, $29,000, and $97,000 in accretion of the net discount on acquired loans for the three months ended March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. The balance of the net discounts on these acquired loans totaled $392,000, $354,000, and $371,000 at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively. Interest income included fees related to prepayment penalties of $176,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $27,000 and $269,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Interest income on investment securities remained at $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased $316,000, or 19.3%, from $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average yield on investment securities decreased five basis points to 4.24% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 4.29% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased 72 basis points from 3.52% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance of investment securities totaled $185.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $181.0 million and $189.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2024, we received $416,000 in cash dividends on our FRB and FHLB stock, up 6.7% from $390,000 received in the fourth quarter of 2023 and up 25.3% from $332,000 received in the first quarter of 2023. Interest income on federal funds sold and interest-bearing balances in banks increased $435,000, or 11.8%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased $2.3 million, or 125.0%, from $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as a result of an increase in the average yield and average balance. The average yield on federal funds sold and interest-bearing balances in banks increased two basis points to 5.48% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 5.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased 92 basis points from 4.56% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance of federal funds sold and interest-bearing balance in banks totaled $302.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $267.3 million and $162.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in average balance during the current quarter compared to the prior quarter and the same quarter one year ago was due to higher retained cash balances as a result of lower new loan production. Interest expense increased $672,000, or 7.8%, to $9.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $8.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and increased $4.5 million, or 94.6%, compared to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting higher funding costs primarily related to increased rates of interest on our deposits due to higher market rates. The average balance of deposits totaled $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2024, fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2023. The average cost of funds for the first quarter of 2024 was 2.40%, compared to 2.21% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 1.35% for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the average cost of funds during the current quarter compared to the prior quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023 was due to higher interest rates paid on money market and time deposits due to increased competition and pricing pressures and a change in deposit mix due to a shift of deposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to higher costing money market and time deposits. The average cost of deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 1.55%, compared to 1.40% for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and 0.71% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $16.3 million, or 2.49%, to $639.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $656.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and decreased $102.3 million, or 13.8%, compared to $742.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Annualized net interest margin was 3.72% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 3.86% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.26% for first quarter of 2023. The average yield on interest earning assets for the first quarter of 2024 decreased one basis point and increased 21 basis points over the average yields for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively, while the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities for first quarter of 2024 increased 19 basis points and 105 basis points over the average rates paid for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. Net interest margin in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was negatively impacted by increasing funding costs which outpaced, on a percentage basis, increasing yields on investment securities and on fed funds sold and interest-bearing balances in banks, and decreasing yields on loans and accretion of the net discount. Accretion of the net discount had a minimal impact on the average yield on loans during the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to seven basis point increase in the average yield on loans during the first quarter of 2023. The Company recorded a $252,000 provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2024, compared to provision for credit losses of $2.3 million and $275,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023, respectively. The provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2024 was mainly driven by a replenishment of the allowance, partially offset by decreases in outstanding loan balances, leading to lower quantitative reserves. Net charges-offs totaled $3.4 million during the first quarter of 2024, of which $3.2 million was specifically reserved for at December 31, 2023. No changes were made to the qualitative risk factor conclusions during the first quarter of 2024. The quantitative reserve was impacted by improvement in forecasted economic conditions, specifically, national unemployment and national gross domestic product, both of which are key indicators utilized to estimate credit losses. Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased $615,000, or 23.0%, to $2.1 million compared to $2.7 million in the prior quarter of 2023, and increased $501,000, or 32.1%, compared to $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in noninterest income for the current quarter compared to the prior quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $373,000 decrease in gain on equity securities as a result of deterioration in fair value adjustments on these securities, a $188,000 decrease in income on investment in a Small Business Investment Company (“SBIC”) fund, and a $53,000 decrease in loan servicing fees and other fees. The increase in noninterest income for the current quarter compared to the same quarter in 2023 was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in gain on equity securities, partially offset by a $519,000 decrease in income on an investment in SBIC fund and a $412,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 increased $997,000, or 6.6%, to $16.1 million compared to $15.1 million for the prior quarter of 2023, and decreased $458,000, or 2.8%, compared to $16.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense for current quarter compared to the prior quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of a downward adjustment to bonus accruals during the prior quarter of 2023, a $130,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense, partially offset by a $219,000 decrease in other expense due to decreased professional fees. The decrease in noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to a $1.0 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of a $675,000 decrease in bonus accrual, decrease in full-time equivalent employees, and reduction in deferred loan origination expenses, partially offset by wage increases during 2024. This decrease was partially offset by a $288,000 increase in data processing expense due to decline in pricing credits offered and expense relating to enhancements to the Bank’s network, a $127,000 increase in other expense due to increased FDIC insurance costs and professional fees, and a $127,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense. The provision for income taxes decreased $138,000, or 5.7%, to $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and decreased $554,000, or 19.6%, from $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 27.9%, compared to 27.3% for the prior quarter of 2023 and 28.2% for the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate remained consistent with the prior quarter of 2023 and was lower compared to the first quarter of 2023 due to higher low income housing tax credits. Loans and Credit Quality Loans, net of deferred fees, decreased $41.1 million and $157.8 million from December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively, and totaled $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, compared to $2.0 billion at March 31, 2023. The decrease in loans from March 31, 2023 primarily was due to $72.4 million of loan repayments, including $834,000 in Small Business Administration (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection (“PPP”) loan repayments, partially offset by $32.0 million of new loan originations during the current quarter. At March 31, 2024, there were $2.9 million in PPP loans outstanding compared to $3.8 million at December 31, 2023, and $5.9 million at March 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, consisting solely of non-accrual loans, totaled $16.5 million, or 0.64% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $13.0 million, or 0.67% of total loans, at December 31, 2023, and $13.1 million, or 0.64% of total loans, at March 31, 2023. The increase in nonperforming loans from the prior quarter-end was primarily due to six new loans placed on non-accrual during the current quarter totaling $7.3 million, partially offset by partial charge-offs of two non-accrual loans totaling $2.9 million, charge-offs of five non-accrual loans totaling $435,000 and, to a lesser extent, pay-offs of five non-accrual loans totaling $305,000. The portion of nonaccrual loans guaranteed by government agencies totaled $2.2 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $740,000 and $818,000 at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. There were no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing and in the process of collection at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023. Accruing loans past due between 30 and 89 days at March 31, 2024, were $2.6 million, compared to $4.8 million at December 31, 2023, and $12.4 million at March 31, 2023. The decrease in accruing loans past due between 30-89 days at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to timing of borrower payments. The decrease in accruing loans past due between 30-89 days at March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023, was primarily due to one $4.7 million multifamily commercial real estate loan which was past due in the same quarter a year ago and was placed on non-accrual during the current quarter, and due to timing of borrower payments. At March 31, 2024, the Company’s allowance for credit losses for loans was $18.9 million, or 1.00% of total loans, compared to $22.0 million, or 1.14% of total loans, at December 31, 2023 and $20.4 million, or 1.00% of total loans, at March 31, 2023. We recorded net charge-offs of $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net charge-offs of $150,000 in the prior quarter of 2023 and net charge-offs of $315,000 in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in net charge-offs during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due to activity in the current quarter. This activity involved partial charge-offs of two non-accrual loans totaling $2.9 million, as well as complete write-offs of five non-accrual loans totaling $435,000. These actions were taken due to collateral shortfalls deemed uncollectable. As of March 31, 2024, acquired loans net of their discount totaled $200.4 million with a remaining net discount on these loans of $392,000, compared to $215.2 million of acquired loans with a remaining net discount of $354,000 at December 31, 2023, and $247.9 million of acquired loans with a remaining net discount of $371,000 at March 31, 2023. The net discount includes a credit discount based on estimated losses on the acquired loans, partially offset by a premium, if any, based on market interest rates on the date of acquisition. Deposits and Borrowings Deposits totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023. The deposit mix shifted, in part, due to interest rate sensitive clients moving a portion of their non-operating deposit balances from lower costing deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, into higher costing money market and time deposits. At March 31, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $630.0 million, or 29.4% of total deposits, compared to $646.3 million, or 30.3% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023, and $705.9 million, or 33.2% of total deposits, at March 31, 2023. We consider our deposit base to be seasoned, stable and well-diversified, and we do not have any significant industry concentrations among our non-insured deposits. We also offer an insured cash sweep product (ICS) that allows customers to insure deposits above FDIC insurance limits. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our average deposit account size (excluding public funds), calculated by dividing period-end deposits by the population of accounts with balances, was approximately $58,100 and $58,700, respectively. The Bank has an approved secured borrowing facility with the FHLB of San Francisco for up to 25% of total assets for a term not to exceed five years under a blanket lien of certain types of loans, with no FHLB advances outstanding at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 or March 31, 2023. The Bank has Federal Funds lines with four corresponding banks with an aggregate available commitment on these lines of $65.0 million at March 31, 2024. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines at March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 or March 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Bank was approved for discount window advances with the FRB of San Francisco secured by certain types of loans. At March 31, 2024 the Bank had no FRB of San Francisco advances outstanding. At March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding junior subordinated debt, net of fair value adjustments, related to junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures assumed in connection with its previous acquisitions totaling $8.6 million, compared to $8.5 million at March 31, 2023. At March 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding subordinated debt, net of costs to issue, totaling $63.6 million, compared to $63.9 million and $63.8 million at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, the Company had no other borrowings outstanding. Shareholders’ Equity Shareholders’ equity totaled $314.2 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $312.9 million at December 31, 2023, and $313.5 million at March 31, 2023. The increase at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023, reflects $5.9 million of net income during the current quarter and a $484,000 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of taxes, partially offset by repurchases of $4.0 million of common stock and $1.2 million of accrued cash dividends payable. At March 31, 2024, 161,632 shares remained available for future repurchases under the Company’s current stock repurchase plan. The increase to shareholders’ equity for activity during the three months March 31, 2024, as compared to activity during three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily was due to a $1.8 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in net income.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures: In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles utilized in the United States (“GAAP”), this earnings release contains tangible book value per share and tangible equity to tangible assets, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common shareholders’ equity by the number of common shares outstanding at the end of the period. Tangible equity and tangible common shareholders’ equity exclude intangible assets from shareholders’ equity, and tangible assets exclude intangible assets from total assets. For these financial measures, the Company’s intangible assets are goodwill and core deposit intangibles. The Company believes that these measures are consistent with the capital treatment by our bank regulatory agencies, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios, and presents these measures to facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company’s capital over time in comparison to its peers. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

Financial Analyst The announcement of Ansys releasing its first-quarter earnings is a precursor to evaluating the company's financial health. Given the suspension of quarterly earnings calls and guidance, investors should rely on the 10-Q filing for a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance. The lack of forward-looking statements from the company warrants a closer examination of the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement for indicators of financial stability, particularly in the context of the upcoming acquisition by Synopsys. The acquisition details suggest a significant premium for Ansys shareholders, a move that usually indicates confidence in Ansys' intrinsic value and future potential. However, investors should scrutinize the terms of the acquisition to understand the immediate and future financial implications, such as the impact on their portfolio's diversification, tax considerations from the cash payout and the potential for dilution from the stock component of the deal. Mergers & Acquisitions Analyst The acquisition of Ansys by Synopsys represents a transformative event with the potential to reshape the competitive landscape within the simulation and analysis industry. It is imperative to dissect the strategic rationale behind the deal. Combining Synopsys' capabilities in semiconductor electronic design automation with Ansys' simulation expertise could drive synergies and unlock new revenue streams, positioning the merged entity at the forefront of silicon to systems design solutions. While the transaction is poised to create a new industry leader, it is essential to be cognizant of the regulatory hurdles the deal might face, which could affect the timeline and even the finalization of the acquisition. Furthermore, the impact on Ansys' stock price leading up to the transaction's close should be monitored, as it may fluctuate based on market sentiment, regulatory news and Synopsys' stock performance. 04/18/2024 - 04:30 PM PITTSBURGH, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ANSYS, Inc.

Financial Analyst Evaluating the initial public offering (IPO) of Tungray Technologies Inc, several financial elements merit attention. The pricing of shares at $4 suggests a modest capital raising effort, aiming for gross proceeds of $5 million. This capital infusion could be pivotal for a company in the niche market of industrial manufacturing solutions, specifically servicing OEMs in the tech sector. Tungray's IPO is relatively small compared to industry giants, but it's a strategic move that might allow for more focused investments and potentially less volatility. The firm commitment from the underwriters indicates confidence in Tungray's potential. Furthermore, the additional allotment option of 187,500 shares provides a buffer that could cover over-allotments, stabilizing the stock post-listing. Investors should be mindful of the company's future filings and performance metrics as they provide insights into the company's operations and market acceptance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Tungray's entry into the public domain could signal an increased investor focus on the specialized industrial manufacturing sector. As the company serves key tech-oriented OEMs, its performance will be a litmus test for the sector's growth trajectory. The semiconductor industry, one of their sectors served, is known for its cyclical nature; hence, investor sentiment may be swayed by overarching market conditions. The modest IPO size implies a conservative approach, which may appeal to investors wary of the risks associated with larger, more speculative offerings. Additionally, with a single book runner in the form of US Tiger Securities, the success of the IPO could influence the perception of smaller investment firms' capabilities in handling public offerings. Securities Lawyer From a legal standpoint, Tungray's IPO process appears to be in compliance with all regulatory requirements, as evidenced by their effective SEC registration. An effective registration is important for transparency and trust with potential investors. The role of US counsel in ensuring compliance with state and federal securities laws cannot be overstated, as any missteps could lead to delays or sanctions. This IPO will serve as a case study for similar companies seeking to go public in the competitive US market. The listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market is strategic, as it targets growth-oriented investors and provides a platform that aligns with Tungray's future expansion goals. 04/18/2024 - 05:35 PM SINGAPORE, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Tungray Technologies Inc (""Tungray"" or the ""Company"" or ""Tungray"") (NasdaqCM: TRSG), a provider of customized industrial manufacturing solutions to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) in the semiconductors, printers, electronics, and home appliances industries, today announced the pricing of its initial public offering (the ""Offering"") of 1,250,000 Class A ordinary shares at a public offering price of $4 per Class A ordinary share, for total gross proceeds of approximately $5 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

FIRST QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS (compared to first quarter 2023, unless otherwise stated) Total commercial loan growth of 8% annualized, compared to 0.4%Earning asset yield of 4.45%, compared to 3.89%Wealth management income increased 19%Nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of 0.09%""Earnings declined year-over-year because of continued interest rate pressure. However, the bank recorded positive results in loans, deposits and wealth management assets as a result of continuing to attract new customers while retaining strong loyalty among our current customers,"" according to Chief Executive Officer Jerome Schwind. ""We've also maintained excellent liquidity and strong credit quality among loan customers, factors that fuel our underlying strength and resilience during continued high interest rates. ""As previously announced, the corporation paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock, which continues to provide an attractive dividend yield for shareholders."" FINANCIAL CONDITION (March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023)Total assets were $2.06 billion at the end of both the first quarter 2024 and year-end 2023, primarily due to loan growth, which were offset by lower balances in cash and securities. Excess cash, security amortization, and strong deposit growth provided the funding for loan growth and borrowing payoffs during the quarter. Total loans grew $16 million to $1.37 billion at the end of first quarter 2024. Total commercial loans, which include advances to mortgage brokers and agricultural loans, increased $18.3 million as the Company selectively expanded its book of business across many industries, but most notably in construction and real estate sectors. Residential loan volume remained stable during the quarter as originations kept pace with paydowns, as well as a few sales in the secondary market. Demand for mortgages remains low given prevailing market rates, housing prices and low inventory. Securities available for sale decreased $10.6 million to $517.6 million at the end of the first quarter 2024, primarily due to amortization from collateralized mortgage obligations and higher unrealized losses on the total portfolio. Unrealized losses on securities totaled $34.8 million, or 6.3% of the portfolio, at the end of the first quarter 2024 versus $31.8 million at year-end 2023, reflecting an increase in market rates. The allowance for credit losses increased $282 thousand to $13.4 million at the end of the first quarter 2024 due to loan growth and specific reserves on a few small commercial loans whose credit ratings were downgraded. Nonaccruing loans increased $301 thousand to $1.3 million, principally due to one commercial credit that is expected to be settled in the near-term. Past due accounts between 30 to 89 days as a percentage of total loans was 0.62% during the first quarter 2024, compared to 0.31% at year-end 2023. The increase primarily is due to a group of customers that typically make payments about 30 days in arrears, which becomes overdue when the 31st day lands on a business day. Accordingly, the increase is not believed to be an indication of deteriorating credit quality. Overall, credit quality remains strong, and there are not any negative trends. Total deposits increased $44.6 million to $1.77 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024. Demand for retail certificates of deposits (CDs) continues based on the rate environment, resulting in a $19.8 million increase in the balance during the quarter. Other interest-bearing deposits increased $40.1 million, which underscores strong relationships the bank continues to build in the communities in which it serves. Demand deposits decreased $15.2 million, which is consistent in seasonal trends in the markets. Additionally, the strong inflow of deposits provided the opportunity to payoff $40.0 million of higher cost Federal Home Loan Bank advances during the quarter. The Company's tangible book value per share was $20.35 as of March 31, 2024, compared to $20.59 on December 31, 2023. Unrealized losses on securities, net of taxes, reduced tangible book value per share by $3.67 and $3.36 at the end of those respective periods. The Bank is considered a ""well-capitalized"" institution, as its capital ratios exceeded the minimum designated requirements. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 8.61%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.10%, and Total Capital Ratio was 13.05% — well above the minimum requirements of 5.0%, 8.0%, and 10.0%, respectively. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (March 31, 2024 to March 31, 2023 quarterly comparison)Net interest margin was 2.78% compared to 3.22% in the first quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a higher cost of funds. The book yield from securities was 2.25% and 2.29% at March 31, 2024 and 2023. The yield includes the effect of the investment of excess cash in shorter term US treasury securities following the COVID pandemic in 2021 and 2022. As a result, these securities will mature over the next 2 to 5 years, and the proceeds are expected to be reinvested in market rate loans and securities. The yield on loans expanded to 5.36% in the first quarter 2024, up from 4.70% in the same quarter of 2023. Approximately 46% of commercial loans are fixed at rates that are lower than current market rates but will contractually reprice to variable rates over the next 3 to 5 years which will improve the overall yield on earning assets. Costs of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.27% from 0.95% in the first quarter 2023, reflecting a higher level of retail CDs and overall deposit relationship pricing. The provision for credit losses was $392 thousand in the first quarter of 2024 and was $41 thousand in the same quarter of 2023. The change was largely due to loan growth and a few specific reserves on commercial loans that were downgraded in the first quarter of 2024. Noninterest income was $3.5 million in the first quarter 2024, up 5% as compared to the same quarter 2023. Customer service fees grew by $68 thousand to $2.0 million as compared to the same quarter of 2023 on a higher number of transactional accounts. Wealth management income increased by $153 thousand to $939 thousand from the prior year quarter due to an increase of $89.2 million in assets under management (AUM). Wealth AUM increased by $19.6 million to $660.6 million from $641.0 million as of fourth quarter 2023 primarily due to new accounts and higher security valuations in the first quarter 2024. Noninterest expense was $12.7 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to $12.2 million in the first quarter 2023. Compensation and benefit expenses increased $426 thousand from the comparative quarter in 2023. The increase reflects annual merit increases and medical claim adjustments totaling $225 thousand.

(“Ascent Solar” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASTI), a U.S. innovator in the design and manufacturing of featherweight, flexible thin-film photovoltaic (PV) solutions, today announced the second and third closings under its previously announced “best efforts” public offering, at a per share offering price of $0.14. 2,550,000 shares of common stock and 11,735,714 Pre-Funded Warrants, representing gross proceeds of $2 million before deducting offering expenses, were sold in the final closing. The Pre-Funded Warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $0.0001 per share of common stock and only expire when such prefunded warrants are fully exercised. The Company previously announced an initial closing under the offering that represented gross proceeds of $3.09 million before deducting offering expenses in gross proceeds. Aggregate gross proceeds from the offering totaled $5.09 million before deducting offering expenses. The net proceeds from of the second and third closings of this offering (i) were utilized to pay $1.8 million to purchase and cancel the remaining 2,798,116 warrants with a current exercise price of $1.76 per share that were issued with our secured notes issued in December 2022, and (ii) the balance will be used for general and administration expenses and other general corporate purposes. As a result of the closings of the public offering, the Company was able to repurchase and cancel a total of 5,596,232 warrants with an exercise price of $1.76 per share that were issued with our secured notes issued in December 2022. The repurchase of the warrants eliminated a substantial potential future issuance of common stock at a substantially reduced price. These warrants would have been adjusted in accordance with their terms to provide for the purchase of 70,554,495 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $0.14, if they had not been repurchased by the Company. The Company believes that the repurchase of these warrants, and the resulting elimination of potential future ratchet adjustments of these warrants, will bring more certainty to the Company’s capital structure and will assist the Company in raising additional capital in the future.

Formally tracking capital-related costs through a memorandum account is an important early step to aid construction and financial recovery of large-scale infrastructure projects, and Cal Water, Group’s largest subsidiary, intends to reapply to track costs through the regulatory process. “Above all, protecting our customers’ health and safety is our highest priority,” said Martin A. Kropelnicki, Group Chairman & CEO. “Although the CPUC rejected our application to include capital costs in our PFAS balancing account, we will proceed with our plans to construct treatment to meet the new federal water quality standard.” Group has long been preparing to comply with the new maximum contaminant levels (MCL) set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month. Although utilities must begin monitoring for certain PFAS by 2027 and comply with the MCLs by 2029, Group has already tested most of its active water sources and believes it is well-positioned to treat any water sources needed across its service areas within the compliance timeframe. Additionally, Group has filed lawsuits to hold PFAS manufacturers financially responsible for the costs of testing and treatment, and is pursuing grants where available, to reduce the financial impact on its customers.

Excluding the prior quarter $6.0 million accrual reduction and the $2.2 million compensation from the Wheatland acquisition, compensation and employee benefit expenses for the current quarter increased $6.2 million, or 8 percent over the prior quarter. Other expense of $30.5 million increased $7.1 million, or 30 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $8.4 million from the prior year first quarter with both increases primarily attributable to increased acquisition-related expenses. Included in other expenses was acquisition-related expenses of $5.7 million in the current quarter, $459 thousand in the prior quarter and $352 thousand in the prior year first quarter. “The Company was excellent in controlling non-interest expenses in a challenging environment including the inflationary pressures that persist,” said Ron Copher, Chief Financial Officer. Federal and State Income Tax ExpenseTax expense during the first quarter of 2024 was $3.8 million, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 52 percent, compared to the prior quarter and a decrease of $8.7 million, or 70 percent, from the prior year first quarter. The effective tax rate in the current quarter was 10.3 percent compared to 12.6 percent in the prior quarter and 16.9 percent in the prior year first quarter. The current quarter decrease in tax expense and the resulting effective tax rate was the result of a combination of increased federal income tax credits and a decrease in pre-tax income. Efficiency RatioThe efficiency ratio was 74.4 percent in the current quarter compared to 65.20 percent in the prior quarter and 60.39 percent in the prior year first quarter. The increase from the prior quarter was principally driven by the increased operating costs, including acquisition-related costs, from the Wheatland acquisition. The increase in the efficiency ratio from prior year first quarter was the combined impact of the expenses related to the Wheatland acquisition and a decrease in net interest income.

Financial Analyst Ecopetrol's filing of its Form 20-F represents a detailed disclosure of the company's financial condition and compliance with international accounting standards. The inclusion of audited financial statements provides transparency into the company's operations, which is critical for investors to assess risk and determine the value of their investment. It is essential to note that the reported data, being consistent with IFRS adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board and audited by Ernst & Young, ensures a recognized level of accuracy and reliability. Investors should scrutinize the growth trends in revenue, profit margins and cash flows, as well as compare these with industry benchmarks. Additionally, the acquisition of a majority stake in ISA hints at strategic expansion, diversifying Ecopetrol's revenue streams and potentially mitigating sector-specific risks. Energy Industry Analyst It's important to contextualize Ecopetrol within the energy sector's dynamics, particularly its dominant presence in Colombia and its operations across the Americas. As the energy market is highly influenced by geopolitical and regulatory factors, the company's position in hydrocarbon production and its expansion into energy transmission and other sectors, paints a picture of a strategy aimed at vertical integration and resilience. Investors should evaluate how Ecopetrol's geographical spread and product diversification might hedge against volatility in oil prices and regulatory changes. Furthermore, the focus on strategic basins in the American continent and diversified operations could present opportunities for growth, leveraging trends in energy demand and infrastructure development. Market Analyst For retail investors, the significance of this 20-F filing extends beyond the raw financials; it embodies Ecopetrol's potential trajectory in a highly competitive industry. Given that the report also contains forward-looking statements, investors need to consider the underlying assumptions behind these projections, such as market conditions and the regulatory environment. Ecopetrol's commitment to complying with reporting standards and its ongoing international expansion efforts suggest a strategic posture to strengthen its market position and deliver shareholder value. However, it's also important for investors to remain cautious about the inherently uncertain nature of business projections and to monitor how external factors, including the volatile nature of energy markets, might influence the company's performance. 04/18/2024 - 08:14 PM BOGOTÁ, Colombia, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ecopetrol S.A.

Financial Analyst Examining Bladex's first-quarter financial performance, the reported $51.3 million net profit signifies a robust 39% year-over-year growth. This positive outcome can be primarily attributed to increased net interest income, which rose 20% year-over-year to $62.9 million and an impressive surge in fee income of 97% compared to the previous year. The rise in fee income suggests an expansion in the bank's transactional capacity and client engagement within its letter of credit business. Equally noteworthy is the 303 basis points increase in annualized return on equity, which now stands at 16.8%, underscoring a strong recurrent operating performance. Reflecting on the bank's operational efficiency, the improvement in the efficiency ratio to 25.2% from last year is an indicator of the bank's ability to manage its expenses relative to its revenue generation. Such financial health can enhance investor confidence in Bladex's stock, considering the bank's reinforced capital position and favorable asset quality, as evidenced by a low level of impaired credits. Market Analyst Bladex's strategic maneuvers, such as new client onboarding and cross-selling, have resulted in a record high in commercial portfolio end-of-period balances, reaching $8,690 million, a 12% annual growth. Additionally, their continuous diversification and the notable 17% year-over-year increase in the investment portfolio contribute to a healthier balance sheet. From a market perspective, the expansion of the bank's credit portfolio and deposit base by 12% and 32% respectively, combined with a solid liquidity position of 17% of total assets, present a stable funding outlook. This could potentially affect the stock's valuation positively due to the implied reduced risk and increased potential for sustained growth. Furthermore, the increased Tier 1 and Regulatory Capital Adequacy Ratios provide a cushion against potential market volatility and enhance the bank's resilience, potentially making Bladex a more attractive investment for risk-averse investors. Risk Management Expert Focusing on asset quality, Bladex's report reveals that a considerable 97% of the credit portfolio is classified as low risk. The stable impaired credits ratio at 0.1% and a high reserve coverage of 6.9 times exhibit a prudent risk management approach. Additionally, the bank's growing Tier 1 Basel III Capital and Regulatory Capital Adequacy Ratios, which now stand at 16.3% and 13.7% respectively, indicate a strong capital buffer that can withstand potential credit losses. These ratios are critical for investors as they provide insight into the bank's overall risk profile and capital adequacy, which is important for understanding the potential volatility and security of their investments. 04/18/2024 - 06:51 PM PANAMA CITY, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A.

Negative None. 04/18/2024 - 04:39 PM INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev., April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Socure, the leading provider of artificial intelligence for digital identity verification, sanction screening, and fraud prevention, today launched its next generation Document Verification (DocV) solution, purpose-built to tackle the rash of stolen identities, spoofing, and highly sophisticated deepfake attacks that are accelerating in their complexity across nearly every segment of the digital economy. Open source generative AI tools have intensified the enablement of easy-to-create fraudulent identities alongside the inexpensively purchased stolen IDs and personally identifiable information (PII) found on the black market. Legacy document verification solutions that aren't investing extensively in R&D are allowing fraudsters to beat their systems using these techniques: tampered headshots, non-live selfie presentation attack, duplicative headshots of the same person across varied PII/documents, mismatch of PII provided in form field vs extracted from document or barcode extraction, substantially different age prediction between headshot and document date of birth, document invalidity, deepfake selfie of true ID owners's face, forged or blurred barcodes, image from a digital screen, repeat device usage across multiple documents in short periods of time and more. Sprinting ahead of these rapidly evolving complexities, many that are used in conjunction with one another in a single attack, Socure has launched a proprietary solution that combats every single dimension of a potential attack at once, making it prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and outright unattainable for the fraudsters to evade detection - all in less than 2 seconds and with no impact to the user experience. This multi-layered defense approach ensures that increasingly complex attacks cannot circumvent the system that now analyzes 1000s of document signals in real-time with a broader view of the identity risk by also analyzing PII, barcode data, device and behavioral intelligence, geolocation, and biometric signals, all resulting in the attainment of Socure's market-leading accuracy. In addition, Socure's next generation DocV alleviates consumer friction concerns presented by typical document and biometric verification solutions, bringing the verification speed down to a P95 of 1.5 seconds, compared to the industry average of more than 30 seconds, with some requiring minutes to return a decision. ""Socure continues to get better and better for our partners with each passing day, improving user experience, accuracy, speed to decision and operational efficiency. The Socure brand is known for continuous innovation as we strive for perfection and this announcement is representative of our continued advances. With generative AI fraud tools in the hands of bad actors, we are seeing attacks at massive scale with the use of incredibly accurate deepfakes and manipulated documents that easily fool legacy biometric and template-based solution providers,"" said Johnny Ayers, founder and CEO of Socure. For example Dave, a Socure neobank customer since 2020, has seen a dramatic 57% increase in DocV auto approval rates resulting in a 21% lift in their overall acceptance rate. Additionally their team has fully automated the experience eliminating the need for manual reviews. It's also important to their business to stay ahead of growing generative AI threats. ""At Dave, it's essential to have strong document verification that allows us to safely accept more good consumers, making Socure a trusted partner in our growth strategy,"" said Stav Gil, Vice President of Platform and Operations at Dave. ""Generative AI fraud attacks will be an ongoing threat in digital banking, and we are excited to continue to partner with Socure as it brings new models to market."" Combatting Generative AI Attacks with Generative AI Solutions - Socure on Offense Deepfake Selfie DetectorIn its most recent innovation cycle, the Socure document verification is shutting down fraudsters who are wielding generative AI tools to spin up sophisticated, hyper-realistic deepfakes that fool legacy document verification checks, mimicking both credentials and the selfies taken to match those IDs. These deepfakes are not discernible to the human eye, and they're outpacing the traditional machine learning models used by most providers in the market. Attacking generative AI for 'bad' with generative AI for 'good', the Socure data science team generated hundreds of thousands of carefully curated deepfakes using more than 20 different AI generators to ensure production of a very realistic diversity of body shapes, ages, skin tones, postures, lighting conditions, backgrounds and ethnicities. These deepfakes train Socure's selfie models to thwart spoofing attacks with incredible precision. See Socure's AI-generated deepfake selfie images here. The deepfake selfie detector is only the newest layer of defense against these robust attacks. Socure also delivers detection for instances in which fraudsters attempt to submit a photo of another image or capture a digital image off a screen, as well as proprietary injection attack detection (with multiple patents having already been filed), which prevent digitally created deepfake selfies from being injected into the capture or verification session. A Barcode Tells a Thousand Words … or ShouldGenerative AI tools have made it possible for fraudsters to recreate driver licenses and ID cards with near perfect visual accuracy, including the barcode. There's a catch – real barcodes tell the story of an identity with encoded PII and built-in security features from the issuing agency. But that's not the case for a fake barcode. Socure's patented fake ID detection technology can identify anomalies in even the most carefully-constructed barcodes. This also addresses the challenge of barcodes that are blurred or difficult to read due to natural wear and tear. Socure's barcode enhancement system takes any unreadable, machine generated or low quality barcode as input and then reconstructs a clean, ""super resolution"" barcode that is easy to read while maintaining the PII originally encoded within. This allows the system to verify front and back consistency, check barcode security compliance with issuing authority standards, and protect against deceptive barcode fraud that can easily fool a human reviewer. Proprietary Predictive Fraud Signals from Across the Socure ID GraphSocure's DocV also stands out in the market because it goes beyond verifying the validity of a presented ID to examine the correlation and risk related to the identity behind the credential - a powerful combinatorial capability unique to Socure. The solution maps and analyzes contextual data on consumers, leveraging insights from Socure's rich identity graph, which provides a view of whether the PII on the credential has been used with other identities, or was historically linked to risk. The solution also fuses device and phone ownership information, behavioral data, PII, and geolocation data with document authenticity analysis, face image comparison, liveness detection, deepfake detection, and barcode detection–all built in-house, making it nearly impossible for a fraudster to create a digital doppelganger. Ideal Use Cases for DocV: Age verification:Incorporates online gaming and gambling, alcohol and cannabis purchases and delivery, online adult content websites with minimum-age requirements, and social media sites requiring parental consent.Driver verification:Validates the legitimacy and age for an individual to engage in a particular activity, including micromobility, car-sharing services, ride-sharing drivers, car rentals, food delivery services, alcohol and cannabis delivery.Identity Verification and KYC for New Applications or High-Risk Transactions:Delivers heightened verification for high risk or irreversible transactions such as wiring a large sum of money or cryptocurrency purchasesStep-up Authentication:Provides a step-up verification process to keep out fraudsters while giving good consumers a secure verification optionTwo and three party marketplace ID verification:Defers fraud in order to build trust between the two or three-parties in a marketplace. Protecting brand reputation and customer trust & safety requires fraud protection, especially when digital interactions become face-to-face such as home rental services and delivery services.Obtain verifiable parental consent:Protects access to social media, gaming, and financial services when parental consent is required on behalf of minors who are not legally allowed to consent for themselves.Accessing government services: Enables the American public to provide proof of government identification when accessing government services in a seamless and friction-free identity verification process.For more information on DocV visit Socure's website or read more in our blog.

(or ""the company"", www.skhynix.com) announced today that it has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with TSMC for collaboration to produce next-generation HBM and enhance logic and HBM integration through advanced packaging technology. The company plans to proceed with the development of HBM4, or the sixth generation of the HBM family, slated to be mass produced from 2026, through this initiative. SK hynix said the collaboration between the global leader in the AI memory space and TSMC, a top global logic foundry, will lead to more innovations in HBM technology. The collaboration is also expected to enable breakthroughs in memory performance through trilateral collaboration between product design, foundry, and memory provider. The two companies will first focus on improving the performance of the base die that is mounted at the very bottom of the HBM package. HBM is made by stacking a core DRAM die on top of a base die that features TSV* technology, and vertically connecting a fixed number of layers in the DRAM stack to the core die with TSV into an HBM package. The base die located at the bottom is connected to the GPU, which controls the HBM. *TSV (Through Silicon Via): An interconnect technology that links upper and lower chips with an electrode that vertically passes through the base logic chip and DRAM chips. There can be thousands of pass-through TSVs depending on the chip design SK hynix has used a proprietary technology to make base dies up to HBM3E, but plans to adopt TSMC's advanced logic process for HBM4's base die so additional functionality can be packed into limited space. That also helps SK hynix produce customized HBM that meets a wide range of customer demand for performance and power efficiency. SK hynix and TSMC also agreed to collaborate to optimize the integration of SK hynix's HBM and TSMC's CoWoS®** technology, while cooperating in responding to common customers' requests related to HBM. **CoWoS (Chip on Wafer on Substrate): A TSMC proprietary packaging process that connects GPU/xPU, a logic chip, and HBM, on a special substrate called an interposer. It is also called 2.5D packaging as the logic chip and the vertically stacked(3D) HBM are integrated into one module which is placed on a horizontal (2D) package substrate ""We expect a strong partnership with TSMC to help accelerate our efforts for open collaboration with our customers and develop the industry's best-performing HBM4,"" said Justin Kim, President and the Head of AI Infra, at SK hynix. ""With this cooperation in place, we will strengthen our market leadership as the total AI memory provider further by beefing up competitiveness in the space of the custom memory platform.""

VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. (“NOVAGOLD” or “the Company”) (NYSE American, TSX: NG) is pleased to publish its 2023 Sustainability Report (“Sustainability Report”) with a focus on our 2023 performance in the areas of environmental stewardship, health and safety, social responsibility and engagement, and corporate governance. “Our 2023 achievements continue to build on the excellent work accomplished in the areas of environmental stewardship, health and safety, social engagement, and corporate governance, by the teams at Donlin Gold and NOVAGOLD over many years in advancing the Donlin Gold project for the benefit of our stakeholders and shareholders. The team’s unwavering commitment to the Company and steadfast dedication to the project, the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region, and Alaska, as well as our Sustainability Committee’s and Board of Directors’ guidance, have been instrumental in successfully advancing this extraordinary asset in western Alaska,” said Greg Lang, President and Chief Executive Officer. Highlights of NOVAGOLD’s 2023 Sustainability Report: As a development-stage mining company, NOVAGOLD focuses primarily on advancing the Donlin Gold project while adopting a long-term approach to sustainability. This year, the Company proudly presents its fourth annual sustainability report, aligned with the GRI framework and TCFD. Our continuous efforts to advance the Donlin Gold project toward construction and eventual operation are fortified by our strong Alaska Native Corporation partnerships with Calista and TKC. Together, our aim is to deliver economic and social benefits to the Y-K region through the environmentally responsible development of the Donlin Gold project. Emphasizing transparency, our focus is on effectively communicating sustainability priorities and ESG performance. Central to NOVAGOLD's ethos is an unwavering focus on sustainable development, where collaboration with local communities minimizes environmental impacts, stimulates economic growth, and sets new industry benchmarks. Consistent with our commitment to transparency and sustainability, since 2020, NOVAGOLD’s annual sustainability reports have highlighted the Company’s significant achievements and dedication to responsible business practices and governance. Collaborative initiatives with Calista and TKC help protect the environment and provide much-needed investment in southwestern Alaska’s indigenous communities. The 2023 sustainability report is available on NOVAGOLD’s website here. About NOVAGOLD NOVAGOLD is a well-financed precious metals company focused on the development of its 50%-owned Donlin Gold project in Alaska, one of the safest mining jurisdictions in the world. With approximately 39 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource categories, inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (541 million tonnes at an average grade of approximately 2.24 grams per tonne, in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories on a 100% basis)1, the Donlin Gold project is regarded to be one of the largest, highest-grade, and most prospective known open-pit gold deposits in the world. According to the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report (both as defined in the footnote below), once in production, the Donlin Gold project is expected to produce an average of more than one million ounces per year over a 27-year mine life on a 100% basis. The Donlin Gold project has substantial exploration potential beyond the designed footprint of the open pit which currently covers three kilometers of an approximately eight-kilometer-long gold-bearing trend. Current activities at the Donlin Gold project are focused on state permitting, engineering studies, community outreach, and workforce development in preparation for the eventual construction and operation of this project. With a strong balance sheet, NOVAGOLD is well-positioned to fund its share of permitting and advancement efforts at the Donlin Gold project.

Positive The total return on Adams Diversified Equity's net asset value for the first quarter of 2024 was 11.2%. The total return on the Fund's shares market price for the same period was 10.5%. For the twelve months ended March 31st, the total return on Adams Diversified Equity's net asset value was 32.6%. The total return on the market price of the Fund's shares for the twelve-month period was 35.2%. The Fund's performance exceeded that of the S&P 500 and Morningstar U.S. Large Blend category in both quarterly and annual terms. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent declaration of a $.05 per share distribution by the Adams Diversified Equity Fund underscores the company's commitment to maintaining a 6% minimum distribution rate. When analyzing the significance of this distribution, one must assess the yield in the context of the current income environment. Given that the S&P 500 dividend yield hovers around 1.6%, the Fund's commitment is quite attractive, potentially leading to increased demand for shares among income-focused investors.The Fund's first quarter performance, showing a total return on net asset value of 11.2%, outpacing the S&P 500 and the Morningstar U.S. Large Blend category, is indicative of effective fund management strategies. Over a 12-month period, this outperformance is even more pronounced, with a net asset value total return of 32.6%, compared to 29.9% for the S&P 500. This suggests that the Fund may be employing a robust investment strategy, potentially involving a mix of growth and value stocks that have been well-positioned to capitalize on market movements. Market Research Analyst From the perspective of market dynamics, the outperformance of Adams Diversified Equity Fund, particularly when it comes to the 35.2% total return on the market price of the Fund's shares over twelve months, is reflective of a bullish sentiment among investors. Market price can often deviate from net asset value in closed-end funds based on investor sentiment, liquidity needs and market volatility. This premium on market price might influence the entry point for new investors, potentially impacting the decision-making process for buying into the Fund.It is also noteworthy that the Fund's performance relative to the Morningstar U.S. Large Blend category suggests a strategic advantage, which could be derived from the Fund's specific asset allocation decisions, sector weighting, or stock selection process. This is an integral point for investors seeking diversified equity funds that consistently outperform their benchmarks and category averages. Retail investors should consider the implications of these performance metrics on the Fund's ability to sustain such distributions and continued growth in net asset value. 04/18/2024 - 07:34 PM BALTIMORE, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of Adams Diversified Equity Fund, Inc.

Financial Analyst The completion of Top Wealth Group Holding Limited's initial public offering is a noteworthy milestone for the company. The offering's size at 2,000,000 ordinary shares and the established price point of US$4.00 per share, adds up to aggregate gross proceeds of US$8 million. This infusion of capital is slated for international expansion, brand promotion and bolstering general working capital, indicating a potentially aggressive growth strategy. The underwriters' 45-day option to purchase an additional 300,000 shares could further cushion the company's fiscal position. However, investors should monitor the company’s deployment of these proceeds against its strategic goals. Given the firm commitment basis of the transaction, the underwriter, here Revere Securities LLC, has taken on the full risk of selling all of the offered shares. It is essential for investors to review the company's SEC filings to understand the underlying financial health and future growth prospects. Market Research Analyst Luxury caviar is a niche market with a relatively inelastic demand, often less sensitive to price changes. Top Wealth's focus on this sector could yield a competitive advantage, especially with their intent to expand internationally. A company's initial public offering can serve as a litmus test of investor confidence and market appetite. The use of proceeds for brand promotion suggests that Top Wealth is seeking to capture a larger share of the luxury market through increased visibility and by potentially building a robust brand identity. Investors should take note of consumer trends within the luxury goods market, as shifts in consumer preferences could influence Top Wealth's performance on the Nasdaq. Additionally, the success of Top Wealth’s expansion strategy may hinge on its ability to understand and adapt to cultural nuances in diverse international markets. 04/18/2024 - 07:00 PM Hong Kong, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Top Wealth Group Holding Limited (the “Company” or “Top Wealth”), a Hong Kong-based supplier of luxury caviar products, today announced the closing of its initial public offering (the “Offering”) of 2,000,000 ordinary shares at a public offering price of US$4.00 per ordinary share.

Looking at non-interest income, an 8.3%> and 16.9%> increase in Wealth Management and Insurance Agency income, respectively, presents a diversified revenue stream, but the pressure on net interest income remains a concern. The dividend declaration of $0.24> per common share is consistent with past payouts, which could reassure income-focused investors about the company's commitment to returning value. Credit Risk Analyst A closer examination of Provident's asset quality indicators such as non-performing loans (NPLs) and the allowance for credit losses—which stand at 0.44%> and 0.98%> of total loans, respectively—reveals a stable risk profile. The slight decrease in NPLs from 0.46%> and a provision for credit losses of $200,000> reflect a managed credit environment. Investors should note the prudent loan growth in the commercial and industrial sector, coupled with enhanced asset quality metrics and an improved economic forecast within the CECL model. However, these positive signs are tempered by the ongoing economic conditions that could influence the performance of loan portfolios.

Provident's report includes merger-related costs of $2.2 million> for Q1 2024. The long-term synergies expected from this merger, such as expanded market reach and economies of scale, can be attractive to investors. However, the short-term drag on earnings due to merger costs and the necessity to keep an eye on the successful integration post-merger will be key to realizing the anticipated value. Retail investors should monitor the progress of the subordinated debt offering—a condition for the merger's completion—and consider the potential impact on the company's capital structure and future earnings. 04/18/2024 - 05:00 PM ISELIN, N.J., April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE:PFS) (the “Company”) reported net income of $32.1 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $27.3 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and $40.5 million, or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net income for the trailing quarter ended December 31, 2023 was negatively impacted by a $3.0 million charge for contingent litigation reserves and a $2.0 million write-down of a foreclosed property. Transaction costs related to our pending merger with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (“Lakeland”) totaled $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with $2.5 million in the trailing quarter and $1.1 million for the respective 2023 period. In addition, prior year earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2023, included a $2.0 million gain recognized from the sale of a foreclosed commercial property.

The increase in funding costs was attributable to a decrease in lower-costing deposits, an increase in average borrowings and unfavorable repricing of deposits, reflective of current market conditions.As of March 31, 2024, the Company's loan pipeline, consisting of work-in-process and loans approved pending closing, totaled $1.08 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.42%, compared to $1.09 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.08% as of December 31, 2023.Asset quality improved in the quarter, as non-performing loans as of March 31, 2024 declined to $47.6 million, or 0.44% of total loans, compared to $49.6 million, or 0.46% of total loans as of December 31, 2023.

The decrease in the provision for credit losses for the quarter was primarily attributable to an improved economic forecast for the current quarter within our Current Expected Credit Loss (""CECL"") model, partially offset by an increase in specific reserves on impaired credits. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans decreased to 0.98% as of March 31, 2024, from 0.99% as of December 31, 2023.Wealth Management and Insurance Agency income increased 8.3% and 16.9%, respectively, versus the same period in 2023.

Anthony J. Labozzetta, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “Our first quarter results reflect strong operating performance and returns despite continuing pressure on funding costs and the net interest margin. Our team has performed admirably to manage through these conditions and continued to deliver exceptional customer service. Additionally, our asset quality remains strong and our credit risk is well managed, with limited exposure to the market segments of greatest concern in the current operating environment.” Regarding the Company's pending merger with Lakeland, Mr. Labozzetta added, “We are delighted that all regulatory approvals required for the merger have been obtained and we are diligently moving forward with our subordinated debt offering which is a required closing condition of the merger. We are excited to complete the closing of the merger promptly to bring together two prominent high performing banks with like-minded cultures, unwavering commitment to employee and customer experience, a dedication to serving our communities, and a keen focus on financial performance and stockholder returns.” Declaration of Quarterly Dividend The Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share payable on May 31, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 29, 2024.

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Net interest income decreased $2.1 million to $93.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $95.8 million for the trailing quarter. The decrease in net interest income reflected one fewer calendar day in the first quarter and a decrease in lower-costing deposits, combined with unfavorable repricing of deposits, partially offset by the favorable repricing of adjustable-rate loans. The Company’s net interest margin decreased five basis points to 2.87% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, from 2.92% for the trailing quarter. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 increased two basis points to 5.06%, compared to the trailing quarter. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 increased nine basis points from the trailing quarter to 2.80%.

Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $200,000 provision for credit losses on loans, compared with a provision for credit losses of $500,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses for the quarter was primarily attributable to an improved economic forecast for the current quarter within our CECL model, partially offset by an increase in specific reserves on impaired credits. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net charge-offs totaled $971,000, or an annualized 4 basis points of average loans, compared with net charge-offs of $863,000, or an annualized 3 basis points of average loans, for the trailing quarter. Non-Interest Income and Expense For the three months ended March 31, 2024, non-interest income totaled $20.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million, compared to the trailing quarter. Insurance agency income increased $2.0 million to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, mainly due to the receipt of contingent commissions and additional business in the current quarter. Wealth management income increased $645,000 to $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, mainly due to an increase in the average market value of assets under management during the period. Additionally, BOLI income increased $173,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to a benefit claim recognized in the current quarter. Partially offsetting these increases to non-interest income, other income decreased $829,000 to $798,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to a reduction in gains on the sale of SBA loans, while fee income decreased $190,000 to $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to decreases in loan related fees and debit card income. Non-interest expense totaled $71.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $3.2 million, compared to $74.5 million for the trailing quarter. Other operating expense decreased $5.3 million to $10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $15.6 million for the trailing quarter, largely due to a prior quarter $3.0 million charge for contingent litigation reserves, combined with a prior quarter $2.0 million write-down of a foreclosed property. FDIC insurance decreased $618,000 to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to the FDIC special assessment of $775,000 recorded in the prior quarter, partially offset with a current quarter FDIC special assessment of $195,000. Additionally, merger expenses related to our pending merger with Lakeland decreased $275,000 to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter. Partially offsetting these decreases in non-interest expense, compensation and benefits expense increased $1.3 million to $40.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $38.8 million for the trailing quarter. The increase in compensation and benefit expense was primarily due to increases in payroll taxes, employee medical benefits, stock-based compensation and salary expense, partially offset by a decrease in the accrual for incentive compensation. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $506,000 provision benefit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, compared to a $1.4 million provision benefit for the trailing quarter. The provision benefits for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for both periods were primarily due to decreases in loans approved and awaiting closing. Additionally, net occupancy expense increased $723,000 to $8.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, largely due to seasonal increases in snow removal costs and Common Area Maintenance (""CAM"") expense. The Company’s annualized adjusted non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets(1) totaled 1.99% for both the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and the trailing quarter. The efficiency ratio (adjusted non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income)(1) was 60.82% for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 61.32% for the trailing quarter. Income Tax Expense For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's income tax expense was $10.9 million with an effective tax rate of 25.3%, compared with income tax expense of $12.5 million with an effective tax rate of 31.3% for the trailing quarter. The decrease in tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with the trailing quarter was largely due to a decrease in taxable income, combined with a discrete item related to deferred taxes on stock-based compensation recorded in the prior quarter and the 2024 sunset of the 2.5% NJ Corporate Business Tax surcharge. This prior quarter discrete item and the sunset of the 2.5% NJ Corporate Business Tax surcharge were also the primary reasons for the decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with the trailing quarter. Three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net income was $32.1 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $40.5 million, or $0.54 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Transaction costs related to our pending merger with Lakeland totaled $2.2 million and $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Net interest income decreased $14.7 million to $93.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $108.3 million for same period in 2023. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in lower-costing deposits and an increase in borrowings, combined with unfavorable repricing of both deposits and borrowings, partially offset by originations of new loans and the favorable repricing of adjustable-rate loans. The Company’s net interest margin decreased 61 basis points to 2.87% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, from 3.48% for the same period last year. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 increased 43 basis points to 5.06%, compared to 4.63% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 126 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 to 2.80%, compared to 1.54% for the first quarter of 2023. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 2.60%, compared to 1.39% for the same period last year. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased $478.8 million to $2.07 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to $2.55 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The average cost of total deposits, including non-interest-bearing deposits, was 2.07% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared with 1.05% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The average cost of borrowed funds for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was 3.60%, compared to 2.48% for the same period last year. Provision for Credit Losses For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $200,000 provision for credit losses on loans, compared with a $6.0 million provision for credit losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was largely a function of the period-over-period improvement in the economic forecast. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net charge-offs totaled $971,000, or an annualized 4 basis points of average loans, compared with net charge-offs of $671,000, or an annualized 3 basis points of average loans, for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Non-Interest Income and Expense Non-interest income totaled $20.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.3 million, compared to the same period in 2023. Other income decreased $2.5 million to $798,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, primarily due to a $2.0 million gain from the sale of a foreclosed commercial property which was recorded in the prior year, combined with a decrease in gains on sales of SBA loans. Fee income decreased $475,000 to $5.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to decreases in commercial loan prepayment fees and deposit fee income. Partially offsetting these decreases in non-interest income, insurance agency income increased $691,000 to $4.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, largely due to an increase in business activity. Wealth management income increased $573,000 to $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2023, mainly due to an increase in the average market value of assets under management during the period, combined with an increase in mutual fund fees. Additionally, BOLI income increased $333,000 to $1.8 million three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due a benefit claim recognized in the current quarter, combined with an increase in equity valuations. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, non-interest expense totaled $71.3 million, an increase of $1.8 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. Compensation and benefits expense increased $1.3 million to $40.0 million for three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $38.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salary expense associated with Company-wide annual merit increases, combined with increases in the accrual for incentive compensation, payroll taxes and employee insurance, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation. Data processing expense increased $1.3 million to $6.8 million for three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $5.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in data processing expense was primarily due to increases in software service, telecommunication and electronic business banking expenses. Merger-related expenses related to our pending combination with Lakeland increased $1.1 million to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. Additionally, FDIC insurance expense increased $335,000 to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a current quarter FDIC special assessment of $195,000, combined with an increase in the assessment rate. Partially offsetting these increases in non-interest expense, other operating expense decreased $729,000 to $10.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to $11.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, largely due to a decrease in professional fees, partially offset by additional expenses related to foreclosed commercial real estate properties. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $506,000 provision benefit for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures, compared to a $739,000 provision charge for the same period in 2023. The $1.2 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the current quarter was primarily due to a decrease in loans approved and awaiting closing. The Company’s annualized adjusted non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets(1) was 1.99% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, compared to 2.00% for the same period in 2023. The efficiency ratio (adjusted non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income)(1) was 60.82% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 51.85% for the same respective period in 2023. Income Tax Expense For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's income tax expense was $10.9 million with an effective tax rate of 25.3%, compared with $14.5 million with an effective tax rate of 26.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease in tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with the same period last year was largely the result of a decrease in taxable income and the 2024 sunset of the 2.5% NJ Corporate Business Tax surcharge, while the decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023, was largely due to the 2024 sunset of the 2.5% NJ Corporate Business Tax surcharge and a decrease in the proportion of income derived from taxable sources. Asset Quality The Company’s total non-performing loans as of March 31, 2024 were $47.6 million, or 0.44% of total loans, compared $49.6 million, or 0.46% of total loans as of December 31, 2023 and $35.5 million, or 0.35% of total loans as of March 31, 2023. The $2.0 million decrease in non-performing loans as of March 31, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, consisted of a $4.6 million decrease in non-performing commercial loans and a $771,000 decrease in non-performing construction loans, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in non-performing multi-family loans, a $794,000 increase in non-performing residential mortgage loans, a $787,000 increase in non-performing commercial mortgage loans and a $127,000 increase in non-performing consumer loans. As of March 31, 2024, impaired loans totaled $40.1 million with related specific reserves of $8.2 million, compared with impaired loans totaling $42.3 million with related specific reserves of $2.9 million as of December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, impaired loans totaled $27.5 million with related specific reserves of $1.4 million. As of March 31, 2024, the Company’s allowance for credit losses related to the loan portfolio was 0.98% of total loans, compared to 0.99% and 0.91% as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for credit losses decreased $771,000 to $106.4 million as of March 31, 2024, from $107.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses on loans at March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to net charge-offs of $971,000, partially offset by a $200,000 provision for credit losses. The following table shows accruing past due loans and non-accrual loans on the dates indicated, as well as certain asset quality ratios.

Foreclosed assets as of March 31, 2024 consisted primarily of commercial real estate. Total non-performing assets as of March 31, 2024 decreased $2.4 million to $58.9 million, or 0.42% of total assets, from $61.3 million, or 0.43% of total assets as of December 31, 2023. Balance Sheet Summary Total assets as of March 31, 2024 were $14.13 billion, a $79.9 million decrease from December 31, 2023. The decrease in total assets was primarily due to a $33.6 million decrease in total investments and a $31.0 million decrease in total loans. The Company’s loan portfolio totaled $10.84 billion as of March 31, 2024 and $10.87 billion as of December 31, 2023. The loan portfolio consisted of the following: March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Dollars in thousands)Mortgage loans: Commercial$ 4,353,799 $ 4,512,411 Multi-family 1,825,888 1,812,500 Construction 711,417 653,246 Residential 1,152,185 1,164,956 Total mortgage loans 8,043,289 8,143,113 Commercial loans 2,514,550 2,442,406 Consumer loans 295,125 299,164 Total gross loans 10,852,964 10,884,683 Premiums on purchased loans 1,439 1,474 Net deferred fees and unearned discounts (11,696) (12,456)Total loans$ 10,842,707 $ 10,873,701 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the loan portfolio had net decreases of $158.6 million of commercial mortgage loans, $12.8 million of residential mortgage loans, and $4.0 million of consumer loans, partially offset by net increases of $72.1 million of commercial loans, $58.2 million of construction loans, and $13.4 million of multi-family loans. All commercial loans, which consist of commercial real estate, multi-family, commercial and construction loans, represented 86.7% of the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2024, compared to 86.5% as of December 31, 2023.

Total investment securities were $2.10 billion as of March 31, 2024, a $33.6 million decrease from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to repayments of mortgage-backed securities, an increase in unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities and maturities and calls of certain municipal and agency bonds, partially offset by purchases of mortgage-backed and municipal securities. Total deposits decreased $193.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $10.10 billion. The decrease in total deposits was primarily due to a decrease in brokered deposits of $98.0 million and a decrease in municipal deposits of $57.0 million. Total savings and demand deposit accounts decreased $129.7 million to $9.07 billion as of March 31, 2024, while total time deposits decreased $64.0 million to $1.03 billion as of March 31, 2024.

Borrowed funds increased $88.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $2.06 billion. The increase in borrowings was largely due to asset funding requirements. Borrowed funds represented 14.6% of total assets as of March 31, 2024, an increase from 13.9% as of December 31, 2023. Stockholders’ equity increased $4.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $1.70 billion, primarily due to net income earned for the period, partially offset by an increase in unrealized losses on available for sale debt securities and cash dividends paid to stockholders. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, common stock repurchases totaled 86,325 shares at an average cost of $14.84 per share, all of which were made in connection with withholding to cover income taxes on the vesting of stock-based compensation.

Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Company evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Company’s industry.

The acquisition provides commercial and operational synergies for LSI, expanding its market presence and customer value proposition. Negative None. Financial Analyst LSI Industries' acquisition of EMI Industries for $50 million represents a strategic consolidation within the commercial lighting and display solutions market. The immediate accretion to LSI's adjusted earnings per share indicates a positive fiscal impact and the anticipated synergy from the transaction suggests potential for margin improvement. With a pro-forma net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.3x and a plan to reduce leverage, the financial structure appears solid, suggesting that management is maintaining a balance between growth and fiscal responsibility.However, it's important to examine the acquisition price relative to EMI's last reported total revenue of $87 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 million. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is roughly 0.57 and the EBITDA acquisition multiple is around 9, which investors should compare against industry benchmarks. The transaction enhances LSI's competitive position in the grocery, convenience store and restaurant markets, broadening its customer base. While the strategy seems coherent with their Fast Forward plan targeting significant top and bottom-line growth, achieving a net sales growth of more than 60% will depend on the successful integration of EMI and the realization of projected operational synergies. Market Research Analyst The merger positions LSI to capitalize on a multi-year investment cycle by expanding its product and services capabilities. The complementary nature of LSI and EMI's customer lists creates cross-selling opportunities which could lead to revenue growth beyond immediate synergies. However, the true test will be in the execution of these cross-selling strategies and whether LSI can effectively leverage EMI’s brand recognition within its existing markets.Furthermore, the market needs to be aware of the risks inherent to business integrations, such as potential culture clashes and the integration of operational processes. While LSI's strategic rationale for the acquisition appears compelling, the company will need to maintain focus on its core competencies while managing the increased complexity of its operation. The challenge lies in preserving EMI's independent brand strength while achieving the efficiencies and market penetration projected in LSI's strategic growth phase. 04/18/2024 - 05:55 PM LSI Acquires EMI Industries for $50 Million in Accretive, All-Cash Transaction Transaction Expands Display Solutions Capabilities Within Grocery, Convenience Store & Restaurant Markets LSI to Host EMI Industries Acquisition Conference Call at 11 a.m. ET on April 19, 2024 CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LSI Industries Inc. (NASDAQ: LYTS, “LSI” or the “Company”), a leading U.S. based manufacturer of commercial lighting and display solutions, today announced the acquisition of privately held EMI Industries (“EMI”) for an all-cash purchase price of $50 million. Florida-based EMI is an award-winning metal and millwork manufacturer of standard and customized fixtures, displays, and food equipment for the convenience store, grocery, and restaurant industries. For more than 40 years, EMI has worked closely with customers to develop innovative custom solutions that drive in-store customer traffic, elevate brand identity, and enhance the shopping experience. EMI serves a diverse, well-established customer base ranging in size from regional brands with several hundred site locations to national and international brands operating thousands of sites. EMI designs and manufactures products from five production facilities across the United States. “LSI continues to build the premier commercial lighting and retail display solutions business in North America,” stated James A. Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The addition of EMI serves to broaden our product and services capabilities within retail fixtures, displays and food equipment. Consistent with our Fast Forward strategy introduced last year, the acquisition positions us to further capitalize on the ongoing, multi-year investment cycle evident across the grocery, refueling/c-store, and restaurant markets. “As we bring together our complementary products, services, and technologies, there are significant cross-selling opportunities that enable us to be a single-source provider to more customers throughout North America,” continued Clark. “The combination represents a major step forward in our ability to serve a growing portfolio of national retail chains that value our integrated, solutions-based approach, which emphasizes quality, reliability, and deep technical expertise.” “EMI has established one of the most respected fixture and equipment brands in our industry,” stated Clark. At LSI, we share EMI’s customer-centric commitment to performance excellence and look forward to leveraging our combined capabilities as we enter the next phase of strategic growth. We are excited to welcome the more than 300 employees and experienced leadership to the LSI team.” Alan Harvill, President and CEO of EMI Industries, stated, “LSI is an industry leader with a proven record of growth and value creation. We are proud to become the newest part of the LSI team and look forward to unlocking the powerful potential of the combined businesses.” Clark concluded, “As outlined within our Fast Forward strategic plan, LSI intends to drive net sales growth by more than 60% between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2028, with approximately half of this growth supported by acquisition-related contributions. Looking ahead, we will continue to develop leading positions within growing, high-value market verticals that expand our capabilities and reach while continuing to scale our solutions-based platform as we drive long-term value creation for our shareholders.” FINANCIAL AND TRANSACTION OVERVIEW In the full year calendar 2023, EMI reported total revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $87.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Upon closing, the transaction will be immediately accretive to LSI on an adjusted earnings per share basis. LSI funded the acquisition of EMI utilizing cash and availability under its existing credit facility. At closing, LSI anticipates that its pro-forma ratio of net debt outstanding to trailing twelve-month adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 1.3x. LSI intends to significantly reduce net leverage within the business during the next 24 months, supported by anticipated growth in pro-forma free cash flow from the combined entities. As part of the transaction, the Company will welcome EMI’s more than 300 employees to LSI, while retaining EMI’s experienced leadership team, including President and CEO Alan Harvill, together with each of its five facilities. Following the closing of the transaction, EMI will remain an independent brand, given its established commercial presence in the market. LSI anticipates EMI will become part of LSI’s display solutions segment on a reporting basis moving forward. COMPELLING TRANSACTION RATIONALE EMI further establishes LSI as a market-leading business of scale within the retail display solutions market. Following the successful acquisition of JSI Store Fixtures in 2021, EMI significantly expands LSI’s presence in the grocery, convenience store and QSR/restaurant verticals. The combined business provides considerable commercial and operational synergies to be realized over the next several years. Business combination provides a one-stop, end-to-end integrated solution to LSI customers. The addition of EMI positions LSI to further enhance its unique value proposition with customers across the full continuum of product design, manufacture, installation, and post-sale support. LSI believes its integrated approach will further entrench its value as a trusted partner equipped to support the full project management lifecycle. Complementary EMI and LSI customer lists provide for significant commercial synergy potential. While the two companies share specific customers, many do not overlap, representing a significant cross-selling opportunity for LSI. The business combination also expands our capability to attract new customers in existing markets. Transaction capitalizes on a multi-year investment cycle within key vertical markets. EMI is one of the largest privately held retail fixture and food equipment companies in the North America, with a diverse base of recurring, long-term customers. LSI believes its acquisition of EMI will position it to further capitalize on the ongoing, multi-year capital investment programs within the convenience store, grocery, and restaurant industries as operators seek to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and behaviors Transaction is immediately accretive to LSI’s adjusted earnings per share. EMI is expected to deliver adjusted earnings per share accretion to LSI upon closing of the transaction, excluding acquisition-related revenue and cost synergies. On a post-synergy basis, LSI believes it will steadily expand EMI’s margin performance in future years, positioning LSI to deliver double-digit EBITDA margin within the legacy EMI business within the first 24 months following the close of the transaction. Transaction is consistent with inorganic growth priorities outlined within LSI’s Fast Forward strategy. LSI’s Fast Forward Strategy seeks to deliver sustained commercial expansion, operational excellence, and disciplined capital allocation, consistent with the Company’s focus on long-term value creation. As outlined within the Fast Forward strategy, LSI remains focused on adding scale and competencies within both new and existing vertical markets. By fiscal year 2028, LSI projects net sales growth of more than 60%, Adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 100% and Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 250+ basis points, or 12.5% of net sales, as supported through a balance of organic and inorganic investments.

Die von Ancora vorgeschlagene Strategie birgt Risiken für Sicherheit und Service, weshalb die Aktionäre dazu aufgerufen werden, für die Kandidaten von Norfolk Southern zu stimmen. Positive Norfolk Southern aims to achieve a sub-60% operating ratio in 3-4 years, targeting 100-150 basis points of improvement in 2024. The company has appointed Alan Shaw as CEO to leverage Precision Scheduled Railroading for revenue and earnings growth. Following a safety incident in 2023, Norfolk Southern has made organizational changes to enhance efficiency and service levels. The company's board has been refreshed with new directors and refined executive compensation plans for accountability. Ancora's proposed strategy threatens safety and service standards, advocating for wholesale changes that could harm long-term shareholder value. Negative Ancora's plan to implement a 'slash-and-burn' strategy could lead to job cuts, safety risks, and reduced shareholder value. The proposed replacement of Norfolk Southern's crisis-tested leadership with inexperienced candidates may negatively impact the company's performance. Ancora's lack of board and safety experience raises concerns about their ability to provide effective oversight and management of the company. Financial Analyst The pursuit of a sub-60% operating ratio by Norfolk Southern indicates aggressive cost management and productivity improvements. A keen investor should consider the historical context; an operating ratio (OR) is a railroad's operating expenses as a percentage of its revenue and a lower OR suggests greater efficiency and profitability. The targeted 400 basis points of productivity savings are substantial, indicating a potential for significant margin improvement.Moreover, the implication of adding operating ratio as a management compensation metric could align executive incentives with shareholder interests more closely, potentially leading to disciplined cost control and operational efficiency. However, investors should be watchful of how this incentive change impacts the company culture and employee morale, as excessive cost-cutting could also lead to service quality issues or safety risks. Risk Management Expert With the recent East Palestine incident, safety overhauls are paramount. Norfolk Southern's strategy to enhance safety standards and reduce the mainline accident rate by 38% is a positive step, potentially mitigating future risk exposure. From a risk management perspective, maintaining safety is not just a regulatory and ethical requirement but also a critical factor in sustaining long-term shareholder value. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these overhauls in preventing future incidents will be important to the company's reputation and operational stability.For investors, it is important to monitor the effectiveness of these safety measures, as recurrent safety issues could lead to regulatory penalties, decreased investor confidence and possible financial setbacks. Norfolk Southern's proactive response to the incident can be seen as a commitment to risk mitigation, instilling investor confidence in the company's governance. Operations and Logistics Analyst The appointment of John Orr, a seasoned expert in Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR), could enhance Norfolk Southern's operational efficiency. PSR is a logistics philosophy that streamlines operations, reduces transit times and can lead to improved profitability for railroads. Orr's influence is already being reported in the form of increased merchandise velocity and reduced terminal dwell times, metrics that indicate a more efficient movement of goods. These operational improvements are significant for investors as they may contribute to enhanced service levels, customer satisfaction and eventually, top-line growth.Investors should watch for how these operational changes affect the company's flexibility and responsiveness, especially in unexpected operational or market conditions. A balance between efficiency gains and the ability to adapt to changing demands is essential for sustainable growth in the logistics sector. 04/18/2024 - 04:30 PM Outlines clear path to close the margin gap with peers by achieving a sub-60% operating ratio in 3-4 years Urges shareholders to vote ""FOR"" ONLY Norfolk Southern's 13 highly qualified nominees on the WHITE proxy card today Identifies safety, service and financial risk of Ancora's ""tear it down to the studs""1 strategy ATLANTA, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) filed an investor presentation Thursday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and sent an accompanying letter to shareholders in connection with its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 9, 2024.

Weighing less than 0.5kg, the Pioneer features a 5Hz geophone, specially designed by Geospace with a small form factor and reduced weight. The Pioneer is able to record continuously 24 hours a day for 50 days and offers rapid recharging and data download times. The carefully designed node provides inductive charging and data transfer as well as improved sensor coupling to dramatically improve the signal to noise ratio delivered. Each node features one GS-5 vertical geophone, battery, 24-bit digitizer, and GPS receiver enclosed in its sealed case. The Pioneer aims to reduce overall operating and ownership costs by lowering the deployment footprint. The benefits of Pioneer’s lower power consumption, smaller size, and less weight result in reduced logistics and lower fuel costs, enabling crews to deploy much faster with greater efficiency. “Demand for land seismic acquisition solutions is growing, driven by factors including increasing exploration and production activities in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs as well as the focus on technologies to aid the energy transition,” said Rick Wheeler, President and CEO. “This is Geospace’s first new land-based product in five years. In the interim, many other low-cost, low-quality land nodes have flooded the market. Time has proven that these cheap non-performant products are exceedingly unreliable for both data quality and operational lifetime. We chose a different path that maintained the superb performance, quality, and reliability for which Geospace is known. Along with listening to our customers’ needs, we took time to gather lessons learned from technology advancements in battery life, sensor performance, and overall technology advances which allowed us to design and manufacture the Pioneer at a cost-competitive price.” Pioneer is fully compatible with the company’s proprietary software package of GeoUtilities, GeoReaper and GeoMerge. By incorporating the power of distributive computing, a single operator interface controls the scalable data collection and delivery needs of any sized crew. About Geospace Technologies Geospace Technologies is a global technology and instrumentation manufacturer specializing in vibration sensing and highly ruggedized products which serve energy, industrial, government and commercial customers worldwide.

Malgré une baisse des revenus de 35,8 % à 6,7 millions de dollars, l'entreprise se concentre sur l'élargissement de sa base de clients, le développement de nouveaux produits de haute technologie et la mise en œuvre de mesures d'économie de coûts.

Dogness (International) berichtete über die Finanzergebnisse für die sechs Monate bis zum 31.

Trotz eines Umsatzrückgangs um 35,8 % auf 6,7 Millionen Dollar konzentriert sich das Unternehmen auf die Erweiterung seiner Kundenbasis, die Entwicklung neuer Hightech-Produkte und die Implementierung von Kostensenkungsmaßnahmen.

Positive Revenue declined by 35.8% to $6.7 million, with significant drops in sales volume and average selling price of intelligent pet products. Revenue from traditional pet products decreased by 23.7%, intelligent pet products by 54.5%, while climbing hooks and other products increased by 5.5%. International sales dropped by 33.7%, and domestic sales decreased by 39.9% due to intense competition and price decreases. Cost of revenues decreased to $5.4 million, with a rise in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues. Negative Revenue decline of 35.8% due to intense competition and trade disputes affecting sales. Significant revenue drops in traditional and intelligent pet products. Decrease in domestic and international sales by 39.9% and 33.7% respectively. Cost-saving measures and merger pursuits to mitigate revenue challenges. Financial Analyst Dogness' significant revenue decline by 3.7 million or 35.8% is a clear indicator of current operational and market challenges. A granular analysis reveals that the intelligent pet products, which faced a 54.5% drop, are significantly impacted. This suggests an aggressive price reduction strategy, which has not sufficed to maintain, let alone increase, revenue streams. The cost of revenues decrease coupled with the decline in revenue indicates a significant reduction in operational scale. Investors should consider the company's ability to reduce costs further without compromising growth potential. In light of the CEO's mention of M&A opportunities, one should be cautious about potential dilution of current shareholder value, as the company could be looking to raise capital or issue new shares to finance such activities. Supply Chain Analyst The steps Dogness is taking to streamline the supply chain and enhance production efficiency are critical given the context of decreasing sales volumes. These efforts may help counterbalance reduced margins by lowering overall production costs. However, this must not distract from innovating and staying competitive in intelligent pet products. Moreover, the increase in climbing hooks sales could indicate a shift towards products with stable demand and better pricing power. The company’s focus on younger consumers aligns with broader market trends, but the effectiveness of these strategies will only be proven in subsequent financial results. Market Analyst Notably, Dogness is experiencing a stronger decrease in international sales compared to domestic sales, which is particularly concerning as it hints at diminished global competitiveness. The trade dispute between China and the United States may exacerbate this situation. The company's strategy to target younger consumers and develop new high-tech products has potential, as this segment is known for valuing innovation and is less price-sensitive. However, the short-term gains from these strategies may be limited if Dogness cannot differentiate sufficiently in a highly competitive market. The increase in service revenue, while small, may signal a strategic pivot to diversify revenue streams, which could be promising if scalable. 04/18/2024 - 04:45 PM PLANO, Texas, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dogness (International) Corporation (""Dogness"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: DOGZ), a developer and manufacturer of a comprehensive line of Dogness-branded, OEM and private label pet products, today announced its financial results for the six months ended December 31, 2023. Silong Chen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dogness, commented, ""We continue to face challenges due to intense competition in the domestic market and the ongoing trade dispute between China and the United States, which are impacting and will likely continue impacting our domestic and export sales in the near future."" ""The decrease in the Company's revenue during the half year ended December 31, 2023 was also partially caused by a significant drop in the average selling price of our intelligent pet products and further affected by decreases in sales volume. To counter the effects of weak sales, we are actively focused on expanding our customer base and exploring new markets by developing more new high-tech products to differentiate us from competitors and meet customer demands. In particular, we are targeting younger consumers who show a strong interest in our smart pet products. We are also implementing cost-saving measures to streamline supply chain processes, enhance production efficiency and improve profit margins."" ""We also target to actively seek merger and acquisition opportunities to capitalize on industry challenges and expand our market presence. By acquiring complementary companies, we can strengthen our industrial chain and exercise greater control over manufacturing costs. Through effective cost control we aim to improve sales performance and margins, so to deliver strong return on investment for our valued shareholders in the near future.""

The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in sales for both domestic and international markets.

The decline was due to a $0.40 decrease in average selling price per unit. ─ Intelligent pet products Revenue from intelligent pet products decreased by $2.7 million or 54.5%, from $4.9 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, to $2.2 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by a $28.40 decrease in average selling price per unit, and more low-value intelligent pet products were sold during the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. ─ Climbing hooks and others Revenue from climbing hooks and other products increased by $39 thousand from $0.7 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022, to $0.8 million in the six months ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to a $0.10 increase in average selling price per unit. ─ Dyeing service For the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company earned approximately $0.1 million and $Nil, respectively, in dyeing service fees. ─ International vs. Domestic sales International sales decreased by approximately $2.3 million or 33.7%, to $4.5 million for the six months ending December 31, 2023, compared to $6.8 million in the same period in 2022. The decline was primarily driven by a significant drop in the average selling price of intelligent pet products during this period. Domestic sales decreased by approximately $1.4 million or 39.9%, from approximately $3.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, to approximately $2.1 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in customer orders caused by intense competition in the domestic market. Cost of revenues was approximately $5.4 million during the six months ending December 31, 2023, compared to around $7.7 million for the same period in 2022. This decrease was due to a significant drop in the average unit cost of intelligent pet products. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues increased by about 6.5 percentage points, reaching 80.4% for the six months ending December 31, 2023, compared to 73.9% in 2022. Gross profit decreased by approximately $1.4 million or 51.7%, to about $1.3 million for the six months ending December 31, 2023, compared to around $2.7 million in 2022. This decline was primarily due to the lower average selling price of our intelligent pet products. The overall gross profit margin was 19.6%, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points from the 26.1% margin achieved in 2022. Total operating expenses decreased by approximately $1.4 million or 21.8%, to about $4.9 million for the six months ending December 31, 2023, compared to around $6.2 million for the same period in 2022. ─ Selling expenses Selling expenses decreased by approximately $1.0 million or 64.8%, from around $1.5 million to about $0.5 million. The decrease was due to reduced marketing research activities. As a percentage of sales, selling expenses were 7.9% in 2023 and 14.4% in 2022. ─ General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses decreased by about $0.3 million or 7.6%, from around $4.2 million to approximately $3.9 million. The decrease was mainly due to lower consultant fees and expenses associated with furnishing the new facility. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 58.0% in 2023 and 40.3% in 2022. ─ Research and development expenses Research and development expenses decreased by $0.1 million or 12.4%, from $0.6 million to approximately $0.5 million. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses were 7.3% in 2023 and 5.3% in 2022. Net loss was approximately $3.2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to approximately $3.0 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increased net loss was the result of decreased sales and gross profit, offset by decreased operating expenses as discussed above.

Das Medikament ist jetzt in den USA für sowohl intravenöse als auch subkutane Anwendungen für die Behandlung von Erwachsenen mit Morbus Crohn und Colitis ulcerosa verfügbar. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent FDA approval of Takeda's ENTYVIO in a subcutaneous form for Crohn's Disease represents a significant advancement in treatment options for patients. The VISIBLE 2 Study data is compelling, showing that a substantial number of patients achieved clinical remission at Week 52. It's essential to understand that clinical remission is defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index score of ≤150, indicating a reduction in disease symptoms and an improved quality of life for patients.From a medical research perspective, the ability to administer maintenance therapy subcutaneously rather than intravenously could increase adherence to treatment protocols due to ease of use and potentially lower overall healthcare costs. It's an important step forward, as Crohn's Disease treatment regimens can be arduous, with many patients struggling with adherence over time. Market Research Analyst Analysing the market implications of ENTYVIO's new administration route, we can anticipate an expansion of the drug's market share. Takeda already has a presence in the gastroenterology space and offering a more convenient administration method could attract patients who value ease and comfort, or who may have limited access to infusion centers.Furthermore, the subcutaneous option may position ENTYVIO favorably against competitors, particularly if it can offer comparable efficacy with enhanced convenience. It's also possible that this FDA approval will drive an uptick in Takeda's stock as investors react to the potential for increased sales volume. Moreover, Takeda's ability to innovate in drug delivery may reflect a broader strategic acumen that could make it a compelling company to watch in the biopharmaceutical sector. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the approval of a new administration form for an existing medication can lead to a significant revenue stream for the company. It's not merely an incremental improvement; it's an expansion in the method of delivery that could lead to wider usage and better patient compliance. Given the chronic nature of Crohn's Disease, long-term maintenance therapies can represent a steady source of income for pharmaceutical companies. The effect on Takeda's bottom line will depend on how quickly they can roll out the subcutaneous option and the extent to which it captures market share from other treatments. Investors should watch prescription trends and insurance coverage decisions closely, as these will be critical determinants of financial success. 04/18/2024 - 07:00 PM − ENTYVIO is Now Available in the U.S. in Both IV and Subcutaneous Administrations for Maintenance Treatment of Adults with Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn’s Disease OSAKA, Japan & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Takeda (TSE:4502/NYSE:TAK) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved ENTYVIO® (vedolizumab) subcutaneous (SC) administration for maintenance therapy in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease (CD) after induction therapy with intravenous (IV) ENTYVIO.1 The subcutaneous administration of ENTYVIO was also approved by FDA in September 2023 for the maintenance treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) and is available in the U.S. as a single-dose prefilled pen (ENTYVIO Pen).* The approval is based on the VISIBLE 2 Study (SC CD Trial), a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which assessed the safety and efficacy of an SC formulation of ENTYVIO as maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD who had clinical response** at Week 6 following two doses of open-label vedolizumab intravenous therapy at Weeks 0 and 2.1 The primary endpoint was clinical remission*** at Week 52, which was defined as a total Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of ≤150. “Crohn’s disease is a complex and usually progressive disease for which an appropriate management plan is critical. My primary goal as a clinician is always to get patients to achieve remission. In VISIBLE 2, about half of patients treated with ENTYVIO SC achieved long-term clinical remission,” said Timothy Ritter, MD, senior medical director, Department of Research and Education, GI Alliance Research and assistant professor of medicine, TCU School of Medicine. “The data from VISIBLE 2 reaffirm the well-established efficacy profile of ENTYVIO, regardless of route of administration.” In VISIBLE 2, a total of 409 patients were randomized at Week 6 in a double-blind fashion (2:1) to ENTYVIO 108 mg administered by SC injection or placebo every 2 weeks.1 Eligible patients included patients who had experienced an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or intolerance to at least one of the following: corticosteroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate), or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers (including primary non-responders). A statistically significant proportion of patients receiving ENTYVIO SC 108 mg maintenance therapy administered every 2 weeks achieved long-term clinical remission*** compared to patients receiving placebo (48% vs. 34%; p<0.01) at Week 52.1 In clinical studies, the ENTYVIO SC safety profile was generally consistent with the known safety profile of ENTYVIO IV, with the addition of injection site reactions (including injection site erythema, rash, pruritus, swelling, bruising, hematoma, pain, urticaria and edema) as an adverse reaction for ENTYVIO SC. The most common adverse reactions reported with ENTYVIO IV (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% higher than placebo) were nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, and pain in extremities. “The approval of subcutaneous ENTYVIO in Crohn’s disease delivers on our goal of providing treatment options that can help patients achieve remission of their ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, while also providing them flexibility and choice of route of administration. With ENTYVIO Pen, patients have the option of administering their maintenance treatment at home or on the go,” said Brandon Monk, senior vice president, head, U.S. Gastroenterology Business Unit, Takeda. “Our development of a subcutaneous option demonstrates Takeda’s commitment to meeting the very real needs of those living with gastrointestinal diseases.” *Please refer to “U.S. FDA Approves Subcutaneous Administration of Takeda’s ENTYVIO® (vedolizumab) for Maintenance Therapy in Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis”, dated September 27, 2023. **Clinical response is defined as a ≥70-point decrease in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score from baseline (Week 0).1 ***Clinical remission is defined as CDAI score of ≤150 at Week 52.1 Takeda does not expect a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of this approval. About ENTYVIO (vedolizumab) Vedolizumab is a biologic therapy and is approved for intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administration (approvals vary by market).1,2 Vedolizumab SC has been granted marketing authorization in the United States, European Union and more than 50 countries. Vedolizumab IV has been granted marketing authorization in more than 70 countries, including the United States and European Union. Globally, vedolizumab IV and SC have more than one million patient years of exposure to date.3 Vedolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to specifically antagonize the alpha4beta7 integrin, inhibiting the binding of alpha4beta7 integrin to intestinal mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1).4 MAdCAM-1 is preferentially expressed on blood vessels and lymph nodes of the gastrointestinal tract.5 The alpha4beta7 integrin is expressed on a subset of circulating white blood cells.4 These cells have been shown to play a role in mediating the inflammatory process in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.4,6,7 By inhibiting alpha4beta7 integrin, vedolizumab may limit the ability of certain white blood cells to infiltrate gut tissues.4 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS ENTYVIO is contraindicated in patients who have had a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to ENTYVIO or any of its excipients. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Infusion-Related and Hypersensitivity Reactions: Infusion-related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, dyspnea, bronchospasm, urticaria, flushing, rash, and increased blood pressure and heart rate have been reported. These reactions may occur with the first or subsequent infusions and may vary in their time of onset from during infusion or up to several hours post-infusion. If anaphylaxis or other serious infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue administration of ENTYVIO immediately and initiate appropriate treatment. Infections: Patients treated with ENTYVIO are at increased risk for developing infections. Serious infections have been reported in patients treated with ENTYVIO, including anal abscess, sepsis (some fatal), tuberculosis, salmonella sepsis, Listeria meningitis, giardiasis, and cytomegaloviral colitis. ENTYVIO is not recommended in patients with active, severe infections until the infections are controlled. Consider withholding ENTYVIO in patients who develop a severe infection while on treatment with ENTYVIO. Exercise caution in patients with a history of recurring severe infections. Consider screening for tuberculosis (TB) according to the local practice. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML, a rare and often fatal opportunistic infection of the central nervous system (CNS), has been reported with systemic immunosuppressants, including another integrin receptor antagonist. PML typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised. One case of PML in an ENTYVIO-treated patient with multiple contributory factors has been reported. Although unlikely, a risk of PML cannot be ruled out. Monitor patients for any new or worsening neurological signs or symptoms that may include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing with ENTYVIO and refer to neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue ENTYVIO dosing permanently. Liver Injury: There have been reports of elevations of transaminase and/or bilirubin in patients receiving ENTYVIO. ENTYVIO should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or other evidence of significant liver injury. Live and Oral Vaccines: Prior to initiating treatment with ENTYVIO, all patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations according to current immunization guidelines. Patients receiving ENTYVIO may receive non-live vaccines and may receive live vaccines if the benefits outweigh the risks. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥3% and ≥1% higher than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, headache, arthralgia, nausea, pyrexia, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, cough, bronchitis, influenza, back pain, rash, pruritus, sinusitis, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremities, and injection site reactions with subcutaneous administration. DRUG INTERACTIONS Because of the potential for increased risk of PML and other infections, avoid the concomitant use of ENTYVIO with natalizumab products and with TNF blockers. Upon initiation or discontinuation of ENTYVIO in patients treated with CYP450 substrates, monitor drug concentrations or other therapeutic parameters, and adjust the dosage of the CYP substrate as needed. INDICATIONS Adult Ulcerative Colitis (UC): ENTYVIO is indicated in adults for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC. Adult Crohn’s Disease (CD): ENTYVIO is indicated in adults for the treatment of moderately to severely active CD.

About Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) are two of the most common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).8 Both UC and CD are chronic, relapsing, remitting, inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.9,10 UC only involves the large intestine as opposed to CD, which can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus.11,12 CD can also affect the entire thickness of the bowel wall, while UC only involves the innermost lining of the large intestine.11,12 UC can present with symptoms of abdominal discomfort or loose bowel movements, including blood.11,13 CD can present with symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.12 The cause of UC or CD is not fully understood; however, research suggests that an interplay between environmental factors, genetics, and intestinal microbiota may contribute to the development of UC or CD.11,14,9 Takeda’s Commitment to Gastroenterology With this latest milestone, Takeda continues to demonstrate a commitment to meeting the very real needs of those living with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases.

Negative None. 04/18/2024 - 04:35 PM – Approval based on Phase III ALINA study showing Alecensa reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by an unprecedented 76% in people with ALK-positive early-stage resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – – This approval helps address an urgent unmet need, with about half of people living with early-stage NSCLC experiencing disease recurrence following surgery, despite adjuvant chemotherapy – – The National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Guidelines recommend routine testing for ALK, EGFR and PD-L1 biomarkers in people with early-stage NSCLC to inform adjuvant therapy selection – SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Alecensa® (alectinib) for adjuvant treatment following tumor resection for patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (tumors ≥ 4 cm or node positive), as detected by an FDA-approved test. Alecensa is now the first and only ALK inhibitor approved for people with ALK-positive early-stage NSCLC who have undergone surgery to remove their tumor. “With an unprecedented 76% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death versus chemotherapy, Alecensa significantly improves upon the standard of care for people with early-stage ALK-positive lung cancer,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. “At Genentech, our goal is to give patients the best chance of cure by bringing effective, targeted treatments to early-stage disease before their cancer has spread. This approval brings us one step closer to achieving that mission.” “The approval of Alecensa marks a pivotal moment for people newly diagnosed with early-stage ALK-positive lung cancer, who until now, were not able to receive ALK-specific therapy,” said Ken Culver, Director of Research and Clinical Affairs at ALK Positive, Inc. “These patients, who are typically diagnosed at a younger age, often face recurrence and have a higher risk of developing brain metastases than those with other types of NSCLC. Now, with this significant advance, it is more important than ever that all people diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer undergo testing for ALK and other recommended biomarkers to receive the treatment most appropriate for them.” The approval is based on positive results from the Phase III ALINA study that demonstrated Alecensa reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 76% (hazard ratio [HR]=0.24, 95% CI: 0.13-0.43, p<0.0001) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in people with completely resected IB (tumor ≥ 4 cm) to IIIA (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) ALK-positive NSCLC. In an exploratory analysis, an improvement of central nervous system (CNS)-disease-free survival (DFS) was observed (HR=0.22; 95% CI: 0.08-0.58). The safety and tolerability of Alecensa in this trial were generally consistent with previous trials in the metastatic setting and no unexpected safety findings were observed. These data were presented as a late-breaking oral at the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress 2023 Presidential Symposium in October 2023 and were also recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2024. Alecensa is a kinase inhibitor currently approved as first- and second-line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC. It has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients, including those with CNS metastases, and now with this approval, these benefits could extend to people with early-stage disease. Routine testing of resected surgical tissue or biopsy for ALK, EGFR and PD-L1 biomarkers in patients with stage IB to IIIA and select IIIB (UICC/AJCC 8th edition) NSCLC, in addition to in the advanced setting, is recommended by international guidelines, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®), to support clinicians’ decision-making. About 5% of people with NSCLC are ALK-positive. The review of this application was conducted under the FDA’s Project Orbis initiative, which provides a framework for concurrent submission and review of oncology medicines among international partners. According to the FDA, collaboration among international regulators may allow patients with cancer to receive earlier access to products in other countries where there may be significant delays in regulatory submissions. For this review, FDA collaborated with the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration (TGA), Health Canada (HC), Israel's Ministry of Health (IMoH) Pharmaceutical Administration, Switzerland’s Swissmedic, and the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (UK MHRA). Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) and Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA) will also be participating as Type C Project Orbis Partners. Additionally, the FDA reviewed and approved the supplemental application under its Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process to ensure safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible. Data from the Phase III ALINA study will also be used for filing submissions to additional global health authorities, including the European Medicines Agency. About the ALINA study The ALINA study [NCT03456076] is a Phase III, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant Alecensa® (alectinib) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in people with resected Stage IB (tumor ≥ 4 cm) to IIIA (UICC/AJCC 7th edition) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study included 257 patients who were randomly assigned to either the Alecensa or chemotherapy treatment arm. The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary outcome measures include overall survival (OS), central nervous system-DFS, and percentage of patients with adverse events. About lung cancer According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that more than 238,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2023, and NSCLC accounts for 80-85% of all lung cancers. Treating lung cancer early, before it has spread, may help prevent the disease from returning and provide people with the best opportunity for a cure. Approximately five percent of people with NSCLC are ALK positive. ALK-positive NSCLC is often found in younger people – usually 55 and under. Today, about half of all people with early lung cancer (45-76%, depending on disease stage) still experience a cancer recurrence following surgery, despite adjuvant chemotherapy. About Alecensa® (alectinib) Alecensa is a prescription medicine used to treat people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is caused by an abnormal anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. It can be used to help prevent lung cancer from coming back in patients after their tumor has been removed by surgery (adjuvant), or to treat patients when their lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic). A doctor will perform a test to make sure that Alecensa is right for their patient. It is not known if Alecensa is safe and effective in children. Important Safety Information Everyone reacts differently to treatment with Alecensa. It’s important to know the most serious and most common side effects with Alecensa. A doctor may lower the dose or stop treatment with Alecensa if any side effects occur. Patients taking Alecensa should contact their doctor right away if they have any of the following side effects. Alecensa may cause serious side effects, including: Liver problems (hepatotoxicity). Liver problems are common with Alecensa and can be severe. A doctor will do blood tests at least every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, and then 1 time each month and as needed during treatment with Alecensa. Patients taking Alecensa should tell their doctor right away if they experience any of the following signs and symptoms: Feeling tired Feeling less hungry than usual Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes Dark urine Itchy skin Nausea or vomiting Pain on the right side of stomach area Bleeding or bruising more easily than normal Lung problems. Alecensa may cause severe or life-threatening swelling (inflammation) of the lungs during treatment. Symptoms may be similar to those symptoms from lung cancer. Patients taking Alecensa should tell their doctor right away if they have any new or worsening symptoms, including trouble breathing, shortness of breath, cough, or fever. Kidney problems. Alecensa may cause severe kidney problems that can lead to death. Patients should tell their doctor right away if they have a change in the amount or color of their urine, or if they get new or worsening swelling in their legs or feet. Slow heartbeat (bradycardia). Alecensa may cause very slow heartbeats that can be severe. A doctor will check a patient’s heart rate and blood pressure during treatment with Alecensa.

Muscle problems are common with Alecensa and can be severe. A doctor will do blood tests at least every 2 weeks for the first month and as needed during treatment with Alecensa. Patients taking Alecensa should tell their doctor right away if they have any new or worsening signs and symptoms of muscle problems, including unexplained muscle pain or muscle pain that does not go away, tenderness, or weakness. Breakdown of healthy red blood cells earlier than normal (hemolytic anemia). Hemolytic anemia can happen in some people who take Alecensa. If this happens, patients may not have enough healthy red blood cells. A doctor may temporarily stop Alecensa and do blood tests, if needed, to check for this problem. If patients develop hemolytic anemia, their doctor may either restart them on Alecensa at a lower dose when the hemolytic anemia goes away, or may stop treatment with Alecensa. Patients should tell their doctor right away if they experience yellow skin (jaundice), weakness or dizziness, or shortness of breath. Before taking Alecensa, patients should tell their doctor about all medical conditions, including if they: have liver problems have lung or breathing problems have a slow heartbeat are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Alecensa can harm an unborn baby. Females who are able to become pregnant will be tested by their doctor to see if they are pregnant before starting treatment with Alecensa. They should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Alecensa and for 5 weeks after the last dose of Alecensa. Patients taking Alecensa should tell their doctor right away if they become pregnant during treatment with Alecensa or think they may be pregnant Males who have female partners that are able to become pregnant should use effective birth control (contraception) during treatment with Alecensa and for 3 months after the last dose of Alecensa are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if Alecensa passes into breast milk. A patient should not breastfeed during treatment with Alecensa and for 1 week after the last dose of Alecensa. Patients should talk with their doctor about the best way to feed their baby during this time.

BancFirst a rapporté un bénéfice net de 50,3 millions de dollars pour le premier trimestre 2024, une baisse par rapport à l'année précédente. Les revenus nets d’intérêts et la marge ont diminué, tandis que les revenus non liés aux intérêts et les dépenses ont augmenté. Le total des actifs, des prêts et des dépôts a montré une croissance, avec une forte qualité d'actifs. Le PDG a mentionné des signes positifs dans la croissance des prêts et des dépôts malgré les préoccupations économiques. BancFirst verzeichnete für das erste Quartal 2024 einen Nettogewinn von 50,3 Millionen Dollar, einen Rückgang gegenüber dem Vorjahr. Der Nettozinsüberschuss und die Marge sanken, während die nichtzinsabhängigen Einkünfte und Ausgaben stiegen. Die Gesamtaktiva, Kredite und Einlagen verzeichneten Wachstum, bei starker Vermögensqualität. Der CEO erwähnte trotz wirtschaftlicher Bedenken positive Entwicklungen bei Kredit- und Einlagenwachstum. Positive Net income for Q1 2024 was $50.3 million, down from $57.5 million in Q1 2023. Net interest income decreased to $106.1 million in Q1 2024 from $109.2 million in Q1 2023. Noninterest income declined to $44.9 million in Q1 2024 from $47.8 million the previous year. Total assets increased to $12.6 billion at the end of Q1 2024. Loan volume grew to $7.8 billion, and deposits reached $10.9 billion, showing positive growth. Asset quality remained strong, with nonaccrual loans at 0.54% of total loans. Negative Net interest margin decreased to 3.70% in Q1 2024 from 3.89% in Q1 2023. Provision for credit losses increased to $4.0 million in Q1 2024 from $2.3 million in Q1 2023. Noninterest expenses rose to $82.8 million in Q1 2024 from $80.3 million in Q1 2023. Net charge-offs were $3.5 million for Q1 2024, a significant increase from $290,000 in Q1 2023. Financial Analyst Examining the quarterly report, there's a clear reduction in net income, a move from $57.5 million to $50.3 million. This is a notable deviation from the previous year's performance, which may concern shareholders looking for growth stability. The net interest margin has also contracted from 3.89% to 3.70%, reflecting a tighter spread between interest income generated and the interest paid to depositors. This squeeze could signal rising funding costs or competitive pressures on lending rates. With the provision for credit losses increasing from $2.3 million to $4.0 million, it suggests a cautious approach to potential bad debts, which may resonate with risk-averse investors amid economic uncertainties. However, the effective tax rate has dipped slightly, providing a thin silver lining. Asset growth is positive, but the key question for investors is whether this can translate into improved returns, especially in a climate where the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy might tighten further. Banking Sector Analyst The Durbin Amendment's influence is evident, with a $5.3 million reduction in interchange fees affecting noninterest income. This legislation often hits smaller financial institutions harder, given their reliance on fee income. BancFirst's increment in noninterest expenses, primarily due to higher staff costs, suggests investment in human capital or possibly wage inflation, which investors should watch in terms of cost management efficiency. Asset quality is a strength, with nonaccrual loans at a modest 0.54% of total loans, an increase from the prior year-end but still within a manageable range. The relatively stable allowance for credit losses ratio indicates the bank's consistent approach to covering potential loan defaults. The increase in deposits and loans is promising, but investors should measure this against the broader economic context and interest rate forecasts for a comprehensive risk assessment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, BancFirst's performance offers a mixed bag. The company operates in a competitive banking landscape where regional dynamics influence business prospects. The expansion of assets and ongoing growth in loans and deposits are indicators of healthy operational activity, but market participants will scrutinize the bank’s strategies for yielding net interest margin, particularly in a rising rate environment. The mention of stabilization in deposit mix could be a strategic advantage if it leads to improved profitability. Understanding regional market factors, such as economic growth rates in Oklahoma and Texas where BancFirst operates, is critical for assessing the potential for BancFirst's further expansion and corresponding stock performance. 04/18/2024 - 05:30 PM OKLAHOMA CITY, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BancFirst Corporation (NASDAQ GS: BANF) reported net income of $50.3 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $57.5 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. The Company's net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased to $106.1 million from $109.2 million for the same period in 2023. Net interest income was negatively impacted by increases in volume and rates on interest bearing deposits, partially offset by higher loan volume. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 3.70% compared to 3.89% for the first quarter of 2023. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $4.0 million in the first quarter compared to $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. Noninterest income for the quarter totaled $44.9 million compared to $47.8 million last year. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to an approximate $5.3 million reduction of interchange fees related to the impact of the Durbin Amendment. Trust revenue, sweep fees and insurance commissions all each increased when compared to last year. Noninterest expense for the quarter increased to $82.8 million compared to $80.3 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily related to growth in salaries and employee benefits of $2.3 million. The Company's effective tax rate for the period was 21.6% compared to 22.6% for the first quarter of 2023. At March 31, 2024, the Company's total assets were $12.6 billion, an increase of $230.4 million from December 31, 2023. Loans grew $127.7 million, totaling $7.8 billion at March 31, 2024. Deposits totaled $10.9 billion, an increase of $209.5 million from December 31, 2023. Sweep accounts were $4.6 billion at March 31, 2024, up $224.2 million from December 31, 2023. The Company's total stockholders' equity was $1.5 billion, an increase of $35.4 million over December 31, 2023. Asset quality remained strong as nonaccrual loans totaled $42.0 million, representing 0.54% of total loans at March 31, 2024 compared to 0.32% at year-end 2023. The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.25% at March 31, 2024 virtually unchanged from year-end. Net charge-offs were $3.5 million for the quarter compared to $290,000 for the first quarter of 2023. BancFirst Corporation CEO David Harlow commented, ""The Company reported a solid quarter fueled by loan growth, deposit growth, and early signs of a stabilization in our deposit mix. Asset quality remained strong and our CECL reserve percentage was essentially flat as our guarded outlook on the economy has not changed materially. Recent inflation data has been higher than anticipated causing the Federal Reserve to signal higher rates for longer which will impact everyone including banks.""

(“First Western” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: MYFW), today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. Net income available to common shareholders was $2.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024. This compares to Net loss of $3.2 million, or $(0.34) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and Net income of $3.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. Scott C. Wylie, CEO of First Western, commented, ""While continuing to prioritize prudent risk management and a conservative approach to new loan production, we delivered a higher level of profitability during the first quarter compared to Q4 2023. As a result of strong execution on our strategic priorities, we saw positive trends in a number of key areas including further improvement in our loan-to-deposit ratio, a higher level of non-interest income driven by our wealth management and mortgage banking businesses, and improvement in our asset quality with a decline in non-performing loans and net charge-offs to average loans of 0.00% in the quarter. Given our higher level of profitability and prudent balance sheet management, we were able to continue increasing our tangible book value per share and our risk-based capital ratios. “While economic conditions remain uncertain, we will continue to prioritize prudent risk management and be conservative in new loan production, while focusing on adding new full banking relationships with high quality clients that need the multiple products and services we can provide in banking, wealth management, and other areas. When economic conditions improve, given the strength of our balance sheet, including the higher level of liquidity that we now have, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on increased loan demand to grow our balance sheet, increase revenue, and realize more operating leverage, which should result in further increases in our level of profitability and additional value being created for shareholders,” said Mr. Wylie.

Operating Results for the First Quarter 2024 Revenue Total income before non-interest expense was $23.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 67.2%, compared to $13.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Gross revenue(1) was $23.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 4.6%, from $22.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in Total income before non-interest expense was primarily driven by a decrease in Provision for credit losses. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Total income before non-interest expense decreased 9.4% from $25.7 million. Gross revenue decreased 9.8% from $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in Net interest income as a result of higher Interest expense due to higher deposit costs, offset partially by higher Interest income. (1) Represents a Non-GAAP financial measure. See “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of our Non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Net Interest Income Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $16.1 million, a decrease of 1.6% from $16.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Net interest income decreased 17.9% from $19.6 million. The decreases were due to higher Interest expense driven primarily by higher deposit costs, offset partially by higher Interest income. Net Interest Margin Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 3 basis points to 2.34% from 2.37% reported in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to continued pricing pressure on interest-bearing deposits and an unfavorable mix shift in the deposit portfolio. The yield on interest-earning assets increased 7 basis points to 5.58% in the first quarter of 2024 from 5.51% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 19 basis points to 4.13% in the first quarter of 2024 from 3.94% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, net interest margin decreased from 2.93%, primarily due to pricing pressure on interest-bearing deposits and an unfavorable mix shift in the deposit portfolio. Non-interest Income Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $7.3 million compared to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in Net gain on mortgage loans and higher Bank fees during the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower Risk management and insurance fees, which tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Non-interest income increased 25.3% from $5.8 million. Increases were driven by most components of Non-interest income, including Bank fees, Net gain on loans held for sale, Trust and investment management fees, Net gain on mortgage loans, and Net gain on loans accounted for under the fair value option. Non-interest Expense Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $19.7 million compared to $18.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher Salaries and employee benefits due to a higher bonus accrual commensurate with improved earnings in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and higher payroll taxes, which tend to be seasonally higher in the first quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Non-interest expense decreased 4.1% from $20.5 million, driven primarily by lower Salaries and employee benefits as a result of staffing reductions in 2023 to better align expenses with lower revenue. The decrease was partially offset by increased Professional services and Other operational costs related to higher legal, audit and other professional fees. The Company’s efficiency ratio(1) was 83.4% in the first quarter of 2024, compared with 80.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 78.4% in the first quarter of 2023.

Loans Total loans held for investment were $2.48 billion as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 2.2% from $2.54 billion as of December 31, 2023, the decline was due to a net decrease in Commercial and Industrial and 1-4 Family Residential portfolios. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Total loans held for investment were flat year over year at $2.48 billion as of March 31, 2023. Deposits Total deposits were $2.53 billion as of March 31, 2024, which were flat compared to December 31, 2023. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, Total deposits increased 5.9% from $2.39 billion as of March 31, 2023, driven primarily by Interest-bearing deposits due to new and expanded deposit relationships. Borrowings Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) and Federal Reserve borrowings were $69.5 million as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of $56.2 million from $125.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, borrowings decreased $191.9 million from $261.4 million as of March 31, 2023. The change in borrowings from December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 is driven by a $31.0 million repayment of a Bank Term Funding Program loan that matured in March 2024. The change when compared to March 31, 2023 was also driven by a decline in FHLB borrowing reliance as a result of increased deposits. Subordinated notes were $52.4 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $52.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Subordinated notes increased $0.2 million from $52.2 million as of March 31, 2023. Assets Under Management Assets Under Management (""AUM"") increased by $388.5 million during the first quarter to $7.14 billion as of March 31, 2024, compared to $6.75 billion as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in market values throughout the first quarter of 2024, resulting in an increase in the value of AUM balances. Total AUM increased by $759.4 million compared to March 31, 2023 from $6.38 billion, which was primarily attributable to improving market conditions year-over-year resulting in an increase in the value of AUM. Credit Quality Non-performing assets totaled $46.0 million, or 1.57% of total assets, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $51.1 million, or 1.72% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of a non-performing Construction and Development note at a gain, a large principal payment received on a Cash, securities and other note offset partially by one new Non-performing Commercial and Industrial loan. As of March 31, 2023, non-performing assets totaled $12.5 million, or 0.42% of total assets. Relative to the first quarter of 2023, the increase in non-performing assets was due to the net addition of $33.5 million in loans added throughout 2023. During the first quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a provision expense of $0.1 million, compared to a provision expense of $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a $0.3 million release to its provision in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in provision expense recorded in the first quarter of 2024 compared to fourth quarter of 2023 reflects a Commercial and Industrial loan where the borrower filed for bankruptcy resulting in a charge-off of the entire loan balance during the fourth quarter of 2023. Capital As of March 31, 2024, First Western (“Consolidated”) and First Western Trust Bank (“Bank”) exceeded the minimum capital levels required by their respective regulators. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank was classified as “well capitalized,” as summarized in the following table: March 31, 2024Consolidated Capital Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets9.77%Common Equity Tier 1 (""CET1"") to risk-weighted assets9.77 Total capital to risk-weighted assets13.15 Tier 1 capital to average assets7.73 Bank Capital Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets11.00 CET1 to risk-weighted assets11.00 Total capital to risk-weighted assets12.02 Tier 1 capital to average assets8.70 Book value per common share increased 0.8% from $25.33 as of December 31, 2023 to $25.52 as of March 31, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the financial measures included in this press release are not measures of financial performance recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures include “Tangible Common Equity,” “Tangible Common Book Value per Share,” “Return on Tangible Common Equity,” “Efficiency Ratio,” “Gross Revenue,” and “Allowance for Credit Losses to Adjusted Loans"". The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company’s financial position and performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Not all companies use the same calculation of these measures; therefore, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as presented by other companies. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, to GAAP financial measures are provided at the end of this press release. Forward-Looking Statements Statements in this news release regarding our expectations and beliefs about our future financial performance and financial condition, as well as trends in our business and markets are “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “position,” “outlook,” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “opportunity,” “could,” or “may.” The forward-looking statements in this news release are based on current information and on assumptions that we make about future events and circumstances that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond our control. As a result of those risks and uncertainties, our actual financial results in the future could differ, possibly materially, from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this news release and could cause us to make changes to our future plans. Those risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, the lack of soundness of other financial institutions or financial market utilities may adversely affect the Company; the Company’s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions; financial institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships; defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions or financial market utilities, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of client, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by other financial institutions, or the Company; integration risks and projected cost savings in connection with acquisitions; the risk of geographic concentration in Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, California, and Montana; the risk of changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity; the risk in our ability to continue to originate residential real estate loans and sell such loans; risks specific to commercial loans and borrowers; the risk of claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities; the risk of competition for investment managers and professionals; the risk of fluctuation in the value of our investment securities; the risk of changes in interest rates; and the risk of the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and the risk in our ability to maintain a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties to which our business and future financial performance are subject is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 15, 2024 (“Form 10-K”), and other documents we file with the SEC from time to time. We urge readers of this news release to review the “Risk Factors” section our Form 10-K and any updates to those risk factors set forth in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our other filings with the SEC. Also, our actual financial results in the future may differ from those currently expected due to additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware or which we do not currently view as, but in the future may become, material to our business or operating results. Due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this news release, which speak only as of today’s date, or to make predictions based solely on historical financial performance. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

(NYSE: AESI) (“Atlas” or the “Company”) mine in Kermit, Texas. Atlas remains grateful that all personnel at the site, including Company employees and contractors, are safe, that no injuries occurred or environmental impacts have been reported, and for the exceptional work of the first responders. John Turner, President, CEO and CFO of Atlas, said: “We are very proud of the quick action from our integrated teams, both Atlas and Hi-Crush, who are working to deliver collaborative, timely and customer-focused solutions. While we work hard to ensure events like this do not occur, we are focused on safely returning the facility to operation as soon as possible. In addition, benefitting from our differentiated scale and associated geographically distributed proppant production operations, we are continuing to support our customers’ ongoing needs.” The company has conducted a preliminary assessment of the facility, which is ongoing, and can provide the following information. The fire primarily impacted the “feed system,” which transports sand from the dryers and separators to storage silos. The full “feed system” rebuild is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. The team began moving temporary loadout equipment to the Kermit facility within 48 hours of the incident. The facility remains closed and initial restart of operations is expected at the beginning of next week. Once the facility is restarted and the temporary loadout equipment is fully operational, we expect to fulfill all Kermit facility customer commitments with sand produced and loaded from that facility. We are assessing the cost to repair the feed system and reviewing the financial impact of the incident. In addition, we have filed an insurance claim and expect coverage to be available to reimburse us for the cost of the repairs. The temporary closing of the Kermit facility will have no impact on the timing or cost of the Dune Express construction. Atlas will provide additional updates to our second quarter operations on our first quarter earnings call scheduled for Monday, May 6th. About Atlas Energy Solutions Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. is a leading proppant producer and proppant logistics provider, serving primarily the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. We operate 12 proppant production facilities across the Permian Basin with a combined annual production capacity of 28 million tons, including both large-scale in-basin facilities and smaller distributed mining units. We manage a portfolio of leading-edge logistics assets, which includes our 42-mile Dune Express conveyor system, which is currently under construction and is scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition to our conveyor infrastructure, we manage a fleet of 120 trucks, which are capable of delivering expanded payloads due to our custom-manufactured trailers and patented drop-depot process. Our approach to managing both our proppant production and proppant logistics operations is intently focused on leveraging technology, automation and remote operations to drive efficiencies. We are a low-cost producer of various high-quality, locally sourced proppants used during the well completion process. We offer both dry and damp sand, and carry various mesh sizes including 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. Proppant is a key component necessary to facilitate the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our logistics platform is designed to increase the efficiency, safety and sustainability of the oil and natural gas industry within the Permian Basin. Proppant logistics is increasingly a differentiating factor affecting customer choice among proppant producers. The cost of delivering sand, even short distances, can be a significant component of customer spending on their well completions given the substantial volumes that are utilized in modern well designs. We continue to invest in and pursue leading-edge technologies, including autonomous trucking, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, to support opportunities to gain efficiencies in our operations. To this end, we have recently taken delivery of next-generation dredge mining assets to drive efficiencies in our proppant production operations. These technology-focused investments aim to improve our cost structure and also combine to produce beneficial environmental and community impacts While our core business is fundamentally aligned with a lower emissions economy, our core obligation has been, and will always be, to our stockholders. We recognize that maximizing value for our stockholders requires that we optimize the outcomes for our broader stakeholders, including our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are proud of the fact that our approach to innovation in the hydrocarbon industry while operating in an environmentally responsible manner creates immense value. Since our founding in 2017, our core mission has been to improve human beings’ access to the hydrocarbons that power our lives while also delivering differentiated social and environmental progress. Our Atlas team has driven innovation and has produced industry-leading environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption, emissions, and our aerial footprint. We call this Sustainable Environmental and Social Progress. We were founded in 2017 by Ben M. “Bud” Brigham, our Executive Chairman, and are led by an entrepreneurial team with a history of constructive disruption bringing significant and complementary experience to this enterprise, including the perspective of longtime E&P operators, which provides for an elevated understanding of the end users of our products and services. Our executive management team has a proven track record with a history of generating positive returns and value creation. Our experience as E&P operators was instrumental to our understanding of the opportunity created by in-basin sand production and supply in the Permian Basin, which we view as North America’s premier shale resource and which we believe will remain its most active through economic cycles.

Quarterly ReportMarch 31, 2024 A Letter to Our Shareholders, Clients, and Team Members: Despite a continued difficult operating environment, your Company is reporting pre-tax income of approximately $1.93 million, which equates to an 11.33% return on average tangible shareholders' equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company also continues to have a strong liquidity position and asset quality metrics. As compared to the same quarter of last year, earnings for the quarter were suppressed by significant headwinds in net interest income, which decreased by $1.4 million (16.5%). Despite that challenge and continued inflationary pressures, the Company has offset those headwinds by reducing non-interest expense by $569,000 (6.8%), reducing the provision for credit losses by $265,000, and improved non-interest income of $536,000 (30.8%). A significant amount of the increase in non-interest income ($435,000) is from the recognition of gain on sale of residential mortgage loans originated in prior periods, which was previously held in reserve. I am also pleased to report that the Board of Directors declared a $0.22 per common share dividend payable June 14, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2024. The dividend is approximately 36% of the reported net income for the first quarter of 2024. While we expect a challenging operating environment to continue to have a negative impact on your company's earnings throughout 2024 and into 2025, we believe that continued efforts on cost controls, new loan originations, and upward repricing of existing loans through this cycle will offset some of that marginal earnings pressure. The efforts of the team and our strong corporate values of respect for and accountability to our shareholders, clients, colleagues, and communities are the foundation for the continued success of your Company. Thank you for your ongoing support and the trust you have placed in us. Respectfully, Brian D.

Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf is the Director of the Translational Data Analytics Institute and a Professor of Computer Science Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, as well as Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology at the Ohio State University (OSU).As a computational ecologist, Tanya's research is at the unique intersection of computer science, wildlife biology, and social sciences. She will speak on International Girls in ICT Day, hosted by Cisco Networking Academy's Women Rock-IT Program. The theme for this year's event is Are You AI Ready? And for those who may not be aware, AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is what Tanya is going to be sharing more about.Q: What was your motivation to get into computer science, and what was your path to get there?A: I always wanted to do math. I even declared that when I was five in front of my whole family. So I went straight for math, eventually realizing that the type of math I like is the math that's the foundation of computer science. I went on to do a theoretical computer science PhD, designing algorithms and doing proofs.Along the way I met an ecologist who is now my husband and partner. He really charmed me with stories of industrious spiders and shy flowers and took me on nature walks to try to get me over my fear of bugs.I intentionally switched from a very theoretical computer science PhD to designing computational methods for answering ecological questions.A zebra's friendQ: What inspired you to focus on using AI in conservation and what keeps you motivated in the face of the ongoing extinction crisis?A: There is both the challenge and the inspiration that keeps me going.The way I got started in conservation was really on a bet. I was working with biologists who study social behavior of animals such as zebras. I got really curious about how they know who a zebra's friend is.After watching them take 20 minutes just to identify one individual zebra using the available technology at the time, the impatient engineer in me said that there had to be a better way of doing it.They said, ""you think you can do better?"" And I said, ""yeah, you want to bet?""I literally bet my reputation on being able to identify an individual zebra from a photograph easily.AI for conservationThe first algorithm we created was developed into an even better algorithm, which we are still curious about. But it turned out it could be very useful in conservation for things like tracking animals, counting them, and even figuring out who's a zebra or a sperm whale's friend without putting collars or satellite tags on them.We realized that we needed to build that technology in a way that non-technical people could use, without becoming AI experts in the process.And that's how Wildbook was born. Having started creating AI technology for conservation, we realized three things:just how big the challenges werehow huge the space was to do something to make a differencehow urgent all of this is.The challenge and urgency keep me going. And most importantly, there's something meaningful that we can do with AI.How important are digital and AI skills?Q: How important is it for people to include digital skills in their future education and professional development plans? And why is it so important?A: I think AI is becoming very quickly a part of pretty much everything that we use and touch. So AI literacy is becoming the basic skill that should be taught in school and everybody should have.It is particularly important in being able to solve complex problems like biodiversity conservation. Because it is not a problem that's going to be solved by AI alone or by humans alone. The answer truly is in partnership: the human-machine partnership.And to be able to partner well with AI, we need to know what that partner is capable of and what's the best way to have that partnership. And that means having skills that allow us to use AI, to understand AI, and even more importantly, to understand the potential of AI.Q: What is your advice for any young women starting out in computer science?A: Not everybody has to do computer science, but anybody who wants to, should have an opportunity to do so. And even more, everybody should have an opportunity to explore it.Computer science is about getting machines to affect the world. For example, with a few lines of text, we can create a 3D view of the brain with an MRI machine, or understand the past through an ancient genome, or predict the path of a hurricane. This creative process of coding is exciting to me.Accessible AI and ML learningQ: AI/Machine learning (ML) has been a subject of academic study for more than half a century. Why was last year such a milestone for this type of technology?A: Last year it exploded, not because of the algorithm or the math, but it's about how you make that accessible.Two things happened simultaneously. Firstly, there was a buildup of data available-with many caveats and asterisks that we're now revisiting. And secondly, modern machine learning is data hungry.When you have the hardware to run these complex models and the data to feed it, you can start capturing the complexity of the world. But it would have been esoteric if not for this brilliant interface that allows everybody to interact with it.And that's a huge lesson if you want to make any piece of technology useful. It's not about the technology itself, per se, it's about how you make it a partner, how you really make it accessible.Observe. Experiment.Q: Conservation of nature often faces complex questions about the natural world. Can AI help?A: In Henri Poincaré's book Science and Method, he says what we now call the scientific method consists of observation and experiment. And all that a scientist needs to do is look carefully at everything.AI doesn't fundamentally change the scientific method. It is still observation and experiment. But just like the microscope, the telescope, or genome sequencing, it expands the types of things that scientists can look at.The fundamental thing that ML and more broadly AI approaches do is extract complex patterns and complex relationships. So, we can not only look at more things, but we can also look carefully at the complexity of the world.The role of public dataQ: Does publicly available data help in this quest?A: There is a lot of publicly available data from digitized biological collections, field studies, and citizen scientists. But the most untapped data by far is from social media posts. People love taking pictures of nature, sometimes unintentionally capturing trees and grass, bugs and spiders.There's a lot of information already there but it is disconnected and disorganized, so we're not taking advantage of it. And we need AI's help to get useful insights from all of it.Q: Can AI help discover the undiscovered?A: If we want to discover new things about the world, we need to take a completely different computational philosophical approach and a new design framework of algorithms.How do we design interpretable, novelty-discovering, computational approaches that produce a testable hypothesis as an outcome?Maybe you already have your massive species classification from an images model? Well, good for you! But we're interested in using these news tools and frameworks to discover something new. A new species? A new trait? A new relationship?This is one of my favorite quotes from Ada Lovelace, who invented the notion of programming in the 1830s:""We talk much of imagination. We talk of the imagination of poets, the imagination of artists etcetera. I am inclined to think that in general we don't know very exactly what we are talking about. It is that which penetrates into the unseen world around us, the world of science. It is that which feels and discovers what is, the real which we see not, which exists not for our senses. Those who have learned to walk on the threshold of the unknown worlds may then with the fair white wings of imagination hope to soar further into the unexplored amidst which we live.""Register now for the Women Rock-IT virtual event on April 25!Are You AI-Ready?

(""CBI""), exchanged all 17,149,925 common shares in the capital of the Company (the ""Common Shares"") they collectively held for 17,149,925 Exchangeable Shares (the ""CBI Exchange"") for no consideration. As a result of the CBI Exchange, the CBG Group no longer holds any Common Shares. Each Exchangeable Share is convertible, at the option of the holder, into one Common Share. The Exchangeable Shares are not traded on a public market and represent an interest in Canopy Growth directly, not Canopy USA, LLC (""Canopy USA""). ""This is another important step forward for the Canopy USA strategy following the recent and overwhelming approval of our shareholders to create this exchangeable class of shares,"" said David Klein, Chief Executive Officer of Canopy Growth. ""We look forward to maintaining an enduring positive relationship with CBI as our largest shareholder, and to the further advancement of the Canopy USA strategy that this change enables as Canopy USA moves forward with the acquisitions of Wana, Jetty and Acreage."" As previously disclosed by the Company, on April 18, 2019, CBG, Greenstar and Canopy Growth entered into a second amended and restated investor rights agreement (the ""Investor Rights Agreement""), pursuant to which the CBG Group, among other things, was entitled to designate four nominees for election or appointment to the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board""), subject to certain conditions set out in the Investor Rights Agreement (the ""Nominee Rights""). In accordance with the consent agreement dated October 24, 2022 among CBG, Greenstar and Canopy Growth (the ""Consent Agreement"") and as a result of the CBI Exchange, CBG, Greenstar and Canopy Growth have terminated the Investor Rights Agreement, along with an administrative services agreement, co-development agreement, and all other commercial arrangements between them and their subsidiaries, other than the Consent Agreement, certain termination agreements and the Exchange Agreement (as defined below). As a result, CBI no longer holds any governance rights in relation to Canopy Growth, including the Nominee Rights. In connection with the termination of the Investor Rights Agreement and subsequent to the Note Exchange (as defined below), on April 18, 2024, Garth Hankinson, Judy Schmeling and James Sabia (collectively, the ""CBG Nominees"") each provided notice to the Company of his or her decision to resign from the Board effective immediately (the ""CBI Resignations""). Each of the CBG Nominees had been a nominee of the CBG Group under the Investor Rights Agreement. Ms. Schmeling had served as Chair of the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee of the Board, and Mr. Sabia had served as a member of the Corporate Governance, Compensation and Nominating Committee of the Board (the ""CGCN Committee""). None of the CBI Resignations were the result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. Following the CBI Resignations, the Board is now comprised of: David Lazzarato (Chair of the Board, Member of the Audit Committee and Member of the CGCN Committee);Willy Kruh (Director and Chair of the Audit Committee);Theresa Yanofsky (Director, Chair of the CGCN Committee and Member of the Audit Committee);Luc Mongeau (Director and Member of the CGCN Committee); andDavid Klein (Chief Executive Officer and Director).The Company also announced that on April 18, 2024, Canopy Growth entered into an exchange agreement (the ""Exchange Agreement"") with Greenstar, pursuant to which Greenstar converted approximately C$81.2 million of the principal amount of the C$100 million principal amount promissory note issued to Greenstar by Canopy Growth on April 14, 2023 (the ""Promissory Note"") into 9,111,549 Exchangeable Shares (the ""Note Exchange"" and together with the CBI Exchange, the ""Transactions""), calculated based on a price per Exchangeable Share equal to C$8.91. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, all accrued but unpaid interest on the Promissory Note together with the remaining principal amount of the Promissory Note was cancelled and forgiven for no additional consideration by Greenstar. Following the closing of the Note Exchange, there is no outstanding balance owing under the Promissory Note and the Promissory Note has been cancelled, which has resulted in an overall reduction in debt on the Company's balance sheet in the amount of C$100 million. As a result of the Transactions, CBG and Greenstar now hold an aggregate of 26,261,474 Exchangeable Shares. The Note Exchange is considered to be a ""related party transaction"" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). Pursuant to Section 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, the Company is exempt from obtaining a formal valuation and minority approval of the Company's shareholders with respect to the Note Exchange as the fair market value of the Note Exchange is below 25% of the Company's market capitalization as determined in accordance with MI 61-101. In addition, the Note Exchange was approved by the board of directors of the Company with the CBG Nominees each having disclosed their interest in the Note Exchange by virtue of their positions with CBI and abstaining from voting thereon. The Company did not file a material change report 21 days prior to the closing of the Note Exchange as the details of the Note Exchange had not been finalized at that time. The Company has not received, nor has it requested, a valuation of its securities or the subject matter of the Note Exchange in the 24 months prior to the date hereof.

Die Finanzergebnisse beinhalteten einen Rückgang des Nettozinsertrags, der jedoch durch eine Umkehrung von Kreditverlusten aufgrund einer verbesserten wirtschaftlichen Aussicht ausgeglichen wurde. Der Vorstand erklärte eine Dividende von 0,17 Dollar pro Aktie. Hilltop kaufte im ersten Quartal 2024 Aktien zurück. Die wirtschaftlichen Gegenwinde aus 2022 hielten auch im Jahr 2024 an und beeinflussten zukünftige Unsicherheiten. Positive Income of $27.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, reported for Q1 2024, compared to $25.8 million in Q1 2023. Decline in net interest income offset by reversal of credit losses due to improved economic outlook. Quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share declared by the Board. Repurchased 320,042 shares in Q1 2024 under the stock repurchase program. Economic headwinds from 2022 continued into 2024, creating uncertainties for the future. Negative Net interest margin decreased to 2.85% in Q1 2024. Noninterest expense slightly decreased to $250.0 million in Q1 2024. Effective tax rate increased to 22.5% in Q1 2024 from 11.6% in the same period in 2023. Non-accrual loans were $64.7 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $68.3 million at December 31, 2023. Total deposits decreased to $10.9 billion at March 31, 2024, from $11.1 billion at December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst Investors seeking to gauge the financial health of Hilltop Holdings Inc. would note the marginal increase in income to common stockholders for Q1 2024, an uptick from $25.8 million in Q1 2023 to $27.7 million in Q1 2024. This indicates a company maintaining profitability despite a volatile economic climate. The diluted earnings per share also slightly rose, from $0.40 to $0.42, suggesting a stable return on investment for shareholders. However, the reported decline in net interest income, which forms a core part of a bank's revenue stream, could be an area of concern as it reflects the industry-wide squeeze on margins due to increased borrowing costs.From a shareholder value perspective, the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share signals a continued commitment to returning value to shareholders, an attractive facet for income-focused investors. The share repurchase at an average price of $31.04 also indicates management's belief in the company's intrinsic value relative to market price, although this merits scrutiny against broader market valuation metrics.The disclosure of economic uncertainties and their potential impacts provides transparency. However, investors should remain cognizant of external economic factors such as U.S. treasury yields, mortgage interest rates and inflationary pressures that can affect Hilltop's performance. The shift of a commercial credit relationship within the hotel/motel portfolio from investment to sale could imply strategic asset reallocation or issues within that subsector that warrant monitoring. Capital ratios exceeding regulatory requirements highlight a robust balance sheet, offering some security against potential economic downturns. Market Research Analyst A key takeaway for investors considering the broader market is Hilltop's net gains from the sale of loans within the mortgage origination segment. The increase to 221 basis points from 189 in the prior quarter might reflect improved profitability in loan sales, albeit in the context of reduced mortgage loan origination volumes due to the housing inventory crunch and affordability issues. This segment's performance could serve as a barometer for the mortgage industry and investor sentiment regarding real estate financing.Comprehensively, Hilltop's effective tax rate jump to 22.5% from 11.6% points to a higher tax burden year-over-year, a significant financial consideration. It's imperative to parse out non-deductible expenses and other adjustments that resulted in this increase, as it could imply a reduced net income outlook going forward if such rates persist. Banking Industry Analyst Investors with a focus on the banking sector would find the PlainsCapital Bank's annualized return on average assets of 1.20% noteworthy, as it evidences the bank's earning potential. The consolidated annualized return on average assets and equity for Hilltop Holdings, compared year-over-year, exhibit a modest improvement, possibly conveying operational efficiency gains. Nevertheless, with the banking segment experiencing a reversal of credit losses, investors should consider the quality of the loan portfolio and the bank's ability to manage credit risk under evolving economic conditions.The slight decrease in the consolidated net interest margin to 2.85% aligns with broader banking trends, where margins are compressed due to a challenging rate environment. Investors should weigh this against the sector's performance and regulatory changes that may come into play. It is also prudent to factor in the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio when assessing risk and stability. Hilltop's strong capital positions well exceed regulatory minimums, potentially mitigating risks associated with economic uncertainty and positioning the bank for continued resilience. 04/18/2024 - 04:45 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilltop Holdings Inc. (NYSE: HTH) (“Hilltop”) today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Hilltop produced income to common stockholders of $27.7 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $25.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2023. Hilltop’s financial results for the first quarter of 2024 included a decline in net interest income, partially offset by a reversal of credit losses due to an improved economic outlook within the banking segment, an increase in net revenues within certain of the broker-dealer segment’s business lines, and a decline in other mortgage production income, partially offset by an increase in net gains from sale of loans within the mortgage origination segment. Hilltop also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per common share payable on May 24, 2024, to all common stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2024. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, Hilltop paid $9.9 million to repurchase an aggregate of 320,042 shares of its common stock at an average price of $31.04 per share pursuant to the 2024 stock repurchase program. These shares were returned to the pool of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. The impacts of economic headwinds that began in 2022, and continued into 2024, remain uncertain and will depend on developments outside of our control, including, among others, the timing and significance of further changes in U.S. treasury yields and mortgage interest rates, exposure to increasing funding costs, inflationary pressures associated with compensation, occupancy and software costs and labor market conditions, and international armed conflicts and their impact on supply chains. Jeremy B. Ford, President and CEO of Hilltop, said, “Hilltop’s operating results for the first quarter of 2024 reflect a general continuation in market trends that were experienced throughout 2023. The elevated interest rate environment continues to impact our net interest margin primarily through increased borrowing costs. Additionally, a lack of housing inventory and pressured home buying affordability limited mortgage origination volumes. Despite these pressures, Hilltop’s robust liquidity position allowed for a return of high-cost deposits. “During the quarter, PlainsCapital Bank produced an annualized return on average assets of 1.20% highlighting the steady earnings power of the franchise. HilltopSecurities delivered a pre-tax margin of 16% on net revenues of $117 million, primarily due to strong results from the structured finance and wealth management business lines. As previously mentioned, PrimeLending’s results remain challenged due to elevated mortgage rates and suboptimal housing inventory across the country. From a consolidated perspective, we will continue to protect our strong balance sheet position and aim to produce results that improve our tangible book value per share over time.” First Quarter 2024 Highlights for Hilltop: The reversal of credit losses was $2.9 million during the first quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a provision for credit losses of $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2023; The reversal of credit losses during the first quarter of 2024 reflected a release in the allowance related to improvements to the U.S. economic outlook since the prior quarter, partially offset by increases in specific reserves within the banking segment. For the first quarter of 2024, net gains from sale of loans and other mortgage production income and mortgage loan origination fees within the mortgage origination segment was $66.6 million, compared to $68.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, a 3.1% decrease; Mortgage loan origination production volume was $1.7 billion during the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2023; Net gains from mortgage loans sold to third parties increased to 221 basis points during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 189 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023. Hilltop’s consolidated annualized return on average assets and return on average stockholders’ equity for the first quarter of 2024 were 0.74% and 5.23%, respectively, compared to 0.69% and 5.12%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2023; Hilltop’s book value per common share increased to $32.66 at March 31, 2024, compared to $32.58 at December 31, 2023; Hilltop’s total assets were $16.2 billion and $16.5 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; Loans1, net of allowance for credit losses, were $7.6 billion at each of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; Non-accrual loans were $64.7 million, or 0.73% of total loans, at March 31, 2024, compared to $68.3 million, or 0.76% of total loans, at December 31, 2023; Non-accrual loans at March 31, 2024 included a single non-owner occupied commercial real estate credit relationship within our hotel/motel portfolio industry subsector that was reclassified since the prior period from loans held for investment to loans held for sale. Loans held for sale decreased by 10.8% from December 31, 2023 to $0.8 billion at March 31, 2024; Total deposits were $10.9 billion and $11.1 billion at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively; Total estimated uninsured deposits were $4.8 billion, or approximately 44% of total deposits, while estimated uninsured deposits, excluding collateralized deposits of $360.5 million, were $4.5 billion, or approximately 41% of total deposits, at March 31, 2024. Hilltop maintained strong capital levels2 with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio3 of 12.49% and a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 19.73% at March 31, 2024; Hilltop’s consolidated net interest margin4 decreased to 2.85% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 2.96% in the fourth quarter of 2023; For the first quarter of 2024, noninterest income was $181.6 million, compared to $162.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, an 11.8% increase; For the first quarter of 2024, noninterest expense was $250.0 million, compared to $250.5 million in the first quarter of 2023, a 0.2% decrease; and Hilltop’s effective tax rate was 22.5% during the first quarter of 2024, compared to 11.6% during the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was higher than the applicable statutory rate primarily due to the impact of nondeductible expenses, nondeductible compensation expense and other permanent adjustments, partially offset by the discrete impact of restricted stock vesting during the quarter and investments in tax-exempt instruments. _____________________________ 1 “Loans” reflect loans held for investment excluding broker-dealer margin loans, net of allowance for credit losses, of $332.6 million and $344.1 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 2 Capital ratios reflect Hilltop’s decision to elect the transition option as issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies in March 2020 that permits banking institutions to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory capital effects from CECL over a five-year transitionary period through December 31, 2024. 3 Based on the end of period Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets during the quarter, excluding goodwill and intangible assets. 4 Net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.

(2) Net interest margin (taxable equivalent), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Taxable equivalent adjustments are based on the applicable 21% federal income tax rate for all periods presented. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. The taxable equivalent adjustments to interest income for Hilltop (consolidated) were $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.6 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for the periods presented and for the banking segment were $0.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, for the periods presented. (3) Dividend payout ratio is defined as cash dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share. (4) Net revenue is defined as the sum of total broker-dealer net interest income and total broker-dealer noninterest income. (5) Pre-tax margin is defined as income before income taxes divided by net revenue. (6) Reported on a consolidated basis and therefore does not include mortgage servicing rights assets related to loans serviced for the banking segment, which are eliminated in consolidation.

L'entreprise a rencontré des défis dans le secteur photovoltaïque en raison des taux d'intérêt élevés, de la baisse des prix de l'énergie et de la réduction des subventions, ce qui a conduit à une baisse des volumes de ventes, particulièrement en Espagne.

Negative The company faced a net loss of €2.01 million ($2.23 million) for the year. Sales volumes decreased significantly in Spain, the main market for Turbo Energy. Challenges in the photovoltaic sector were exacerbated by external factors like high interest rates and subsidy reductions. Financial Analyst Examining Turbo Energy's announced financials, the reported revenues of €13.14 million ($14.54 million) display a company that's maintaining its market presence, yet the net loss of €2.01 million ($2.23 million) highlights the need for scrutinizing cost structures and operational efficiency. The photovoltaic sector's performance is tightly coupled with regulatory environments and energy pricing dynamics. For investors, it’s important to track how Turbo Energy plans to mitigate the impact of high interest rates and decreased energy prices, both of which pose risks to profitability. Furthermore, the high inventory levels suggest potential for write-downs or need for sales discounting, which could further pressure margins in the short term. Investors should keep an eye on the company's inventory turnover ratios in comparison to industry standards as this could be indicative of underlying demand issues or operational inefficiencies. Market Research Analyst The photovoltaic industry is sensitive to economic and policy changes. The mention of subsidy reductions is particularly noteworthy, as such incentives have historically driven growth in renewable energy adoption. In the absence of subsidies, customer acquisition costs could rise, possibly slowing the sector's expansion. However, Turbo Energy's optimism may be anchored in future regulatory adjustments or technological advancements that could reduce costs or open new market segments. As an investor, it’s essential to evaluate Turbo Energy's strategic positioning and R&D investments. These could be pivotal in outmaneuvering the headwinds faced due to the subsidy reductions. Monitoring industry-wide trends and competitor responses will also provide a broader context to Turbo Energy's performance. 04/18/2024 - 04:30 PM Valencia, Spain, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turbo Energy, S.A. (NASDAQ: TURB), a leading energy-saving technology company leveraging artificial intelligence software, today announced that for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported revenues of €13.14 million ($14.54 million) and a net loss of €2.01 million ($2.23 million). MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY The year 2023 was a period in which the residential and industrial photovoltaic sector was adversely affected by a variety of external factors including high interest rates, significant energy price decreases and subsidy reductions. Combined with unusually high inventory levels in distribution channels, these factors contributed to a significant reduction in photovoltaic sales volumes, especially in Spain, which is the main market of the company. Despite experiencing the negative effects of this market downturn, the company remains optimistic about the coming years. During 2023, Turbo Energy launched a portable version of its photovoltaic product for home balconies, as well as a version for commercial and industrial scale, and signed agreements with major retailers for this entire product range, thus achieving the introduction of new sales channels with greater potential. All of these moves have produced positive sales results thus far in 2024. During 2023, the company also progressed with the development of a Sunbox residential version for marketing in the U.S., a Sunbox utility scale version, and a new powerful software platform that will allow Turbo to offer a highly competitive software proposition. We expect these products to yield positive sales results sometime in 2024. These investments are paving the way towards a business model in which income will be a combination of equipment sales and recurring income from services, supported by high added value for both end users and partners related to new sales channels. In addition, the downward trend in the prices of components related to photovoltaic installations, especially batteries, has started again, which is increasing the already high profitability of these installations for end users. All sector forecasts issued by experts predict very significant growth in sales for the coming years. This is a global trend in all scales of installations. Turbo Energy expects to once again embark on strong growth resulting from good sector growth expectations and commercial and product/software expansion plans launched from 2023. 2023 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS In June 2023, Turbo Energy announced its new SunBox Industry product line, a storage solution focused on the solar, commercial and industrial self-consumption market. SunBox Industry is a complete lithium-ion battery electricity storage and smart solar power management system utilizing Turbo's artificial intelligence software. In September 2023, Turbo Energy priced its initial public offering of 1 million American Depositary Shares (ADSs), representing 5 million ordinary shares at a price of $5.00 per ADS to the public for a total of $5 million in gross proceeds to the company before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. These ADSs began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TURB.” In October 2023, Turbo announced it had obtained a patent, granted for Spain, for a software development that allows the company to offer SunBox as a combined AI-driven smart management home photovoltaic system and electric vehicle charger, thus positioning it among the most innovative residential photovoltaic solutions on the market. In November 2023, Turbo announced a strategic alliance with the French multinational retailer, Leroy Merlin, to include Sunbox in that company’s range of photovoltaic products available in Spain. In December 2023, Turbo Energy announced that Movistar, a Fortune 500 telecommunications leader in Spain and Latin America, had launched Turbo´s GoSolar offering for sale through Movistar´s energy branch, Solar360. 2024 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS In January 2024, Turbo signed a collaboration agreement with Solar360 involving a major retailer focused on B2C photovoltaic installations. The agreement identified Sunbox as a strategic product for such installations. In March 2024, after verifying the success of the Sunbox commercial and industrial product, Turbo added three senior professionals to its commercial sales team. In April 2024, Turbo announced that El Corte Inglés S.A., the biggest department store group in Europe and third largest worldwide, had launched sales of GoSolar.

Negative None. 04/18/2024 - 04:30 PM BOSTON and ATLANTA, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: IKT) (Inhibikase or Company), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing protein kinase inhibitor therapeutics to modify the course of Parkinson's disease (""PD""), Parkinson's-related disorders and other diseases of the Abelson Tyrosine Kinases, today issued a Letter to Shareholders. Dear Fellow Shareholders of Inhibikase Therapeutics: 2024 has been off to a productive start for Inhibikase. Our 201 Trial is approximately 75% enrolled, with the last patient anticipated to enter the trial in June. We have had consistent and constructive interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for IkT-001Pro, culminating in the recent completion of a pre-IND meeting as we evaluate 001Pro’s potential in cardiopulmonary disease and a pre-NDA meeting with relation to the cancer indications for which imatinib is approved. As we look forward, we recognize the urgency to initiate the 12-month extension study for our 201 trial, and we are planning our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in Parkinson’s and developing our Phase 3 protocols. In addition, we continue to evaluate potential pathways to initiate a Phase 2/3 trial in Multiple System Atrophy and continue to explore multiple indications for which IkT-001Pro could be a novel new agent. In neurodegeneration, the combined efforts of our internal team, site investigators and staff as well as our digital media campaign through the201trial.com has enabled us to efficiently enroll participants across all 32 open sites. We have only 30 patients left to enroll as of April 18, 2024, and we expect to complete enrollment in approximately mid-June. Looking ahead, the initiation of the extension to the 201 Trial of up to 12 months is an essential activity to evaluate long-term effects of risvodetinib on safety, tolerability, biomarkers and whether improvements in motor and non-motor function will be realized, which will require additional financial resources. Emerging biomarker data from the 201 Trial evaluating pathological alpha-synuclein in multiple tissues and fluids supported our recent grant submissions to the National Institute of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS), an Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). One of these grants, if approved, will introduce our newly developed monoclonal antibody to track phospho-Tyr39-alpha-synuclein in the clinical trial setting, which we believe will enhance the meaning of biomarker measurements. We believe the utilization of this antibody in tissue biopsy and fluid analysis will enable us to confirm target engagement and evaluate the effect of risvodetinib on the underlying pathology responsible for disease. Upon completion of the double-blinded phase of the 201 Trial, we expect to request an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA by the end of 2024, which further accelerates our goal to begin enrolling the extension study as soon as possible. As we continue to explore the breadth of potential indications for IkT-001Pro, we believe that there is an opportunity worth exploring for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Imatinib was shown to be a disease-modifying treatment for PAH more than 10 years ago, however, unfavorable safety and tolerability precluded its approval at that time. Changes to standard-of-care for these patients coupled with the exclusion of anti-coagulant use and the potentially more favorable tolerability profile of 001Pro over imatinib mesylate suggests to us that 001Pro could offer an alternative path to success in this area. Our recent pre-IND meeting with the FDA was constructive and we expect to provide an update from this meeting following receipt of the formal meeting minutes. If considered a new molecular entity for PAH, IkT-001Pro might enjoy a long period of patent exclusivity. Altogether, 2024 is shaping up to be a year of execution across our portfolio. We believe our work to date supports the continued development of both risvodetinib and 001Pro, and we appreciate the support of our shareholders as we continue on this journey to bring transformative treatments for patients across our therapeutic pipeline. Sincerely, Milton H. Werner, PhD.President & CEO About Inhibikase (www.inhibikase.com) Inhibikase Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: IKT) is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Inhibikase's multi-therapeutic pipeline has a primary focus on neurodegeneration and its lead program risvodetinib, an Abelson Tyrosine Kinase (c-Abl) inhibitor, targets the treatment of Parkinson's disease inside and outside the brain as well as other diseases that arise from Abelson Tyrosine Kinases. Its multi-therapeutic pipeline is pursuing Parkinson's-related disorders of the brain and GI tract, orphan indications related to Parkinson's disease such as Multiple System Atrophy, and drug delivery technologies for kinase inhibitors such as IkT-001Pro, a prodrug of the anticancer agent imatinib mesylate that the Company believes will provide a better patient experience with fewer on-dosing side-effects. The Company's RAMP™ medicinal chemistry program has identified several follow-on compounds to risvodetinib that could potentially be applied to other cognitive and motor function diseases of the brain. Inhibikase is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia with offices in Lexington, Massachusetts.

(NYSE: STZ), a leading beverage alcohol company, announced today that its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greenstar Canada Investment Limited Partnership (“Greenstar”) and CBG Holdings LLC (“CBG”), have converted (the ""Conversion”) their common shares (“Common Shares”) of Canopy Growth Corporation (“Canopy”) into non-voting and non-participating exchangeable shares of Canopy (“Exchangeable Shares”). The amendment to Canopy’s share capital and the creation of the Exchangeable Shares were authorized by Canopy shareholders at a special meeting held on April 12, 2024 (the “Amendment”). Greenstar and Canopy also agreed to exchange (the “Note Exchange” and together with the Conversion, the “Transactions”) C$81.2 million of the principal amount of the C$100 million promissory note due December 2024 issued by Canopy (the “Note”) for Exchangeable Shares pursuant to an exchange agreement between Greenstar and Canopy (the “Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Greenstar forgave all accrued but unpaid interest on the Note together with the remaining principal amount of the Note. Constellation had previously disclosed its intention to complete the Transactions following Canopy shareholder approval of the Amendment. “We are pleased to complete the conversion of our Common Share ownership interest in Canopy into Exchangeable Shares,” said Bill Newlands, Constellation’s President and CEO. “While we remain supportive of Canopy’s strategy, this Transaction is expected to eliminate the impact to our equity in earnings and is aligned to our intent to not deploy additional investment in Canopy as we’ve previously stated in our capital allocation priorities.” Prior to the completion of the Transactions, Greenstar and CBG held an aggregate of 17,149,925 Common Shares (representing approximately 18.8% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares) after giving effect to the reverse stock split completed by Canopy in December 2023, and Greenstar also held the Note. Canopy issued Greenstar 9,111,549 Exchangeable Shares in connection with the Note Exchange, calculated based on a price per share of C$8.91. As a result of the Transactions, Greenstar and CBG now hold an aggregate of 26,261,474 Exchangeable Shares, which Constellation believes to be all of the issued and outstanding Exchangeable Shares as of April 18, 2024, and no other securities of Canopy. In connection with the Conversion, Greenstar, CBG, and Canopy have terminated the investor rights agreement, administrative services agreement, co-development agreement, and all other commercial arrangements between them and their subsidiaries, other than the consent agreement pursuant to which Greenstar and CBG consented to the Amendment, certain termination agreements, and the Exchange Agreement. As a result, Constellation has no further governance rights in relation to Canopy, including rights to nominate members to the Board of Directors of Canopy (the “Canopy Board”), or approval or consulting rights related to certain transactions of Canopy. All nominees of Constellation resigned from the Canopy Board effective April 18, 2024. Pursuant to their terms, the Exchangeable Shares are convertible into Common Shares on a one-for-one basis at any time at the election of Greenstar and CBG. Greenstar and CBG do not intend to convert any of their outstanding Exchangeable Shares for Common Shares or own any Common Shares, in each case until such time as the U.S. domestic sale of marijuana could not reasonably be expected to violate the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), and all related applicable anti-money laundering laws. For early warning reporting purposes, Constellation will be deemed to beneficially own the Common Shares issuable on conversion of the Exchangeable Shares. Based on the assumptions noted above and assuming no further issuances of Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares, if Constellation were to convert all such Exchangeable Shares into Common Shares it would hold an aggregate of 26,261,474 Common Shares (representing approximately 26.2% of the currently issued and outstanding Common Shares, inclusive of the as-converted Exchangeable Shares). IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Constellation has no other present plans or future intentions that relate to Canopy. Constellation may from time to time dispose of Exchangeable Shares or other securities of Canopy, convert its Exchangeable Shares into Common Shares (provided that Constellation does not intend to convert any of its outstanding Exchangeable Shares for Common Shares or own any Common Shares, in each case until such time as the U.S. domestic sale of marijuana could not reasonably be expected to violate the Controlled Substances Act, the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (as it relates to violation of the Controlled Substances Act), and all related applicable anti-money laundering laws), dispose of any Common Shares acquired upon exchange of Exchangeable Shares, or conduct other transactions, in the future, either on the open market or in private transactions, in each case, depending on a number of factors, including general market and economic conditions, other available investment opportunities, regulatory developments, or other factors determined by Constellation. Depending on market conditions, general economic and industry conditions, Canopy’s business and financial condition, and/or other relevant factors, Constellation may develop other plans or intentions in the future. A copy of the early warning report filed in connection with this press release will be available on Canopy’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca or may be obtained by contacting Constellation’s Investor Center at 1‑888-922-2150.

(HMN or the Company) (Nasdaq:HMNF), the $1.2 billion holding company for Home Federal Savings Bank (the Bank), today reported net income of $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.3 million compared to net income of $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2023. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.30, a decrease of $0.07 from diluted earnings per share of $0.37 for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net income between the periods was due primarily to a $0.8 million decrease in net interest income because of a decline in the net interest margin as a result of funding costs increasing faster than the yields on interest earning assets. This decrease in net income was partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in the provision for credit losses due primarily to a decrease in the general reserves as a result of updating the annual historical vintage loan loss analysis during the quarter. Other non-interest expenses decreased $0.1 million primarily because of a decrease in compensation and benefits expense due to a reduction in incentive accruals. Income tax expense also decreased $0.2 million primarily because of the decrease in pre-tax income. President’s Statement“Maintaining our net interest income was a challenge in the first quarter due to the rates paid on deposits and other funding sources increasing more quickly than the yields earned on our interest earning assets,” said Bradley Krehbiel, President and Chief Executive Officer of HMN. “We are, however, encouraged by the growth in core deposit balances during the quarter and optimistic that net interest margin will slowly improve over time as increases in deposit costs slow and our earning assets reprice to higher current market rates. We will continue to focus our efforts on profitably growing the Company and expanding our core customer deposit relationships.” First Quarter ResultsNet Interest IncomeNet interest income was $7.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.8 million, or 10.0%, compared to $8.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. Interest income was $12.0 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.1 million, or 21.0%, from $9.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Interest income increased primarily because of the increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets between the periods and also because of the $50.3 million increase in the average interest-earning assets. The average yield earned on interest-earning assets was 4.36% for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 56 basis points from 3.80% for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the average yield is primarily related to the increase in market interest rates as a result of the 5.00% increase in the prime interest rate over the past two years. Interest expense was $4.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.8 million, or 156.4%, compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. Interest expense increased primarily because of the increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities between the periods. Interest expense also increased because of the $44.9 million increase in the average interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits between the periods. The average interest rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits was 1.88% for the first quarter of 2024, an increase of 111 basis points from 0.77% for the first quarter of 2023. The increase in the average rate paid is primarily related to the change in the types of funding sources as more brokered deposits and certificates of deposits were used as funding sources in the first quarter of 2024 than were used in the first quarter of 2023. These funding sources generally have higher interest rates than traditional checking and money market accounts. The increase in market interest rates as a result of the 5.00% increase in the federal funds rate over the past two years also contributed to the higher funding costs in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. Net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets) for the first quarter of 2024 was 2.63%, a decrease of 46 basis points, compared to 3.09% for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin is primarily because the increase in the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits exceeded the increase in the average yield earned on interest-earning assets between the periods. A summary of the Company’s net interest margin for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows: For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) AverageOutstandingBalance InterestEarned/Paid Yield/Rate AverageOutstandingBalance InterestEarned/Paid Yield/Rate Interest-earning assets: Securities available for sale$229,901 923 1.61% $268,684 795 1.20%Loans held for sale 1,853 29 6.21 1,216 18 6.04 Single family loans, net 264,791 2,877 4.37 208,127 1,951 3.80 Commercial loans, net 541,148 7,071 5.25 522,921 6,373 4.94 Consumer loans, net 41,502 709 6.87 45,784 661 5.85 Other 28,677 390 5.46 10,814 115 4.31 Total interest-earning assets 1,107,872 11,999 4.36 1,057,546 9,913 3.80 Interest-bearing liabilities: Checking accounts 144,848 306 0.85 161,708 188 0.47 Savings accounts 106,312 28 0.11 120,741 26 0.09 Money market accounts 272,014 1,580 2.34 258,768 655 1.03 Retail certificate accounts 134,195 1,349 4.03 75,938 223 1.19 Wholesale certificate accounts 116,422 1,477 5.09 61,048 711 4.72 Customer escrows 0 0 0.00 6,393 32 2.00 Advances and other borrowings 231 3 5.71 1,219 15 4.86 Total interest-bearing liabilities 774,022 685,815 Non-interest checking 238,329 282,136 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 2,898 2,423 Total interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits$1,015,249 4,743 1.88 $970,374 1,850 0.77 Net interest income $ 7,256 $ 8,063 Net interest rate spread 2.48% 3.03%Net interest margin 2.63% 3.09% Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was ($0.2) million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.2 million compared to the provision for credit losses in the first quarter of 2023. The provision for credit losses decreased in the first quarter of 2024 primarily because of a decrease in the general reserve percentages used to calculate the allowance for credit losses as a result of updating the annual historical vintage loan loss analysis during the quarter. The provision for credit losses was also reduced as a result of the reduction in the required qualitative reserves due to perceived improvements in the forecasted economic conditions. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in the provision as a result of an increase in the allowance for credit losses attributable to loan growth. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Loans evaluated individually are not included in the collective evaluations. The collective reserve amount is assessed based on the size and risk characteristics of the various portfolio segments, past loss history, and other adjustments determined to have a potential impact on future credit losses. A reconciliation of the Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans for the first quarters of 2024 and 2023 is summarized as follows: (Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 Balance at January 1,$11,824 10,277 Adoption of Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-13 0 1,070 Provision (208) (32)Charge offs: Single family (30) 0 Recoveries 0 27 Balance at March 31,$11,586 11,342 Allocated to: Collective allowance$11,167 11,139 Individual allowance 419 203 $11,586 11,342 On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The transition to this ASU resulted in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for credit losses of $1.1 million, an increase in deferred tax assets of $0.3 million, and a decrease to retained earnings of $0.8 million as of the adoption date. In addition, a liability for $0.1 million was established for projected future losses on unfunded commitments on outstanding lines of credit upon adoption. The projected liability for unfunded commitments decreased $1,000 during the first quarter of 2024 and increased $24,000 during the first quarter of 2023.

Non-Interest Income and ExpenseNon-interest income was $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2024, the same as it was for the first quarter of 2023. Fees and service charges decreased $0.1 million between the periods due primarily to a decrease in overdraft fees collected as a result of changes to the Company’s overdraft policy that were implemented in the first quarter of 2024. Loan servicing fees decreased slightly between the periods due to a decrease in the aggregate balances of commercial loans that were being serviced for others. Gain on sales of loans decreased slightly between the periods because of a decrease in the margin realized on loans sold in the secondary market between the periods. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in other non-interest income due primarily to an increase in the income earned on the sales of uninsured investment products between the periods. Non-interest expense was $7.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1.8%, from $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $0.1 million primarily because of a reduction in incentive accruals between the periods. Occupancy and equipment expense decreased $0.1 million due primarily to a decrease in noncapitalized equipment costs between the periods. Other non-interest expense decreased slightly between the periods primarily because of a decrease in advertising costs. These decreases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in professional services expense between the periods primarily because of an increase in legal and other audit related expenses. Data processing expenses increased slightly between the periods primarily because of an increase in core, mobile and on-line banking charges. Income tax expense was $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2024, a decrease of $0.2 million from $0.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in income tax expense between the periods is primarily the result of a decrease in pre-tax income. Return on Assets and EquityReturn on average assets (annualized) for the first quarter of 2024 was 0.46.%, compared to 0.61% for the first quarter of 2023. Return on average equity (annualized) was 4.36% for the first quarter of 2024, compared to 5.64% for the same period in 2023. Book value per common share at March 31, 2024 was $24.39, compared to $22.35 at March 31, 2023. General InformationHMN Financial, Inc. and the Bank are headquartered in Rochester, Minnesota.

(Nasdaq: CELU) (“Celularity”), a regenerative medicine company developing placental-derived allogeneic cell therapies and advanced biomaterial products, today announced that its abstract entitled “Emerging Technologies for the Management and Protection of Tendon Injuries: Decellularized Placental Biomaterials” was accepted by the Orthopedic Research Society (ORS) Tendon Conference, which will be held from May 30 - June 1, 2024 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. The conference theme is “Mechanism to Therapy - Emerging Technologies and Therapeutic Outcomes.” Celularity’s abstract explores the application of various decellularized placental biomaterials, including connective tissue matrix (CTM) and umbilical cord matrix (UCM), in tendon management, both in vitro and in vivo. The abstract focuses on assessing the biomaterials’ biomechanical properties, immunomodulatory effects, and preclinical outcomes in clinically relevant models to advance their potential in tendon repair. Robert J. Hariri, M.D., Ph.D., Celularity Chairman, CEO and Founder, noted, “Tendon injuries, whether due to sports-related activities, overuse, or degenerative conditions, present significant challenges in both treatment and recovery. I am very excited about the growing opportunity and potential of our decellularized placental biomaterials in tendon management and healing. The global tendon market accounted for USD 2.3 billion in 2022 and is projected to achieve a market size of USD 4.8 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 7.6% from 2023 to 2032. We are committed to to growing our regenerative biomaterials business through innovations like this which we believe will significantly contribute to revenue growth. I am confident Celularity’s placental technology can be an important therapeutic tool in the management of these debilitating injuries.” Anna Gosiewska, Ph.D., Vice President of Research and Development for Degenerative Diseases, who leads Celularity’s development of advanced biomaterials and cell technologies, added, “Decellularized placental biomaterials offer a rich source of native, developmentally early extracellular matrix that we believe is beneficial for tissue repair and regeneration. By carefully processing and engineering these biomaterials, Celularity is developing advanced therapeutic solutions tailored specifically for tendon injuries. We believe our innovative technologies utilizing decellularized placental biomaterials represent a novel approach in the field of tendon injury management and may offer patients and healthcare providers new hope for improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life.” The study results described in the abstract provide insights into an in vivo evaluation of Celularity’s decellularized placental biomaterials in two clinically relevant models. The results demonstrate more advanced healing in the UCM treated group and complete incorporation of UCM into the tendon within three months post-implantation. These data indicate that human placental decellularized biomaterials may represent a promising matrix suitable for tendon management and healing. Through strategic collaborations with leading academic institutions and healthcare partners, Celularity is working to advance treatments for musculoskeletal disorders and beyond. The Celularity abstract authors include Dr. Anna Gosiewska, Desiree Long, Dr. Raja Sivalenka, Joseph Gleason, Dr. Adrian Kilcoyne, Dr. Robert J Hariri, and Dr. Steve A Brigido. The study was performed in close collaboration with scientific leaders from some of the nation’s top research organizations. About CelularityCelularity Inc.

The details of the oral presentation are below: Session: Oral Abstract Session IPresentation ID #196Title: Results of a Phase 1, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of Gene Therapy with AAV2-hAQP1 as Treatment for Grade 2 and 3 Radiation-induced Late Xerostomia and Parotid Gland Hypofunction – The AQUAx StudyPresenting Author: Dr. Michael BrennanTime: 4:20pm ET Abstract:Results of a Phase 1, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of Gene Therapy with AAV2-hAQP1 as Treatment for Grade 2 and 3 Radiation-induced Late Xerostomia and Parotid Gland Hypofunction Michael Brennan5, Michael Passineau1, Deborah Saunders4, Herve Sroussi2, Dyani Gaudilliere3, Arthur Fernandez1, Jun Liu1, Nathalie Dubois1, Robert Zeldin11MeiraGTx, New York, NY; 2Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; 3Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA; 4Health Sciences North, Sudbury, ON, Canada; 5Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC; ObjectivesGrade 2/3 late xerostomia is a chronic, debilitating complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers. We assessed the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAQP1 gene therapy as a treatment for this condition. MethodsTwenty-four participants with Grade 2/3 xerostomia at least five years after completing radiotherapy (2 years if HPV+) were enrolled in this multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study. AAV2-hAQP1 was delivered to the parotid gland(s) via cannulation of Stensen’s duct. Twelve participants received AAV2-hAQP1 in one gland and 12 in both glands. Participants were followed for 12 months post-treatment. Safety parameters included adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. Efficacy assessments included the Xerostomia-specific Questionnaire (XQ), MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN), Global Rate of Change Questionnaire (GRCQ), and measurement of unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rates (UWSFR, SWSFR). ResultsNo treatment-related serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicities were reported, and all participants completed the study. Statistically significant improvements were seen in the patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments by Day 30 and were maintained through Month 12, with greater improvement in the bilateral versus unilateral cohorts. At Month 12, the mean percent change from baseline (%CFB) was -39.5% and -42.2% for the XQ Total Score and the Dry Mouth question of the MDASI-HN, respectively, and the mean GRCQ symptom score was 3.8. Overall, 16/24 participants reported an improvement of ≥8 points in the XQ Total Score, and 19/24 participants reported important improvements in xerostomia symptoms based on the GRCQ. The improvement reported across PRO instruments, measuring different aspects of xerostomia symptoms, provides compelling evidence of treatment effectiveness. The mean %CFB in UWSFR at Month 12 was 112.5%, and a trend toward improved SWSFR was observed. ConclusionTreatment with AAV2-hAQP1 was safe and well-tolerated at all doses and resulted in meaningful improvements in xerostomia symptoms and unstimulated whole saliva flow rate. The presentation will be available on the Posters and Publications page of the Company’s website after the respective presentation session has concluded.

Volatility in the industry, revenues, and expenses reported by working interest owners directly affect the Trust's ability to pay distributions to unitholders. Negative Distributions to unitholders will be materially reduced until the Trust increases its cash reserves to $2.0 million. Excess production costs have resulted in substantial accumulated costs, potentially leading to no distributions in some periods. Volatility in the industry and expenses reported by working interest owners may reduce proceeds to the Trust, impacting cash available for distribution to unitholders. Additional expenses and adjustments can further reduce proceeds to the Trust, potentially resulting in no distributions to unitholders in certain periods. 04/18/2024 - 04:24 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mesa Royalty Trust (the “Trust”) (NYSE: MTR) announced today the Trust income distribution for the month of April 2024. Unitholders of record on April 30, 2024 will receive distributions amounting to $0.019208416 per unit, payable on July 31, 2024. The Trust received $89,860, all of which came from the New Mexico portion of the Trust’s San Juan Basin properties operated by Hilcorp San Juan LP, an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. No income was received in April 2024 from any other working interest owner. This month, after the Trust’s withholding for cash reserves and the payment of administrative expenses, income from the distributable net profits was $35,797. The Trust was formed to own an overriding royalty interest of the net proceeds attributable to certain producing oil and gas properties located in the Hugoton field of Kansas and the San Juan Basin fields of New Mexico and Colorado. As described in the Trust's public filings, the amount of the monthly distributions is expected to fluctuate from month to month, depending on the proceeds, if any, received by the Trust as a result of production, oil and natural gas prices and the amount of the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. In addition, as further described in the Trust’s most recent filing on Form 10-K, distributions to unitholders are expected to be materially reduced, until the Trust increases its cash reserves to a total of $2.0 million in order to provide added liquidity. Proceeds reported by the working interest owners for any month are not generally representative of net proceeds that will be received by the Trust in future periods. As further described in the Trust’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, production and development costs for the royalty interest have resulted in substantial accumulated excess production costs, which will decrease Trust distributions, and in some periods may result in no Trust distributions. The amount of proceeds, if any, received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions to unitholders) has been and will continue to be directly affected, among other things, by volatility in the industry and revenues and expenses reported to the Trust by working interest owners. Any additional expenses and adjustments, among other things, will reduce proceeds to the Trust, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. This press release contains forward-looking statements. No assurances can be given that the expectations contained in this press release will prove to be correct. The working interest owners alone control historical operating data, and handle receipt and payment of funds relating to the royalty properties and payments to the Trust for the related royalty. The Trustee cannot assure that errors or adjustments or expenses accrued by the working interest owners, whether historical or future, will not affect future royalty income and distributions by the Trust. Other important factors that could cause these statements to differ materially include delays in actual results of drilling operations, risks inherent in drilling and production of oil and gas properties, declines in commodity pricing, prices received by working interest owners and other risks described in the Trust’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in such risk factors. The Trust does not intend, and assumes no obligations, to update any of the statements included in this press release. Each unitholder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to its particular circumstances.

Positive Return on assets of 1.03% Commercial loan growth of 7% annualized Net interest margin of 3.14% Declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share Approved a stock repurchase plan of up to 5% of outstanding shares Total assets remained at $4.0 billion Total loans grew 2% Allowance for credit losses was flat at $28.4 million Net interest margin decreased to 3.14% from 3.54% in Q1 2023 Total interest and dividend income increased by 13.4% to $45.8 million Non-interest expense rose to $23.7 million Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of an increased dividend to $0.30 per share reflects a positive cash flow situation for Bar Harbor Bankshares and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. This 4.53% annualized yield is attractive, particularly in a fluctuating interest rate environment. The steadiness in dividend growth over seven consecutive years can be seen as a sign of the company's financial health and management's confidence in its continued profitability.The share repurchase plan is another strong signal to the market, suggesting that management believes the stock is undervalued. By repurchasing up to 5% of outstanding shares, the company is not only showing a commitment to shareholder value but is also likely expecting to bolster earnings per share in future periods by reducing the number of shares outstanding. Market Analyst Looking into the loan portfolio growth, the 7% annualized increase in commercial loans indicates an aggressive approach to capitalizing on business growth opportunities. However, the decline in residential loans signifies a response to market conditions, likely due to higher prevailing mortgage rates. This strategic pivot within their loan portfolio could help stabilize their income amidst market volatility.In contrast, the decrease in securities and associated fair value adjustments raises some concern over potential volatility in other areas of the bank's portfolio. This could suggest a strategic shift or a response to market pressures, which stakeholders should monitor closely. Credit Analyst The flat allowance for credit losses might raise some questions about the sufficiency of reserves, particularly in an environment where non-accruing loans have seen an increase. Typically, a bank would adjust its allowance in response to loan growth and macroeconomic trends and stakeholders might expect more conservative provisioning in uncertain economic times.However, the low ratio of non-accruing loans to total loans at 0.23% is encouraging, indicating a strong credit quality within the bank's portfolio. The balance between the desire to release reserves for earnings enhancement and the need to maintain a safety net for loan defaults is a delicate one, which requires careful scrutiny by investors. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM BAR HARBOR, ME / ACCESSWIRE / April 18, 2024 / Bar Harbor Bankshares (NYSE American:BHB) (the ""Company"") reported first quarter 2024 GAAP and core (Non-GAAP) net income of $10.1 million or $0.66 per diluted share compared to $13.0 million or $0.86 per diluted share in the same quarter of 2023.FIRST QUARTER 2024 HIGHLIGHTS• Return on assets of 1.03%• Commercial loan growth of 7% annualized• Net interest margin of 3.14%• Non-accruing loans to total loans ratio of 0.23%Bar Harbor Bankshares' President and Chief Executive Officer, Curtis C. Simard, stated, ""We are pleased to announce our financial results for the first quarter, as we deliver stable earnings which are in line with expectations. We continue to see yield expansion across all earning asset classes. Our liquidity and capital levels remain robust, and our credit metrics are strong with nominal charge-offs. Despite an uncertain economic environment, our performance in the first quarter reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our teams as we execute on our strategy to grow profitably while continuing to conservatively sustain the level of our allowance for credit losses. Our Bar Harbor Wealth Management division combined with our brokerage services crossed a milestone as assets under management grew above $3.0 billion. The Company continues to build long-term shareholder value which has once again enabled us to increase our dividend per share for the seventh straight year by 7% over last year's dividend amount, and approve our annual resolution for a stock buyback program of up to 5% of the total outstanding shares.""DIVIDEND DECLARED AND STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN APPROVEDThe Board of Directors of the Company (the ""Board"") voted to declare a cash dividend of $0.30 per share to shareholders at the close of business on May 16, 2024 payable on June 14, 2024. This dividend equates to a 4.53% annualized yield based on the $26.48 closing share price of the Company's common stock on March 28, 2024, the last trading day of the first quarter 2024. Additionally, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock, representing approximately 761,000 shares as of March 31, 2024 under a share repurchase plan (the ""Plan""). The Plan is authorized to last no longer than twelve months.FINANCIAL CONDITION (March 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023)Total assets were $4.0 billion at the end of both the first quarter of 2024 and the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily due to loan growth offset by lower cash and security balances during the quarter.Total cash and cash equivalents were $76.2 million, compared to $94.8 million at year-end 2023. Interest-earning cash held with other banks totaled $45.3 million compared to $52.6 million at year-end 2023 and yielded 5.88% and 6.42%, respectively.Total loans grew 2%, on an annualized basis and remained at $3 billion at the end of both the first quarter 2024 and fourth quarter 2023. Commercial loans grew by $35.1 million or 7% annualized primarily driven by $22.7 million or 6% increase in commercial real estate and $12.4 million or 12% increase in commercial and industrial growth. Residential loans decreased by $16.7 million or 8% compared to the fourth quarter 2023, primarily due to continued lower demand for prevailing mortgage rates and sales into the secondary market. Tax exempt loans decreased by $4.7 million or 31% driven by payoffs within the first quarter of 2024.Securities decreased to $527.6 million compared to $534.6 million at year-end 2023 driven by $485 thousand in net amortization, and $7.8 million of amortizing securities pay-downs offset by security purchases of $4.8 million. Fair value adjustments decreased the security portfolio by $64.9 million at quarter-end compared to $62.4 million at year-end. The year to date weighted average yield of the securities portfolio was 4.02% compared to 3.85% at year-end primarily due to a run-off of lower coupon fixed-rate securities. As of quarter-end and year-end, our securities portfolio had an average life of nine years with an effective duration of five years and all securities remain classified as available for sale to provide flexibility in asset funding and other opportunities as they arise.The allowance for credit losses remained flat at $28.4 million at the end of the first quarter 2024 compared to the end of the fourth quarter 2023. Our allowance for credit losses continues to be driven by a combination of portfolio loan growth, nominal credit movement and general macroeconomic trends. Non-accruing loans increased during the first quarter 2024 to $6.9 million from $5.5 million in the fourth quarter 2023, but declined on a year-over-year basis. Charge-offs and specific reserves on non-accruing loans remain nominal, with these non-accruing relationships supported by relatively strong collateral values.Total deposits remained at $3.1 billion at the end of the first quarter 2024 and the end of fourth quarter 2023. The $58.4 million decrease in interest bearing demand deposits and the $25.2 million decrease in non-interest bearing demand deposits in the first quarter 2024 were offset by an increase in time deposits of $76.9 million primarily due to remix in higher yielding deposit categories as customers are anticipating rates to decrease and are maximizing their own returns. Brokered certificate of deposit accounts (""CDs"") increased by $55 million, and senior borrowings remained relatively flat at $269.4 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to $271.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2023.The Company's book value per share was $28.64 as of March 31, 2024 compared to $28.48 as of December 31, 2023. Unrealized losses on securities, net of taxes, reduced book value per share by $3.26 and $3.14 at the end of those respective periods. Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP measure) was $20.48 at the end of the first quarter 2024, compared to $20.28 at the end of the fourth quarter 2023.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (March 31, 2024 compared to March 31, 2023)Net interest margin was 3.14% compared to 3.54% in the first quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a higher cost of funds offset by rising asset yields in the first quarter of 2024. The yield on loans grew 49 basis points to 5.31% in the first quarter 2024, up from 4.82% in the same quarter of 2023. Costs of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.48% from 1.39% in the first quarter 2023 showing evolution of the market pricing amongst interest-bearing demand deposits, money market accounts and time deposits as customers are seeking out more competitive rates. We continue to experience a shift in deposit composition from non-maturity deposits to CDs. Cost of borrowing decreased $944 thousand or 22.5% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023 driven by wholesale borrowings in the first quarter 2024 decreased $68.8 million to $269.4 million from $338.2 million in the same quarter of 2023.Total interest and dividend income increased by $5.4 million or 13.4% to $45.8 million compared to $40.4 million in the first quarter 2023 primarily driven by the repricing of adjustable loans and originations of higher fixed rate loans within the commercial portfolio. The yield on commercial real estate loans grew 39 basis points to 5.47% at the end of the first quarter 2024 from 5.08% in the first quarter of 2023. Commercial and industrial yield grew 79 basis points to yield 6.68% at the end of the first quarter 2024 compared to 5.89% at the end of the first quarter 2023. Increases in yields were driven by the current rate environment.The provision for credit losses was $289 thousand compared to $798 thousand in the first quarter of 2023 as net charge-offs to total loans continue to remain nominal. Credit quality continues to be strong as non-accruing loans to total loans declined 3 basis points to 0.23% at the end of the first quarter 2024 compared to 0.26% in the first quarter 2023. Total delinquent and non-accruing loans to total loans declined 15 basis points from 0.52% at the end of the first quarter 2023 to 0.37% in the first quarter 2024.Non-interest income was $8.6 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to $9.2 million in the same quarter 2023 primarily driven by elevated BOLI income of $622 thousand related to one-time death benefits, and customer derivative income $132 thousand at the end of the first quarter 2023. Wealth management income grew 3% to $3.7 million compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter in 2023.Non-interest expense was $23.7 million in the first quarter 2024 compared to $22.7 million in the first quarter 2023 driven by salary and benefits, marketing and other expenses. Salary and benefit expenses increased 4% or $477 thousand from the comparative quarter driven by cost of living increases in the first quarter 2024. Marketing expenses increased to $567 thousand compared to $409 thousand in the first quarter of 2023. Other expenses increased to $4.4 million from $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to increases in assessments, software expenses, and debit card replacement costs in the first quarter of 2024.BACKGROUNDBar Harbor Bankshares (NYSE American:BHB) is the parent company of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.

These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial information. Because non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, these non-GAAP financial measures, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item which management excludes when computing non-GAAP core earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company's results for any particular quarter or year. Each non-GAAP measure used by the Company in this report as supplemental financial data should be considered in conjunction with the Company's GAAP financial information.The Company utilizes the non-GAAP measure of core earnings in evaluating operating trends, including components for core revenue and expense. These measures exclude amounts which the Company views as unrelated to its normalized operations, including gains/losses on securities, premises, equipment and other real estate owned, acquisition costs, restructuring costs, legal settlements, and systems conversion costs. Non-GAAP adjustments are presented net of an adjustment for income tax expense.The Company also calculates core earnings per share based on its measure of core earnings. The Company views these amounts as important to understanding its operating trends, particularly due to the impact of accounting standards related to acquisition activity. Analysts also rely on these measures in estimating and evaluating the Company's performance. Management also believes that the computation of non-GAAP core earnings and core earnings per share may facilitate the comparison of the Company to other companies in the financial services industry. The Company also adjusts certain equity related measures to exclude intangible assets due to the importance of these measures to the investment community.###CONTACTSJosephine Iannelli; EVP, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer; (207) 288-3314 TABLE INDEXCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL SCHEDULES (UNAUDITED) ASelected Financial HighlightsBBalance SheetsCLoan and Deposit AnalysisDStatements of IncomeEStatements of Income (Five Quarter Trend)FAverage Yields and CostsGAverage BalancesHAsset Quality AnalysisI -JReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Five Quarter Trend) and Supplementary DataBAR HARBOR BANKSHARESSELECTED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - UNAUDITED At or for the Quarters Ended Mar 31, Dec 31, Sep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, 2024 2023 2023 2023 2023 PER SHARE DATA Net earnings, diluted $0.66 $0.65 $0.73 $0.71 $0.86 Core earnings, diluted (1) 0.66 0.68 0.73 0.71 0.86 Total book value 28.64 28.48 26.67 27.12 27.00 Tangible book value (1) 20.48 20.28 18.45 18.88 18.74 Market price at period end 26.48 29.36 23.63 24.64 26.45 Dividends 0.28 0.28 0.28 0.28 0.26 PERFORMANCE RATIOS (2) Return on assets 1.03% 1.00% 1.11% 1.10% 1.36%Core return on assets (1) 1.03 1.04 1.11 1.09 1.36 Pre-tax, pre-provision return on assets 1.32 1.34 1.49 1.47 1.81 Core pre-tax, pre-provision return on assets (1) 1.32 1.39 1.49 1.46 1.81 Return on equity 9.31 9.43 10.72 10.49 12.96 Core return on equity (1) 9.32 9.82 10.72 10.42 12.94 Return on tangible equity 13.25 13.65 15.65 15.28 18.97 Core return on tangible equity (1) 13.26 14.21 15.65 15.19 18.94 Net interest margin, fully taxable equivalent (1) (3) 3.14 3.17 3.18 3.22 3.54 Efficiency ratio (1) 62.91 61.38 58.59 60.25 54.72 FINANCIAL DATA (In millions) Total assets $3,959 $3,971 $3,984 $4,029 $3,928 Total earning assets (4) 3,663 3,664 3,687 3,716 3,628 Total investments 538 547 524 556 573 Total loans 3,012 2,999 2,993 3,007 2,944 Allowance for credit losses 28 28 28 27 27 Total goodwill and intangible assets 124 124 125 125 125 Total deposits 3,127 3,141 3,140 3,090 3,054 Total shareholders' equity 436 432 404 411 408 Net income 10 10 11 11 13 Core earnings (1) 10 10 11 11 13 ASSET QUALITY AND CONDITION RATIOS Net charge-offs (recoveries) (5) /average loans 0.01% 0.07% -% -% 0.01%Allowance for credit losses/total loans 0.94 0.94 0.94 0.91 0.90 Loans/deposits 96 95 95 97 96 Shareholders' equity to total assets 11.01 10.88 10.15 10.20 10.40 Tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets 8.13 8.00 7.25 7.32 7.45 Non-GAAP financial measure.

OceanFirst Financial Corp. meldete für das erste Quartal 2024 einen Nettogewinn von 27,7 Millionen Dollar, wobei die Kerngewinne auf 25,6 Millionen Dollar zurückgingen. Das Unternehmen konzentrierte sich auf die Stabilisierung der Nettozinsmarge, Kapitalakkumulation, Kostenmanagement und die Beibehaltung einer starken Vermögensqualität. Der Vorstand erklärte vierteljährliche Barausschüttungen für Inhaber von Stamm- und Vorzugsaktien. Die Schlüssel-Finanzkennzahlen verbesserten sich gegenüber dem Vorjahr, jedoch sanken die Kerngewinne und die Kernverdienste pro Aktie. Positive Stable net interest margin at 2.81% Capital accretion with common equity tier 1 capital ratio at 11.0% Disciplined expense control with non-interest expense decreasing slightly Strong asset quality metrics with low non-performing loans and past-due loans Decrease in net interest income and margin due to higher cost funding Provision for credit losses decreased to $591,000 Increase in other income driven by non-recurring operations Operating expenses decreased due to lower professional fees and compensation expenses Total assets decreased to $13.42 billion, with total liabilities also decreasing Increase in common equity tier one capital ratio to 11.0% Tangible book value per common share increased to $18.63 Negative Core earnings and core diluted earnings per share decreased Net interest income and margin decreased Deposit betas increased to 40% Non-recurring items impacted the quarterly results Increase in provision for income taxes Decrease in total assets and liabilities Financial Analyst OceanFirst Financial Corp.'s recent quarterly report indicates a slight increase in net income available to common stockholders year-over-year, marking a stable financial performance for the company. The increase from $26.9 million to $27.7 million suggests a resilient income stream, despite a challenging higher interest rate environment. However, an important note for investors is the decline in net interest margin from the previous year, decreasing from 3.34% to 2.81%. This compression signals the increasing cost of funds, which could squeeze profitability if the trend continues. Additionally, the efficiency ratio's minor improvement may be indicative of successful cost management strategies, but it remains above the industry standard of 50-60%, potentially signaling room for improvement in operational efficiency. Market Analyst The company's decision to resume share repurchases, which indicates confidence in the firm's financial position and potentially signals to investors a perceived undervaluation of OceanFirst's stock. A total of 957,827 shares were repurchased for $15.1 million, which could provide support for the stock price in the short term. Long-term investors should note the slight build in capital, consistent with a management approach geared towards maintaining a robust balance sheet. The declared dividends illustrate a commitment to returning value to shareholders, contributing to an appealing total shareholder return profile. Risk Analyst From a risk perspective, OceanFirst's asset quality metrics demonstrate strong credit performance, with non-performing loans and loans past due remaining low. This is a key indicator of the bank's asset management quality and suggests financial stability. In terms of credit risk management, a decreased provision for credit losses from the prior year might reflect an improved economic outlook or a tighter credit underwriting standard. However, the slight uptick in non-performing loans should be monitored, as it could suggest potential headwinds in loan repayment should economic conditions deteriorate. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM RED BANK, N.J., April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp.

Maher, commented on the Company’s results, “We are pleased to report on our first quarter results, which reflected a stable net interest margin, prudent balance sheet management, and expense discipline. Additionally, we continued to build capital while also resuming share repurchases during the quarter.” Mr. Maher added, “The Company is well positioned to bolster shareholder value through a variety of different economic and industry outlooks.” The Company’s Board of Directors declared its 109th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on common stock. The quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.20 per share will be paid on May 17, 2024 to common stockholders of record on May 6, 2024.

For the periods presented, core earnings exclude merger related expenses, net branch consolidation expense, net (gain) loss on equity investments, net loss on sale of investments, net gain on sale of trust business, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment, and the income tax effect of these items, (collectively referred to as “non-core” operations). PTPP excludes the aforementioned pre-tax “non-core” items along with income tax expense (benefit) and provision for credit losses. Refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” tables for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.2 Tangible book value per common share and tangible common equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude the impact of intangible assets, goodwill, and preferred equity from both stockholders’ equity and total assets. Refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” tables for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Results of Operations The current quarter results were impacted by the following matters. Net interest income and margin were modestly impacted by a continued mix-shift to and repricing of higher cost funding that offset the increase in yields on interest-earning assets. Deposit betas increased modestly to 40%, from 38% in the prior linked quarter3. Additionally, the results included several non-recurring matters, which included a $1.2 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company’s trust business, a $1.2 million write-off in income tax expense, $418,000 in FDIC special assessments, and $345,000 in bank owned life insurance death benefits. 3 Deposit beta measures the change in the interest rates paid for interest-bearing deposit accounts versus the change in the federal funds target rate. Represents the deposit beta for total deposits (interest-bearing and non-interest bearing) for the current rate cycle (since December 31, 2021). Net Interest Income and Margin March 31, 2024 vs. March 31, 2023 Net interest income decreased to $86.2 million, from $98.8 million, primarily reflecting the net impact of the higher interest rate environment. Net interest margin decreased to 2.81%, from 3.34%. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion and prepayment fees of 0.04% for both quarters, net interest margin decreased to 2.77%, from 3.30%. Net interest margin decreased primarily due to the increase in cost of funds outpacing the increase in yield on average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased by $340.3 million, primarily driven by growth of $163.9 million in total loans and $143.0 million in securities. The average yield for interest-earning assets increased to 5.26%, from 4.68%. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.03%, from 1.74%, primarily due to higher cost of deposits. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased to 2.31%, from 0.88%. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $636.4 million, primarily due to an increase in total deposits, partly offset by a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances, which reflect a shift in funding sources. March 31, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Net interest income decreased by $1.6 million, reflecting a slight decrease in net interest margin to 2.81%, from 2.82%, as the increase in cost of funds was offset by yields of average interest earning assets. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion and prepayment fees of 0.04% and 0.05% for the respective quarters, net interest margin remained flat at 2.77% for both periods. Average interest-earning assets increased by $1.2 million, and the yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.26%, from 5.16% primarily due to securities purchased at the end of the prior linked quarter. The total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.03%, from 2.91%, primarily due to higher cost of deposits and increased other borrowings. Total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased to 2.31%, from 2.22%. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $91.2 million, primarily due to a mix shift from deposits to other borrowings. Provision for Credit Losses Provision for credit losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $591,000, as compared to $3.0 million and $3.2 million for the corresponding prior year period and prior linked quarter, respectively. The current quarter provision was driven by the net effect of continued uncertainty impacting the banking industry and improvements in macro-economic forecasts. Net loan charge-offs were $349,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily related to a single consumer borrower, as compared to net loan recoveries of $47,000 for the corresponding prior year period. Net loan charge-offs were $35,000 in the prior linked quarter. Refer to “Asset Quality” section for further discussion. Non-interest Income March 31, 2024 vs. March 31, 2023 Other income increased to $12.3 million, as compared to $2.1 million. The current quarter’s other income was favorably impacted by non-core operations of $3.1 million related to net gains on equity investments and a gain on sale of a portion of its trust business. The prior year period’s other income was adversely impacted by non-core operations of $7.5 million, primarily related to losses on sale of investments. Excluding non-core operations, other income decreased by $370,000, primarily driven by a decrease in fees and service charges of $686,000 on lower retail deposit fees and title activity. March 31, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Other income in the prior linked quarter was $11.9 million and included non-core operations of $2.2 million related to net gains on equity investments. Excluding non-core operations, other income decreased by $484,000, primarily due to a decrease in fees and service charges of $842,000, which was driven by the same factors as noted above. Non-interest Expense March 31, 2024 vs. March 31, 2023 Operating expenses decreased to $58.7 million, as compared to $61.3 million. Operating expenses were adversely impacted by non-core items of $418,000, from an FDIC special assessment in the current year, and $92,000 from merger related and net branch consolidation expenses in the prior year. Excluding non-core operations, operating expenses decreased $3.0 million. The primary drivers were decreases in professional fees of $2.4 million and compensation and employee benefits expenses of $1.2 million, which reflect the net realization of the Company’s performance improvements initiatives and strategic investments made over the past year. March 31, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Operating expenses in the prior linked quarter was $60.2 million and included non-core operations of $1.7 million, related to an FDIC special assessment. Excluding non-core operations, operating expenses decreased by $272,000. Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was $10.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $8.7 million for the same prior year period, and $8.6 million for the prior linked quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as compared to 23.7% for the same prior year period, and 23.6% for the prior linked quarter. The current quarter's effective tax rate was negatively impacted by 3.0% due to a one-time write-off of a deferred tax asset of $1.2 million. Financial Condition March 31, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Total assets decreased by $119.3 million to $13.42 billion, from $13.54 billion, primarily due to decreases in loans and debt securities. Total loans decreased by $68.9 million to $10.13 billion, from $10.19 billion, due to loan payoffs and lower loan originations. Held-to-maturity debt securities decreased by $31.1 million to $1.13 billion, from $1.16 billion, primarily due to principal repayments. Other assets increased by $20.3 million to $200.0 million, from $179.7 million, primarily due to increase in market values associated with customer interest rate swap programs. Total liabilities decreased by $123.2 million to $11.75 billion, from $11.88 billion primarily related to lower deposits and a funding mix shift. Deposits decreased by $198.1 million to $10.24 billion, from $10.43 billion. Time deposits decreased to $2.32 billion, from $2.45 billion, or 22.7% and 23.4% of total deposits, respectively, which was primarily related to planned runoff of brokered time deposits which decreased by $88.1 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 98.9%, as compared to 97.7%. FHLB advances decreased by $190.2 million to $658.4 million, from $848.6 million due to mix shift in funding sources to other borrowings, which increased by $229.3 million to $425.7 million, from $196.5 million, as a result of lower cost funding availability. Other liabilities increased by $36.4 million to $337.1 million, from $300.7 million, primarily due to an increase in the market values associated with customer interest rate swaps and related collateral received from counterparties. Capital levels remain strong and in excess of “well-capitalized” regulatory levels at March 31, 2024 including the Company’s common equity tier one capital ratio which increased to 11.0%, up approximately 15 basis points from December 31, 2023. Total stockholders’ equity increased to $1.67 billion, as compared to $1.66 billion, primarily reflecting net income, partially offset by capital returns comprising of share repurchases and dividends. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 957,827 shares totaling $15.1 million representing a weighted average cost of $15.64. The Company had 1,976,611 shares available for repurchase under the repurchase program authorized. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by $1.4 million primarily due to increases in fair market value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax. The Company’s tangible common equity2 increased by $4.7 million to $1.10 billion. The Company’s stockholders’ equity to assets ratio was 12.41% at March 31, 2024, and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased by 11 basis points during the quarter to 8.49%, primarily due to the drivers described above. Book value per common share increased to $28.32, as compared to $27.96. Tangible book value per common share2 increased to $18.63, as compared to $18.35. Asset Quality March 31, 2024 vs. December 31, 2023 Overall asset quality metrics remained stable for the quarter. The Company’s non-performing loans increased to $35.0 million from $29.5 million and represented 0.35% and 0.29% of total loans, respectively. The allowance for loan credit losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 191.86%, as compared to 227.21%. The level of 30 to 89 days delinquent loans decreased to $17.5 million, from $19.2 million. The Company’s allowance for loan credit losses was 0.66% of total loans for each period. Refer to “Provision for Credit Losses” section for further discussion. The Company’s asset quality, excluding purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD”) loans, was as follows. Non-performing loans increased to $31.5 million, from $26.4 million. The allowance for loan credit losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 213.34%, as compared to 254.64%. The level of 30 to 89 days delinquent loans, excluding non-performing loans, decreased to $15.4 million, from $17.7 million. The allowance for loan credit losses plus the unamortized credit and PCD marks amounted to $74.2 million, or 0.73% of total loans, as compared to $74.7 million, or 0.73% of total loans. Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding non-core operations and in some instances excluding income taxes and provision for credit losses, and reporting equity and asset amounts excluding intangible assets, goodwill or preferred stock, all of which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and, therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, which may be presented by other companies.

Asset quality improved, with non-performing loans decreasing to $7.8 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $10.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst Chemung Financial Corporation's reported net income of $7.1 million, translating to $1.48 per share, marks a notable uptick from the previous quarter's $3.8 million ($0.80 per share), albeit a slight dip from $7.3 million ($1.54 per share) year-over-year. Observing the expansion of their loan portfolio to over $2.0 billion for the first time signals robust growth and business development. This expansion aligns with an incremental rise in the net interest margin to 2.73%, up from 2.69%. The corporation's strategic positioning to strengthen its provisions for credit losses, which saw a $4.3 million decrease from the last quarter, appears to be in response to an improved economic outlook and a refined CECL model. Additionally, manageable non-performing loans at 0.39% present a healthy credit quality landscape. For investors, the sustainability of these metrics amidst evolving market conditions is paramount. The dividend declaration of $0.31 per share also suggests confidence in the corporation’s liquidity and profitability. Market Research Analyst The trend of expanding loan portfolios and credit quality improvements, as evidenced by the decrease in non-performing loans ratio to 0.39%, could be indicative of a broader industry shift towards risk management and quality lending. What's particularly intriguing is the ability of Chemung Financial Corporation to increase its loan portfolio during a period that is described as challenging, reflecting a resilient and perhaps conservative approach to growth. The reported increase in deposit interest expense, however, points towards a tightening of the net interest margin in the near future, given the rising interest rate environment. Investors should keep an eye on these evolving dynamics as they may impact future profitability. The growth in non-interest income, though modest, suggests a diversification of revenue streams which can help buffer against interest rate pressures. Risk Management Analyst The provision for credit losses decrease suggests a proactive approach to risk management, aligning with favorable economic forecasts and a refined CECL model. However, the long-term sustainability of these provisions should be monitored closely, especially given the rising interest rate environment, which could put pressure on borrowers and potentially lead to an uptick in non-performing loans. Continued stability in loan delinquencies, particularly in the commercial and residential mortgage sectors, will be vital for investors to evaluate the risk profile of the institution. Chemung Financial's cautious optimism, as evidenced by their actions, should be balanced against the potential for economic headwinds that may not have fully materialized in the current reporting period. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM ELMIRA, N.Y., April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chemung Financial Corporation (the “Corporation”) (Nasdaq: CHMG), the parent company of Chemung Canal Trust Company (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $7.1 million, or $1.48 per share, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $3.8 million, or $0.80 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $7.3 million, or $1.54 per share, for the first quarter of 2023. “We have started out 2024 with another strong quarter of results from our core businesses,” said Anders M. Tomson, President and CEO of the Corporation. “Improving credit metrics and 6% annualized loan growth in a challenging environment is an endorsement of our client focused business model and franchise,“ Tomson added. First Quarter Highlights: Total loans exceeded $2.0 billion for the first time in the Corporation's 190-year history, growing $30.9 million during the first quarter.1Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin expanded by four basis points during the first quarter of 2024 to 2.73%, from 2.69% during the fourth quarter of 2023.2Non-performing loans to total loans decreased by 14 basis points to 0.39% as of March 31, 2024, from 0.53% as of December 31, 2023.1Dividends declared during the first quarter 2024 were $0.31 per share. 1 Balance sheet comparisons are calculated as of March 31, 2024 versus December 31, 2023. 2 See the GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations. 1st Quarter 2024 vs 4th Quarter 2023 Net Interest Income: Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $18.1 million compared to $17.9 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1.1%, driven primarily by an increase of $1.1 million in interest income on loans, including fees, offset by increases of $0.8 million in interest expense on deposits and $0.2 million in interest expense on borrowed funds. Interest income on loans, including fees, increased primarily due to a $37.8 million increase in average commercial loan balances, and a 21 basis points increase in the average yield on commercial loans, compared to the prior quarter. Interest income on commercial loans for the first quarter of 2024 included $0.3 million in deferred interest recognized on the payoff of a nonaccrual commercial real estate loan. Average balances of consumer and residential mortgage loans decreased by $2.9 million and $1.7 million respectively, while the average yield on these loan categories each increased 15 basis points, compared to the prior quarter. The Corporation continued to see demand for new commercial originations, while demand for new consumer and residential mortgage loans remained subdued due to current market conditions. Interest expense on deposits increased primarily due to an increase of 16 basis points in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, and growth in average balances of customer and brokered deposits. Average balances of total customer interest-bearing deposits increased $21.6 million and average balances of brokered deposits increased $17.4 million compared to the prior quarter. The cost of customer time deposits increased 21 basis points compared to the prior quarter, and comprised 20.1% of average total deposits as of March 31, 2024, compared to 18.7% as of December 31, 2023. A continuation of CD campaigns was primarily responsible for the increase in average balances and the cost of customer time deposits during the current quarter. Pressures on pricing continued during the current quarter due to both competition and market expectations, while the shift in deposit mix towards higher cost accounts softened in the current quarter, compared to the shift experienced throughout 2022 and 2023. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was due primarily to an increase in average balances of borrowed funds of $19.9 million in the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter, due to a $50.0 million advance from the FRB Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) at an interest rate of 4.91%. The advance is due in January 2025 and is prepayable at any time prior to maturity, without prepayment penalty. Average balances of FHLBNY overnight advances decreased $18.5 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the utilization of the lower cost BTFP advance. The average cost of total borrowings for the current quarter was 5.15%, compared to 5.52% in the prior quarter, a decrease of 37 basis points. Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.73% in the current quarter, compared to 2.69% in the prior quarter. Net interest margin expansion in the current quarter was primarily attributable to $0.3 million in interest income recognized on the payoff of a nonaccrual commercial loan. Average balances of interest-earning assets increased $26.4 million in the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter, and the average yield on interest-earning assets increased 20 basis points, compared to the prior quarter, to 4.70%. For the current quarter, the average cost of interest- bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points, compared to the prior quarter, to 2.85%. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased $4.3 million during the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in the current quarter was primarily due to the annual review and update of the loss drivers used in the Bank's CECL model, $0.3 million in paydowns on loans analyzed on an individual basis which have specific reserve allocations, and continued favorable FOMC forecasts for unemployment and GDP growth. The Bank's updated loss drivers resulted in lower loss experience over the historical look back period, however the economic factors used did not change as a result of these updates. Provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2023 was primarily attributable to a $0.9 million specific allocation on a commercial real estate relationship, a decline in prepayment assumptions, and loan growth. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.7 million, compared to $5.9 million for the prior quarter, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 3.4%. The decrease was driven primarily by decreases of $0.1 million each in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange revenue from debit card transactions, and the change in fair value of equity investments, partially offset by a $0.1 million increase in other non-interest income. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts was primarily attributable to a decrease in NSF activity in the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in interchange revenue on debit card transactions was primarily attributable to greater transactional volume in the prior quarter, compared to the current quarter. The decrease in the change in fair value of equity investments was primarily attributable to disbursements related to the Corporation's deferred compensation plan. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily attributable to the receipt of Mastercard incentives in the current quarter. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $16.7 million, compared to $16.8 million for the prior quarter, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 0.8%. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease of $0.7 million in other non-interest expense, partially offset by increases of $0.2 million in salaries and wages, $0.2 million in pension and other employee benefits, $0.1 million in marketing and advertising expenses, and $0.1 million in other real estate owned expenses. The decrease in other non-interest expense in the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter, was primarily due to decreases in expenses across a majority of included expense categories, including non-loan charge offs and charitable contributions. Salaries and wages increased in the current quarter compared to the prior quarter primarily due to increases in expenses related to the Corporation's reward program and base wages. The increase in pension and other employee benefits was primarily due to an increase in payroll tax expense in the current quarter, compared to the prior quarter. The increase in marketing and advertising expense was primarily related to promotion of the Corporation's 190th anniversary checking account campaign, a new CD campaign, as well as resumed marketing and advertising efforts overall, compared to the prior quarter. The increase in other real estate owned expenses was primarily due to gains on the transfer of two properties to OREO in the prior period. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.0 million, compared to $0.8 million for the prior quarter, an increase of $1.2 million. The effective tax rate for the current quarter increased to 22.4% from 18.1% in the prior quarter. The increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax income. 1st Quarter 2024 vs 1st Quarter 2023 Net Interest Income: Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $18.1 million compared to $19.9 million for the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 8.8%, driven primarily by increases of $6.8 million in interest expense on deposits and $0.1 million in interest expense on borrowed funds, offset by increases of $4.9 million in interest income on loans, including fees, and $0.1 million in interest-earning deposits. Interest income on taxable securities was comparable between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. The increase in interest expense on deposits was due primarily to a 141 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, which included brokered deposits, and an increase of $134.2 million in the average balance of customer interest-bearing deposits. The average balance of brokered deposits increased $8.3 million, and the average interest rate paid on brokered deposits increased 50 basis points, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in interest expense on borrowed funds was primarily due to a 24 basis points increase in the average interest rate paid and a $2.4 million increase in the average balances of borrowed funds. Changes in the composition of borrowed funds reflects the Corporation's shift to the lower cost funding source of the BTFP, partially replacing relatively higher cost FHLBNY overnight advances. The average balances of FHLBNY overnight advances decreased $35.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year, and the average interest rate paid on FHLBNY overnight advances increased 55 basis points. Interest income on loans, including fees, increased primarily due to a $145.9 million increase in average commercial loan balances, compared to the same period in the prior year, and an increase of 57 basis points in the average yield on commercial loans between these periods, due to the rising interest rate environment. Average consumer loan balances, supported by growth in the indirect auto portfolio, increased $1.9 million, and the average yield on consumer loans increased 90 basis points, primarily due to originations of higher rate indirect auto loans, and interest rate increases on variable rate home equity loans. Average balances of residential mortgage loans decreased $7.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, due to adverse conditions for borrowers in the residential real estate market, while the average yield on residential mortgage loans increased 23 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest and dividend income on taxable securities was comparable between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. During this period, the average yield on taxable securities increased 17 basis points, due to an increase in interest rates on variable rate securities. This increase was offset by $54.4 million in paydowns and maturities on securities held in the portfolio between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. Fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 2.73% for the first quarter 2024, compared to 3.14% for the same period in the prior year. The Corporation exhibited a greater level of liability sensitivity throughout 2023 and early 2024, after reaching an inflection point in the fourth quarter of 2022. Average interest-earning assets increased $88.4 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 58 basis points to 4.70%, while the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 136 basis points to 2.85%, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to the rising interest rate environment, as well as a shift in the overall deposit mix to higher-cost account types, compared to the same period in the prior year. Provision for Credit Losses: Provision for credit losses decreased $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease in provision was primarily attributable to the annual review and update of the loss drivers used in the Bank's CECL model, favorable changes in economic forecasts, and a comparatively smaller increase in loan volume during the current period. The Bank's updated loss drivers resulted in lower loss experience over the historical look back period, however the economic factors used did not change as a result of these updates. FOMC forecasts improved substantially between the first quarters of 2023 and 2024. Forecasted year-end 2023 U.S. unemployment was projected at 4.5% as of March 2023, and year-end 2024 unemployment was projected at 4.0% as of March 2024. U.S annual GDP growth was projected at 0.4% for year-end 2023 as of March 2023, and year-end 2024 U.S. annual GDP growth was projected at 2.1% as of March 2024. 2023 FOMC projections reflected uncertainty concerning the impact of interest rate increases in the wake of multiple regional banks being placed into receivership prior to the FOMC's March 2023 meeting. Loan growth in the first quarter of 2024 totaled $30.9 million, compared to $44.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in lower volume-related provisioning in the current period. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2024 was $5.7 million compared to $5.4 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.3 million, or 5.6%. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $0.1 million in both wealth management group fee income other non-interest income. The increase in wealth management group fee income was primarily attributable to an increase in assets under management in the first quarter of the current year, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in other non-interest income was primarily related to gains on the transfer of two properties to OREO in the current period. Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $16.7 million compared to $15.8 million for the same period in the prior year, an increase of $0.9 million, or 5.7%. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $0.4 million in pension and other employee benefits, $0.2 million in salaries and wages, $0.2 million in data processing, and $0.1 million in professional services, offset by a decrease of $0.2 million in other non-interest expense. The increase in pension and other employee benefits for the current quarter was primarily attributable to an increase in employee healthcare expense, compared to the same period in the prior year. Salaries and wages increased in the current quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in base wages, severance expense, and an increase in the market value of the Corporation's deferred compensation plan. The increase in data processing expense in the current quarter was primarily attributable to increases in software related expenses, compared to the same period in the prior year. Professional services increased in the current quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to outsourced services related to the realignment of certain back office functions, new strategic consulting arrangements, and fee increases. The decrease in other non-interest expense was primarily attributable to decreases across a majority of included expense categories in the current quarter, compared to the same period in the prior year. Income Tax Expense:Income tax expense of $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 was comparable with the first quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the current quarter was 22.4%, compared to 21.5% for the same period in the prior year. Asset Quality Non-performing loans totaled $7.8 million as of March 31, 2024, or 0.39% of total loans, compared to $10.4 million, or 0.53% of total loans as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in non-performing loans was primarily attributable to the payoff of a nonaccrual commercial real estate loan totaling $1.9 million, as well as $0.5 million in paydown activity on other nonaccrual commercial loans, inclusive of $0.2 million in paydowns relating to the commercial real estate relationship for which a $0.9 million specific reserve allocation was made in the prior quarter. Non-performing assets, which are comprised of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, were $8.4 million, or 0.30% of total assets, as of March 31, 2024, compared to $10.7 million, or 0.40% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in non-performing assets can be attributed to the decrease in non-performing loans. Total loan delinquencies as of March 31, 2024 declined compared to December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to a decline in consumer loan delinquency rates during the period, consistent with the Corporation's past experience of seasonal fluctuations, particularly for auto loans. Commercial loan and residential mortgage delinquencies remained stable as of March 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, and management continues to monitor the impacts that elevated interest rates may have on its borrower base. Annualized net charge-offs to total average loans for the first quarter of 2024 were 0.04%, compared to 0.05% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Annualized consumer net charge-offs for the period ended March 31, 2024 were 0.30% of average consumer loans, primarily concentrated in auto loans, while commercial loans and residential mortgage loans each had net recoveries during the period ended March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses was $20.5 million as of March 31, 2024, and $22.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments, a component of other liabilities, was $0.7 million as of March 31, 2024 and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses was primarily attributable to the aforementioned annual review and update to the loss drivers which the Bank's CECL model is based upon. Loss drivers are the economic variables used to make forward looking credit loss projections by determining correlations between changes in the underlying economic variables and changes in historical loss experience over a predefined historical period. Peer loss experience is utilized to supplement the Bank's own historical loss experience. Recalibration of the loss drivers resulted in a decline in the baseline loss rates which the model utilizes. Additionally, FOMC projections for the economic variables used in the model improved between December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. Projected year-end 2024 U.S. unemployment improved from 4.1% in December 2023 to 4.0% in March 2024. Actual unemployment rates between January 2022 and March 2024 have remained at or below 4.0% for the longest continuous duration since the 49-month period ended February 1970, keeping projection levels below historical norms. Projected year-end 2024 U.S annual GDP growth improved from 1.4% in December 2023 to 2.1% in March 2024. The allowance for credit losses was 261.28% of non-performing loans as of March 31, 2024 and 216.28% as of December 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to total loans was 1.02% as of March 31, 2024 and 1.14% as of December 31,2023. Balance Sheet Activity Total assets were $2.785 billion as of March 31, 2024 compared to $2.711 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $74.4 million, or 2.7%. The increase can mostly be attributed to increases of $58.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $30.9 million in loans, net of deferred origination fees and costs, $2.6 million in accrued interest receivable and other assets, and a decrease of $2.0 million in the allowance for credit losses, offset by a decrease of $19.4 million in total investment securities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to increases of $51.3 million in total deposits, $50.0 million in advances from the Federal Reserve BTFP, and $11.9 million related to paydowns and maturities of securities in the available for sale portfolio, offset by an increase of $30.9 million in loans, net of deferred origination fees and costs, and a decrease of $31.9 million in FHLBNY overnight advances. The increase in loans, net of deferred origination fees and costs, was concentrated in the commercial loan portfolio, which increased $38.1 million, or 2.7%. Consumer loans decreased $6.4 million, or 2.1%, primarily driven by weaker demand for originations in the indirect auto segment, and the relatively fast turnover rate of the portfolio. The residential mortgage portfolio decreased $0.7 million, or 0.3%, as the Corporation continued to elect to sell a greater proportion of originations into the secondary market, and constrained residential real estate market conditions impacted demand. Total investment securities decreased primarily due to a decrease of $18.0 million in securities available for sale. Net paydowns and maturities on securities available for sale for the first quarter totaled $11.9 million, primarily attributable to paydowns on mortgage-backed securities and SBA pooled-loan securities. The market value of securities available for sale declined $5.5 million, due to unfavorable changes in interest rates during the quarter. FHLB stock decreased $1.4 million due to lower FHLBNY overnight advance borrowing activity as of the end of the current quarter, compared to prior year-end. The increase in accrued interest receivable and other assets was primarily due to increases in interest rate swap assets of $1.3 million, due to an increase in the market value of swaps, and accrued interest receivable of $1.2 million, primarily on loans. Total liabilities were $2.588 billion as of March 31, 2024 compared to $2.515 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $72.5 million, or 2.9%. The increase in total liabilities can primarily be attributed to increases of $51.3 million in deposits, $18.0 million in advances and other debt, and $2.8 million in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. Total deposits increased $51.3 million or 2.1%, compared to prior year-end, primarily due to increases of $24.0 million in interest-bearing demand deposits, or 8.2%, and $17.1 million in total time deposits, or 2.8%, which include customer time deposits and brokered deposits. Customer time deposits increased $33.9 million, while brokered deposits decreased $16.8 million. Additionally, money market deposits and non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $7.6 million and $3.2 million respectively, compared to prior year-end. Savings deposits decreased by $0.6 million compared to prior year-end. Non-interest bearing deposits comprised 26.5% and 26.9% of total deposits as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively. The increase in advances and other debt can primarily be attributed to a $50.0 million advance from the Federal Reserve, as the Corporation took advantage of lower interest rates offered by the BTFP, offset by a decrease of $31.9 million in FHLBNY overnight advances. The increase in accrued interest payable and other liabilities was primarily due to increases in the interest rate swap liability of $1.2 million, primarily due to an increase in the market value of swaps, and accrued interest payable of $1.9 million, primarily on deposits. Total shareholders’ equity was $197.1 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to $195.2 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.9 million, or 1.0%, primarily driven by an increase of $5.6 million in retained earnings, offset by an increase of $4.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss, as a result of increases in interest rates. The increase in retained earnings was due primarily to net income of $7.1 million, offset by dividends declared of $1.5 million. The total equity to total assets ratio was 7.08% as of March 31, 2024, compared to 7.20% as of December 31, 2023. The tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 6.34% as of March 31, 2024 compared to 6.45% as of December 31, 20231. Book value per share increased to $41.35 as of March 31, 2024 from $41.07 as of December 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2024, the Bank’s capital ratios were in excess of those required to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. 1 See the GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations Liquidity The Corporation uses a variety of resources to manage its liquidity, and management believes it has the necessary liquidity to allow for flexibility in meeting its various business needs. These include short term investments, cash flow from lending and investing activities, core-deposit growth and non-core funding sources, such as time deposits of $250,000 or greater, brokered deposits, FHLBNY advances, and FRB Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) advances. No new borrowings may be made under the BTFP after March 11, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents balance was $94.9 million. The Corporation also maintains an investment portfolio of securities available for sale, comprised primarily of US Government treasury securities, SBA loan pools, mortgage-backed securities, and municipal bonds. Although this portfolio generates interest income for the Corporation, it also serves as an available source of liquidity and capital if the need should arise. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation's investment in securities available for sale was $566.0 million, $240.3 million of which was not pledged as collateral. Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, the Bank's overnight advance line capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York was $231.0 million, of which $54.1 million in US Government treasury securities was considered unpledged. None of the available capacity at the FHLB was utilized as of March 31, 2024. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis for liquidity purposes or on a long-term basis to fund asset growth. In January 2024, the Corporation utilized the BTFP with an advance of $50.0 million, maturing in January 2025, however BTFP advances may be prepaid at any time without prepayment penalty. As of March 31, 2024, uninsured deposits totaled $689.4 million, or 27.8% of total deposits, including $190.7 million of municipal deposits that were collateralized by pledged assets. As of December 31, 2023, uninsured deposits totaled $655.7 million, or 27.0% of total deposits, including $152.9 million of municipal deposits that were collateralized by pledged assets. Due to their fluidity, the Corporation closely monitors uninsured deposit levels when considering liquidity management strategies. The Corporation considers brokered deposits to be an element of its deposit strategy, and anticipates it will continue utilizing brokered deposits as a secondary source of funding in support of growth. As of March 31, 2024, the Corporation has entered into brokered deposit arrangements with multiple brokers. As of March 31, 2024, brokered deposits carried terms between 2 and 48 months, with staggered maturities, totaling $126.0 million. Excluding brokered deposits, total deposits increased $68.1 million compared to December 31, 2023.

Chemung Financial Corporation GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations (Unaudited) The Corporation prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP. See the Corporation’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets and statements of income contained within this press release. That presentation provides the reader with an understanding of the Corporation’s results that can be tracked consistently from period-to-period and enables a comparison of the Corporation’s performance with other companies’ GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Corporation’s results on a reported basis, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, because it believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Corporation and, therefore, facilitate a comparison of the Corporation with the performance of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The SEC has adopted Regulation G, which applies to all public disclosures, including earnings releases, made by registered companies that contain “non-GAAP financial measures.” Under Regulation G, companies making public disclosures containing non- GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure, certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure and a statement of the Corporation’s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP financial measure as part of its financial disclosures. The SEC has exempted from the definition of “non-GAAP financial measures” certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. When these exempted measures are included in public disclosures, supplemental information is not required. The following measures used in this Report, which are commonly utilized by financial institutions, have not been specifically exempted by the SEC and may constitute ""non-GAAP financial measures"" within the meaning of the SEC's rules, although we are unable to state with certainty that the SEC would so regard them. Fully Taxable Equivalent Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Net interest income is commonly presented on a tax-equivalent basis. That is, to the extent that some component of the institution's net interest income, which is presented on a before-tax basis, is exempt from taxation (e.g., is received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added to the actual before-tax net interest income total. This adjustment is considered helpful in comparing one financial institution's net interest income to that of other institutions or in analyzing any institution’s net interest income trend line over time, to correct any analytical distortion that might otherwise arise from the fact that financial institutions vary widely in the proportions of their portfolios that are invested in tax-exempt securities, and that even a single institution may significantly alter over time the proportion of its own portfolio that is invested in tax-exempt obligations. Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. For purposes of this measure as well, fully taxable equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, as opposed to actual net interest income, again to provide a better basis of comparison from institution to institution and to better demonstrate a single institution’s performance over time. The Corporation follows these practices.

The adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents the Corporation’s ability to turn resources into revenue and is calculated as non-interest expense divided by total revenue (fully taxable equivalent net interest income and non- interest income), adjusted for one-time occurrences and amortization. This measure is meaningful to the Corporation, as well as investors and analysts, in assessing the Corporation’s productivity measured by the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.

Tangible assets represents the Corporation’s total assets, less goodwill and other intangible assets.

(CSE: KBX) (FSE: F3I) (OTCQB: KBXFF) (""Kobrea"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to introduce the Upland Copper Project (""Upland Copper"" or the ""Project"") and discuss upcoming 2024 exploration plans. The 5,300 hectare, road-accessible project is located 20 kilometres northeast of the town of Barriere and 20 kilometres south of the Taseko Mines Limited's Yellowhead Project (Figure 1) in south-central British Columbia. Upland Copper is host to a copper-dominant, remobilized polymetallic volcanogenic massive sulphide deposit that is open for expansion.Figure 1 - Location map. *The Company notes that mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby and/or geologically similar properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization hosted on the Project.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/10375/206078_20010861b43eb961_001full.jpgUpland Copper ProjectThe first recorded exploration programs on Upland Copper Project began in 1965 after local prospectors discovered mineralized float boulders southeast of the Project. Numerous geophysical, geochemical and diamond drilling programs were completed between 1965 and 2010 on the Project.50 drill holes totaling 8,095 metres, completed by previous operators on the Project, have outlined copper mineralization over a 1.6 km by 1.0 km area (Figure 2). Historical drilling indicates that mineralization is open to depth, with numerous holes bottoming in copper mineralization including drill hole P-70-9 which averaged 0.32% over the entire 74 metres of the hole (Figures 3 & 4). The deepest drilling to date reached a depth of 235 metres.A total of 3,260 soil samples have been collected on the Project by previous operators. Such samples have outlined a 3.7 km by 1.0 km copper-in-soil anomaly that coincides well with copper mineralization intersected in historical drilling. Anomalous copper-in-soils extend south beyond historical drilling approximately 1.5 kilometres, with large portions of the copper-in-soil anomaly untested by drilling (Figure 2).Together with ground-based geophysical surveys completed historically and an airborne magnetic survey completed by Kobrea in 2022, favourable copper-bearing stratigraphy has been outlined that correlates with copper mineralization intersected in historical drilling. Induced polarization (""IP"") surveys completed by previous operators have outlined a 4.0 by 1.2 kilometre chargeability high anomaly that is open to the northwest (Figure 3).All historical exploration at the Project has not been verified by the Company and the historical exploration information in this news release is sourced entirely from the independent technical report entitled ""Technical Report on the Upland Copper Project"" dated June 13, 2023, prepared for the Company by Sean Butler, P. Geo.

This will better define copper mineralization in bedrock and improve confidence in the geological model. Two 500-metre-long trenches have been proposed to be excavated over two mineralized cross-sections of the deposit, which will help to determine continuity of mineralization and will aid in targeting the higher-grade domains seen in historical drilling. The results from the first phase of exploration at the Upland Copper project will be used to target subsequent drilling.Marketing AgreementKobrea is also pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement with MIC Market Information & Content Publishing GmbH (""MIC"") (Address: Gerhart-Hauptmann-St. 49b 51379 Leverkusen; email: contact@micpublishing.de; phone: +49 2171-7766628) for a 6-month marketing engagement, commencing on April 18, 2024.

Positive Increase in net income and earnings per share in the first quarter 2024 compared to the previous quarter and the same period last year. Deposit growth of $6.9 billion, leading to a decrease in the loan-to-deposit ratio to 81.5%. Repayment of $1.0 billion of borrowings and strong quarterly deposit growth.

Asset quality metrics remained favorable with low nonperforming assets and annualized net loan charge-offs. Tangible book value per share increased by 13.8% year-over-year to $47.30. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net income and earnings per share (EPS) by Western Alliance Bancorporation is a robust indicator of growth, reflecting a 19.9% and 20.3% surge respectively from the previous quarter. This performance is significant, demonstrating the company's profitability amidst economic dynamics. Given the context of a tightened monetary policy affecting the banking sector, the company's ability to maintain a net interest margin (NIM) of 3.60%, despite a slight decline, suggests a well-managed interest income strategy. Investors should note the impact of net interest income on the bank's revenue, as it is a critical component for financial institutions. Risk Management Analyst The credit quality of the loan portfolio is paramount in assessing the bank's risk exposure. Western Alliance Bancorporation's provision for credit losses has slightly increased from the previous quarter, which could be a cautious approach against potential loan defaults. The stability in the loan-to-deposit ratio, declining to 81.5%, may indicate a strategic liquidity management which can be seen as a positive sign for risk mitigation. Despite a slight uptick in nonperforming assets, the ratio remains relatively low at 0.53%, signaling healthy asset quality. Investors should appreciate the bank's prudent risk assessments and its potential to weather loan repayment challenges. Market Analyst From a market perspective, Western Alliance Bancorporation's deposit growth of $6.9 billion is impressive and showcases strong customer confidence and potentially an expanding customer base. The significant year-over-year jumps in both net revenue and deposits, 32.1% and 30.8% respectively, underscore the bank's scalability in the market. These figures could suggest a competitive edge in the banking industry. However, investors should temper expectations as increasing non-interest expenses, such as insurance and deposit costs, could affect future profitability margins. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL): FIRST QUARTER 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS Quarter Highlights: Net income Earnings per share PPNR1 Net interest margin Efficiency ratio Book value per common share $177.4 million $1.60 $247.0 million 3.60% 65.2% $53.33 $190.9 million1, excluding notable items $1.721, excluding notable items 54.4%1, adjusted for deposit costs and notable items $47.301, excluding goodwill and intangibles CEO COMMENTARY: “Western Alliance delivered strong first quarter results with continued robust business and deposit momentum that allowed us to largely complete our balance sheet repositioning efforts, while maintaining stable asset quality,” said Kenneth A. Vecchione, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Quarterly deposit growth of $6.9 billion enhanced our liquidity profile, drove the loan-to-deposit ratio down to 81.5%, and allowed us to repay $1.0 billion of borrowings. In total, excluding a $17.6 million increase to the FDIC special assessment and related tax impact, we achieved net income of $190.9 million1 and earnings per share of $1.721, which resulted in a return on tangible common equity of 14.5%1.

Income Statement Net interest income totaled $598.9 million in the first quarter 2024, an increase of $7.2 million, or 1.2%, from $591.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023, and a decrease of $11.0 million, or 1.8%, compared to the first quarter 2023. The increase in net interest income from the fourth quarter 2023 is due to a decrease in average short-term borrowings combined with an increase in average HFS loan and securities balances, partially offset by an increase in deposit balances and rates. The decrease in net interest income from the first quarter 2023 was driven by an increase in both the balances and rates of deposits, partially offset by higher yields on HFI loans and a higher average securities balance. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $15.2 million in the first quarter 2024, an increase of $5.9 million from $9.3 million in the fourth quarter 2023, and a decrease of $4.2 million from $19.4 million in the first quarter 2023. The provision for credit losses during the first quarter 2024 is primarily reflective of loan growth, net-charge offs of $9.8 million and a stable economic outlook. The Company’s net interest margin in the first quarter 2024 was 3.60%, a decrease from 3.65% in the fourth quarter 2023, and a decrease from 3.79% in the first quarter 2023. Lower yields on average earning assets drove a decrease in net interest margin from the fourth quarter 2023. The decrease in net interest margin from the first quarter 2023 was driven by higher average balances and rates on deposits, partially offset by higher yields on HFI loan balances and a higher average securities balance. Non-interest income was $129.9 million for the first quarter 2024, compared to $90.5 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and $(58.0) million for the first quarter 2023. The $39.4 million increase in non-interest income from the fourth quarter 2023 was primarily due to an increase of $37.3 million in net loan servicing revenue due to higher servicing income and fair value changes combined with lower losses on sales of investment securities of $13.9 million. These changes were partially offset by a $12.8 million decrease in service charges and fees and a $2.5 million decrease in net gain on loan origination and sale activities from lower spreads. The $187.9 million increase in non-interest income from the first quarter 2023 was primarily driven by fair value loss adjustments in the first quarter 2023 due to the Company's balance sheet repositioning efforts that did not reoccur, paired with higher income from equity investments and net gain on loan origination and sale activities. Net revenue totaled $728.8 million for the first quarter 2024, an increase of $46.6 million or 6.8%, compared to $682.2 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and an increase of $176.9 million or 32.1%, compared to $551.9 million for the first quarter 2023. Non-interest expense was $481.8 million for the first quarter 2024, compared to $461.9 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and $347.9 million for the first quarter 2023. The Company’s efficiency ratio, adjusted for deposit costs1 was 57.3% (or 54.4% further adjusted for notable items1) for the first quarter 2024, compared to 59.1% in the fourth quarter 2023, and 55.1% for the first quarter 2023. The increase in non-interest expense from the fourth quarter 2023 is due primarily to a $39.3 million gain on debt extinguishment related to the early payoff of the AmeriHome senior notes in the fourth quarter 2023 that did not reoccur, combined with increased salaries and benefits of $20.3 million due to seasonal compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in insurance cost of $49.7 million due to the higher FDIC special assessment recognized in the fourth quarter 2023. The increase in non-interest expense from the first quarter 2023 is primarily attributable to an increase in deposit and insurance costs. Income tax expense was $54.4 million for the first quarter 2024, compared to $63.1 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and $42.4 million for the first quarter 2023. The decrease in income tax expense from the fourth quarter 2023 is primarily related to the timing of benefits from Low Income Housing Tax Credit investments. Net income was $177.4 million for the first quarter 2024, an increase of $29.5 million from $147.9 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and an increase of $35.2 million from $142.2 million for the first quarter 2023. Earnings per share totaled $1.60 for the first quarter 2024, compared to $1.33 for the fourth quarter 2023, and $1.28 for the first quarter 2023. The Company views its pre-provision net revenue1 (""PPNR"") as a key metric for assessing the Company’s earnings power, which it defines as net revenue less non-interest expense. For the first quarter 2024, the Company’s PPNR1 was $247.0 million, up $26.7 million from $220.3 million in the fourth quarter 2023, and up $43.0 million from $204.0 million in the first quarter 2023. The Company had 3,312 full-time equivalent employees and 56 offices at March 31, 2024, compared to 3,260 full-time equivalent employees and 57 offices at December 31, 2023, and 3,340 full-time equivalent employees and 57 offices at March 31, 2023. 1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Balance Sheet HFI loans, net of deferred fees totaled $50.7 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $50.3 billion at December 31, 2023, and $46.4 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in HFI loans of $403 million from the prior quarter was primarily driven by an increase of $646 million in commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by decreases of $154 million and $108 million in residential real estate and construction and land development loans, respectively. The increase in HFI loans of $4.3 billion from March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a $4.2 billion and $374 million increase in commercial and industrial and construction and land development loans, respectively. This increase was partially offset by a $400 million decrease in residential real estate loans. HFS loans totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2023, and $7.0 billion at March 31, 2023. The balance of HFS loans at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 primarily consisted of AmeriHome HFS loans. The increase of $439 million in HFS loans from the prior quarter is primarily related to an increase in agency conforming loans. The decrease of $5.2 billion in HFS loans from March 31, 2023 primarily related to the sale and disposition of loans during 2023 related to the Company's balance sheet repositioning strategy. The Company's allowance for credit losses on HFI loans consists of an allowance for funded HFI loans and an allowance for unfunded loan commitments. At March 31, 2024, the allowance for loan losses to funded HFI loans ratio was 0.67%, flat from December 31, 2023, and 0.66% at March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for unfunded loan commitments, to funded HFI loans ratio was 0.74% at March 31, 2024, compared to 0.73% at December 31, 2023, and 0.75% at March 31, 2023. The Company is a party to credit linked note transactions which effectively transfer a portion of the risk of losses on reference pools of loans to the purchasers of the notes. The Company is protected from first credit losses on reference pools of loans totaling $9.0 billion, $9.1 billion, and $9.8 billion as of March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2023, respectively, under these transactions. However, as these note transactions are considered to be free standing credit enhancements, the allowance for credit losses cannot be reduced by the expected credit losses that may be mitigated by these notes. Accordingly, the allowance for loan and credit losses ratios include an allowance related to these pools of loans of $14.2 million as of March 31, 2024, $14.7 million as of December 31, 2023, and $20.8 million as of March 31, 2023. The allowance for credit losses to funded HFI loans ratio, adjusted to reduce the HFI loan balance by the amount of loans in covered reference pools, was 0.90% at March 31, 2024, 0.89% at December 31, 2023, and 0.95% at March 31, 2023. Deposits totaled $62.2 billion at March 31, 2024, an increase of $6.9 billion from $55.3 billion at December 31, 2023, and an increase of $14.6 billion from $47.6 billion at March 31, 2023. By deposit type, the increase from the prior quarter is attributable to increases of $3.9 billion from non-interest bearing demand deposits, $1.4 billion from savings and money market deposits, $1.0 billion from interest-bearing demand deposits, and $564 million from certificates of deposits. From March 31, 2023, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $6.2 billion, certificates of deposit increased $4.1 billion, savings and money market deposits increased $2.3 billion, and non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $1.9 billion. Non-interest bearing deposits were $18.4 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2023, and $16.5 billion at March 31, 2023. The table below shows the Company's deposit types as a percentage of total deposits: Mar 31, 2024 Dec 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2023 Non-interest bearing 29.6 % 26.2 % 34.6 % Savings and money market 26.0 26.7 29.1 Interest-bearing demand 27.3 28.8 22.5 Certificates of deposit 17.1 18.3 13.8 The Company’s ratio of HFI loans to deposits was 81.5% at March 31, 2024, compared to 90.9% at December 31, 2023, and 97.6% at March 31, 2023. Borrowings were $6.2 billion at March 31, 2024, $7.2 billion at December 31, 2023, and $15.9 billion at March 31, 2023. Borrowings decreased $1.0 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in short-term borrowings. The decrease in borrowings from March 31, 2023 is due primarily to a decrease in short-term borrowings of $9.0 billion, combined with payoffs of the AmeriHome senior notes and credit linked notes, as part of the Company's balance sheet repositioning. Qualifying debt totaled $896 million at March 31, 2024, compared to $895 million at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023. Stockholders’ equity was $6.2 billion at March 31, 2024, compared to $6.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and $5.5 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders’ equity from the prior quarter was due to net income, partially offset by unrealized fair value losses of $88 million on the Company's available-for-sale securities, which are recorded in other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and dividends to shareholders. Cash dividends of $40.7 million ($0.37 per common share) and $3.2 million ($0.27 per depository share) were paid to shareholders during the first quarter 2024. The increase in stockholders' equity from March 31, 2023 is primarily a function of net income, partially offset by dividends to shareholders. The Company's common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 11.0% at March 31, 2024, compared to 10.8% and 9.4% at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023, respectively. At March 31, 2024, tangible common equity, net of tax1, was 6.8% of tangible assets1 and total capital was 14.0% of risk-weighted assets. The Company’s tangible book value per share1 was $47.30 at March 31, 2024, an increase of 1.2% from $46.72 at December 31, 2023, and an increase of 13.8% from $41.56 at March 31, 2023. The increase in tangible book value per share from December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2023 is attributable to net income. Total assets increased 8.6% to $77.0 billion at March 31, 2024 from $70.9 billion at December 31, 2023, and increased 8.4% from $71.0 billion at March 31, 2023. The increase in total assets from December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in investments and cash. The increase in total assets from March 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in investments and HFI loans, partially offset by a decrease in HFS loans. 1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Asset Quality Provision for credit losses totaled $15.2 million for the first quarter 2024, compared to $9.3 million for the fourth quarter 2023, and $19.4 million for the first quarter 2023. Net loan charge-offs in the first quarter 2024 were $9.8 million, or 0.08% of average loans (annualized), compared to $8.5 million, or 0.07%, in the fourth quarter 2023, and $6.0 million, or 0.05%, in the first quarter 2023. Nonaccrual loans increased $126 million to $399 million during the quarter and increased $292 million from March 31, 2023. Loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $6 million at March 31, 2024, $42 million at December 31, 2023, and $1 million at March 31, 2023 (excluding government guaranteed loans of $349 million, $399 million, and $494 million, respectively). Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest totaled $117 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease from $164 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase from $58 million at March 31, 2023 (excluding government guaranteed loans of $224 million, $279 million, and $281 million, respectively). Repossessed assets totaled $8 million at March 31, 2024, flat from December 31, 2023, and a decrease of $3 million from March 31, 2023. Classified assets totaled $781 million at March 31, 2024, an increase of $108 million from $673 million at December 31, 2023, and an increase of $322 million from $459 million at March 31, 2023. The ratio of classified assets to Tier 1 capital plus the allowance for credit losses2, a common regulatory measure of asset quality, was 12.0% at March 31, 2024, compared to 10.5% at December 31, 2023, and 7.8% at March 31, 2023. 1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 2 The allowance for credit losses used in this ratio is calculated in accordance with regulatory capital rules.

Positive DermTech is proactively seeking strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value through potential acquisitions, mergers, or other transactions. The company plans to reduce expenses through a restructuring plan, leading to a substantial workforce reduction of around 56%. A one-time restructuring charge of approximately $1.6 million is expected in the second quarter of 2024 due to these actions. DermTech will not conduct a first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call in light of these strategic and restructuring initiatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst DermTech's engagement with TD Cowen to explore strategic alternatives is a notable decision that indicates the company's willingness to consider significant changes in its operational structure. Such alternatives could involve mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales, often undertaken to unlock shareholder value or pivot business strategies. The engagement of a restructuring advisor like AlixPartners suggests an in-depth analysis of operational efficiency and cost structures, aiming to improve the company's financial standing. As a result, this could lead to a reevaluation of DermTech's market position and a recalculation of its intrinsic value by investors. Human Resources Specialist The planned workforce reduction of approximately 56% is a drastic measure, indicating severe cost-cutting efforts. It is likely to affect DermTech's operational capabilities in the short term, potentially impacting company culture and employee morale. However, such a decision could be seen as a necessary step to extend the company's cash runway and to focus on core competencies. The anticipated one-time restructuring charge of $1.6 million in Q2 2024 will be a key figure to monitor in the company's upcoming financial statements, as it will affect the net income and could influence investor sentiment towards the company's stock. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DermTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: DMTK) (DermTech or the Company), a leader in precision dermatology enabled by a non-invasive skin genomics technology, today announced that the special committee of its board of directors engaged TD Cowen to conduct a process exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated include an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, business combination, sale of assets, licensing or other transaction involving the Company. There can be no assurance, however, that the strategic review process will result in any such transaction or if a transaction is undertaken, that such transaction would close in a timely manner or at all. DermTech does not intend to comment on this strategic review process and will make further announcements in accordance with its ongoing disclosure obligations and pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. The Company will not be hosting a first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call as a result of today’s announcement.

These restructuring actions will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 100 employees, or approximately 56% of DermTech’s workforce. The Company anticipates incurring a one-time restructuring charge of approximately $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with these restructuring actions. Currently, the Company intends to continue laboratory operations during the strategic review and believes it has sufficient capacity to process orders for the DermTech Melanoma Test (DMT).

Positive First-quarter net income of $47.8 million, with a return on average assets of 1.00% and a return on average common equity of 6.63%. Total assets remained steady at $19.3 billion, with loan growth in commercial real estate and small business portfolios.

Conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings will be held on April 19, 2024, hosted by CEO Jeffrey Tengel and CFO Mark Ruggiero. Negative None. Financial Analyst Independent Bank Corp.'s net income for the first quarter of 2024 is a stepping stone to assess the bank's financial health amidst a complex market environment. A year-over-year decrease in total assets, although marginal, might raise questions about the bank's growth trajectory. However, careful observation of loan growth, particularly in commercial real estate, indicates sector-specific dynamism that benefits from the economic landscape. Despite the uptick in deposit costs, the bank’s strategic positioning resulted in moderate loan portfolio growth. The reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and redemption of subordinated debentures suggest a more cost-effective capital structure, which is pivotal in times of narrow net interest margins. Moreover, the completion of the stock buyback program at an average price below the book value could be perceived as management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company. Investors should watch the bank's deposit mix and its ability to control cost of funds in the face of rising interest rates. Market Research Analyst From a market analysis perspective, Independent Bank Corp.'s recent financials shed light on broader industry trends such as the competitive environment for deposits and the rising costs associated with them. The bank's strategic prioritization of core deposits and adjustable-rate loan portfolios may be a tactical move anticipating further interest rate adjustments. The shift in noninterest income sources, with fluctuations in mortgage banking income and investment management, suggests adaptability in revenue generation methods—a signal that might appeal to investors seeking stability in market volatility. Nonetheless, the decline in noninterest income and the increase in the tax rate to 23.56% reflect the bank's sensitivity to market conditions and regulatory changes, which is common across the sector and essential for investors to monitor. Risk Analyst Evaluating asset quality, the slight uptick in non-performing loans and the increased allowance for credit losses echo cautious optimism in Independent Bank Corp.'s risk management practices. In a macro environment where asset quality can rapidly deteriorate, the bank's minimal net charge-offs are reassuring. The increase in delinquencies, while not alarming, is a reminder of the need for continued stringent credit monitoring. This, in tandem with the disciplined growth approach, positions the bank to manage potential credit risk effectively. Investors should find comfort in the bank's proactive approach to maintain a robust allowance for credit losses, which acts as a buffer in uncertain economic conditions. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM Results reflect underlying strength of franchise ROCKLAND, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Independent Bank Corp.

This growth was primarily driven by the commercial real estate loan portfolio, which increased $67.3 million, or 0.8% (3.4% annualized) for the quarter, primarily reflecting transfers from the construction portfolio, modest new origination activity, and reduced levels of paydowns. The small business portfolio also continued its steady growth, rising by 3.9% during the first quarter of 2024, while the total consumer real estate portfolio remained generally in line with the prior quarter. Deposit levels also resumed growth during the quarter, with balances of $15.0 billion at March 31, 2024, rising by $177.7 million, or 1.2%, from December 31, 2023. This increase was driven primarily by municipal deposit inflows and consumer demand for higher cost time deposits, partially offset by seasonal business deposit outflows. Though some level of product remixing persists, total noninterest bearing demand deposits comprised 29.7% of total deposits at March 31, 2024. Core deposits, inclusive of reciprocal deposits, represented 83.2% of total deposits at March 31, 2024, as compared to 84.6% at December 31, 2023. The total cost of deposits for the first quarter increased 17 basis points to 1.48% compared to the prior quarter, reflective of the competitive market environment and ongoing customer preference for higher yielding accounts. In conjunction with deposit growth during the quarter, total borrowings declined by $193.0 million, or 15.8%, during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was driven primarily by a reduction in Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings of $143.0 million, or 12.9%. Additionally, the Company fully redeemed its outstanding subordinated debentures with an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million. The securities portfolio decreased by $85.1 million, or 2.9%, compared to December 31, 2023, driven primarily by paydowns, maturities, and unrealized losses of $4.0 million in the available for sale portfolio. Total securities represented 14.7% of total assets at March 31, 2024, as compared to 15.1% at December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased 532,266 shares of its common stock for $31.0 million at an average price per share of $58.22, marking the completion of its previously announced $100 million buyback program. Stockholders' equity at March 31, 2024 remained generally consistent when compared to December 31, 2023, as the impact of share repurchase activity and the common dividend declared during the first quarter was offset by strong earnings. The Company's ratio of common equity to assets of 14.92% at March 31, 2024 represented a decrease of 4 basis points from December 31, 2023 and an increase of 36 basis points from March 31, 2023. The Company's book value per share increased by $0.41, or 0.6%, to $67.94 at March 31, 2024 as compared to the prior quarter. The Company's tangible book value per share at March 31, 2024 rose by $0.21, or 0.5%, from the prior quarter to $44.34, and represented an increase of 7.3% from the year ago period. The Company's ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of 10.27% at March 31, 2024 represented a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior quarter and an increase of 38 basis points from the year ago period. Please refer to Appendix A for a detailed reconciliation of Non-GAAP balance sheet metrics. NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 5.3% to $137.4 million compared to $145.1 million for the prior quarter, as rising deposit costs continued to counter the benefit of repriced assets, resulting in a reduction in net interest margin of 15 basis points to 3.23% for the quarter. NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income of $29.9 million for the first quarter of 2024 represented a decrease of $2.1 million, or 6.6%, as compared to the prior quarter. Significant changes in noninterest income for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter included the following: Investment management and advisory income increased by $123,000, or 1.3%, primarily driven by elevated asset-based revenue, which increased by $277,000, or 3.2%, offset by slightly lower commission and other revenue. Total assets under administration increased by $266.1 million, or 4.1%, to a record level of $6.8 billion at March 31, 2024. Mortgage banking income grew by $187,000, or 30.7%, driven primarily by a greater portion of new originations sold in the secondary market versus being retained in the Company's portfolio. Loan level derivative income decreased by $722,000, or 90.0% primarily due to lower demand. Other noninterest income decreased by $1.5 million, or 19.8%, driven primarily by volatility in non-core components, including lower unrealized gains on equity securities, while the prior quarter also included an outsized $1.0 million gain from the purchase of discounted tax credits. NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense of $99.9 million for the first quarter of 2024 represented a decrease of $860,000, or 0.9%, as compared to the prior quarter. Significant changes in noninterest expense for the first quarter compared to the prior quarter included the following: Salaries and employee benefits increased by $786,000, or 1.4%, due primarily to seasonal increases in payroll taxes, partially offset by decreased commissions and equity compensation. Occupancy and equipment expenses increased by $413,000, or 3.2%, due mainly to seasonal increases in snow removal and utilities costs, partially offset by one-time lease termination costs recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023. FDIC assessment decreased $1.0 million, or 24.4%, from the prior quarter, driven primarily by the FDIC special assessment recognized by the Company. Other noninterest expense decreased by $1.2 million, or 4.6%, due primarily to decreases in consultant fees, advertising, and subscriptions, partially offset by increased card issuance costs. The Company’s tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 increased to 23.56%, compared to 22.72% for the prior quarter, primarily due to changes in discrete items realized in both quarters. ASSET QUALITY The first quarter provision for credit losses was $5.0 million as compared to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs were minimal at $274,000 for the first quarter of 2024, or 0.01% of average loans annualized, versus $3.8 million, or 0.11% of average loans annualized, in the prior quarter, with the decline driven by negligible net charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio in the first quarter. Nonperforming loans increased slightly to $56.9 million, or 0.40% of total loans at March 31, 2024, as compared to $54.4 million, or 0.38% of total loans at December 31, 2023. Delinquencies as a percentage of total loans increased 8 basis points from the prior quarter to 0.52% at March 31, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on total loans increased to $146.9 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $142.2 million at December 31, 2023, and represents 1.03% and 1.00% of total loans, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Actual results may differ from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: adverse economic conditions in the regional and local economies within the New England region and the Company’s market area; events impacting the financial services industry, including high profile bank failures, and any resulting decreased confidence in banks among depositors, investors, and other counterparties, as well as competition for deposits, significant disruption, volatility and depressed valuations of equity and other securities of banks in the capital markets; the effects to the Company of an increasingly competitive labor market, including the possibility that the Company will have to devote significant resources to attract and retain qualified personnel; the instability or volatility in financial markets and unfavorable domestic or global general economic, political or business conditions, whether caused by geopolitical concerns, including the Russia/Ukraine conflict, the conflict in Israel and surrounding areas and the possible expansion of such conflicts, changes in U.S. and international trade policies, or other factors, and the potential impact of such factors on the Company and its customers, including the potential for decreases in deposits and loan demand, unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral and decreased service revenues; unanticipated loan delinquencies, loss of collateral, decreased service revenues, and other potential negative effects on the Company’s local economies or the Company's business caused by adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, changes in climate, public health crises or other external events and any actions taken by governmental authorities in response to any such events; adverse changes or volatility in the local real estate market; changes in interest rates and any resulting impact on interest earning assets and/or interest bearing liabilities, the level of voluntary prepayments on loans and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities, decreased loan demand or increased difficulty in the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans; acquisitions may not produce results at levels or within time frames originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration issues or impairment of goodwill and/or other intangibles; the effect of laws, regulations, new requirements or expectations, or additional regulatory oversight in the highly regulated financial services industry, including as a result of intensified regulatory scrutiny in the aftermath of certain bank failures in 2023 and the resulting need to invest in technology to meet heightened regulatory expectations, increased costs of compliance or required adjustments to strategy; changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; higher than expected tax expense, including as a result of failure to comply with general tax laws and changes in tax laws; increased competition in the Company’s market areas, including competition that could impact deposit gathering, retention of deposits and the cost of deposits, increased competition due to the demand for innovative products and service offerings, and competition from non-depository institutions which may be subject to fewer regulatory constraints and lower cost structures; a deterioration in the conditions of the securities markets; a deterioration of the credit rating for U.S. long-term sovereign debt or uncertainties surrounding the federal budget; inability to adapt to changes in information technology, including changes to industry accepted delivery models driven by a migration to the internet as a means of service delivery, including any inability to effectively implement new technology-driven products, such as artificial intelligence; electronic or other fraudulent activity within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector; adverse changes in consumer spending and savings habits; the effect of laws and regulations regarding the financial services industry, including the need to invest in technology to meet heightened regulatory expectations or introduction of new requirements or expectations resulting in increased costs of compliance or required adjustments to strategy; changes in laws and regulations (including laws and regulations concerning taxes, banking, securities and insurance) generally applicable to the Company’s business and the associated costs of such changes; the Company's potential judgments, claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory and government actions; changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters; operational risks related to cyber threats, attacks, intrusions, and fraud which could lead to interruptions or disruptions of the Company's operating systems, including systems that are customer facing, and adversely impact the Company's business; and any unexpected material adverse changes in the Company's operations or earnings. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements as the Company’s business and its forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q (""Risk Factors""). Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise. Any public statements or disclosures by the Company following this release which modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this release will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this release. In addition to the information set forth in this press release, you should carefully consider the Risk Factors. This press release and the appendices attached to it contain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). This information may include operating net income and operating earnings per share (""EPS""), operating return on average assets, operating return on average common equity, operating return on average tangible common equity, core net interest margin (""core margin""), tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratio. Operating net income, operating EPS, operating return on average assets and operating return on average common equity, exclude items that management believes are unrelated to the Company's core banking business such as merger and acquisition expenses, and other items, if applicable. Management uses operating net income and related ratios and operating EPS to measure the strength of the Company’s core banking business and to identify trends that may to some extent be obscured by such items. Management reviews its core margin to determine any items that may impact the net interest margin that may be one-time in nature or not reflective of its core operating environment, such as significant purchase accounting adjustments or other adjustments such as nonaccrual interest reversals/recoveries and prepayment penalties. Management believes that adjusting for these items to arrive at a core margin provides additional insight into the operating environment and how management decisions impact the net interest margin. Management also supplements its evaluation of financial performance with analysis of tangible book value per share (which is computed by dividing stockholders' equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, or ""tangible common equity"", by common shares outstanding), the tangible common equity ratio (which is computed by dividing tangible common equity by ""tangible assets"", defined as total assets less goodwill and other intangibles), and return on average tangible common equity (which is computed by dividing net income by average tangible common equity). The Company has included information on tangible book value per share, the tangible common equity ratio and return on average tangible common equity because management believes that investors may find it useful to have access to the same analytical tools used by management. As a result of merger and acquisition activity, the Company has recognized goodwill and other intangible assets in conjunction with business combination accounting principles. Excluding the impact of goodwill and other intangibles in measuring asset and capital values for the ratios provided, along with other bank standard capital ratios, provides a framework to compare the capital adequacy of the Company to other companies in the financial services industry. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results and other financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. An item which management excludes when computing these non-GAAP measures can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results for any particular quarter or year. The Company’s non-GAAP performance measures, including operating net income, operating EPS, operating return on average assets, operating return on average common equity, core margin, tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratio, are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies.

Le PDG de la société a souligné l'accent mis sur le développement de relations clients rentables et la gestion efficace de la qualité du crédit. Southern First Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: SFST) verzeichnete starke finanzielle Ergebnisse für das erste Quartal 2024, mit einem Nettogewinn von 2,5 Millionen Dollar, einer Zunahme bei Gesamtkrediten und Einlagen sowie einer Nettozinsmarge von 1,94%. Der CEO des Unternehmens hob den Fokus auf den Aufbau profitabler Kundenbeziehungen und die effektive Verwaltung der Kreditqualität hervor. Positive Net income of $2.5 million and diluted earnings per common share of $0.31 for Q1 2024. Total loans increased to $3.6 billion, and total deposits increased to $3.5 billion at Q1 2024. Strong credit quality with nonperforming assets to total assets of 0.09% and past due loans to total loans of 0.36% at Q1 2024. Net interest margin was 1.94% for Q1 2024, compared to 2.36% for Q1 2023. Book value per common share increased to $38.65 at Q1 2024, a 4% increase over Q1 2023. Negative Net interest income decreased by $415 thousand from Q4 2023, and $1.8 million from Q1 2023. Noninterest expense increased by $1.1 million from Q4 2023, and $996 thousand from Q1 2023. The provision for credit losses was $175 thousand in Q1 2024, compared to a reversal of $975 thousand in Q4 2023, and a provision of $1.8 million in Q1 2023. Financial Analyst The reported net income of Southern First for Q1 2024 reflects a downward trend when compared to both the preceding quarter and the same quarter a year ago. This contraction in net income, moving from $4.167 million in Q4 2023 to $2.522 million in Q1 2024, may signal pressures that the bank is facing, potentially due to increased deposit and funding costs as suggested by the rise in interest expense on deposits from $17.179 million in Q1 2023 to $26.932 million in Q1 2024. Interestingly, despite an increase in total loans and deposits, net interest income has declined, indicating a margin squeeze. This might raise concerns for investors about the bank's ability to expand net interest margins in a rising rate environment, a key determinant of profitability for the banking sector. Long-term, the bank's sustained increase in book value per share, from $37.16 to $38.65, suggests a stable growth in equity, which could be seen as a fundamental strength. Market Research Analyst Southern First's provision reversal of $175 thousand during Q1 2024, versus a provision of $1.8 million in Q1 2023, indicates improving credit quality or an adjusted outlook on potential loan losses. This could be inferred as an optimistic sign of underlying economic conditions for the bank's clientele. However, the efficiency ratio has deteriorated year over year, from 76.12% to 84.94%. A rising efficiency ratio typically denotes higher costs relative to revenue, which may be indicative of scalability challenges or operational inefficiencies that could concern investors focused on operational excellence and cost management. Credit Analyst A robust credit quality is observed, with a decline in nonperforming assets to total assets from 0.12% in Q1 2023 to 0.09% in Q1 2024. The bank's loans 30 days or more past due have modestly increased from 0.11% in Q1 2023 to 0.36% in Q1 2024, yet remain at manageable levels. It’s essential to monitor trends in loan delinquencies, as they can be a leading indicator of future credit losses. The strong coverage ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans suggests that the bank is well-prepared to absorb potential loan defaults. For investors, these ratios signify the bank's risk management competency and its ability to withstand loan-related adversities. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM GREENVILLE, S.C., April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern First Bancshares, Inc.

Net interest income decreased $415 thousand during the first quarter of 2024, compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and decreased $1.8 million, compared to the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in net interest income from the prior quarter was driven by less interest income on our federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits, while the decrease from the prior year was driven by an increase in deposit and funding costs. There was a reversal of the provision for credit losses of $175 thousand for the first quarter of 2024, compared to a reversal of $975 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2023 and a provision of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2023. The provision reversal of $175 thousand during the first quarter of 2024 relates to a reversal in the reserve for unfunded commitments, driven by a decrease in the balance of unfunded commitments at March 31, 2024. As we continue to experience low net charge-offs, our expected loss rates continue to decline, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans. Noninterest income was $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2023. Mortgage banking income continues to be the largest component of our noninterest income at $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2024, $868 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $622 thousand for the first quarter of 2023. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $18.1 million, a $1.1 million increase from the fourth quarter of 2023, and a $996 thousand increase from the first quarter of 2023. The increase in noninterest expense from the previous quarter was driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, while the increase from the prior year related not only to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses, but also to increases in outside service and data processing costs and insurance expenses. The increase in compensation and benefits expenses during the current quarter was due primarily to an increase in various benefit-related expenses. In addition, the increase in outside service and data processing costs from the prior quarter and prior year was driven by an increase in software licensing and maintenance costs, while insurance costs increased over the prior year due to higher FDIC insurance premiums. Our effective tax rate was 25.5% for the first quarter of 2024, 21.9% for the fourth quarter of 2023, and 23.6% for the first quarter of 2023. The higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior quarter and prior year was primarily related to the effect of equity compensation transactions during the quarter.

The decrease in interest income was driven by a $107.5 million decrease in average federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposit balances. In comparison to the first quarter of 2023, net interest income decreased $1.8 million, resulting primarily from a $432.7 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities during the 12 months ended March 31, 2024, combined with a 115-basis point increase in the average cost. Our net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 1.94% for the first quarter of 2024, a two-basis point increase from 1.92% for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a 42-basis point decrease from 2.36% for the first quarter of 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the yield on our loan portfolio increased by 10-basis points, while the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by only seven basis points, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting in a slight increase in net interest margin for the period. The lower net interest margin during the first quarter of 2024, as compared to the first quarter of 2023, was a result of our deposit and borrowing costs increasing faster than our loan yield as our interest-bearing liabilities have been more sensitive to changes in the federal funds rate over the past two years.

While we added three new relationships to nonaccrual during the first quarter of 2024, there were also three relationships either returned to accrual status or paid off during the quarter. In addition, our classified asset ratio decreased to 3.99% for the first quarter of 2024 from 4.25% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and from 5.10% in the first quarter of 2023. At March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $40.4 million, or 1.11% of total loans, compared to $40.7 million, or 1.13% of total loans at December 31, 2023, and $40.4 million, or 1.18% of total loans, at March 31, 2023. We had net charge-offs of $241 thousand, or 0.03% annualized, for the first quarter of 2024, compared to net recoveries of $191 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023 and net charge-offs of $59 thousand for the first quarter of 2023. There was no provision for credit losses recorded during the first quarter of 2024, compared to a reversal of $640 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2023 and a provision of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2023. As we continue to experience low net charge-offs, the expected loss rates in our allowance for credit loss continue to decline, resulting in no provision for credit loss expense for the quarter.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Our reported results are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We also disclose Funds From Operations (“FFO”) Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”), and Pro Forma Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Pro Forma EBITDA”), all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they are widely accepted industry measures used by analysts and investors to compare the operating performance of REITs. FFO, AFFO, and Pro Forma EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements; accordingly, they should not be considered alternatives to net income as a performance measure or cash flows from operations as reported on our statement of cash flows as a liquidity measure and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude real estate related depreciation and amortization, as well as extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP) such as net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and impairments associated with the implementation of current expected credit losses on commercial loans and investments at the time of origination, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. To derive AFFO, we further modify the NAREIT computation of FFO to include other adjustments to GAAP net income related to non-cash revenues and expenses such as loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of above- and below-market lease related intangibles, straight-line rental revenue, amortization of deferred financing costs, non-cash compensation, and other non-cash income or expense. Such items may cause short-term fluctuations in net income but have no impact on operating cash flows or long-term operating performance. We use AFFO as one measure of our performance when we formulate corporate goals. To derive Pro Forma EBITDA, GAAP net income or loss is adjusted to exclude extraordinary items (as defined by GAAP), net gain or loss from sales of depreciable real estate assets, impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate assets and impairments associated with the implementation of current expected credit losses on commercial loans and investments at the time of origination and/or payoff, and real estate related depreciation and amortization including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries, non-cash revenues and expenses such as straight-line rental revenue, amortization of deferred financing costs, loss on extinguishment of debt, above- and below-market lease related intangibles, non-cash compensation, other non-cash income or expense, and other non-recurring items such as disposition management fees. Cash interest expense is also excluded from Pro Forma EBITDA, and GAAP net income or loss is adjusted for the annualized impact of acquisitions, dispositions and other similar activities. FFO is used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers primarily because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains or losses on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. We believe that AFFO is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider because it will help them to better assess our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues or expenses. We also believe that Pro Forma EBITDA is an additional useful supplemental measure for investors to consider as it allows for a better assessment of our operating performance without the distortions created by other non-cash revenues, expenses or certain effects of the Company’s capital structure on our operating performance. FFO, AFFO, and Pro Forma EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Strategische Übernahmen und die Einführung neuer Produkte treiben das Wachstum voran. Positive Phoenix Motor expects to report revenue of $14-16 million in Q2 2024, a marked improvement from previous quarters. The projected revenue surge is attributed to strategic actions such as acquiring Proterra's transit bus operations and introducing new products. CEO Denton Peng emphasizes the company's commitment to redefining transportation with sustainable mobility solutions. Phoenix Motor aims to lead the sustainable transportation revolution with a clear vision and strategic initiatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Phoenix Motor Inc. of an expected Q2 2024 revenue between $14 million to $16 million is a notable development for the company. To put this into perspective, this guidance suggests a near doubling of their highest-ever forecasted revenue of $8 million to $9 million for Q1 2024. The significant jump from a mere $1.8 million in Q1 2023 is indicative of substantial growth and effectively positions the firm as an emerging player to watch in the electrification and transit solutions market.For investors, the trajectory of Phoenix Motor's revenue growth reflects positively on the company's strategic initiatives, such as acquisitions and product launches. Acquiring Proterra's transit bus operations, for instance, likely expanded their production capabilities and market reach, feeding directly into the increased revenue streams. Moreover, the focus on sustainable transportation aligns with global trends toward green initiatives, potentially opening additional avenues for government subsidies and incentives which could bolster the company's profitability.Having said that, it is important for investors to also consider the operational costs associated with such rapid growth. Are the margins keeping pace with revenue growth, or are costs escalating just as quickly? This balance will be key in determining the true financial health of the company. Market Research Analyst Phoenix Motor's revenue guidance also provides insight into the broader commercial transportation industry. The emphasis on the company's strategic vision to lead in sustainable transportation suggests that they are tapping into a market with significant growth potential. As governments and businesses globally push for a transition to greener transport solutions, Phoenix Motor's product range, which now includes Proterra's transit bus operations, positions them to capitalize on these trends.However, it's noteworthy that the electric vehicle (EV) and transit space is highly competitive with larger, established players that have deeper pockets for R&D and marketing. Phoenix Motor's ability to continue growing at the projected rate will depend on ongoing product innovation, competitiveness and the successful scaling of operations without compromising quality or customer satisfaction. Investors should keep an eye on the company's market share and how it evolves in response to these industry dynamics. 04/18/2024 - 04:05 PM ANAHEIM, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 18, 2024 / Phoenix Motor Inc. (Nasdaq:PEV), a leading manufacturer of heavy-duty transit buses and electrification solutions provider for medium-duty vehicles, today announced its revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2024.

""The recent strides we've made, from strategic acquisitions to launching cutting-edge products, underscore our resolve to redefine transportation. Our focus remains on delivering exceptional value and driving the shift towards sustainable mobility solutions.""The expected surge in revenue can be linked to several strategic actions implemented by Phoenix Motor throughout the past year.

Financial Analyst The new $2.5 billion share repurchase program initiated by PPG is a substantial financial maneuver that will potentially impact the company's per-share metrics favorably. From a financial perspective, this move may signal to investors that PPG's leadership believes the stock is undervalued or that they see it as a good use of capital given the current market conditions. Share buybacks can often lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS), as there are fewer shares outstanding, which can make the stock more attractive to investors.However, it's important for investors to consider whether these funds could be more effectively used for growth initiatives or reducing debt. Share repurchases can sometimes be a sign that a company lacks better investment opportunities. Moreover, investors should keenly observe the future quarterly earnings reports to assess the impact of this repurchase on the company's financial health, keeping in mind that while buybacks can enhance EPS, they do not inherently increase the intrinsic value of the company. Market Strategist PPG's decision to implement a new share repurchase program, on top of the existing one from December 2017, suggests a strategic effort to manage the company's capital structure actively. In the short term, this may create a positive sentiment among investors, as it could be perceived as a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The company's announcement indicates a discretionary approach, which provides flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions.Long-term investors should monitor PPG's allocation of capital towards such repurchases versus its investment in strategic initiatives, which could drive sustainable growth. The timing of share repurchases can be quite telling; if executed when shares are deemed to be undervalued, the program can serve as a tool for shareholder value maximization. It's essential to weigh this action against the backdrop of the company's ongoing needs for capital for research and development, expansion and potential acquisitions in the paints and coatings industry. 04/18/2024 - 04:07 PM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PPG (NYSE:PPG) today announced that its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of $2.5 billion of outstanding common stock. The authorization is effective immediately, does not expire, and gives management discretion in determining the conditions under which shares may be purchased. This program is in addition to the company’s existing share repurchase authorization, which was approved in December 2017 and had approximately $860 million remaining as of March 31, 2024. Repurchases will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

Financial Analyst The GEO Group's decision to close a substantial senior notes offering alongside a new term loan is a significant reshuffle of the company's capital structure. The issuance of $1.275 billion in senior notes, with a higher interest rate for the unsecured notes at 10.25%, indicates GEO's necessity to attract investors at a costlier rate potentially due to perceived credit risk. This transaction also involves refinancing existing debt which will likely improve GEO's debt maturity profile and reduce near-term liquidity risks. However, the increased interest expenses due to the higher coupon rates could pressure the company's financials. Investors should monitor how these changes affect GEO's interest coverage ratio and overall debt servicing capability. Debt Market Analyst By opting for a combination of secured and unsecured notes, accompanied by a new term loan that carries an interest of SOFR plus 5.25%, GEO is diversifying its financing strategies. The refinancing at these higher rates, while potentially dilutive to shareholders – especially given the planned use of GEO common stock to retire a portion of the existing convertible notes – suggests an imperative to manage upcoming maturities. It's important to note that the Term Loan B and revolving credit facilities enhance GEO's financial flexibility. For potential debt investors, the different tranches and associated security provide a range of risk profiles, which could attract a broader investment base. Market Research Analyst The immediate market reaction to such financial restructuring will likely hinge on investor confidence in GEO's operational stability and future revenue streams to service the new debt. Additionally, the terms of the new debt, particularly the 10.25% rate on unsecured notes, may reflect market sentiment on the company's risk profile. A broader industry perspective shows that companies like GEO are facing increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges, which may inform investors' interpretations of the associated risks with this capital restructuring. 04/18/2024 - 04:15 PM BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The GEO Group (NYSE: GEO) (“GEO” or the “Company”) announced today that it has closed a private offering of $1.275 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, comprised of $650.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% senior secured notes due 2029 (the “Secured Notes”) and $625.0 million aggregate principal amount of 10.25% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (the “Unsecured Notes” and, together with the Secured Notes, the “Notes”), exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Notes are guaranteed by GEO’s domestic subsidiaries that are guarantors under a new senior secured credit facility and outstanding senior notes. GEO also announced today that it has closed a new five-year $450.0 million Term Loan B (the “Term Loan”), bearing interest at SOFR plus 5.25%, under a new $760.0 million senior secured credit facility. The new senior secured credit facility also includes a five-year revolving line of credit for $310.0 million. The offering of the Notes and the new Term Loan resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.67 billion, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated expenses payable by GEO. GEO intends to use the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes, borrowings under the new Term Loan, and cash on hand to refinance approximately $1.5 billion of existing indebtedness, including to fund the repurchase, redemption or other discharge of the Company’s existing Tranche 1 Term Loan and Tranche 2 Term Loan under its prior senior credit facility, the 9.50% senior second lien secured notes, the 10.50% senior second lien secured notes, and the 6.00% senior notes due 2026, to pay related premiums, transaction fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes of the Company.

Barinthus Bio a annoncé des données positives de l'essai de phase 1b/2 APOLLO sur VTP-200 pour les infections persistantes à papillomavirus humain (HPV) à haut risque. VTP-200 a démontré des tendances positives dans les taux d'élimination pour les HPV à haut risque et les lésions cervicales dans les groupes recevant la dose la plus élevée de ChAdOx. Cependant, il n'y avait pas d'amélioration statistiquement significative par rapport au groupe placebo. L'essai a atteint son critère d'évaluation principal de la sécurité, montrant que VTP-200 était généralement bien toléré sans événements indésirables graves. Des options de développement futur sont évaluées avec des analyses en cours. Barinthus Bio verkündete positive Topline-Daten aus der Phase-1b/2-APOLLO-Studie zu VTP-200 bei persistierenden Hochrisiko-Humanpapillomavirus (HPV)-Infektionen. VTP-200 zeigte positive Trends bei den Clearance-Raten sowohl für hochriskantes HPV als auch für zervikale Läsionen in Gruppen, die die höchste ChAdOx-Dosis erhielten. Es gab jedoch keinen statistisch signifikanten Unterschied im Vergleich zur Placebogruppe. Die Studie erreichte ihren primären Sicherheitsendpunkt, was zeigt, dass VTP-200 allgemein gut verträglich war und keine schwerwiegenden Nebenwirkungen auftraten. Zukünftige Entwicklungsoptionen werden mit laufenden Analysen bewertet. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The Phase 1b/2 APOLLO trial data show that VTP-200 met the primary safety endpoint, which is an essential first step in drug development. When investing in biotech, it's important to understand that safety profiles are as critical as efficacy. VTP-200's tolerability could factor into its competitive edge in the market. However, the lack of statistically significant improvement in hrHPV clearance or cervical lesion clearance in pooled data suggests more research is needed. This could mean uncertainty for investors, as future development hinges on further positive findings. The data showing a higher clearance rate at the highest dose provides a potential pathway for optimization of dosage in future trials. Biotech Investment Analyst Positive trends in the highest dose cohorts of VTP-200 indicate a nuanced opportunity for Barinthus Bio. For an investor, it's a reminder that early-stage biotech investments are often high-risk/high-reward. The specificity of the trial for women with persistent hrHPV-associated low-grade cervical lesions might limit the target market, but it also provides a focused approach in an area with unmet medical needs. The future of the VTP-200 program will greatly depend on subsequent studies and the ability to show efficacy. It's a situation where a long-term view is necessary and current investor sentiment may be mixed due to the insufficient powering of the trial for dose group comparisons. Healthcare Market Analyst The investment implications for Barinthus Bio after the APOLLO trial results can be multi-faceted. The unmet need for a treatment in persistent hrHPV infections and low-grade cervical lesions suggests a significant market opportunity. However, the lack of statistical significance in the pooled data could impact the stock negatively in the short term. It's vital to monitor the company's next steps, such as additional trials, which could provide more clarity on VTP-200's commercial viability. Stakeholders should also keep abreast of competitor advancements in this space, as this sector is highly competitive and fast-moving. 04/18/2024 - 04:10 PM Primary safety endpoint met; VTP-200 was generally well-tolerated, with no treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs (SAEs). Positive trends in clearance rate for both high-risk (hr)HPV (60%, Group 2) and cervical lesions (67%,Groups 2 and 5), were observed in the groups receiving the highest ChAdOx dose.Pooled data from the five different active dose groups demonstrated no statistically significant improvement in either hrHPV or cervical lesion clearance in comparison to the placebo group. OXFORD, United Kingdom, April 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barinthus Biotherapeutics plc (NASDAQ: BRNS), formerly Vaccitech plc, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel T cell immunotherapeutic candidates designed to guide the immune system to overcome chronic infectious diseases, autoimmunity and cancer, today announced topline final data from the APOLLO trial (also known as HPV001), a completed randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2 dose-ranging trial of VTP-200 in women with low-grade cervical lesions associated with persistent hrHPV infection. “This was our first in-human, dose-ranging trial of VTP-200 in women with hrHPV-associated low-grade cervical lesions, who currently don’t have any treatment option until progression to high-grade lesions,” said Bill Enright, Chief Executive Officer of Barinthus Bio. “While we didn’t observe a significant improvement from VTP-200 in the overall pooled results, we did observe positive trends in the highest dose cohorts.” APOLLO (NCT04607850) was a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2 multi-center trial of 108 participants across the UK and EU evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VTP-200 in women aged 25-55 with persistent hrHPV infection and low-grade cervical lesions. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VTP-200. The trial was also designed to assess the effect of VTP-200 on clearance of hrHPV infection and cervical lesion(s), as well as select appropriate doses for further development. The APOLLO study met its primary safety endpoint, demonstrating that VTP-200 was generally well-tolerated and was administered with no treatment-related grade 3 or higher unsolicited AEs and no treatment-related SAEs. The highest hrHPV clearance rate of 60% at Month 12 was observed in group 2, which included the highest dose of ChAdOx, compared to a 33% clearance rate in the placebo group. Groups 1, 3, 4 and 5 showed 12%, 11%, 33% and 36% hrHPV clearance rates, respectively. The study also evaluated cervical lesion clearance rates in participants with both reported lesions at screening and visualization of the cervical transformation zone at 12 months (n=57). The highest cervical lesion clearance rate of 67% was observed in group 2 and group 5, both received the highest dose of ChAdOx, compared to 39% in the placebo group. Groups 1, 3 and 4 showed 40%, 20% and 33% cervical lesion clearance rates, respectively. Pooled data from the five active dose groups showed no significant improvement in hrHPV clearance or cervical lesion clearance rates in comparison to the placebo group. Future development options for the VTP-200 program are currently being evaluated with further analyses ongoing. “We were pleased to see that VTP-200 was generally well-tolerated, meeting the primary safety endpoint in this study. The most promising hrHPV and cervical lesion clearance data were observed in the highest ChAdOx-HPV dosing groups which is informative for future development,” said Nadege Pelletier, Chief Scientific Officer of Barinthus Bio. “However, these differences compared to placebo were not statistically significant given that the trial was not powered for individual dose group comparisons. Further analyses are ongoing, mostly focusing on immunological responses and we plan to share the detailed results in due course.” About the APOLLO trialAPOLLO (NCT04607850) was a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1b/2 multi-center trial of 108 participants across the UK and EU evaluating the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VTP-200 in women aged 25-55 with persistent high-risk (hr) HPV infection and low-grade cervical lesions. The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VTP-200. The trial was also designed to assess the effect of VTP-200 on clearance of hrHPV infection and cervical lesion(s), as well as select the appropriate doses for further development. The study consisted of an open label, non-randomized, dose escalation lead-in phase (n=9), followed by a blinded, randomized main phase (n=99; 67 randomized to VTP-200 and 32 to placebo). Participant groups were dosed sequentially with ChAdOx and MVA 28 days apart, as follows: Group 1, ChAdOx 2x109 viral particles (vp), MVA 1x107 plaque-forming units (pfu); Group 2, ChAdOx 2x1010 vp, MVA 1x107 pfu; Group 3, ChAdOx 2x108 vp, MVA 1x108 pfu; Group 4, ChAdOx 2x109 vp, MVA 1x108 pfu; Group 5, ChAdOx 2x1010 vp, MVA 1x108 pfu. About VTP-200VTP-200 is an investigational immunotherapeutic combination regimen consisting of an initial dose using the ChAdOx vector and a second dose using MVA vector, both encoding the same HPV antigens, designed to elicit an antigen-specific T cell immune response to HPV. VTP-200 is being developed as a potential non-invasive treatment for persistent high-risk HPV infections and associated pre-cancerous cervical lesions. About HPVIt is estimated that approximately 291 million women worldwide are carriers of human papillomavirus DNA.2 Persistent genital HPV infection is responsible for almost all cases of cervical pre-cancerous lesions, which can lead to cervical carcinoma.3 Over 95% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV infection.3 Cervical cancer was the fourth most common cancer in women in 2022, with approximately 660,000 cases and 350,000 deaths from the disease worldwide.3 The American Cancer Society predicted that in 2023, approximately 13,960 new cases of invasive cervical cancer would be diagnosed in the US with over 4,310 women dying from the disease.4 About Barinthus BiotherapeuticsBarinthus Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel T cell immunotherapeutic candidates designed to guide the immune system to overcome chronic infectious diseases, autoimmunity and cancer.

Financial Analyst The first quarter results for Five Point Holdings reveal a strategic maneuver in their capital structure, exchanging high-interest senior notes due in 2025 for new ones with an increase in interest rate but an extension in maturity to 2028. This exchange serves to alleviate short-term liquidity pressures, evident by their substantial cash position of $232.7 million. However, investors should be wary of the increased interest expense that comes with the higher rate, which may affect net income in the long term.Moreover, the sales performance of 82 homesites and 131 total home sales signifies a stable demand in their market segment. The 20.9% debt-to-capitalization ratio presents a balanced leverage situation, allowing for growth opportunities while maintaining a degree of financial stability. The upgrade by S&P Global Ratings is a positive signal, potentially leading to a lower cost of capital in the future. However, investors should consider the broader economic context, particularly interest rate trends and inflation, which could impact the housing market and Five Point's performance. Real Estate Market Analyst The residential real estate market, particularly in California, hinges on the delicate balance between supply and demand. Five Point's optimism regarding sustained demand exceeding supply could be underpinned by California's notorious housing shortage. This environment typically benefits land developers like Five Point through increased prices and sales volume, which is reflected in their quarterly home sales. The strategic distribution of earnings and incentive payments totaling $30.3 million from Great Park Venture suggests effective monetization of assets.However, the market should not overlook potential headwinds such as regulatory changes, shifts in consumer preference and the possible increase of interest rates, which could affect affordability and subsequently, Five Point's sales trajectory. Investors should monitor market trends closely and assess the company's agility in adapting to changing market conditions. 04/18/2024 - 04:10 PM First Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights Great Park Venture sold 82 homesites on 11.6 acres of land for an aggregate purchase price of $74.6 million.

(2) Net debt to total capitalization is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net debt (debt less cash and cash equivalents) divided by total net capitalization (net debt plus total capital). The Company believes the ratio of net debt to total capitalization is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in the Company’s operations. However, because net debt to total capitalization is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement the Company's GAAP results.

We maintained a conservative risk profile, with notable improvements in asset quality and no significant charge-offs,"" Mr. Klein noted. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Revenue In the first quarter of 2024, SB Financial Group’s total operating revenue, encompassing net interest income before provision for credit losses and noninterest income, faced significant economic headwinds. Our operating revenue saw a decline of 6.1 percent from the prior year quarter and 13.1 percent from the linked quarter. Although robust, net interest income decreased by 11.1 percent compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased deposit and funding costs. This also contributed to a 38 basis-point reduction in our net interest margin 1Q 2024 compared to 1Q2023. Noninterest income, however, showed a positive trajectory, increasing by 7.8 percent from the same quarter last year. This growth was significantly bolstered by a 30.4 percent increase in gains from the sale of mortgages and OMSR. Additionally, mortgage loan servicing fees saw a substantial increase of 25.5 percent. These gains, along with steady customer service fees, built a solid revenue foundation. Despite these strengths, we observed a downturn in revenues from wealth management and title insurance, illustrating the varied performance across our noninterest income streams. Amid these variances, our strategic focus remains firm. We are dedicated to maintaining a balanced revenue portfolio and dynamically adjusting our strategies to effectively respond to the economic environment. This approach is vital for continuing to create value for our clients and shareholders and demonstrates our commitment to navigating cyclical economic challenges with resilience and foresight. Mortgage Loan Business Mortgage loan originations for the first quarter of 2024 totaled $42.9 million, experiencing a contraction from the $49.4 million recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. This downturn reflects the cooling trends within the housing market, indicative of broader economic shifts. Despite this challenging environment, SB Financial Group's strategic agility was evident, with mortgage sales climbing to $36.6 million, or 85 percent of production. This represents an increase of $10.8 million, or approximately 41.9 percent, from the $25.8 million recorded in the prior year quarter, showcasing our ability to capitalize on opportunities within the purchase market. For this quarter, our mortgage banking net revenue stood at $1.5 million, demonstrating solid performance and an improvement of $0.2 million, or 20.3 percent, from the prior year. This growth, indicative of the robustness of our mortgage servicing operations, is further underscored by the consistent expansion of our servicing portfolio, which grew by 2.0 percent compared to the prior year period, reaching $1.37 billion. ""In a period marked by variable interest rates and a cautious market, SB Financial Group's mortgage banking sector has continued to demonstrate resilience,"" said Mr. Klein. ""The upward trend in mortgage sales, despite a decrease in originations, attests to our team’s market presence and strong brand. Our increased net mortgage banking revenue and the expansion of our servicing portfolio reflect our ongoing commitment to this business line.” Mortgage Banking ($ in thousands)Mar. 2024 Dec. 2023 Sep. 2023 Jun. 2023 Mar. 2023 Prior Year GrowthMortgage originations$42,912 $39,566 $61,200 $65,387 $49,366 $(6,454)Mortgage sales36,623 33,362 54,085 47,933 25,803 10,820 Mortgage servicing portfolio1,371,713 1,366,667 1,367,209 1,353,904 1,344,158 27,555 Mortgage servicing rights14,191 13,906 13,893 13,723 13,548 643 Revenue Loan servicing fees763 855 850 844 844 (81)OMSR amortization(273) (282) (334) (334) (292) 19 Net administrative fees490 573 516 510 552 (62)OMSR valuation adjustment181 (12) (78) (16) 56 125 Net loan servicing fees671 561 438 494 608 63 Gain on sale of mortgages781 747 1,207 1,056 599 182 Mortgage banking revenue, net$ 1,452 $ 1,308 $ 1,645 $ 1,550 $ 1,207 $ 245 Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense For the first quarter of 2024, noninterest income at SB Financial Group surged to $4.0 million, marking a 7.8% increase from the $3.7 million recorded in the prior year quarter. This notable growth is primarily attributable to our strategic initiatives, including enhanced gain-on-sale yields from mortgage loans and higher recapture of servicing rights, which significantly contributed to our financial performance. Additionally, customer service fees rose by $55,000, or 6.7 percent, further reinforcing our strategic focus in this area. Noninterest expenses for the first quarter were reported at $10.3 million, a reduction of 4.6 percent from the previous year's $10.8 million. This decrease demonstrates our commitment to reducing costs and enhancing operational efficiency, even in a complex and challenging economic environment. ""Our noninterest income has shown consistent growth compared to the same period last year."" commented Mr. Klein. ""The gains from both mortgage and mortgage servicing fees have been significant, reflecting our agility and expertise in capitalizing on favorable market conditions. On the expense front, we continued to reduce our noninterest expenses, reflecting a diligent and calculated approach to cost management. Our ongoing efforts are focused on maintaining an efficient operational structure, paramount in delivering sustained value to our stakeholders.""

Additionally, our cash and cash equivalents have been increasing, providing enhanced liquidity and further stabilizing our financial base.

As of March 2024, our reports showcase a robust position, with nonperforming loans constituting a mere 0.25% of total loans—a clear testament to the enduring strength and soundness of our lending practices. This represents a significant improvement, with a 10 basis point reduction from the previous year, which reported nonperforming loans at 0.35% of total loans. Significantly, the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans ratio has reached a strong 643 percent. This not only emphasizes our proactive and preemptive measures in managing asset quality but also exceeds the performance benchmark set in the previous year. This ratio reflects our structured approach to risk management, which is aligned with the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology, ensuring we remain well-prepared for any contingencies. Furthermore, the net loan charge-offs to average loans ratio, annualized at 0.02%, underlines our effective handling of loan repayments and the high quality of our credit portfolio. With such solid metrics, we continue to uphold our strong reputation for risk management and credit excellence. Mark A. Klein, Chairman, President, and CEO of SB Financial, noted, “Our commitment to asset quality is unwavering and clearly evident in our first-quarter performance. The strength of our loan portfolio is reflected in the low percentage of nonperforming loans and a substantial allowance for potential credit losses, demonstrating our vigilant approach to asset management and our resilience in the face of economic variables.""

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240418137302/en/(Graphic: Morgan Stanley Wealth Management) Bullishness remained steady. Three out of five investors (60%) are bullish this quarter—consistent with last quarter. Fewer investors are optimistic about the economy. Roughly half (53%) agree that the Fed will be able to execute a “soft landing,” down 7 percentage points from last quarter. Yet, fewer investors are making changes to their portfolio. Half of investors (50%) said they do not plan to make any changes to their portfolios for the next six months, significantly more than last quarter (42%). Additionally, only 10% plan on moving out of their current positions and into cash, down 4% from Q1. Inflation and election concerns have increased. Over half (53%) said that they were most concerned about inflation, up from 49%. Unease about the 2024 election ticked up to 31% from 26%. “The US stock market is coming off one of its strongest first quarters of the past 20 years, and so it should not be too large a surprise to see it pull back,” said Chris Larkin, Managing Director, Head of Trading and Investing, E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley. “Yet despite economic uncertainty amid the revised pace of rate cuts for the year, along with uncertainty around the 2024 election, investors remain optimistic about the market.” The survey explored investor views on sector opportunities for the second quarter of 2024: IT – Amid continued interest in chipmakers and AI, technology remained the top choice for investors this quarter. Energy – After Q1 showed glimpses of recovery from 2023, interest in energy held steady as a second choice for investors as oil prices rallied to multi-month highs. Health care – Perhaps utilized as a hedge, the traditionally defensive health care sector secured the third spot at 36%. About the Survey This wave of the survey was conducted from April 1 to April 17 of 2024 among an online US sample of 875 self-directed investors, investors who fully delegate investment account management to financial professionals, and investors who utilize both. The survey has a margin of error of ±3.20 percent at the 95 percent confidence level. It was fielded and administered by Dynata. The panel is broken into three investable assets: less than $500k, between $500k to $1 million, and over $1 million. The panel is 60% male and 40% female and self-select as having moderate+ investing experience, with an even distribution across geographic regions, and age bands.
