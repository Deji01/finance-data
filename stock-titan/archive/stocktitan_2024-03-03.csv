Creditors' Committee files motion seeking extension from March 31, 2024, to September 30, 2024, subject to U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The request by the Creditors' Committee of Sorrento Therapeutics to extend the restrictions on the transfer of Scilex Holding Company's Dividend Stock is a significant legal maneuver within bankruptcy proceedings. This extension can affect the liquidity and marketability of Scilex's shares, potentially impacting shareholder value. Investors and shareholders must understand that such legal actions can lead to temporary halts in trading activity for the affected shares, which might influence the stock's volatility. Additionally, these restrictions can signal underlying financial distress or strategic reorganization efforts that could have long-term implications for the company's financial health and operational strategy. Financial Analyst An extension of transfer restrictions on dividend shares typically indicates a complex financial situation, possibly related to the restructuring efforts of Sorrento Therapeutics. For Scilex, this move could be interpreted by the market as a sign of instability, potentially affecting investor confidence and the stock price. It's important to assess the company's financial statements and cash flow to understand the potential impact of such restrictions on its liquidity and capital structure. The extension could also alter the timeline for any expected returns from these shares, which is a crucial factor for investors' portfolio strategies and valuation models. Market Research Analyst The implications of the motion to extend transfer restrictions on Scilex's Dividend Stock need to be evaluated in the context of the non-opioid pain management market. Scilex's focus on this sector is particularly relevant given the ongoing opioid crisis and the increasing demand for alternative pain treatments. This legal development might affect Scilex's ability to raise capital and invest in its product pipeline, which could impact its competitive position in the market. Understanding the market dynamics and Scilex's role within it will be essential to gauge the long-term commercial prospects of the company post-restriction period. 03/02/2024 - 03:25 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 02, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scilex Holding Company (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex”), an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, today announced that the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors (the “Creditors’ Committee”) of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.

Negative None. 03/02/2024 - 02:51 PM CLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ohio-based Ancora Holdings Group, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, “Ancora” or “we”), which owns a large equity stake in Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) (“Norfolk Southern” or the “Company”), today issued the below statement regarding the Company’s latest derailment. As a reminder, we recently announced the nomination of eight highly qualified, independent candidates (the “Investor Slate”) for election to the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, we announced a proposed management team that includes transportation network leader Jim Barber, Jr. as Chief Executive Officer and lifelong railroad operator and turnaround expert Jamie Boychuk as Chief Operating Officer. To learn more, visit www.MoveNSCForward.com. “We hope the crew and everyone in Lower Saucon Township are unharmed by yet another derailment of a Norfolk Southern train. Although our fiduciary obligation is to pursue optimal returns for the pensions, family offices and other clients who entrust us with their capital, nothing takes precedence over the health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our proposed slate and management team are unanimous in their view that Norfolk Southern must become a safer and more reliable railroad before it can ever reach its full potential. Following this latest derailment, we call for the immediate termination of CEO Alan Shaw and stand ready to engage with the Company about an orderly reconstitution of the Board and a transition to capable management with a track record of actually delivering on safety commitments. It is all too common for people to see in the news that a Norfolk Southern train is at the center of a derailment or tragedy.1 It is only by the grace of God that preliminary reports indicate no fatalities are associated with this accident. Images of diesel-filled locomotives lying on their sides underscore the urgent need to replace the Company’s failed executive leadership and provide this railroad the fresh start it so desperately needs. This latest incident, which follows other accidents and the tragic death of an engineer this year, has resulted in two locomotives tumbling down a riverbank just 50 miles outside of Philadelphia and 85 miles outside of New York City. A derailment of this nature could cause fuel to leak into the river and nearby soil, resulting in health risks for communities who drink from this water and inviting investigations from state and federal governments. American Rivers, a non-profit, states that the Lehigh River supports the drinking water supply of 15 million people.2 A derailment like this could also hurt near-term service quality on an extremely busy line that connects major cities. This latest chapter in a series of accidents, which have been downplayed by Norfolk Southern, leads us to believe that it is only a matter of time before Mr. Shaw’s approach results in another wholesale disaster like the one in East Palestine, Ohio. This comes days after the Board arrogantly promoted management’s safety record and revealed a 37% year-over-year raise in total compensation for Mr. Shaw, resulting in pay of roughly $13.4 million. It also follows the Board’s sustained efforts to poison the well and peddle misinformation about our safety commitments to regulators, shippers, labor and the media. An incident like this, which is drawing national news coverage and resulting in more embarrassment for the railroad, should put an end to the Board’s unsustainable efforts to save a tainted CEO with no long-term future.3 How can anyone defend this?” About Ancora Founded in 2003, Ancora Holdings Group, LLC offers integrated investment advisory, wealth management, retirement plan services and insurance solutions to individuals and institutions across the United States.
