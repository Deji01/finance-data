Gold prices (GC=F) fell more than 1% to trade near $2,162.Investors are digesting the Consumer Price Index release, one of the most important data inputs for the Fed in deciding its next policy move. Headline inflation met expectations with a monthly gain of 0.4% in February, following a 0.3% rise the month before. But ""core"" CPI — which strips out food and energy prices — came in at a 0.4% rise on the month and 3.1% gain on the year, both higher than estimates.The CPI print is seen as influential, given Fed policymakers have said they want to be sure inflation is easing before beginning to bring rates down from their historically high level. Before the CPI release, S&P 500 traders were hedging moves of 0.9% in either direction for stocks.Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its record-setting rally with a rise above $72,000 earlier in the session. Surging inflows into crypto assets have helped the leading token to notch an almost 70% gain this year so far, prompting bulls to predict bitcoin could reach as high as $350,000 this year.On the corporate front, Oracle (ORCL) shares jumped about 12% on signs the database giant is making progress in cloud computing amid a tie-up with AI chip giant Nvidia.Live11 updatesTue, March 12, 2024 at 1:04 PM PDTAlexandra CanalS&P nabs new record US stocks ended Tuesday's trading session in a sea of green with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) notching a new record high as investors shrugged off hotter than expected inflation data.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 1.2% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed roughly 1.5% after two days of losses.

The incident unleashed widened regulatory scrutiny and temporarily grounded Boeing's 737 Max 9 planes in the US. The Department of Justice has reportedly also recently launched an investigation into the incident.Airlines have anticipated plane delivery delays from Boeing as the industrial giant overhauls its production safety measures.On Tuesday United Airlines (UAL) CEO Scott Kirby said Boeing has agreed to build Max 9 aircrafts instead of working on the yet to be certified Max 10 jet.Southwest Airlines lowered its 2024 capacity on Tuesday as it expects 42% less Max deliveries this year from the plane manufacturer.Regarding delivery timelines, Boeing said in a statement, ""We are squarely focused on implementing changes to strengthen quality across our production system and taking the necessary time to deliver high quality airplanes that meet all regulatory requirements.""Boeing stock is down roughly 28% year-to-date.

Southwest said Boeing, which produces the 737 Max aircrafts, told the company it expects to deliver just 46 aircrafts in 2024 compared to the 79 that was expected.3M (MMM): Shares rose 3% after the conglomerate announced William Brown as its next CEO.

Investors are hopeful the central bank will cut interest rates this year.After the data's release, markets were pricing in a nearly 100% chance the Federal Reserve keeps rates unchanged next week, according to data from the CME Group.The market still largely expects the central bank to begin cutting rates at its June meeting, pricing in roughly 60% chance of a cut. Those expectations remain unchanged despite the hotter-than-expected data.Fed Chair Jerome Powell. (Bonnie Cash/REUTERS) (Reuters / Reuters)Inflation has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target on an annual basis. But the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core PCE price index, has come in below that rate on a six-month annualized basis, boosting hopes the central bank could begin to cut interest rates.But more recent data has put a dent in that optimism, with the six-month annualized PCE price increase for January settling at 2.5%.To note, the Fed has consistently preached that the path down to 2% will be ""bumpy.""As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger pointed out, markets began the year betting on six cuts starting in March, only to revert to three cuts starting in June following cautious commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and a slew of other Fed officials along with higher-than-expected readings on inflation.Last week, Powell said that while he expects interest rate cuts ""at some point this year,"" the FOMC committee still wants to see ""a little bit more data"" before committing to cuts.""The February consumer price index will not instill more confidence among the Federal Reserve members that inflation is on a sustainable path toward their 2% objective,"" Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in reaction to the report.""A pessimistic scenario is one in which rates are higher for longer, where inflation reaccelerates and long-term inflation expectations increase, forcing the Fed to resume raising interest rates,"" he continued.

Tue, March 12, 2024 at 7:15 AM PDTAlexandra CanalSticky shelter, higher gas prices drive inflation higherA hotter-than-expected February inflation print was largely driven by two components: shelter and gas.The shelter index rose 5.7% on an unadjusted annual basis and 0.4% month over month, a deceleration from January's 6% annual increase and 0.6% monthly rise.Sticky shelter inflation is largely to blame for higher core inflation readings, according to economists.The index for rent and owners' equivalent rent (OER) rose 0.5% and 0.4% on a monthly basis, respectively. Owners' equivalent rent is the hypothetical rent a homeowner would pay for the same property. In January, the index for rent rose 0.4% while OER increased 0.6%.Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, highlighted that ""while core services inflation was again hot, the all-important core services ex housing weakened from last month while shelter inflation nudged lower.""Shah said that disinflationary trend is a positive but warned price pressures will subside ""very gradually.""""This print is just about enough to keep rate cut expectations for June stable — but another print like this next month would push the first cut into the second half of the year, putting the soft landing narrative in question,"" the economist said.Energy prices — largely to blame for the increase in headline inflation — rose following several months of declines, buoyed by gas prices. The index jumped 2.3% in February after falling 0.9% in January. Still, on a yearly basis, the index fell 1.9%.Gas prices climbed a significant 3.8% from January to February after falling 3.3% the previous month. This was largely due to seasonality and a pullback in US refinery utilization.Other indexes that rose in February included apparel, recreation, and used cars and trucks.The BLS noted the airline fares index rose 3.6% in February following a 1.4% increase in January. The index for motor vehicle insurance increased 0.9% over the month.The food index jumped 2.2% in February over the last year, with food prices holding steady from January to February. The index for food at home also held steady over the month after rising 0.4% in January.Food away from home, however, ticked up 0.1% month over month after rising 0.5% in January.Read more here.

The pundits have pointed to disappointment over Apple not yet revealing its AI plans as the main reason for the stock's weakness. Concern on the pace of China demand hasn't helped sentiment, either.But there may be more at play here, points out Evercore ISI tech analyst Amit Daryanani in a new note to clients this morning.Daryanani shares three reasons behind the Apple sell-off:""We have fielded a large number of investor questions around what could unlock the upside on the stock and help drive the momentum back up. Overarchingly, we think there are three things that’s driven the “underperformance’ for AAPL over the last few weeks – 1) Risk On + Skew to Nvidia/AI: Heard this a LOT from investors that want to go overweight “AI” names like Nvidia (NVDA) especially on the mega cap side, which makes them more comfortable taking dollars away from AAPL. 2) China Worries – There continues to be data sets that suggests that China demand is broadly soft and within smartphones Apple is perhaps ceding back some of the share and 3) Regulatory worries – That continue to impede comfort around Apple. Notably, we have heard worry around DOJ/Google implications and also EU anti trust issues."""

Motley Fool,Here's Why Ranpak Stock Skyrocketed Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-ranpak-stock-skyrocketed-194100898.html,The sleepy packaging stock finally got some attention from the market.,"Ranpak Holdings (NYSE: PACK), a small company that provides packaging systems and materials to e-commerce companies and more, is often overlooked. But investors were certainly looking its way today. As of 2:20 p.m. ET, Ranpak stock was up a whopping 51% following the release of its financial results.An exciting day for Ranpak shareholdersRanpak released financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 yesterday afternoon. Q4 net revenue was up 14% year over year and up more than Wall Street expected. The company leases its packaging machines, and machine placements were up 1.5%. And higher volume led to higher revenue for its consumable-packaging materials.Profits also improved for Ranpak. The company had Q4 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of over $24 million, which was its best quarter in 2023. Moreover, its full-year net loss shrank to $27.1 million compared to a net loss of $41.4 million in 2022.The financial results were enough to motivate a couple of analysts to rethink their assumptions about Ranpak. Both Ghansham Panjabi of Baird and Greg Palm of Craig-Hallum raised their price targets for Ranpak stock today in light of Q4 results, according to The Fly.Expect more growth in 2024 for RanpakFor 2024, Ranpak's management expects to grow net revenues by 6% to 12%, which would result in $370 million to $390 million on the top line. And for adjusted EBITDA, management expects to grow by 5% to 16%, which would result in adjusted EBITDA of $80 million to $89 million.That's a broad range of outcomes for Ranpak in 2024, and it reflects uncertainty on management's part, which is something for investors to be mindful of. Moreover, while Q4 results were respectable, I'm a little surprised to see the stock up as much as it is.For Ranpak, this could be a case of a small stock popping more than usual because volume is typically low -- a sudden spike in interest can trigger big moves. Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if shares pulled back in coming days and weeks. But for patient, long-term investors, Rankpak stock could still find upside if it can keep building on its successes in 2023.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Ranpak right now?Before you buy stock in Ranpak, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ranpak wasn’t one of them.

At $112 billion, the troubled US company is about $24 billion smaller than its French counterpart, as of midday Tuesday in New York.The gap is telling of how the fortunes have turned against Boeing in recent years, in the wake of several issues with its aircraft, including two fatal crashes and a long, painful grounding of its jets. A string of accidents and mishaps this year has been prompting airlines to rethink their own expansion plans.Boeing had been bigger than Airbus ever since the latter became a publicly traded company in July 2000. That changed in mid-2022, following a particularly disappointing outlook from the US jet-maker.Since then, the market value of the two companies have been close to each other — with Boeing largely staying ahead — before starting to plunge amid the constant barrage of recent negative news.The latest commentary from airlines on Tuesday doesn’t bode well for Boeing. United Airlines Holdings Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said he’d seek a deal with Airbus for their A321, and Delta Air Lines Inc. has already been taking that model.“Airbus could be poised to take additional share from Boeing, especially if they add pressure to Boeing’s customers,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Kenneth Herbert.Boeing’s aircraft deliveries trailed that of Airbus last month. The former handed over 27 airplanes to customers in February, while Airbus delivered 49.Story continuesMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Bloomberg,Stock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets Wrap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-look-mixed-us-225117935.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The stock market managed to rebound after the latest inflation figures did little to alter bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year — even if it keeps a more cautious stance for now.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets WrapUS Core Inflation Tops Forecasts Again, Reinforcing Fed CautionChina Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US WheatNY Says Trump Should Post","(Bloomberg) -- The stock market managed to rebound after the latest inflation figures did little to alter bets the Federal Reserve will cut rates this year — even if it keeps a more cautious stance for now.Most Read from BloombergOne of the Most Infamous Trades on Wall Street Is Roaring BackStock Traders Bracing for Worst Shrug Off Hot CPI: Markets WrapChina Has Never Canceled This Many Shipments of US WheatUS Core Inflation Tops Forecasts Again, Reinforcing Fed CautionNY Says Trump Should Post Full Bond During Fraud Case AppealFollowing a series of twists and turns, equities pushed decidedly higher. Notwithstanding the fact that the consumer price index continued to show some discouraging signs of “stickiness,” the overall report came only slightly above estimates. While that’s not ideal for a central bank trying to get close to its 2% target, the February CPI was not a shocker to traders dreading another post-inflation rout.“Fears have been circulating prior to the release for an extra-hot print, which appears to have boosted markets as they failed to materialize,” said Josh Jamner at ClearBridge Investments. “Overall, there should be relatively little market impact from today’s release given it is largely consistent with the prior understanding of the disinflationary process.”The S&P 500 rose nearly 1% — and was on track for another all-time high. Tech led gains on Tuesday, with Oracle Corp. soaring 12% amid a spike in bookings in cloud computing. Nvidia Corp. rallied 5%. Boeing Co. extended its 2024 losses to 30%. Treasuries remained lower after a $39 billion sale of 10-year notes and a growing slate of new corporate bonds.For a glimpse of how traders were on guard before Tuesday’s CPI print, consider the Cboe One-Day Volatility Index — a measure of cost in S&P 500 options with maturities of no more than 24 hours. The gauge closed Monday at the highest level since October, a sign of heightened anxiety.It has since pulled back, along with its more famous 30-day volatility index known as the VIX.Story continuesOn Monday, the options market was more concerned about a potentially big S&P 500 move post-CPI than it was about the Fed’s rate decision next week, Citigroup analysts said. That was based on a strategy known as an at-the-money straddle — when a trader buys an equal number of calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration.Following a few swings in the immediate aftermath of the CPI results, a relative sense of calm in equities prevailed — for the most part — on Tuesday.“Today’s report suggests that while the last mile towards 2% has become a bit longer, the underlying report offers a modicum of hope that by June or certainly July the Fed should feel more comfortable that they’re increasingly closer to their destination,” said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial.While the CPI reading may breathe new life into the sticky inflation narrative, whether it actually delays rate cuts is a different story, according to Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.“Sticky doesn’t necessarily mean overheating,” Larkin noted.To Bret Kenwell at eToro, regardless of whether the inflation print is ideal, investors mostly want to know whether they can count on what’s expected — and right now, that’s for a June rate cut.Indeed, the inflation reading did little to alter traders’ conviction that the Fed will shift to cutting interest rates this year. Futures are pricing in nearly 70% odds that the central bank will start easing in June and enact at least three quarter-point cuts over the course of 2024“The Fed usually cuts interest rates to get ahead of an impending economic slowdown, and with the economy running so strong currently, it’s difficult to justify any rate cuts,” said Skyler Weinand at Regan Capital. “Still, the Fed is likely to cut interest rates one or two times this year, as an acknowledgement that inflation has meaningfully decelerated, even if it’s not quite fully back to its 2% target.”The Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting when policymakers gather March 19-20. Much of the focus by investors will be on the Federal Open Market Committee’s quarterly forecasts for rates, including whether fresh employment and inflation figures have prompted any changes.While the stock market is rallying, the yield curve remains inverted, which suggests that there are plenty of investors who are still concerned about economic conditions this year, said Weinand at Regan Capital.“While a recession would naturally steepen out the yield curve to positive territory, we think the yield curve can steepen this year without a recession, as investors will eventually realize that we can achieve a soft landing and that sentiment shift can push 10-year Treasury bond yields back above 2-year Treasury bond yields,” he noted.Corporate Highlights:3M Co. named aerospace veteran William Brown as its new chief executive officer, a move aimed at providing fresh direction for a company mired in mounting legal liabilities and a much-diminished stock price.Boeing Co.’s aircraft deliveries trailed rival Airbus SE’s last month as the US planemaker dealt with the growing fallout from an early-January accident that has since plunged the company into crisis.United Airlines Holdings Inc. has told Boeing to stop building 737 Max 10 jets for the carrier, opting to switch to a smaller variant and the rival Airbus SE A321 until the US planemaker can pull the stretched single-aisle through its long-delayed certification.Southwest Airlines Co. plans to cut capacity this year, halt most hiring and review its spending plans in response to reduced aircraft deliveries from Boeing Co., the planemaker facing regulatory and criminal investigations in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January.Kohl’s Corp. reported same-store sales in the fourth quarter that missed the average analyst estimate, suggesting the department store chain struggled to attract shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season.Key events this week:Eurozone industrial production, WednesdayECB Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras speaks, WednesdayVolkswagen, Adidas earnings, WednesdayUS PPI, retail sales, initial jobless claims, business inventories, ThursdayChina property prices, FridayJapan’s largest union federation announces results of annual wage negotiations, just ahead of Bank of Japan policy meeting, FridayBank of England issues inflation survey, FridayUS industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire Manufacturing, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.8% as of 1:38 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%The MSCI World index rose 0.7%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%The euro was little changed at $1.0918The British pound fell 0.3% to $1.2780The Japanese yen fell 0.5% to 147.75 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 2.9% to $70,051.73Ether fell 2.8% to $3,920.71BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 4.16%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to 2.33%Britain’s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 3.95%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changedSpot gold fell 1% to $2,159.93 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Lu Wang, Felice Maranz, Michael Mackenzie, Ye Xie and David Marino.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Active funds have total assets of $549 billion in 1,349 different products, making up only 6% of the total $8.3 trillion U.S. ETF market.Market volatility may contribute to better performance of active strategies, as was the case in 2022, when large-cap equity active funds had their best performance year since 2009, according to S&P 500 Global. Yet in 2023’s bull market, which saw the S&P 500 gain 24% over the year, the index edged out other funds.Story continuesIn international equities, the overall underperformance rate was higher—74%. Yet in both U.S. and international equities, small cap funds fared better. Only 54% of international small cap funds underperformed, while 48% U.S. equity small caps underperformed the S&P SmallCap 600.In the fixed income category, performance of active funds varied largely across categories. Overall, fixed income funds had an underperformance rate of 59%, according to SPIVA.Contact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com. All rights reserved"

Dolan, 66, who spent 30 years working for Jefferies Financial Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and other financial firms, formally registered a campaign committee this week to run against Ocasio-Cortez. He now begins a month-long sprint to gather the necessary signatures to land a spot on the ballot for the 14th congressional district, which includes parts of northern Queens and the Bronx.Dolan said he’s running because the congresswoman, the 34-year-old standard-bearer for the left wing of the Democratic Party, is too progressive, even for New York City. He said she’s sacrificed economic pragmatism at the altar of political ideology.“I call it a referendum on common sense,” said Dolan, who’s harbored an interest in running for office since volunteering as a driver for former New York Representative Peter Peyser in the 1970s.Dolan oversaw the financial institutions group at Bank of Nova Scotia until 2020, and spent much of his previous career as an insurance banker. Most recently, he’s worked as an adviser through his own firm, Dolan & Co.Challenging Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t his first choice. In October, Dolan registered to run against Democratic Representative Jamaal Bowman in the 16th congressional district, which covers parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman is a member of the so-called Squad, the unofficial group of eight, nonwhite progressive Democratic representatives who have won elections since 2018.Story continuesDolan changed his plans after Westchester County Executive George Latimer entered the race against Bowman in December, immediately drawing significant endorsements and campaign cash.His rationale for running against Ocasio-Cortez is the same as the reason for challenging Bowman. But the odds against Dolan are steep.There’s little sign that Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most well-known, admired — and polarizing — members of Congress, faces real vulnerability in her ethnically diverse and progressive district, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 8 to 1. The winner of the primary is almost certainly assured of victory in November’s general election.Her campaign had $5.7 million in cash on hand as of Jan. 1, while Dolan’s campaign has raised just $58,000 so far, $55,000 of which is from loans Dolan made to his own campaign.Making HistoryOcasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress at age 29 after winning an upset primary victory over former longtime Representative Joe Crowley in 2018, and has handily won reelection in subsequent contests. She amassed 74.6% of the vote against Michelle Caruso-Cabrera in 2020, the last time she faced a primary challenge.And Dolan, who resides in Dobbs Ferry in Westchester County, doesn’t actually live in NY-14, a potential liability even though candidates aren’t required to live in a district to run in a redistricting year. Dolan said he will move there if he wins the primary.Ocasio-Cortez has her own vulnerabilities, Dolan said.He specifically called out her vocal opposition to Amazon.com Inc.’s 2018 plans to locate a new headquarters in Long Island City, Queens, a deal that fell apart after the company voluntarily abandoned the plan amid widespread local criticism.Dolan blasted Ocasio-Cortez’s support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. DEI has recently morphed into a political flashpoint, as corporations pull back initiatives implemented in the wake of protests following George Floyd’s 2020 murder, though criticism has more often come from Republicans.Migrant IssueHe also accused the lawmaker of “importing immigrants and exporting decent contributing taxpayers,” he said, referring to residents who have fled to Florida and other states. The immigration issue has become ubiquitous in New York over the past year as city and state leaders grapple with how to house, feed and care for the nearly 180,000 migrants who’ve arrived in the city since 2022.“There’s been nobody who’s more in favor of immigration than AOC, and there’s been no worse thing that’s happened in New York in the last year,” Dolan said.Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign declined to comment.Dolan’s platform includes plans to advocate for a new federal value-added tax and an additional luxury goods sales tax. The money would be used to reduce the national debt, state pension liabilities and would allow states like New York to lower income taxes. The plan would help New York stave off decades of population loss that have diluted its power and representation in Congress, he argued.Dolan said that while Ocasio-Cortez may be a political star in the Democratic Party, he has a shot at winning because her track record in the district is thin.“There’s a lot of people who, even in Queens and the Bronx, think, ‘What has she done for us?’” Dolan said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,"Why SoundHound AI, Nvidia, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Rallied Today",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-soundhound-ai-nvidia-other-182435912.html,Better-than-expected results from an unlikely quarter helped boost other stocks in the space.,"There's little question that the catalyst that sparked the current bull market rally is artificial intelligence (AI). The AI gold rush that kicked off last year is gathering steam, but market watchers continue to question the resilience of this upward momentum. However, robust results from one company provided a lift for a number of AI stocks.With that as a backdrop, audio AI specialist SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) surged 13.6%, chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) climbed 4.9%, and social media maven Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) climbed 2.4%, as of 1:47 p.m. ET.A check of all the usual suspects -- financial reports, regulatory filings, and changes to analysts' price targets -- turned up nothing in the way of catalysts to explain the move higher. This seems to suggest that it was the results of another company that drove AI stocks upward.Image source: Getty Images.Evidence the adoption of AI is spreadingThe catalyst that seems to have sparked a rally among AI stocks was a surprisingly strong earnings report from database specialist Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The results provided evidence that demand for AI is spreading.For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), Oracle reported revenue of $13.3 billion, which grew 7% year over year, resulting in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.41, up 16%. While that might not seem like much to write home about, the devil is in the details, with two items of particular interest.Oracle's cloud revenue was the headliner, growing 25% year over year to $5.1 billion. Even more impressive was the company's cloud infrastructure results, which climbed 52% year over year. This outpaced the growth of Amazon Web Services, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure -- also known as the ""Big Three"" cloud providers -- which grew 13%, 26%, and 30%, respectively. This suggests that either Oracle took market share from its closest cloud competitors, or that demand for cloud services is growing -- though both could be true.Story continuesFurthermore, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO), or contractually obligated sales not yet booked as revenue, surged 29% to $80 billion. Since RPO gives insight in future revenue trends, this suggests Oracle's sales growth seems destined to continue.Oracle CEO Safra Catz also noted that AI cloud capacity ""substantially exceeds supply."" As a result, Oracle is ""opening new and expanding existing cloud data centers very, very rapidly.""The chief executive also noted the company recently signed a ""big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with Nvidia"" in the third quarter, but also hinted there's more on the docket. ""We expect to have some very nice joint announcements with Nvidia next week"" during Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference (GTC).This all but confirms that it was the accelerating demand for AI that boosted Oracle's results, which has broader implications for other companies in the AI space.Profiting from AIWe're only just beginning to comprehend just how prevalent generative AI will be, but these highlighted companies have each carved out a niche for themselves in the AI gold rush:SoundHound AI creates AI-powered voice and audio solutions serving the restaurant and automotive industries. The company's tools can be used for restaurant drive-thrus, phone banks, and self-serve kiosks, among others.Nvidia provides the graphics processing units (GPUs) with the computational horsepower required by AI systems. The company has generated triple-digit year-over-year sales growth in each of the preceding three quarters thanks to growing demand for AI.Meta Platforms has long used AI to advance its business, surfacing relevant content to its social media users, as well as directing its targeted advertising efforts. Meta also developed LLaMA AI, one of the most in-demand large language models available on the major cloud infrastructure sites.Each of these stocks is relatively inexpensive, depending on your favored valuation metric. Meta and Nvidia currently sell for 25 times and 36 times forward earnings, respectively, making them the standout choices -- particularly given their history of strong growth. SoundHound AI isn't yet profitable and sells for 20 times sales, making it more expensive and certainly riskier.The trend toward AI adoption is unmistakable, offering investors plenty of ways to profit from the AI revolution.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"2 Growth Stocks Wall Street Might Be Sleeping On, but I'm Not",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-growth-stocks-wall-street-181100406.html,Some tremendous investment opportunities are hiding in plain sight. Lessons learned from other market-stomping growth stories can help you find the next potential rocket stocks.,"There's something special about finding ""the next big thing"" before that thing goes mainstream. Tom and David Gardner recommended Amazon.com and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) years before those online innovators were cool. Without those astute insights, The Motley Fool might not have existed today.Or you can look at my personal history. I dove headlong into that brand-new ""Internet"" thing in 1995, spending every spare moment in my Swedish college's computer rooms to explore the rudimentary world wide web at dial-up speeds. Two years later, I had met a girl in an online game and transferred to her school in Florida, working out the whole transfer process by email.By the end of the millennium, the office of admissions at my new school wanted me to stay after graduation as their webmaster. And in 2024, I'm still married to that American girl I met on an Icelandic game server 29 years ago and all my work is online. Let's just say that the internet has been a game-changer for me.I'm no future-telling oracle, but I did have the foresight to follow the Gardner brothers' advice years before joining the Motley Fool's writing crew. And just as I was early to the digital revolution, I may have found two companies currently poised for remarkable long-term growth, similar to the early days of Amazon and Netflix.Roku took a bottom-line hit in recent years -- on purposeAs it happens, the first name on my list used to be a subsidiary of Netflix. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) started life as the designer of set-top boxes that could move Netflix's video-streaming experience from laptop screens to living-room TVs.The DVD-mailer king struggled in the transition to digital video streams, but astute investors who bought Netflix stock during the Qwikster storm have been handsomely rewarded in the long run. For example, the shares I picked up at the end of October 2011 have gained almost exactly 5,000% so far.Story continuesMuch like Netflix's stock in 2011, Roku's share price is down on unreasonable grounds nowadays. Bearish investors worry about the usual headline numbers -- Roku's sales growth slowed down in 2022 and 2023 while bottom-line earnings dipped into negative numbers. But -- stop me if you've heard this before -- these undesirable financial trends simply reflected how Roku chose to conduct its business during the inflation-tinged economic downturn.Many companies raised prices in an effort to pass their increased expenses on to their customers. Roku didn't contribute to the inflationary trend that way. Instead, the company held prices steady in order to win more end-market customers and a larger market share during this difficult period.As a result, Roku is selling streaming devices below cost. You can call it a marketing expense if you like, and an effective one. The number of active Roku accounts rose from 70 million names in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 80 million users one year later.Chart source: Roku's Q4 2023 earnings report.Oh, and Roku may report negative earnings but its cash profits are positive and rising. The company converted 5% of its 2023 revenues into free cash flows, reflecting generous amounts of stock-based compensation and video content amortization. Keep in mind that cash flows show the movement of actual cash in and out of a company's bank accounts, while earnings are an accounting construct related to tax reporting. So I don't mind low or negative earnings alongside robust cash flows -- that's just clever accounting that keeps tax expenses low.Digital advertising is coming back from the inflation crisis at its own sluggish pace, with the media and entertainment (M&E) sector lagging behind the ad-buying market at large. That's bad news for Roku, who generates most of its revenues from ad sales with an outsized contribution from the M&E sector. But no downturn lasts forever and I think it's both shortsighted and unfair to reduce your calculation of Roku's long-term value based on a temporary challenge.Yet, the M&E advertising headwind and negative earnings still dominate the stock market's thinking about Roku and its stock. Share prices stand more than 85% below the all-time highs from the summer of 2021 and 40% down from the annual peaks in November 2023. You can pick up Roku shares at the modest valuation of 2.7 times sales.That's a bargain in my book, more suitable for a slow-growth cash machine than an early stage growth phenom. One of these lines is not like the other, and I think it's just a matter of time before Wall Street gets back to its senses. Roku deserves a much richer valuation and the company has many years of greenfield growth opportunities ahead. You don't want to be left empty-handed when this goofy discount pricing ends:ROKU PS Ratio ChartAI-powered voice controlsNext, let's take a quick look at SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). This company provides voice control and audio analytics software and services to auto makers, drive-through restaurants, any business with a phone-based menu system, and more. For example, SoundHound AI has managed the voice-control functions in Netflix's reference design for set-top boxes since 2019.Its software relies on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) engines, trained on two decades of song identification services and an ongoing stream of fresh voice-control commands.SoundHound AI's deep learning systems produce a better user experience than simpler systems with basic speech-to-text interpretation. And the company has a modest approach to its brand so far -- customers are typically free to skip the SoundHound AI and Houndify branding altogether and present their tweaked voice control systems under their own brand names.So you may never notice that you're using a SoundHound AI service when talking to ChatGPT in your Stellantis car or ordering burgers at the local White Castle drive-through. Whether you know it or not, that's the Houndify platform at work, and the client network is growing larger over time.This is still a very small company, barely scratching the surface of a massive global market. SoundHound AI's revenues stopped at $46 million in fiscal year 2023, but the company has a backlog of unfilled orders and long-term contracts worth $661 million. That backlog doubled in size last year.So SoundHound AI is building a rocket engine to drive years and years of terrific business growth. The stock recently soared as AI technology giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) revealed a small investment in SoundHound AI, but the stock still trades more than 20% below the price of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2021. With currently tiny revenue streams supported by $661 million in firm long-term order bookings, the stock may look expensive from a simple price-to-sales perspective but affordable in light of the robust bookings backlog.And don't forget that voice control and audio analysis specialists have a history of attracting buyout offers. Shazam is an Apple subsidiary since 2018. Nuance Communications joined forces with Microsoft four years later. I can imagine a bidding war breaking out over SoundHound AI if another couple of tech giants want to get an instant foot in the voice-control door without doing decades of advanced voice-based AI research.Both SoundHound AI and Roku look deeply undervalued right now, especially when you consider the absolutely gigantic target markets they are pursuing. I can't promise that either one will follow in the market-beating footsteps of Amazon and Netflix, but their growth prospects have inspired me to buy both stocks in recent months.These spicy growth stocks may not be your cup of tea, but they have a lot in common with how Netflix inspired me in 2011 and Amazon caught David Gardner's eye in 2002.Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.
