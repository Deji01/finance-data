The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost a more modest 0.1%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses, falling over 1%.Big Tech drove the market action, with Nvidia (NVDA) falling almost 4% and Meta (META) sliding over 1%. The tech sector (XLK) was the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500, falling nearly 1.5%.Stocks have struggled to reprise their early-year rally, buffeted most recently by worries over heightened tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty over the timing and depth of rate cuts.Another bump came on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's downbeat comments on inflation prompted some to recalibrate their bets on a September cut to December.After robust big bank results signaled a return to strength on Wall Street, investors are looking to earnings season to give stocks a push upward. United Airlines (UAL) shares rose more than 17% after posting a revenue beat late Tuesday.But shares of ASML (ASML) fell more than 7% in New York after the Dutch company's quarterly update. ASML, the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide, missed order estimates, though its sales to China held up amid US curbs.Live17 updatesWed, April 17, 2024 at 1:00 PM PDT Josh SchaferThe S&P 500 has its worst stretch since start of 2024The S&P 500 closed lower for a fourth-straight day on Wednesday. This marks the the benchmark average's first four day losing streak since a stretch from late December into the start of 2024, per Bespoke Invest.The market action has whipsawed more than usual, too, reflecting the ""bumpier path"" ahead some Wall Street strategists see the market headed for.In each of the last four sessions, the S&P 500 has closed at least 0.5% lower than its session-high. The only other time that's happened since the start of 2023 was back in October, the most recent bottom for the S&P 500, Bespoke also noted.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 12:15 PM PDT Josh SchaferTrending tickers on WednesdayArm holdings (ARM) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday as shares fell nearly 10% amid a broader sell-off in chip stocks. The move came after ASML (ASML), the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide, missed order estimates in a quarterly release on Wednesday. Nvidia (NVDA) shares also fell more than 2% on the news.Meanwhile, United Airlines (UAL) stock rose more than 16% after the company reported a narrower-than-expected loss than Wall Street expected. For the first quarter, United posted an earnings per share loss of $0.15, narrower than the $0.57 Wall Street expected, per Bloomberg data.Meanwhile, United guided for earnings per share in the current second quarter in a range of $3.75 to $4.25. This came in above Wall Street's projections for $3.73.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 11:35 AM PDTInes FerréOil prices fall as 'geopolitical premium' undwindsOil futures fell roughly 3% on Wednesday, extending their declines over the past two days as the risk of a widening conflict in the Middle East appeared to ease.Analysts anticipate Israel is unlikely to hit Iran's oil production when it responds to Tehran's attack on Israeli government targets unleashed over the weekend.""Crude futures continue to unwind some of the Geopolitical premium that has been priced in,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial said in a recent note on Wednesday.West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures settled at $82.69 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, fell below $88 per barrel.Crude has come off its 2024 intraday highs touched earlier this month when WTI rose above $87 per barrel and Brent surpassed $92 per barrel.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 11:25 AM PDT Josh SchaferHigh rates haven't always been a problem for stocks Rising bond yields have been a key catalyst for stock drawdowns over the past year. But as the market shifts to expect that interest rates may remain higher than the previous decade for longer than many initially hoped, BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski notes that higher rates haven't always been a bad enviornment for stocks.In an analysis spanning back to 1990, Belski found the the S&P 500's monthly return has actually delivered its best annualized average returns when the 10-Year treasury yield (^TNX) was higher.Belski's work shows the benchmark average delivered an average annual return of 7.7% in months where the 10-year Treasury yield was less than 4%, compared to an average annual return of 14.5% in months when the 10-year was 6%.""In a higher interest rate environment, certainly higher than 0% to 1% or 0% to 2%, stocks traditionally do very well,"" Belski said. ""So I think we're recalibrating that, we still think from these levels stocks are higher at year end.""Belski's research shows that on average, stocks have performed better in a rising rate enviornment than in a falling rate environment, too. The average annual rolling 1-year return for the S&P 500 during a falling rate enviornment is 6.5%, while it's 13.9% in a rising rate regime.He argued this makes sense given that one reason the Fed would keep rates lower, or cut them, would be a sluggish economic growth outlook. Given the current backdrop is one where the Fed feels the economy is in a strong position to handle higher borrowing costs, increased rates might not be so bad for stocks, Belski said.""If we can hover between this 4% and 5% range [on the 10-Year Treasury yieldand still have strong employment, but most importantly, have very strong earnings, and oh by the way cash flow, I think the market can do very well,"" he added.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 10:22 AM PDT Josh SchaferASML's earnings miss sinks chips sectorShares of ASML (ASML) fell more than 8% in New York after the Dutch company's quarterly update revealed the the largest supplier of equipment to chipmakers worldwide, missed order estimates for the most recent quarter.Net bookings for ASML's machinery declined 4% compared to the same year prior and were down nearly two-thirds from the quarter prior.“Our outlook for the full year 2024 is unchanged, with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first half, in line with the industry’s continued recovery from the downturn,” ASML CEO Peter Wennink said in a statement.The disappointing outlook, by Wall Street's standards, forced selling action across the chip sector. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA) dipped more than 2% while AMD (AMD) fell more than 4%.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 10:00 AM PDTDani RomeroHomebuyers applied for more mortgages even as rates roseIn a counterintuitive development, mortgage demand picked up for the second consecutive week even though rates rose during that period.The volume of mortgage applications increased 3.3% from the prior week ending April 12, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) reported. Purchase applications drove the increase.Joel Kan, MBA's deputy chief economist, said in a release that ""application activity picked up, possibly as some borrowers decided to act in case rates continue to rise.""Mortgage rates have been hovering above 7%. The prospect of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve’s looks cloudy following recent higher than anticipated inflation prints.“Rates increased for the second consecutive week, driven by incoming data indicating that the economy remains strong and inflation is proving tougher to bring down. Mortgage rates increased across the board, with the 30-year fixed rate at 7.13% – reaching its highest level since December 2023,” Kan said.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances of $766,550 or less increased to 7.13% from 7.01%, the MBA data showed. Meanwhile, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the FHA increased to 6.90 % from 6.80%.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 9:31 AM PDT Josh SchaferTech leads losses on WednesdayStocks turned lower on Wednesday led by losses across tech.As Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland recently noted, the so-called ""Magnificent"" group of tech stocks that led the 2023 market rally still represent a historically high portion of the S&P 500's market cap. And midway through the trading the day on Wednesday, that helped lead stocks lower.Nvidia (NVDA) fell more than 2% while Meta (META) sliding nearly 2%.

This was a noted move higher from the 23% who saw the outcome a month ago and the highest level seen since June 2023, the earliest date on BofA's graph.Meanwhile, 54% of respondents believe a soft landing — where economic growth slows but not to the point of recession, and inflation returns to its historical average — is the most likely outcome.This shows a shift in the discussion on Wall Street, as just 7% of respondents believe a hard landing, where restrictive policy forces the economy into recession, is the base case. Last year, much of the debate on Wall Street was whether a hard or soft landing was in the cards for the economy.Now, the debate has shifted to whether recent better-than-expected economic data could prohibit further progress on inflation.""Recessions don't hit the US economy without a catalyst of some sort, and we just don't see what is going to stop consumer spending,"" Jefferies US economist Tom Simons wrote in a note on April 12. ""With demand still solid, it is hard to see how inflation will continue to slow down, and thus it is hard to see how the Fed can cut rates.""Read more here.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 7:57 AM PDT Josh SchaferEarnings are under more scrutiny this quarterIt's early in earnings season, but a warning sign is flashing is for investors as quarterly results roll in.In a market that's priced in significant earnings growth for the rest of this year, investors are watching closely how companies live up to their expectations.With 43 S&P 500 companies having reported first quarter earnings, companies that miss estimates for both earnings per share and revenue have seen a negative stock reaction of more than 10% the next day. This is well above the 3.1% average fall seen over the last five years, per Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel.And as seen in the chart below from Emanuel, any mix of company beats or misses on earnings and revenue for the quarter have driven worse returns for investors on average this quarter.A chart from Evercore ISI shows that stocks have seen more aggressive swings to the downside when missing on earnings and revenue this quarter. (Source: Evercore ISI)Given the market's recent slump on fears inflation's downward path may have stalled and the Fed could cut rates less than expected, how this earnings season plays out will be increasingly ""critical"" for the market rally, according to BlackRock global chief investment strategist Wei Li.""Earnings have come to the rescue because markets are up year to date, despite the hawkish repricing,"" Li told Yahoo Finance. ""So we'll see if earnings will continue to come to the rescue of hawkish repricing, even as the bar has increased as well for earnings.""Wed, April 17, 2024 at 6:59 AM PDT Josh SchaferUnited Airlines stock soars more than 10% after earningsUnited Airlines (UAL) stock rose more than 10% on Wednesday morning after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results. The airliner reported a $200 million impact to earnings from the recent Boeing 737 MAX 9 grounding, a loss lower than expected from Wall Street analysts.""In a way, you could say the damage here is pretty limited,"" Nick Owens, Morningstar Industrials equity analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.For the first quarter, United posted an earnings per share loss of $0.15, narrower than the $0.57 Wall Street expected, per Bloomberg data. Meanwhile, United's revenue of $12.54 billion came in above estimates for $12.44 billion.Meanwhile, United guided for earnings per share in the current second quarter in a range of $3.75 to $4.25. This came in above Wall Street's projections for $3.73.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 6:34 AM PDT Josh SchaferStocks rebound in early trade on WednesdayUS stocks rose on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) eyeing a comeback as investors put interest rate worries on the back burner to focus on quarterly earnings.The S&P 500 was up roughly 0.4% after booking a three-day run of losses, while Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising more than 0.5%.United Airlines (UAL) was the standout on Wednesday morning, with shares rising more than 7% in morning trade after posting a revenue beat after the bell.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 4:15 AM PDTBrian SozziNetflix bulls not shaken ... yetNetflix (NFLX) shares have had a great ride this year, up 27% year to date (a move not many people have talked about).The bulls haven't been shaken in a volatile April for markets, with the stock up 1.6% versus the 3.9% drop for the S&P 500.The vibe on the Street is that when Netflix reports earnings after the close on Thursday, it will show continued benefits of its crackdown on password sharing and a strong original content slate. In short, investors are positioned for another blowout quarter from the streaming beast.But, there is some concern creeping in on the Street on the back half of the year outlook for Netflix. The company will be cycling several impressive quarters from 2023 (meaning growth could slow), and investors know the bullish thesis very well.What they may be missing are a few points brought to light by Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft this morning.Here's what Kraft said in a client note:""We believe that in order for the stock to appreciate further, consensus estimates for 2024-2025 will need to be revised higher, as we believe a lot is already priced in at these valuation levels. We think incremental subscriber growth from paid sharing will continue into this year, but at some point in 2024 will normalize at a lower level of net additions, with an ongoing benefit from a larger total addressable market and a less leaky customer acquisition funnel. Exactly when net addition normalize in 2024 is an open question since only management knows how large the base of unpaid sharers is that have not yet been forced to decide between paying or losing access to Netflix.""More on what to watch from Netflix earnings from yours truly down below.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 4:00 AM PDTBrian SozziInvestors still not getting it on interest ratesA good amount of focus this morning in markets is on what Fed chief Jerome Powell said on Tuesday, that it will ""take longer than expected"" to get inflation down to the Fed's 2% target.Lost in the Powell focus, though, were even more hawkish comments from Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson.“If incoming data suggest that inflation is more persistent than I currently expect it to be, it will be appropriate to hold in place the current restrictive stance of policy for longer. I am fully committed to getting inflation back to 2%,"" Jefferson said.In the wake of this commentary, fed funds futures are now pricing in only 40 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. Deutsche Bank points out this is the lowest this has been so far in this cycle.But I have to wonder if investors are truly getting that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates at all this year! Check out the CME Fed Watch tool below for the Fed's December meeting. More people are looking for rate cuts than those expecting rates to be at the same level they are today.Investors are still hoping for rate cuts in 2024.

But interestingly, investors may have priced it in months ago.To date, 43 S&P 500 companies have reported first quarter results. Reported sales growth has been a solid 4.5%, and earnings have expanded quicker by 8.8% (despite sticky inflation weighing on profit margins).However, despite the solid growth rates, the average stock price dropped 1.2% after the results, according to data crunched by Evercore ISI strategist Julian Emanuel.Companies beating on both the top and bottom lines have seen their stock rise only 0.6% after the results. Companies that have missed on both the top and bottom lines (known as double misses) have seen their stock price hammered by 10.4% on average.Wed, April 17, 2024 at 3:31 AM PDTBrian SozziAnd we're back again on TeslaI can't get enough of this Tesla (TSLA) fall-from-grace story!So I am back (see 6:00 a.m. post below) with a new piece of research that just came my way on Tesla from Deutsche Bank auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner. I loved this title on his Tesla section: ""Clarity Needed on Future Direction of the Company.""Perfectly said, and most others on the Street would agree.Here's what Rosner said, which goes a long way in explaining why Tesla's stock has gotten run over:""Perhaps most importantly, we view recent sequence of Tesla news as potentially thesis-changing for investors. With still many questions unanswered, it may be too early to tell if it is particularly bearish, or just neutral. As of now, it is unclear if a drivable version of Model 2 is still coming and if so when; how far along is robotaxi in its development and what a realistic timeline for deployment is in light of considerable technology and regulatory hurdles ahead. We expect Tesla to have to comment on these on its upcoming earnings call. Unfortunately, if Tesla were to confirm that its renewed robotaxi focus comes at the expense of Model 2, we believe this would introduce considerably higher risk profile for the stock, and remove a key reason many shareholders currently own the stock. More critically, this change in strategy would also make any upside from here tied to Tesla cracking the code on full driverless autonomy, which represents a significant technological and regulatory challenge.""All in, we await clarity from Tesla on any change in strategy. If Robotaxi is being accelerated with no focus or timeline change for Model 2, this may be perceived as a positive signal of Tesla’s confidence in its autonomous technology and could potentially be accretive to out year estimates. If, however, Model 2 is being pushed out or canceled, we would view it as completely thesis-changing, as we worry about Tesla’s new execution risk profile, see considerable downside risk to 2026+ earnings estimates, and believe the stock would need to undergo a potentially painful shift in ownership base, with investors focused on Tesla’s EV volume domination and cost advantage potentially throwing in the towel, and eventually replaced by AI/tech investors with considerably longer time horizons.""Wed, April 17, 2024 at 3:15 AM PDTBrian SozziCheck out where these former pandemic stock darlings now trade!The rise in broader market volatility in the past week hasn't been kind to two former pandemic stock darlings.Shares of Zoom (ZM) hit a fresh low on Tuesday, down about 90% from their October 2020 peak.

Chipmakers bore the brunt of the selling after ASML Holding NV’s orders tumbled. Nvidia Corp. led losses in megacaps. A tug of war between bulls and bears unfolded amid the expiration of VIX options — with Wall Street’s favorite volatility gauge whipsawing.After a 10% stock rally in the first quarter — the strongest start to a year since 2019 — investors have been increasingly skeptical about how much further the market could go over the near term, even accounting for the continued strength in the economy.“The combination of geopolitical uncertainty, rising interest rates, Fed hawkishness, and inflation frustration have combined to put bears temporarily in charge,” said Mark Hackett at Nationwide.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,030. The Nasdaq 100 dropped 1%. Treasuries extended gains amid strong demand in a $13 billion sale of 20-year bonds. Just a day after Jerome Powell thew cold water on rate-cut bets, dip buyers emerged, with two-year yields dropping further below 5%.Powell signaled Tuesday that policymakers will wait longer than previously anticipated to cut interest rates following a series of surprisingly high inflation readings. Fed officials narrowly penciled in three cuts in forecasts published last month — but investors are now betting on just one to two this year, futures markets show.“Fed Chair Powell was downright hawkish,” said Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman. “The Fed wants the market to do the tightening for them. Financial conditions remain too loose and so some combination of higher yields, wider spreads, stronger dollar, and lower equities is needed to tighten conditions.”While global equities are facing tactical headwinds, this is just a consolidation phase and stocks are expected to keep rising this year, according to UBS strategists led by Andrew Garthwaite.They noted positive developments including artificial intelligence pushing productivity and earnings higher, lower warranted equity risk premium, likely falling labor costs and less worries on margin pressures.Story continuesThe equity risk premium for US equities — a measure of the differential between stocks and bonds’ expected returns — is now deep in negative territory, something that hasn’t happened since early 2000s.While this is not necessarily a negative indicator for the stock market, it all depends on the economic cycle. The lower ERP can be seen as a promise of a future boost in corporate profits, but also that a bubble is in the making.Fundamentals and technical trends for equity markets still appear supportive, suggesting the recent pullback should prove temporary, according to HSBC strategists led by Max Kettner, who are using the decline to add to their bullish stance.“Sentiment and positioning are not flashing a warning signal, though real money investors have started to extend their constructive stance on equities lately, they wrote.US corporate earnings are set for a “healthier runway” through 2024 and investors are growing more confident that companies can meet expectations, according to Morgan Stanley strategists.The market is watching for profits to bottom in the first quarter before sequentially recovering in the second quarter and eventually expanding in the back half of the year, a team including Michelle Weaver and Michael Wilson wrote.Corporate Highlights:President Joe Biden is calling for higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, part of a series of steps to shore up the American steel sector and woo its workers in this year’s election.Microsoft Corp.’s $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is set to avoid a formal investigation by European Union merger watchdogs, calming fears that the relationship could be forced apart.Jane Street Group LLC generated $10.6 billion in net trading revenue last year, as the proprietary-trading firm continues to cement its presence as a dominant market-maker.U.S. Bancorp reduced the outlook for a key driver of its profit for the year as lenders face pressure to pay more for deposits.Abbott Laboratories raised the lower end of its annual profit forecast as strong sales in medical devices drove first-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations.Key events this week:Taiwan Semiconductor earnings, ThursdayUS Conf.

FreightWaves,Prologis sees market tightening again once interest rate cuts begin,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prologis-sees-market-tightening-again-190541566.html,Prologis modestly reeled in 2024 expectations on Wednesday as it believes the recent demand weakness is tied to near-term uncertainties. The post Prologis sees market tightening again once interest rate cuts begin appeared first on FreightWaves.,"“The worst that we are projecting in this period is almost as good as the best we’ve seen in other cycles,” Hamid Moghadam, co-founder and CEO, told analysts on a Wednesday call. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Management from logistics real estate investment trust Prologis said Wednesday that uncertainty around the timing of interest rate cuts has slowed leasing demand in the near term but that its favorable longer-term outlook remains unchanged.Prologis (NYSE: PLD) reported first-quarter core funds from operations (FFO) of $1.28 per share, in line with the consensus estimate. However, it lowered its full-year guidance by 1% to a new range of $5.37 to $5.47 compared to analysts’ expectations of $5.50 at the time of the print.The slight pullback in outlook represents some hesitancy in the market, which management believes will last for the next two to three quarters. Looking two and three years out, it said it’s potentially more bullish than before as deferred demand continues to build.“If you are sensing any acute change in our outlook, you are not reading our call correctly, said Hamid Moghadam, co-founder and CEO, on a Wednesday call with analysts.He said lease signings have been pushed out somewhat due to geopolitical concerns and higher interest rates. However, he expects that to change once rates start moving lower.“People are just scared of pulling the trigger until the Fed gives the all-clear sign with the first rate cut,” Moghadam said.Table: Prologis’ key performance indicatorsRental revenue increased 12% year over year (y/y) to $1.83 billion in the first quarter. Consolidated revenue was 11% higher at $1.96 billion.Occupancy across its portfolio was 96.8%, which was 30 basis points lower than the fourth quarter and 120 bps lower y/y. The company said occupancy rates have fallen 310 bps across the broader industry since the peak two years ago, but only by 80 bps across Prologis’ portfolio.Prologis now expects average occupancy in 2024 to be between 95.75% and 96.75%, which is a 75-bp reduction from the midpoint of the prior range. It said available supply is down 80% from the peak and one-third lower than pre-pandemic levels. It expects vacancy rates to reach the mid-6% range, quickly moving quickly lower later this year.It views a 6% vacancy rate as market equilibrium for rent negotiations.Net effective rent change (over the entire lease term) was 67.6% in the quarter, 120 bps lower y/y.Global market rents were down 1% in the period, with most markets in the U.S. seeing little change. Prologis noted weakness in Southern California (rents down 6% in the first quarter) and the Inland Empire of California due to general demand softness. But Moghadam believes some of that sluggishness is tied to protracted labor negotiations at the West Coast ports over the past two years.Story continuesHowever, rent changes on multiyear leases rolling over were 120% higher across the U.S. and 156% higher in the Inland Empire. The company said marking its whole lease portfolio to current market conditions would produce $2.2 billion in additional rents, or about a 50% increase to the current lease rates.“The worst that we are projecting in this period is almost as good as the best we’ve seen in other cycles,” Moghadam said. “We’ve just been spoiled by a market … where vacancies have been lower than they’ve ever been.”Shares of PLD were down 6.9% at 2:40 p.m. EDT on Wednesday compared to the S&P 500, which was off 0.2%.More FreightWaves articles by Todd MaidenKnight-Swift slashes H1 2024 expectation by more than halfJ.B.

Motley Fool,"Why AMD, Applied Materials, and Lam Research Stocks All Tumbled Today",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-amd-applied-materials-lam-190527749.html,"Will Chinese ""overproduction"" of semiconductor chips swamp the market?","Wednesday is turning into a bad day to own semiconductor stocks -- and China is the reason. Late last night, the South China Morning Post reported that semiconductor chip output in the Middle Kingdom surged 40% in the first quarter -- more than twice as fast as total global semiconductor sales, according to data from the Semi global semiconductor manufacturers association.Shares of leading chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are down 4.5% through 2:10 p.m. ET. Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) -- both builders of machines to make semiconductor chips -- are down 4.3% and 4.5%, respectively.Why China is importantChinese chipmakers are seeing ""soaring"" demand for their products from automobile companies (EVs especially) and smartphone manufacturers (such as Xiaomi). While slowing sales of EVs and smartphones dominate headlines in the West, the Post says Chinese EV sales grew 29% in Q1, and smartphone sales rose 17% -- and China's building its own chips to supply them.Denied access to advanced chips and chipmaking equipment by the West, and spurred by local government edicts, Chinese companies are ""doubling down on ... efforts to achieve self-reliance"" in semiconductors. This could be bad news both for Western makers of semiconductors and for sellers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment -- and help explain why equipment manufacturer ASML missed earnings today.What it means for semiconductor stocksThe Post calls all this ""an unintended consequence of US export controls on advanced chip technology to China,"" and says it's causing ""a wave of state-backed investment leading to overproduction and, potentially, Chinese dominance of global legacy-chip production.""And you can see why that might worry investors.According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, AMD got 22% of its revenue from China in 2022 -- but by 2023, that number had dwindled to only 15%. The story is similar for Lam Research, where China sales slid from 31.4% of revenue to 25.6%, and (to a lesser extent) Applied Materials -- from 28.1% to 27.3%.As China moves to take over the semiconductor industry, those revenues could fall further.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Upgraded Rivian Stock With a Possible Catalyst Ahead. Is It a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-upgraded-180000830.html,"Rivian stock is near an all-time low, and there may be catalysts ahead.","One Wall Street analyst thinks Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock has dropped far enough. UBS analyst Joseph Spak upgraded the stock of the electric vehicle (EV) maker on Tuesday, and implied there could be another upgrade ahead.Spak addressed both a short-term view as well as a specific catalyst that could drive Rivian shares higher over the long term. After Rivian stock has dropped by more than 50% in the last three months, Spak upgraded his rating from sell to neutral on Tuesday. He kept his price target of $9, but noted that there could be a new catalyst emerging, too.One catalyst that could drive this EV maker's stockIn the short term, Spak noted, ""We believe the near-term risk/reward is more balanced at current levels"" after the recent slide in Rivian shares. He added that risks that are now reflected in the stock price include slowing EV sales growth in general. But the short interest has also reached over 18% of available Rivian shares.Any near-term catalyst could spark a short squeeze that would push shares higher. And there is a potential catalyst ahead. Rivian recently introduced the R2 SUV, its next EV offering. The analyst believes that a positive initial update on R2 reservations would support the longer-term potential for the stock.The R2 won't be available until 2026, but the stock could push higher on any update that has investors anticipating growing revenue in the coming years. With Rivian stock trading near its all-time lows, much of the pessimism surrounding EV demand and slowing sales may already be priced into the stock.Investors shouldn't look at the short-term movement or whether short covering might push shares higher. But if the R2 platform, or even the future R3 crossover SUV that will follow, are a hit with EV buyers, Rivian's stock may have bottomed. Risks remain, of course, but investors who believe EV demand will be strong for the lower priced vehicles should consider buying Rivian stock now.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why ASML Holding Stock Was Falling Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-asml-holding-stock-falling-174441650.html,Shares of the chip equipment manufacturer pulled back after a disappointing earnings report.,"Shares of ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), the leading manufacturer of semiconductor producing equipment, were moving lower today after the company turned in disappointing results in its first-quarter earnings report.As of 11:54 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the stock was down 7.4% on the news.Image source: Getty Images.ASML comes up shortRevenue was down 22% from the quarter a year ago as the company transitions to new technology to prepare for the AI boom. It fell to 5.29 billion euros and was down even more sequentially. That result, which was equal to $5.62 billion, missed estimates at $5.87 billion.ASML's gross margin improved from 50.6% to 51%, but operating margins fell from 32.7% to 26.3% as spending on research and development rose, along with selling, general, and administrative expenses.Earnings of $3.30 per share were down from $5.26 in the quarter a year ago. That still beat estimates at $3.15.CEO Peter Wennink said, ""We see 2024 as a transition year with continued investments in both capacity ramp and technology to be ready for the turn in the cycle.""What's next for ASMLThe news seems to signal that chip manufacturers like Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Samsung aren't rushing to upgrade their equipment in order to prepare for the wave of AI-related demand.ASML's guidance also indicated a continuing decline in year-over-year revenue. For the second quarter, the company expects revenue of $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion, which compares to $7.3 billion.The slowdown isn't alarming because ASML's business tends to be lumpy, but a pullback in the stock seems justified as the stock had soared along with a broader AI boom since last October.
