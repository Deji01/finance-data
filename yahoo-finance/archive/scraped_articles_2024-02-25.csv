Motley Fool,Is It Too Late to Buy SentinelOne Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-sentinelone-stock-064400298.html,The cybersecurity firm felt the love as shares hit a new 52-week high on Valentine's Day.,"Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne (NYSE: S) has seen its stock surge so far in 2024. In fact, the share price more than doubled from a 52-week low of $12.43 last June to a high of $30.76 this past Valentine's Day.SentinelOne's share price hit a high on Feb. 14 thanks to Bank of America upgrading the stock from a neutral rating to a buy. With shares still hovering near this high, it's fair to wonder whether it's now too late to buy SentinelOne stock.To determine whether it still makes sense to invest in this cybersecurity company despite the elevated stock price, let's look into SentinelOne in more detail. Now is a good time to do so, because the company's next earnings call, covering its fiscal fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31), is scheduled for March 13.SentinelOne faces industry pros and consSentinelOne benefits from operating in the cybersecurity industry, a space where protection from cybercriminals is necessary for organizations with any degree of digital usage, whether that's a website, email, customer data, or financial records.This environment is why the cybersecurity industry is forecast to reach $183 billion in 2024, and grow to $274 billion by 2028. So demand for cybersecurity services is robust, and that provides a multi-year revenue tailwind for SentinelOne.But it also creates a challenge, because operating in an industry with high customer demand brings fierce competition. As a result, a number of firms dedicated to cybersecurity exist, including CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks. Add to that several corporations that offer cybersecurity as part of their digital solutions, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Cisco Systems.So in evaluating SentinelOne as an investment, a key factor is how well the company is capturing its share of a crowded cybersecurity market. One way to gauge this is by looking at its growth in customer count, and in this regard, SentinelOne is doing well.In its fiscal third quarter, ended Oct. 31, 2023, SentinelOne had over 11,500 clients. Contrast this with the 4,700 customers it had in 2021's fiscal first quarter, the quarter before the company's IPO in June of that year. In just two-and-a-half years, SentinelOne achieved impressive customer growth of 145%.Story continuesSentinelOne's track record of successIn conjunction with customer count, it's also helpful to look at SentinelOne's annual recurring revenue (ARR) -- or run rate -- generated from the company's clients. It provides insight into SentinelOne's ability to not only acquire new customers, but also to grow their spending on SentinelOne's solutions.In fiscal Q3, the ARR reached $663.9 million, a 43% jump from the prior year. This ARR growth manifested into SentinelOne's Q3 sales of $164.2 million, a 42% year-over-year increase. And Q3 was the latest in a multi-year streak of rising revenue since its 2021 IPO.S Revenue (TTM) ChartThis sales streak is set to continue. SentinelOne expects fiscal Q4 revenue to come in at $169 million, a double-digit increase over the prior year's $126.1 million. The company's customer, ARR, and revenue growth show SentinelOne is successfully capturing clients with its cybersecurity solutions.The company's platform has incorporated artificial intelligence since SentinelOne's inception in 2013. Its AI-enabled solution can identify and proactively deal with cyberattacks without the need for human intervention, making it fast and efficient.These AI capabilities help SentinelOne keep pace with the tools available to cybercriminals given AI's rise to prominence last year with ChatGPT's emergence. In fact, SentinelOne uncovered cyberattack software incorporating ChatGPT to perform hacks using AI.Other considerations with SentinelOne stockDespite the strong customer and revenue growth, the company is not profitable. SentinelOne exited fiscal Q3 with a net loss of $70.3 million. However, that's an improvement over the prior year's net loss of $98.9 million. SentinelOne has made some cost-cutting moves as it strives to reach profitability next year.Its fiscal Q3, the company's balance sheet was outstanding. Total assets were $2.2 billion, far exceeding total liabilities of $615 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and investments alone were $1.1 billion.Even though SentinelOne's stock has increased dramatically over the past year, the company's share price is still below its IPO price of $35. So it's not unreasonable for strong fiscal Q4 results to potentially push the stock to greater heights than its recent 52-week high. In fact, Bank of America set a price target of $35.Given SentinelOne's history of customer and revenue growth, its improving bottom line, and strong balance sheet, SentinelOne stock looks like a buy.Should you invest $1,000 in SentinelOne right now?Before you buy stock in SentinelOne, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SentinelOne wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Cathie Wood Just Bought More Shares of Roku Stock. Should You?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-just-bought-more-054400588.html,Roku stock plunged after the company released its earnings report last week.,"Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) stock has been sinking over the past few weeks. The plunge began when Walmart announced it was buying Roku competitor Vizio, and then it continued after Roku released its earnings report last week. It's now down 30% since the year started, erasing much of its 2023 gains.Ever the contrarian, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood has been taking advantage of the plunging price to scoop up shares of Roku stock. Should investors follow her lead?Why Roku stock is downRoku is known for its streaming devices, but it makes most of its money from its platform segment, which is mostly ad revenue. It features ads on its free channels, and platform revenue accounted for 87% of the total in 2023.In all, Roku's revenue increased 14% year over year, with strong performance in both segments. It added 10 million new active accounts in 2023 for a total of 80 million, and streaming hours increased sequentially as well as 21% more than last year.There are many reasons to believe this is the future of content viewing and streaming, and the advertising model could unlock high revenue and profits in the coming year. According to Nielsen, traditional TV viewing hours fell 16% from last year in the 2023 fourth quarter, while Roku's viewing hours increased 21%. This includes all hours on Roku's operating system.Roku features hundreds of channels available to watch on its devices, and it has partnerships with most of the major streaming networks. Viewing hours on its free Roku channel increased 63% year over year in the fourth quarter, and that's important because it can fill the ad slots for all of these hours through deals with advertisers that are looking to catch viewers.There are more indications that Roku still has a large, under-tapped opportunity. Roku's average viewing hours per active account increased from 3.8 last year to 4.1 this year, and the average for traditional TV is 7.5 hours. Viewers are still switching over, and Roku is well-positioned to capture a lot of this market.Story continuesHowever, in the current environment, advertisers are still curtailing their budgets. That's hurting Roku's business right now, and average revenue per user (ARPU) is declining because active accounts are increasing at a faster pace than ad spending. But if inflation moderates and interest rates are cut as expected, it should eventually catch up.As for the Walmart/Vizio acquisition, investors could be scared of Roku facing stiff competition from a name like Walmart. Vizio is a small player compared with Roku, with 2% of streaming hours vs. 8% for Roku. But Walmart's brand and scale could level the playing field. However, Roku has faced competition from other big names, notably Amazon, and it remains the top player.Why Cathie Wood loves Roku StockCathie Wood loves disruptive technology, which is the theme behind her investment firm. ARK Invest offers several exchange-traded funds (ETF) that focus on different areas. ARK has been buying Roku stock for the Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKW) and the Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKF). Both of these ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, almost doubling its gain.ROKU Total Return Level ChartAt its current price, Roku stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 2.6, which is a bargain if you believe that Roku has a massive opportunity.Cathie Wood's ETF's underwhelmed over the past few years when the market switched to safer stocks, but now that it's embracing growth stocks again in this bull market, her picks are outperforming.There's risk with Roku as it fends off competition and tries to become more efficient and profitable. But it has a long growth runway and has been profitable at scale, and that's likely to continue when macroeconomic conditions are more favorable. If you have some tolerance for risk, Roku looks like a bargain that should reward patient shareholders over time.Should you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?Before you buy stock in Roku, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

The deluge, which included notes tied to AbbVie Inc., Bristol Myers Squibb Co. and Cisco Systems Inc., marks a steep surge in M&A financing after the slowest year for dealmaking in a decade.To Arvind Narayanan at Vanguard Group, there’s even more to come. Corporate debt markets have grown busy as investors hunt for new, attractively yielding debt before policymakers can pull interest rates lower. That’s encouraging finance chiefs to raise capital while the conditions are ideal.“We do think M&A is going to continue,” said Narayanan, the firm’s co-head of investment-grade credit, in a phone interview. It’s “going to be front and center.”At least $276 billion of pending M&A activity stands to be financed in the US investment-grade debt market this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Broadcom Inc.’s takeover of VMware Inc. is among the deals that could lead to more issuance this year.Buyout activity is filtering into other markets, too, from European debt to US leveraged loans. Not only are many of these offerings being met with strong demand from money managers, but borrowing costs — while still elevated compared to a few years ago — have been trending downward since October.The average spread for high-grade bonds traded at the lowest level since November 2021 this past week as investors bet on Federal Reserve easing at some point later this year.Story continuesAnother $35 billion of blue-chip debt is expected in the coming week — and at least one more jumbo deal may be possible before the end of the month, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing deals.“The ability to lock in historically low spreads and to appeal to investors who are more motivated by yield — all while the economy is saying we’re in great shape — is a perfect storm to compel borrowers to step in and take advantage of the backdrop,” Meghan Graper, global co-head of debt capital markets at Barclays Plc, said in a phone interview.For finance chiefs, it’s hard to ignore the success of recent deals as bond buyers — from pension funds to retail traders — look to take advantage of currently high all-in yields. AbbVie drew in more than $80 billion of orders from investors, while Bristol Myers’ deal raked in more than $85 billion.WATCH: AbbVie Sees More Than $80 Billion Demand for Bond SaleThe hot demand is allowing companies to sell bonds at yields similar to what their existing debt pays. Borrowers in the US high-grade market, on average, paid 0.4 basis point more yield on Thursday for new bonds compared with the levels on their outstanding notes.Corporations usually have to pay much more than that to convince investors to sell their current holdings and buy newer bonds: These so-called concessions averaged 8.5 basis points for all of 2023 and 13 basis points the year before that.Rising ActivityIn Europe, there’s been about $72.5 billion worth of M&A dealmaking so far this year, a 77% jump from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Even US firms are raising money there. Boston Scientific Corp. sold €2 billion to finance its acquisition of Axonics Inc. The deal was met with more than €5.7 billion of demand at pricing, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private details. CreditSights analysts are now looking ahead for BAE Systems to tap markets to refinance the $4 billion bridge loan used to acquire Ball Aerospace.Even the junk-debt market is seeing new financings for leveraged buyouts re-emerge after months of lackluster activity. Roughly $8 billion in debt is set to start hitting the market in March for Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Stone Point Capital’s buyout of Truist Financial Corp.’s insurance brokerage business.Banks have gotten increasingly interested in private equity transactions, particularly less risky purchases requiring relatively low levels of debt. JPMorgan Chase & Co. beat private credit lenders to provide around $2.5 billion in debt financing to support Cohesity Inc.’s proposed acquisition of a unit of Veritas Technologies.“The market feels like it’s stabilizing,” said Lauren Basmadjian, global head of liquid credit at Carlyle Group. “It’s the most encouraging it’s been in nearly two years.”Week in ReviewInvestment banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc are striving to get a lucrative fee-making machine back in action.The $1.4 trillion US junk-bond market is getting junkier, as more debt gets either downgraded or elevated out of the high-yield universe altogether, leaving greater potential risks for investors.A little-watched corner of Canada’s credit market is being shaken up by the country’s largest lenders as they pile into securities that shift credit risks to other investors — a play likely to be copied by their counterparts on Wall Street.Credit markets are signaling optimism about China’s latest stimulus steps aimed at easing the property-market crisis, alleviating some of the earlier skepticism seen over the impact of efforts to shore up the sector.Chinese builder Jinke Properties and its wholly-owned Chongqing unit applied for restructuring to a local court, saying the company and its subsidiaries are all exposed to capital liquidity risks.A group of China South City Holdings Ltd. bondholders has asked Hong Kong’s securities regulator to investigate the defaulted developer over what it says could be a potential breach of financial rules.Demand for US high-grade corporate bonds is getting “unusually strong,” raising the risk of a market overshoot as investors absorb a glut of supply, according to Bank of America Corp.The financing opportunity for private lenders has the potential to reach $1.5 trillion, according to Ares Management Corp.The US Supreme Court turned away an appeal that might have upended the $1.4 trillion leveraged loan market, leaving intact a legal victory for JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other banks.On the MoveBank of Nova Scotia has recruited Bank of Montreal’s Raad Hossain as a director for structured products in the fixed income, currencies and commodities group.Allen & Overy has hired John Goldfinch from Milbank as partner for its global structured finance practice.--With assistance from Ronan Martin and Jill R.

Every Magnificent Seven stock has more than doubled over the past five years. These assets have significantly outperformed the market during that time. However, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been a largely underappreciated stock.The corporation has amassed a $1.75 trillion market cap and is up by 56% over the past year. Still, that gain falls behind most of the Magnificent Seven stocks. New opportunities and a good valuation can help Alphabet gain momentum and accumulate long-term returns for investors. Those catalysts make me bullish on the stock.Alphabet Has Underperformed the Magnificent SevenAlthough the company owns the largest search engine in the world, it’s fallen behind the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years. These are the one-year and five-year returns for each stock within the cohort.One-year returns:Nvidia: 223%Meta Platforms: 171%Amazon: 77%Microsoft: 58%Alphabet: 56%Apple: 22%Tesla: -2%Five-year returns:Nvidia: 1,579%Tesla: 882%Apple: 320%Microsoft: 260%Meta Platforms: 187%Alphabet: 157%Amazon: 106%These are still impressive returns and outpace the S&P 500 (SPX) and Nasdaq 100 (NDX). However, Alphabet has been outclassed by every Magnificent Seven stock except Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) over the past five years.Alphabet Trades at a Great ValuationWhile the stock has underperformed its peers within the cohort, Alphabet has a better valuation than most tech companies. The stock trades at a 24.5 P/E ratio and has solid profit margins. The company’s net profit margin usually exceeds 20% and should get a big boost in future quarters.Alphabet has three components on its side: rising revenue, more profits, and cost-cutting measures. The tech giant reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 51.8% year-over-year net income growth in Q4 2023. Alphabet’s efforts to trim its workforce contributed to higher margins and seem to be ongoing.Story continuesA contributing factor to Alphabet’s rising net income is the recent profitability of Google Cloud. The cloud computing segment has been taking up a larger percentage of revenue and attributed to more than 10% of Q4-2023 revenue. Google Cloud generated $9.2 billion of the company’s $86.3 billion in revenue. Google Cloud swung from a $186 million operating loss in Q4 2022 to generating $864 million in operating income in Q4 2023.Google Cloud’s margins should improve significantly in future quarters and reduce the company’s P/E ratio by increasing its earnings.Advertising Revenue Is ReboundingWhile it’s nice to see Alphabet expanding in other verticals, it’s no secret that advertising is the main engine for this corporation. Advertising sales slowed down in 2022 but came back to life in 2023. Its fourth-quarter results further highlight this fact and suggest that Alphabet has more to gain.The fourth quarter featured $76.3 billion in Google Services revenue. This segment mainly consists of the company’s advertising and grew by 12.5% year-over-year. Advertising should receive an additional boost from the Olympic Games and the upcoming Presidential Election.Higher advertising revenue also translates into more profits. While the same can be said about most businesses, Alphabet achieved a 35.0% operating margin with its Google Services segment in Q4.AI Presents Another Long-Term Growth OpportunityAmong the Magnificent Seven stocks, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the clear leaders in the artificial intelligence industry. However, Alphabet is also poised to gain a meaningful slice of the pie by using its existing technology and making new investments.Alphabet recently launched Gemini in a bid to bolster its AI presence. The tech firm also invested over $2 billion into an OpenAI competitor. Alphabet has been using artificial intelligence to improve its search results and cloud platform, but these investments represent the next steps to gain market share.Alphabet can close the gap in the AI race with Microsoft. The company started Google Cloud two years after Amazon got a head start with Amazon Web Services. Now, Google Cloud is a critical component of the company’s business. Alphabet has invested in many ventures known as Other Bets that are growing at a high rate. While this segment makes up a small part of total revenue, it’s worth monitoring the collection of businesses under the umbrella term.Is GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Most analysts are bullish on Alphabet stock. The stock sports 29 Buys and eight Hold ratings from analysts, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average GOOGL stock price target of $164.59 implies 14.3% upside potential.The Bottom Line on Alphabet StockAlphabet is an under-the-radar stock (relatively) due to the impressive performances of other Magnificent Seven stocks. The tech giant has outperformed the market but has underperformed most of the corporations in its cohort.Rising revenue and profits from advertising and cloud computing present a great opportunity. Alphabet also seems determined to gain more market share in artificial intelligence, which is a great long-term move for the corporation.Disclosure"
Motley Fool,Better AI Stock: Nvidia or Super Micro Computer?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ai-stock-nvidia-super-183000828.html,Nvidia and Super Micro Computer have been two of the hottest AI investments this year.,"While artificial intelligence (AI) is widely considered a software program, it requires hardware to develop and power it. This leads to investors looking for ""pick-and-shovel"" style investments, as these companies sell the tools needed to power these processes (similar to how many businesses sold picks and shovels to gold miners during the various gold rushes throughout U.S. history).Two of the top ""pick-and-shovel"" plays in the AI market are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI). Both stocks have been rocket ships since the start of 2023, with Nvidia and Super Micro Computer's (often called Supermicro) stocks up 437% and 1,000%, respectively.But which one is the better buy now? Let's find out.Nvidia and Super Micro Computer are complementary businessesWhile both companies could be considered ""pick-and-shovel"" investments, in reality, Nvidia makes the shovel and pick heads, while Supermicro assembles the tools and sells them to end users.Nvidia makes the graphics processing units (GPUs) to handle the complex workloads that AI models require. These hardware pieces have been around for a long time and were originally used to process gaming graphics, but have since expanded their usage to engineering simulations, drug discovery, and AI model training.When companies want to build a supercomputer to harness the power of data through AI, they don't just buy one or two GPUs; they buy hundreds or thousands. To get the most use out of them, they must also be strategically placed and connected to a server, which is where Supermicro comes in.Supermicro builds these servers for clients and offers highly configurable models that can be tailored to end-use and computing power expectations. They work closely with Nvidia to ensure they're squeezing every ounce of performance out of their servers, which benefits users in the long run.But as to which makes more sense to invest in, there's a clear choice.Story continuesNvidia is the superior investment at these pricesSupermicro is heavily dependent on Nvidia for business. If Nvidia chooses to fulfill GPU orders to other clients or the relationship sours, Supermicro's business will be crushed. These two companies have been partners for a while, so I don't see this happening, but it is something to keep in mind.Furthermore, Supermicro has fierce competition from other server builders like Hewlett-Packard and IBM, while Nvidia's AI GPUs are in a class of their own.This heavily skews the bias toward Nvidia, but another factor is also at play.Both stocks were undervalued entering 2023, but Supermicro's stock was unbelievably cheap at just over six times forward earnings.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartThat's why Supermicro has outperformed Nvidia's stock over the past year, but that will likely stop soon. Now that Supermicro is more expensive than Nvidia, buying it doesn't make a ton of sense, especially if they're growing at the same pace.Nvidia's business model is far superior because it controls the primary product, giving it an advantage when assessing profit margins.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) ChartNvidia is far more profitable than Supermicro, and if you give me a choice between two stocks that are evenly priced and growing around the same pace, then I'll choose the more profitable one every single time.While both companies will succeed as the AI buildout continues, I'm more excited about Nvidia due to its superior margins and control over the primary product. Super Micro Computer may be a solid company to invest in, but you're better off picking Nvidia at these prices.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Roku Stock Is Crashing: What's Wrong With This Video Streaming Giant?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-stock-crashing-whats-wrong-180900099.html,Investors are getting impatient over the company's lack of profitability.,"Technology stocks have been on an absolute tear recently. But these returns have been concentrated in a few mega-cap names and beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It might not seem like it when looking at the broad market's return charts, but many smaller technology stocks are doing terribly.One stock that has gone through major struggles is Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU). The streaming-TV platform is off 87% from all-time highs, with the stock falling 30% after its latest earnings report earlier this month. Let's try to figure out what went wrong, and whether shares are finally a buy at these bottomed-out prices.ROKU ChartGrowing usage, but no profitsRoku is known for its streaming TVs and media-viewing software platform, operating as the portal for many people to access streaming channels and internet-connected TV services such as Netflix or Disney's Disney+. This year, it continued to grow its presence across North America and in other global regions. Active Roku accounts hit 80 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 14% year over year.Usage among these active accounts continues to grow, with total streaming hours passing 100 billion in 2023 and growing 21% year over year in the fourth quarter. Importantly, Roku's proprietary Roku Channel streaming service grew usage by 63% year over year and is now one of the largest services in the United States. The Roku Channel could prove a valuable asset since it gives Roku vertical integration -- controlling several stages of the consumer's entertainment experience -- and perhaps some negotiating leverage when talking with advertisers.To make money, Roku has built (and continues to build) advertising and promotional services for the streaming platform. The problem is, monetization is growing slower than usage. Platform revenue -- which is essentially advertising revenue -- grew 13% year over year in the fourth quarter, with revenue per user down 4% year over year in 2023. This led to another year without profits, posting an operating loss of $793 million in 2023 compared to $531 million in 2022.Story continuesThe numbers are moving in the wrong direction, and investors are not happy. This is why the stock sold off yet again to start the year.How big does the streaming platform need to get?Roku has shown it can consistently increase its active users. It is now a top streaming TV operator in Canada and Mexico, with plans to spread across other Latin American markets.With its 80 million accounts and over 500 million people living in Canada, the United States, and Mexico, there is plenty of room to grow in its core markets. And in the United Kingdom, Roku now has many TV models for sale.Advertising will certainly follow usage, but the concern should be: Do these advertisers need -- let alone want -- to use Roku? Today, despite Roku's massive scale, many ad buyers appear to prefer platforms like YouTube instead.YouTube had $9.2 billion in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter, which Roku didn't see any of. Its entire 2023 revenue (some of which isn't advertising) was under $3.5 billion.Right now, people are spending a lot of time using Roku's platform with the company earning little in return, which is a bad situation.Only one thing matters for shareholders: profitsA company can grow its revenue all it wants. But for shareholders, what truly matters over the long term are earnings. Roku lost over $700 million last year and will likely lose money again in 2024.Even if we assume it could generate a profit if it wanted to pull back on growth initiatives, the stock does not look cheap. On a theoretical 10% profit margin, Roku would be generating $350 million in annual earnings on $3.5 billion in revenue. If that revenue grows to $5 billion, Roku could perhaps be generating $500 million in earnings within a few years.The company now has a market cap of $9 billion. If it had $350 million in earnings, it would have a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 26, and on $500 million in earnings, it would have a P/E of 18. Neither of these looks very cheap, especially when you remember these are theoretical earnings that Roku is not generating today.Either you expect Roku to grow its revenue substantially over the next few years, or you believe it will see a huge inflection in its profit margins.

Motley Fool,Better Comeback Stock: Alibaba vs. Peloton,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-comeback-stock-alibaba-vs-173800767.html,Which of these beaten-down stocks is a better turnaround play?,"Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) and Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON) have both frustrated plenty of investors over the past few years. Alibaba's stock hit its all-time high in October 2020 as the bulls embraced the Chinese e-commerce and cloud leader, but it subsequently sank more than 75% as it faced fierce macro, regulatory, and competitive headwinds.Peloton's stock closed at its record high in January 2021 as its sales of connected bikes and subscriptions accelerated throughout the pandemic. But it then shed roughly 97% of its value as its growth stalled out amid broad economic reopening. Could either of these beaten-down stocks be a worthwhile turnaround play for patient investors?Image source: Peloton.Alibaba's high-growth days are overAlibaba's downfall started when China's antitrust regulators levied a record $2.75 billion fine against its e-commerce business in 2021. Alibaba was then barred from locking in its merchants with exclusive deals, using aggressive loss-leading promotions, and making big investments or acquisitions without the government's permission.Those restrictions eroded Alibaba's defenses against its top competitors, PDD Holdings and JD.com. China's unpredictable zero-COVID lockdowns and other macro issues also exacerbated its slowdown.As Alibaba's Chinese e-commerce marketplaces cooled off, its cloud business struggled to grow as companies reined in their spending to cope with the macro headwinds. It also lost ByteDance's TikTok as a major customer as it shifted the personal data of its overseas users to Oracle's cloud platform in 2022.All of that pressure caused Alibaba's revenue to grow just 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last March), compared to its 19% growth in fiscal 2022 and 41% growth in fiscal 2021.That slowdown convinced the bears that Alibaba's high-growth days were over, but it's expanding its higher-growth overseas e-commerce business -- which houses its Southeast Asian marketplace Lazada, its Turkish marketplace Trendyol, and its cross-border marketplace AliExpress -- to offset that slowdown. Its other major growth engine is its Cainiao logistics division, which it's expanding as a standalone business to provide more services for third-party customers.Story continuesFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Alibaba's revenue to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its Chinese e-commerce and cloud businesses stabilize. However, they also expect its net income to rise at a CAGR of 24% as it reins in its spending and spins off some of its units as fresh IPOs. Based on those expectations, its stock looks dirt cheap at 11 times forward earnings.Peloton is slowing resolving its biggest issuesPeloton's business started to crumble when gyms reopened and cheaper competitors entered the market. It expanded its business with a connected treadmill and other products, but its revenue still dropped 11% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and 22% in fiscal 2023. It expects another 3% decline in fiscal 2024.As Peloton's growth stalled out, it laid off thousands of employees, outsourced its production to a Taiwanese manufacturer, and started selling its products on Amazon to expand its reach beyond its first-party website and showrooms.Peloton also reduced its equipment prices to keep pace with its cheaper competitors, but it raised its subscription fees to offset its lower gross margin. It believes the expansion of its higher-margin subscription business will ultimately reduce its dependence on its lower-margin sales of bikes, treadmills, and other equipment.Those strategies enabled it to expand its margins and narrow its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) losses. Analysts expect its adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in fiscal 2025, but it's also expected to stay unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis for the foreseeable future. On the bright side, analysts expect its revenue to finally rise 5% in fiscal 2025 and 7% in fiscal 2026 as it ""rightsizes"" its business.Peloton's stock looks cheap at a price-to-sales ratio of 1, but there's no guarantee that it will survive. It only served 718,000 paid app subscribers at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 -- compared to 2.97 million at the end of fiscal 2022 -- and it could run out of room to grow its revenue per subscriber before its entire business model implodes.The obvious winner: AlibabaAlibaba lost its mojo over the past few years, but I believe it's still worth owning as a slow-growth e-commerce and cloud stock. Its stock is cheap, it generates plenty of cash, and it's constantly buying back its shares. Peloton won't go bankrupt this year, but it still needs to stabilize its core business before it can be considered a worthwhile investment.Should you invest $1,000 in Alibaba Group right now?Before you buy stock in Alibaba Group, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alibaba Group wasn’t one of them.
