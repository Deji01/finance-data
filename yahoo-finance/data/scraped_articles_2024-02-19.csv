Earnings from bellwether Nvidia Corp. Wednesday could provide new impetus for equities as investors try to gauge the strength of the global economy.The Stoxx Europe 600 was little changed following the previous week’s 1.4% surge that took the gauge to within four points of its January 2021 high. Basic resources stocks led declines after iron ore tumbled, while the technology sector also underperformed. Defensive sectors, including telecoms and health care, posted gains.Among individual movers in Europe, AstraZeneca PLc climbed more than 3% after trial data showed its Tagrisso drug slowed disease progression in lung cancer patients. German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall AG advanced as much as 4% after announcing it will open a new plant in Ukraine. Banco Santander SA rose after kicking off a share buyback.US and global stocks are yet to respond to the selloff in Treasuries this month, after a string of better-than-expected economic data and hawkish comments by policy makers drove traders to roll back aggressive bets on rate cuts. Investors also have to contend with mixed earnings, while the Middle East conflict and Red Sea shipping chaos pose major risks to the outlook for profits.“Our base case remains that equities will end the year higher than current levels, but we do not expect it to be a straight path,” said Mohit Kumar, the chief economist for Europe at Jefferies International Ltd. “We are looking for a bit of a pull-back in the near term, which would provide better levels to reset long positions.”Story continuesSwaps are now pricing about 90 basis points of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024 — from more than 150 basis points at the start of February. In Europe, wagers have been whittled down to about 100 basis points, from 150.For JPMorgan Asset Management, US stocks are priced for perfection amid “healthier” market momentum since the beginning of the year.“Markets have adjusted to the idea that rate cuts would come later and probably be less important than what was originally priced,” Vincent Juvyns, global market strategist, said on Bloomberg Television. The move upward are also “really driven by decent earnings growth that we have seen during the fourth quarter,” he added.This week, traders will be keeping an eye on European inflation data as well as earnings from Nvidia and mining giants BHP Group Ltd and Rio Tinto Plc.

China mainland benchmark CSI 300 Index rebounded from earlier losses in the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. The stocks had struggled in the early hours despite buoyant travel and tourism data that suggested consumption revved up even as the broader economy struggles with deflation and a property crisis.Traders are now looking for further policy support across China’s monetary and fiscal space, in addition to a cut in the reserve requirement ratio already undertaken.

Autoblog,Detroit automakers splurge on shareholders with big stock buybacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detroit-automakers-splurge-shareholders-big-200000395.html,The Detroit Three spent a combined $22.7 billion buying back their shares and paying dividends last year.,"General Motors, Ford and Stellantis are engaged in a race that investors are cheering now, but may look back on as foolish within a few years.The three spent a combined $22.7 billion buying back their shares and paying dividends last year. It’s a remarkable sum for companies that were pleading poverty only a few months ago, when the United Auto Workers union was demanding — and eventually won — costlier labor contracts.It’s also a curious use of cash, considering how far these carmakers have fallen behind in the shift to electric vehicles. Even as Tesla and China’s BYD lap them, the Detroit Three increasingly are hedging their bets on battery-electric models. While their early wagers have been big money-losers thus far, paring investments back while splurging on shareholders puts their long-term futures at risk.GM carried out much of its binge toward the end of last year, when CEO Mary Barra announced the company’s biggest-ever buyback plan and boosted the dividend by a third. It would be one thing if GM had money to burn from having pulled off the “breakout year” for EVs that Barra predicted in early 2023. But that wasn’t meant to be.GM missed its EV production goal by a mile. Its battery joint-venture plants were plagued by persistent manufacturing issues, and as the year came to a close, buggy software left the company with no choice but to stop sales of the new electric Chevrolet Blazer shortly after launch.Ford also didn’t have the year it was hoping for with EVs. It was forced to cut prices of its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle and F-150 Lightning pickup in an effort to keep up with competitors led by Tesla. By year-end, the company halved its weekly production plan for the plug-in truck.Ford’s EV business ended up losing $4.7 billion for the year, and has forecast at least a $5 billion deficit for 2024. The company nonetheless spent roughly that amount paying dividends, a stream of income that’s particularly important to the Ford family.Story continuesWhereas GM and Ford have swung at Tesla and largely missed, Stellantis has barely picked up a bat in the US. That will change this year, with the company planning to launch eight battery-electric models bearing Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Fiat badges, but those EVs will have a lot of catching up to do.Whether these models fare well in the market or not, shareholders are making out nicely. Stellantis spent over 50% more on dividends and buybacks in 2023 and plans to double repurchases in 2024.One automaker that hasn’t bothered to shower shareholders with cash is Tesla. The company has never declared a dividend and tells investors it doesn’t anticipate paying one for the foreseeable future.While Elon Musk flirted with the idea of a buyback in 2022, when shareholder unrest over his acquisition of Twitter was at its peak, Tesla’s board didn’t pull the trigger on the $5 billion to $10 billion repurchase that the CEO said was possible. (For a well-thought-out weighing of the pros and cons for Tesla, see Liam Denning’s latest Bloomberg Opinion column.)GM, Ford and Stellantis have fared well the last few months as an industrywide EV growth slowdown set in. GM shares have soared 35% since the company announced its buyback and dividend plan in late November. Ford is up 21% in that span, while Stellantis is trading at an all-time high.But while Tesla’s warning of “notably lower” growth has taken some of the wind out its sails, it’s still a $638 billion company that Detroit can’t afford to take for granted. Don’t take my word for it — ask Ford CEO Jim Farley.“The ultimate competition,” Farley said during Ford’s earnings call this month, “is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese.”You Might Also LikeGM’s electrification efforts have been a total gong showBiden's nicely loaded, built-to-order Cadillac ATS-V is up for saleF1's Sergio Perez, displaced at Red Bull, says he still has a lot to achieve"
The Telegraph,London Stock Exchange owner to double chief executive’s pay,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/london-stock-exchange-owner-double-180013207.html,The owner of the London Stock Exchange is planning to double the pay of its chief executive amid concerns that City bosses are being lured to deep-pocketed US rivals.,"Mr Schwimmer will reportedly earn twice his current maximum package of £6.25m - Brendan McDermid/ReutersThe owner of the London Stock Exchange is planning to double the pay of its chief executive amid concerns that City bosses are being lured to deep-pocketed US rivals.David Schwimmer, boss of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), will reportedly have the opportunity to earn twice his current maximum package of £6.25m under proposed changes to the group’s pay policy.Mr Schwimmer, who took the helm in 2018, was paid £4.7m last year. This included base pay of £1m, plus a £1.4m annual bonus and around £2m in long-term incentives.The revised pay structure could reportedly increase Mr Schwimmer’s annual bonus to 300pc of his base salary, up from 225pc.The group – which owns the London Stock Exchange, clearing house LCH and financial market data provider Refinitiv – is currently consulting major shareholders about the move, Sky News reported.It comes amid concerns that small pay packages for FTSE bosses are harming London’s stock market.Julia Hoggett, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, last year warned of the disparity between executive pay in the UK and US, which typically compensates bosses much more generously.She argued that this “lack of level playing field” has driven an exodus of companies and talent from the Square Mile.Ms Hoggett said at the time: “The alternative is we continue standing idly by as our biggest exports become skills, talent, tax revenue and the companies that generate it.”She called for a “constructive discussion” between UK investors and advisors about boardroom pay to stop them leaving for New York.Lower pay deals for UK executives have been blamed as one of the reasons London’s stock market has struggled to attract new listings.Only 23 companies floated in the UK last year, down 49pc from the 45 listings recorded during the previous year, according to EY.An LSEG spokesman said: “The committee periodically reviews executive remuneration arrangements, in line with usual corporate governance practices, to ensure they remain fit for purpose and aligned to our ambitious growth strategy.“The policy will focus on attracting, securing, retaining and rewarding the best talent in a competitive global market.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Motley Fool,"1 Beaten-Down Stock That Turned $10,000 Into Nearly $1 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-beaten-down-stock-turned-171700806.html,A track record of winning has made this business a dominant industry leader.,"As a business that provides the clothing and footwear for athletes to compete at the highest level, Nike (NYSE: NKE) has certainly been a winning investment in the past.In the last 30 years, the top footwear and apparel stock has turned a $10,000 initial investment into a whopping $962,000 today (as of Feb. 14), including dividends. A similar investment in the S&P 500 would be worth $189,000 today.Let's take a look at Nike's history to figure out what factors led to such an impressive performance. For prospective investors, it's best to view things today with a fresh perspective.Nike's history of winningWithout a doubt, Nike's most important quality is its strong brand. The company was founded in 1964, and it has taken decades for the brand to become as powerful as it is today. This is certainly what makes up Nike's economic moat, allowing it to stand out against competition.In the mid-1980s, the business signed NBA superstar Michael Jordan as its most high-profile endorsement at the time. This led to the launch of the Air Jordan line, which continues to release extremely successful products to this day. This also gave Nike a globally recognized athlete who could raise the brand's awareness and appeal with people everywhere. Moreover, this was the start of Nike developing a core competency when it comes to marketing efforts. These days, the company is known for its incredibly influential advertising campaigns that not only resonate with people but exude a winning mentality. And there are numerous well-known athletes on Nike's endorsement roster now. Of course, what really contributed to Nike's impressive share-price performance in the last three decades are strong fundamentals. Nike has done a fantastic job at growing its revenue and earnings over the years. Just in the last decade, sales and net income have increased at compound annual rates of 109% and 194%, respectively.Thanks to the power of the brand, Nike products carry a premium status in the marketplace. The business posted a superb gross margin of 44.6% in the most recent fiscal quarter (second-quarter 2024 ended Nov. 30, 2023).Story continuesThe current situationDespite its tremendous historical success, Nike has hit a bit of a rough patch. Its sales are forecast to rise by just 1% in the current fiscal year. Management blames the challenging macroeconomic environment that is pressuring consumer demand. Elevated levels of uncertainty and ongoing inflationary concerns might discourage shoppers from spending money on discretionary items.However, Nike is also facing stiff competition these days, which adds to the worries. There are many direct-to-consumer brands out there that have leveraged social media as a key marketing platform, and this might undermine the standing Nike has developed with customers.In greater China, which has usually been the company's fastest-growing region, Nike reported sales of roughly $1.9 billion in the latest quarter, a lower number than three years earlier. The business might be losing market share to rivals.But to its credit, Nike's gross margin actually expanded on a year-over-year basis. The company is successfully gaining better control over its inventory, which expanded by 43% in the year-ago period. The current inventory balance of $8 billion is 14% lower than it was at the end of Q2 2023. This indicates that management's top priority remains protecting the brand's status, which is the right thing to do.As we set our sights on the next 30 years, how likely is it that Nike will once again produce a return of more than 9,500% between now and the beginning of 2054? To be clear, I don't think shares will repeat their historical performance. As a more mature enterprise, Nike's growth prospects will naturally decline as it gets larger and further penetrates its key markets.Shares are currently trading 40% below their peak price, so some investors might still consider adding the business to their portfolios right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Why Palantir Technologies, Arm Holdings, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Skyrocketed 50% or More in February",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-palantir-technologies-arm-holdings-171500648.html,The proliferation of AI continues.,"The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has been gathering steam over the past year, but there's been a notable uptick in AI-related developments over the past several weeks. Since the start of February alone, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR) have jumped 55%, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) surged 72%, Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) soared 90%, and SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) skyrocketed 121% as of the market close on Thursday.The common thread that runs through these companies is the accelerating adoption of AI. There wasn't a single development that drove these stocks higher, but rather the growing tidal wave of AI that's beginning to overtake the tech industry.Let's look at what drove each of these stocks higher and what it all means for the future.Image source: Getty Images.Show me the moneyIt wasn't just the growing secular tailwinds of generative AI that drove these stocks higher. Three of the four recently reported quarterly financial results that easily surpassed investor expectations.Supermicro was first out of the gate, reporting the results of its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023). The company generated revenue of $3.7 billion, up 103% year over year and 73% sequentially. Management cited record and accelerating demand for AI servers. Profit was equally spectacular, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.59 rising 62%. If that weren't enough, the company is forecasting full-year revenue of $14.5 billion at the midpoint of its guidance, which would represent 100% growth.Next up was Palantir Technologies. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $608 million marked a 20% jump year over year and 9% sequentially, fueled by a 70% jump in U.S. commercial revenue. This performance helped the company generate its fifth consecutive quarter of profit according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), with adjusted EPS of $0.08. The headline was the forecast for at least 40% growth from its U.S. commercial business over the coming year, thanks to robust demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform, Palantir's generative AI solution.Story continuesMost recently, Arm Holdings delivered eye-opening results. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter, Arm generated record revenue of $824 million, up 14% year over year, driven by license revenue that grew 18% and record royalty revenue that climbed 11%. This performance resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.29, rising 32%. It was the company's forecast that really caught Wall Street off guard. Management is guiding for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $850 million to $900 million, or growth of between 34% and 42%, lunging past the third quarter's 14% growth.What these companies have in common, aside from the obvious ties to AI, is that each company delivered a ""beat and raise"" quarter, defying expectations and providing guidance that outpaced Wall Street's already bullish expectations.SOUN ChartThe godfather of AI takes stockThere's a strong argument to be made that Nvidia saw the writing on the wall and positioned itself for the AI boom to come. Investors need only review the company's recent results to understand the magnitude of the secular tailwind involved.For Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), the company delivered record revenue that jumped 206% to $18.1 billion, resulting in diluted EPS that surged 1,274% to $3.71.So when Nvidia makes a notable move in the field of AI, investors take notice.In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Nvidia revealed that it had taken stakes in several AI-related companies, causing a spike in their respective shares.Nvidia purchased 1.73 million shares of SoundHound AI, which provides voice-controlled AI solutions for businesses, in a stake valued at $6.5 million as of Thursday's market close. The company's technology has been deployed by a number of high-profile restaurants, including White Castle and Jersey Mike's, to power voice-enabled phone and drive-through ordering. It's also one of the leading providers of voice-AI solutions to carmakers, counting more than 20 automotive brands on its customer list.SoundHound wasn't the only one. Nvidia finally confirmed the size of the stake it took in Arm Holdings: It owns 1.96 million shares worth roughly $262 million. Arm provides the designs behind some of the world's most widely used central processing units. After two years in the making, regulators quashed an attempted merger between Nvidia and Arm in early 2022.Some viewed these purchases as a significant vote of confidence from Nvidia. As a result, many investors followed suit, piling into the stocks.ARM PEG Ratio (Forward) ChartThe cost isn't as high as you might thinkThe most common bear argument for investing in these and many AI stocks is the valuation. That view is understandable but tends to ignore the stunning growth rates of the companies in question. It reveals the limitations involved in using the price-to-earnings ratio or the price-to-sales ratio, especially when using them in a vacuum.When dealing with high-growth stocks, the more appropriate measure is the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, as it takes the growth rate of the company's profit into account. Since SoundHound AI isn't yet profitable, the point is moot. However, for Arm Holdings, Super Micro Computer, and Palantir Technologies, they clock in with forward PEG ratios of 0.8, 0.5, and 0.3, all well below the level of 1, which is the standard for an undervalued stock.From that perspective, Arm Holdings, Super Micro Computer, and Palantir Technologies are not only growing quickly but are also cheaper than you might think.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

This move signifies Beijing’s urgency to restore investor confidence and halt the market’s slide, which has erased a significant value from Hong Kong and China equities since their 2021 peaks. The Shanghai Composite Index, for example, is down over 21% from its high in December 2021.The downturn has been attributed to a variety of factors, including regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical tensions, real estate defaults and internal economic pressures, prompting a call for decisive action to prevent further damage to consumer confidence, especially as the country approached the Lunar New Year holiday.Don't Miss:This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?This Los Angeles startup is closing a real estate market gap worth hundreds of billions and you can invest in it with as little as $100.China’s real estate sector has been grappling with significant challenges, culminating in a crisis that has reverberated through the country’s economy. The crisis was highlighted by the downfall of China Evergrande, Group one of China’s largest property developers, which became emblematic of the broader issues plaguing the sector. Evergrande’s aggressive expansion, characterized by a rapid acquisition of land and significant borrowing, eventually led to its financial distress. This situation underscored the broader vulnerabilities within China’s real estate market, including high levels of debt, a slowdown in property sales and regulatory changes aimed at curbing speculative investments​​.The crisis has had wide-ranging implications, not only for property developers but also for the Chinese economy as a whole. The real estate sector, a critical engine of economic growth in China, has faced $125 billion in bond defaults between 2020 and 2023. This slump has contributed to layoffs, financial instability and a dampening effect on China’s post-pandemic economic recovery​.Story continuesTrending: This startup in the climate tech industry could unlock the riches flowing 30 feet above your head.China’s economic challenges are multifaceted, stemming from a post-COVID recovery that has fallen short of expectations. Despite hopes that the end of stringent COVID-19 restrictions would rejuvenate consumer spending, foreign investment and manufacturing, the reality has been starkly different. Consumers are saving more than spending, foreign firms are withdrawing investments, and the property sector, along with local government finances, has been severely impacted. These developments raise doubts about the sustainability of China’s growth model, which has long been driven by construction and investment over consumption​​​​​​.The leadership’s response has been to pledge a boost in domestic demand and economic recovery for 2024, with a focus on supporting the economy through more stimulus measures. Yet, the effectiveness of these initiatives remains to be seen, as previous measures have underwhelmed market expectations and investor confidence. The government is advocating for a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy, aiming to enhance economic vitality and address the risks and imbalances plaguing the economy. Nonetheless, the path to a sustainable recovery appears complex, with challenges such as managing high levels of debt, stimulating consumption and navigating geopolitical tensions​​.In the face of these challenges, China’s efforts to communicate its strategies and reassure both the domestic and international communities have encountered skepticism. Analysts highlight a growing disconnect between official optimism and the realities faced by businesses and consumers. This gap underscores the need for more transparent and effective policy communication to restore confidence in China’s economic direction and stability​​.Investor confidence is wavering amid this uncertainty, exacerbated by Xi's centralized control over economic policy, which has slowed decision-making and policy communication. The stock market has felt the impact, with significant value lost since 2021. Despite attempts by the central bank to inject liquidity, these measures have yet to convince markets of a turnaround. The policy response has been criticized for being too late or insufficiently robust to alter the negative economic trajectory​​.Read Next:A startup that solves the age-old paywall problem is growing exponentially and looking for new shareholders.Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.The political landscape under Xi's leadership has shifted toward more centralized decision-making, with an emphasis on “stability” and “common prosperity.” However, this approach has led to challenges in addressing China’s economic complexities, including an over-indebted property sector and murky financial systems. Moreover, Xi’s regulatory crackdowns across various industries have rattled investors and raised concerns about the legal environment for foreign businesses. Despite the establishment of the National Financial Regulatory Administration aimed at addressing regulatory gaps, investor apprehension persists​​.As China navigates these turbulent waters, the focus shifts to finding new drivers of economic growth. While the electric vehicle and green energy sectors have shown promise, the semiconductor industry and other high-tech areas face hurdles, including U.S. sanctions and internal inefficiencies. Beijing’s industrial policy, aiming to shift away from traditional growth engines like property and exports, underscores a strategic pivot toward innovation-driven development. However, the success of these measures in rejuvenating the economy and restoring investor confidence remains to be seen​​.The situation underscores a critical juncture for China’s economy, with implications for global markets and industries reliant on Chinese growth. As Beijing contemplates its next steps, the world watches closely to see how one of the largest economies navigates these turbulent times, striving to balance growth, stability, and reform in an increasingly uncertain global landscape.""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Chinese President Xi Jinping Grappling With $7 Trillion Downturn As Country's Debt Levels Soar, Real Estate Collapses And Markets Pull Back Over 21% From 2021 Highs originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Now He’s Cashing InTrump Keeps NY Empire Intact as Judge Rescinds Asset-Sale OrderCapital One Weighs Acquisition of Discover FinancialChina Stocks’ Insipid Reopen Adds Pressure on Beijing to Do MoreReal estate companies are facing a major blow to asset valuations, as evolving European requirements drive investors and bankers to cut their exposure to buildings with a big carbon footprint. The issue has increased the possibility that property owners’ assets will end up stranded, devalued by the impact of climate regulations.“The industry at the moment is very, very aware of stranded assets,” said Neil Menzies, director of sustainability at Hibernia Real Estate Group Ltd., a Dublin-based firm owned by Brookfield Asset Management. The risk of assets being stranded is “getting greater because it’s now legislated as well.”Commercial real estate values have toppled after higher interest rates and lower occupancy levels upended the financial logic of much of the sector’s debt-reliant business model. Both the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve have made clear they’re now monitoring what lenders are doing to mitigate potential losses.Against that backdrop, Menzies says the industry is now facing a further valuation shock as it becomes clear just how much renovation and investment is needed to bring the majority of buildings across Europe up to the bloc’s new requirements around energy efficiency.The situation is so dire, according to Menzies, that he expects the market is “probably going to see values plummet over the next 12 months for unsustainable buildings with very high energy usage.”The European Union estimates that about 85% of buildings in the bloc were built before 2000. Of these, 75% have a “poor energy performance,” the EU said. The EU has set a goal of cutting emissions in the building sector by 60% by 2030 and completely decarbonizing it by 2050. At 42% of energy consumed, buildings “are the single largest energy consumer in Europe,” according to the European Commission.Story continuesStranded Assets:The term was popularized by the Smith School’s Stranded Assets Program roughly a decade ago, and refers to assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature writedowns, devaluations, or conversions to liabilities. UBS Group AG has noted that in the context of real estate, this can include buildings that aren’t energy-efficient, ultimately making them impossible to rent or sell, or uneconomical to own. Such properties may also become uninsurable due to rising physical climate risks, according to UBS.Other EU rules also are making it harder for investors in the region to ignore the carbon footprint of real estate, including the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.Warnings related to climate risk in real estate portfolios have been steadily picking up. In October, analysts at UBS Group pointed out that new regulations are adding to the likelihood that assets end up stranded, “potentially saddling their owners with massive capital losses versus today’s book values.”The Swiss bank said the issue has the potential to morph into a vicious cycle. “Inefficient buildings will likely also weigh on investors’ climate balance sheets and may prove less attractive to tenants due to high energy bills and low sustainability ratings,” according to UBS.Read More: Green Buildings Could Get Boost From ISSB Standards, EU RulesThough Europe is further ahead than other jurisdictions in enforcing regulations, the risk of a shock to valuations is global in scope.“With North America traditionally behind other regions in building decarbonization and sustainability, new climate and sustainability disclosure regulations represent a major risk for the real estate sector,” said Claire Stephens, research director of the Smart Buildings unit at research and advisory firm Verdantix.“We could see insurers pulling the plug on facilities with insufficient climate resilience and investors shunning companies with poor sustainability performance across their real estate,” she said in a statement in connection with the December release of Verdantix’s annual smart buildings survey. A growing awareness of such risk is now prompting the firms to step up efforts to persuade investors of their greenness, “particularly in industries such as hotels and leisure,” she said.Hibernia’s Menzies said in an interview that investors are now trying to come up with precise estimates for when real estate assets can be deemed as stranded, using a so-called Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor.Investors and bankers using the CRREM tool can “know exactly the date that a building is going to strand,” Menzies said. They’re asking detailed questions about climate-related issues such as expected energy usage, before providing credit.“Lenders are becoming so sophisticated, they’ve got people in house to model this,” he said.CRE Loans by Country (€ Billions, % Loans)Bloomberg Intelligence: EU Banks’ €1.4 Trillion CRE Loan Stress Looks Contained for NowHibernia, which focuses on the Dublin office market, refurbishes old buildings and develops new ones with a goal of being net zero carbon and climate resilient by 2030. The company’s 30 buildings were valued at around €1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) when it was acquired by Brookfield in 2022. To verify its energy efficiency, Hibernia partnered with CoolPlanet Ltd., which helps firms figure out cleaner energy solutions to cut their carbon footprints.For companies able to come up with credible sustainability plans, the response is “a huge, huge uptake and interest in green loans and other sustainability-linked loans, as well as on refinancing of projects,” he said.All in all, the decline in valuations that Menzies expects over the next year “will hopefully” get the market to a level that creates “opportunities for companies to come in and buy,” he said. And they’ll then be in a position to support valuations by investing in renovations that bring buildings up to the new standards, he said.In the meantime, firms like Hibernia “need to show real-time performance and improvements year on year to be able to gain the interest from investors and lenders,” Menzies said.--With assistance from Gautam Naik.(Adds reference to CoolPlanet in fourth-to-last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming WarsHow Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became ProfitableToday’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of YesteryearWhat’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
