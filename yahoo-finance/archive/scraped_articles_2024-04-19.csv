The benchmark index lost more than 3% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 2.1%, falling more than 5% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to rise about 0.6%.Disappointing earnings from Netflix (NFLX) weighed on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally. Shares of the streaming giant, the first of the megacap techs to update, slid 8%. Technology stocks as a whole flashed red with all of the biggest names shedding value.Market darling Nvidia (NVDA) lost 10%, while Amazon (AMZN) saw a drop of more than 2%. Apple (AAPL) decreased 1%.The market had come back from a deeper sell-off after Israel's retaliatory strike on Iran spooked traders overnight and spurred a rush to safe havens such as gold. But investors are still on high alert, though Iran has confirmed the drone attack and said it failed.Stocks were already under pressure before the shock amid persistent uncertainty about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A growing number of Fed officials this week expressed a more hawkish stance because of hotter-than-anticipated inflation data in the first quarter.Meanwhile, US government bonds pulled back almost fully from their biggest rally of the year. The yield on the safe-haven 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell to trade around 4.6%.In commodities, Brent crude futures (BZ=F) — the global oil benchmark — traded around 0.2% higher to around $87 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CL=F) were up 0.5% to roughly $83 a barrel. Gold (GC=F) increases cooled a bit after earlier earlier gains, trading up 0.2%.Live10 updatesFri, April 19, 2024 at 11:45 AM PDTHamza ShabanTesla's EV success made it 'Magnificent.' It could also be its downfall.If an autonomous future was one pillar supporting Tesla's (TSLA) ""Magnificent"" market valuation, an electric car cheap enough for most families was the other.But changes from inside the company and from outside forces are swiftly complicating that vision.Tesla's stock price is predicated in part on mass-market EVs and leading the paradigm shift in how most of the country gets around.But sky-high costs for autos — and especially EVs — have dampened consumer demand and extended any timelines for adoption.While governments are set on steering society toward the electric transition, legacy automakers are recalibrating the timing as they adjust to the waning demand. Several big players, including Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), have recently scaled back their EV plans, while others are relying on hybrid vehicles to start the shift.Just as competitors are leaning into cheaper hybrids and better-selling gas models, Tesla appears to be pivoting away from its long-anticipated entry-level EV and entrenching its position as a luxury automaker.At the same time, resources for the affordable Model 2 EV project have now been allocated to a farfetched robotaxi plan.Against an increasingly pessimistic backdrop, the Model 2 was meant to be a shimmering answer to Tesla's short-term woes. But without a daring entry-level vehicle to reinvigorate Tesla's financials, the company's challenges seem less temporary. For some analysts and investors, Tesla doesn't have a future without the Model 2.The idea of driving without human intervention has played a crucial part in Tesla's tech-juiced growth story. But what if it's the only part?Fri, April 19, 2024 at 11:00 AM PDTHamza ShabanRates staying higher for longer could be the new normalSurprisingly stubborn inflation has weighed heavily on markets in recent days. And a growing number of Fed officials are throwing cold water on the hopes that a rate cut will soon arrive. What was once a theory of interest rates staying higher for longer is looking more like a new normal.Current market wagers don't forecast a Fed rate cut until at least September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That's a long ways off from when most interest rate traders thought the easing cycle would begin. As recently as last month, the markets were projecting a June rate cut. But hotter-than-expected inflation readings have scrambled expectations.As Apollo Global Management’s chief economist Torsten Slok notes, it typically takes eight months from the last Fed hike until the Fed starts cutting. But this cycle is different. The Fed has kept interest rates constant for ten months since the last hike in July 2023, Slok, said in a Friday note. (Disclosure: Apollo is Yahoo's parent company.)""With easy financial conditions still giving a significant boost to inflation and growth over the coming quarters, the risks are rising that we could see a Fed cycle that is very different, with the Fed keeping rates higher for much longer than we usually see,"" he said.Fri, April 19, 2024 at 10:33 AM PDTHamza ShabanStocks trending in afternoon tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday:Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip leader was among a host of tech stocks losing ground on Friday afternoon with the semiconductor sector undergoing a correction as interest rate cut expectations dwindle. Nvidia lost more than 4% alongside other high-growth, technology-driven stocks.Procter & Gamble (PG): After topping quarterly earnings estimates and boosting guidance, shares of the consumer goods company fell by by 0.2% as investors focused on sales figures that fell short of expectations.Netflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 8 % after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.American Express (AXP): Shares of the financial services company gained almost 5% after releasing first quarter earnings that showed an 11% jump in revenue compared to the same period a year ago and beating Wall Street expectations.

""But after three months of this, it can’t be dismissed.""“Right now, it makes sense to wait and get more clarity before moving,"" he added.Fri, April 19, 2024 at 8:55 AM PDTHamza ShabanStocks trending in morning tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday:Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Shares of the server manufacturer slid more than 16% Friday morning after the company announced the date of its third quarter results but didn’t offer a pre-announcement, which investors perceived as a negative signal, Wells Fargo Securities wrote.Netflix (NFLX): Shares of the streaming giant fell 7% after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.Paramount (PARA): The entertainment company rose 8% Friday morning following a report from the New York Times revealing that Sony Pictures Entertainment (SONY) has entered talks with Apollo Global Management (APO), the parent company of Yahoo Finance, to discuss a possible joint buyout bid of Paramount.

The move, Reuters reports, also signals a growing intolerance of China's central government toward foreign online messaging services and less leeway given to the iPhone maker to operate there.""The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,"" Apple said in a statement.China's Great Firewall blocks access to these apps, but they are still commonly used by Chinese users through virtual private networks that bypass the restrictions.

Motley Fool,Why Arm Holdings Stock Plunged Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-arm-holdings-stock-plunged-195752957.html,A scare from Super Micro Computer sent the AI sector spiraling.,"Shares of Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) were taking a dive today, getting hit for the third day in a row on disappointing news on the artificial intelligence (AI) front.After ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing both fell on their earnings reports on Wednesday and Thursday, dragging down Arm and other AI stocks, today Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) shares plunged after one analyst observed that the company failed to pre-report revenue, which had become a pattern for it in earlier reports.As of 3:18 p.m. ET, shares of Arm were down 14.5%.Image source: Getty Images.Is the AI bubble bursting?The AI bubble may not be bursting, but it is clearly deflating, as stocks like Super Micro Computer and Arm are now down sharply from their peaks earlier this year, even though there hasn't been a clear indication that momentum in the AI sector is slowing.ASML, the leading semiconductor manufacturing stock, is in the middle of a transition to new technologies; TSMC reported strong growth in high-performance computing, a proxy for AI, but cited weakness in the smartphone market, and it's unclear if the lack of a preliminary report at Supermicro, as that company is also known, is meaningful.However, altogether the news shows that AI momentum isn't enough to take over the semiconductor sector, as these stocks are still sensitive to broader tech trends, including weak demand for consumer devices like smartphones and PCs.What it means for ArmArm stock is now down nearly 50% from its peak in February, as the stock was trading at a sky-high price-to-sales ratio, which was roughly 50 at one point. In addition, its float is relatively low, which increases volatility, as around 90% of the stock is held by Softbank.However, price-to-sales may not be the best way to judge Arm stock, as it is highly profitable. On a forward P/E basis, it's expensive at around 75 right now, but the company has a number of competitive advantages that led to its surge earlier this year, and its revenue growth is accelerating on AI-related demand.There's no doubt this has been a frustrating week for Arm shareholders, and the AI sector more broadly, but there's no material reason to sell based on the pullback. We'll learn more once earnings reports start rolling in.Keep an eye on Supermicro's upcoming update, which is scheduled for April 30, and Arm's should come out sometime in May.Should you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?Before you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Super Micro Computer Stock Tanked Friday. Is It Time to Sell?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/super-micro-computer-stock-tanked-195042219.html,Super Micro surprised investors by not preannouncing a big quarter this time.,"Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) stock has been riding the artificial intelligence (AI) wave that Nvidia started. That makes sense to some extent. Super Micro provides the computer stacks for data centers that run the AI content powered by Nvidia's chips and software.But Super Micro stock plunged more than 20% today, as of late Friday afternoon trading. Even so, the stock has soared by more than 150% so far this year. So investors might be wondering whether it's time to take those profits, or if today's plunge means the stock is now a bargain.Super Micro is not NvidiaToday's stock drop may have occurred for an interesting reason. The company didn't provide investors any news -- that is, except for the news release that told investors that Super Micro would be reporting its fiscal 2024 third-quarter earnings on April 30. But what was interesting was that was the only news release.In seven of the past eight quarterly periods, the AI hardware company has also preannounced its financial results, mostly to prepare investors for a better-than-expected report. Now investors fear that the upcoming report won't include a positive earnings surprise.Super Micro previously told investors to expect revenue of between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion for the quarter. The Wall Street consensus is for sales of about $4 billion and earnings of $5.84 a share. That compares to sales of about $3.7 billion and net income per common share of $5.10 in its prior fiscal second quarter.But investors have been expecting more, as shares have more than doubled in just the past three months. That said, Super Micro wasn't going to ride Nvidia's AI coattails forever. Even as sales have surged with the boost from data center growth, Super Micro reported a gross profit margin of just 15.4% in its most recent quarterly report, down from 16.7% in the prior-year period. Its products are more of a commodity than Nvidia's difficult-to-get chips.Today's drop implies investors may be thinking this will be the quarterly report where that will become more apparent.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Autodesk Stock Slipped This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-autodesk-stock-slipped-week-194143110.html,The company delayed some SEC filings.,"Shares of Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) slipped by as much as 10% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The software giant delayed its annual report filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is currently doing an internal investigation of its accounting practices. Investors do not like any uncertainty around accounting mishaps and were likely spooked by this news.Autodesk stock is currently down 7.7% year to date while the broad market is soaring.Delayed SEC filings, no margin expansionOn April 16, Autodesk notified shareholders that it would be delaying its annual report filing, which is unusual for a company of its size. Currently, Autodesk has a market cap of $46 billion. The reason? It is still performing an internal investigation around its free-cash-flow and non-GAAP (adjusted) operating margin practices. While it is unclear whether anything will come from this investigation, investors do not like these developments. Free cash flow and profit margin are key metrics that shareholders follow. If Autodesk has been misstating these numbers, that could indicate a major problem with the business.Even if the numbers are correct, Autodesk has struggled to expand its margins in recent years. Management has promised it can expand its profit margins to the 30% to 40% range due to the high gross margins of its software products. However, its bottom-line operating margin has stayed around 20% for the last few years. A similar company, Adobe, has margins in the 35% range, which is what investors expected Autodesk to achieve.Is the stock a buy today?Even though Autodesk has underperformed the market, its stock still looks expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) above 50. Investors may have been betting that it would see a profit inflection if margins could get closer to peers, but that has not happened over the last few years. Instead, revenue has grown while margins stagnate.Now, the company is investigating itself over its accounting practices, another poor sign. Autodesk may consistently grow its revenue, but it is not turning incremental sales into profits. With a high P/E, investors should stay away from Autodesk, especially with the uncertainty over its accounting statements.Should you invest $1,000 in Autodesk right now?Before you buy stock in Autodesk, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Autodesk wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,"Paramount stock soars as Wall Street sees possible Sony, Apollo buyout as 'positive' for all shareholders",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paramount-stock-soars-as-wall-street-sees-possible-sony-apollo-buyout-as-positive-for-all-shareholders-193125468.html,Paramount is currently in exclusive merger talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media.,"Paramount (PARA) jumped as much as 15% on Friday following media reports that private equity firm Apollo Global Management is in discussions to acquire the media company through a joint buyout bid with Sony Pictures Entertainment.The development comes after Paramount reportedly declined a previous $26 billion all-cash offer, which included $14 billion worth of debt, for the entire company from Apollo. It also reportedly declined a separate $11 billion bid for just the studio business from the firm. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)""We view this as a positive development for all shareholders, including Shari Redstone,"" CFRA analyst Ken Leon wrote in reaction to the report. Redstone and her family control Paramount through the holding company National Amusements.""Should there be a cash purchase for all PARA shares, it is likely that Apollo, as a US company, would take network assets (CBS and local TV station licenses), and Sony could hold equity in the non-FCC license assets (movies, television programs, and other),"" he said.Paramount declined to comment on the report. National Amusements, Sony, and Apollo did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request.Paramount is currently in exclusive merger talks with David Ellison's Skydance Media, according to a source familiar with the matter.But shareholders have publicly expressed concerns over the terms of the deal, which critics say unfairly benefits Redstone. Some have even threatened to sue.Amid the outcry, a proxy filing last week revealed four board members at Paramount will not seek reelection: Dawn Ostroff, Nicole Seligman, Frederick Terrell and Rob Klieger.Ostroff, Seligman, and Terrell currently serve on the independent directors board tasked with evaluating potential bids. It is unclear if their departures will have an impact on ongoing Skydance talks.'Averse to fair market value'Skydance is reportedly aiming for a two-step deal targeting Paramount's holding company, National Amusements (NAI). Redstone currently serves as the president of NAI.According to the Wall Street Journal, Redstone and Ellison have agreed to terms that would allow Skydance to purchase Redstone's controlling stake. Skydance would then merge its production studio with Paramount's — an important contingency to the deal, which must first be approved by an independent committee of directors at Paramount. It's unclear what Ellison plans to do with the rest of the company.Skydance's purchase of Redstone's stake would result in a $2 billion cash windfall for the executive while investors with nonvoting shares would receive stock in the combined company (and a diluted shareholding.)Story continuesNational Amusements owns approximately 10% of Paramount's equity capital value and maintains 77% of voting shares — valued at around $1 billion.""Any merger talks that forego competitive bidding in favor of an exclusive discussion with a single buyer, particularly where the reported control premium differentiates the financial position of a single shareholder over all other shareholders, is averse to the fair market value of a company,"" said Ariel Investments, a longtime shareholder of Paramount Global, in a statement earlier this month.As of December 31, 2023, Ariel held a stake in the company of just under 2%.Shari Redstone, chairwoman of ViacomCBS and president of National Amusements, reacts as she celebrates her company's merger at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., December 5, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)Citi analyst Jason Bazinet further explained shareholder panic: ""A lot of the details that have been talked about in the press with Skydance [include] Skydance buying NAI's shares and, essentially, getting control of Paramount without paying a premium to the public shareholders.""He said investors are more interested in an alternative bidder, which ""presumably would pay all shareholders at a premium.""Paramount has been bleeding money in its streaming business. Although losses have narrowed, the company still reported a direct-to-consumer (DTC) loss of $490 million in the fourth quarter. It's also been plagued by plummeting linear TV revenue as more consumers cut the cord.To combat the declines, Paramount has committed to various cost-efficiency plans, including layoffs, business restructurings, price hikes, and even a surprise dividend cut. But a potential sale has been on the table for months.Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Here's what to know.,"Netflix (NFLX) stock slid as much as 9.6% Friday after the company gave a second quarter revenue forecast that missed estimates and announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber metrics closely watched by Wall Street.On Thursday, Netflix guided to second quarter revenue of $9.49 billion, a miss compared to consensus estimates of $9.51 billion.The company said it will stop reporting quarterly membership numbers starting next year, along with average revenue per member, or ARM.""As we’ve evolved our pricing and plans from a single to multiple tiers with different price points depending on the country, each incremental paid membership has a very different business impact,"" the company said.Netflix reported first quarter earnings that beat across the board on Thursday, with another 9 million-plus subscribers added in the quarter.Subscriber additions of 9.3 million beat expectations of 4.8 million and followed the 13 million net additions the streamer added in the fourth quarter. The company added 1.7 million paying users in Q1 2023.Revenue beat Bloomberg consensus estimates of $9.27 billion to hit $9.37 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14.8% compared to the same period last year as the streamer leaned on revenue initiatives like its crackdown on password-sharing and ad-supported tier, in addition to the recent price hikes on certain subscription plans.Netflix's stock has been on a tear in recent months, with shares currently trading near the high end of its 52-week range. Wall Street analysts had warned that high expectations heading into the print could serve as an inherent risk to the stock price.Earnings per share (EPS) beat estimates in the quarter, with the company reporting EPS of $5.28, well above consensus expectations of $4.52 and nearly double the $2.88 EPS figure it reported in the year-ago period. Netflix guided to second quarter EPS of $4.68, ahead of consensus calls for $4.54.Profitability metrics also came in strong, with operating margins sitting at 28.1% for the first quarter compared to 21% in the same period last year.The company previously guided to full-year 2024 operating margins of 24% after the metric grew to 21% from 18% in 2023. Netflix expects margins to tick down slightly in Q2 to 26.6%.Free cash flow came in at $2.14 billion in the quarter, above consensus calls of $1.9 billion.Meanwhile, ARM ticked up 1% year over year — matching the fourth quarter results. Wall Street analysts expect ARM to pick up later this year as both the ad-tier impact and price hike effects take hold.Story continuesOn the ads front, ad-tier memberships increased 65% quarter over quarter after rising nearly 70% sequentially in Q3 2023 and Q4 2023. The ads plan now accounts for over 40% of all Netflix sign-ups in the markets it's offered in.Netflix reported first quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.

Blame Climate Change, Not Cloud SeedingEquities fell at end of a week that saw the S&P 500 dropping below 5,000 after a rally that sent the benchmark to all-time highs, spurring warnings for a consolidation. A drumbeat of hawkish Fedspeak and a flare-up in inflation pressures weighed heavily on sentiment, with investors trimming their bets on the keenly anticipated central bank pivot. While the latest tensions in the Middle East seemed contained, traders opted for a more cautious stance.That being said, nothing can be taken for granted, and markets may remain on the edge, especially considering the looming weekend risk, according to Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. He added that inflation data continues to be a focal point for traders due to its potential influence on the Fed’s monetary policy.“The stock market has been declining in recent weeks because rate cut expectations have dropped significantly — and investors are not surprisingly taking some profits after the strong market performance seen during the first quarter,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management.The S&P 500 is on track for its sixth consecutive drop — the longest losing streak since October 2022.

Motley Fool,"Why Celsius Stock Had a Bad Week, Dropping 15%",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-celsius-stock-had-bad-191836206.html,This isn't the time to abandon ship.,"Shares of energy drink company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH) were down 15% this week, as of 12:45 p.m. ET on Friday, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. By comparison, the S&P 500 was only down 3% so far this week, so Celsius' underperformance over this time period stands out. But I don't believe it's something for investors to worry about.Embrace normalCelsius didn't report news this week. Nothing fundamentally changed with the industry. And there weren't any filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Therefore, in the absence of any news whatsoever, investors can chalk up Celsius' bad week to normal stock market volatility.Volatility is to be expected with a high-growth company such as Celsius. The chart below shows that over the last five years, Celsius stock has dipped 25% or more eight different times, including right now.CELH ChartKeep your sights set on the long-term horizonThis is part of the reason that the Motley Fool recommends having a long-term mindset, investing with five years or so in mind. Over a short term, like a week in Celsius' case, returns are unpredictable. However, targeting long-term returns and holding through volatility -- other Motley Fool principles -- will yield better results.For Celsius specifically, shares are up more than 5,000% in the last five years, up 135% in the past year, and up 26% year to date even after its bad week this week. With red-hot returns like this, the pullback is quite insignificant.There's good reason to keep holding Celsius stock through the current pullback. The company just hit $1.3 billion in annual revenue after more than doubling its business in 2023. And this year, it has its sights set on international expansion, which is a multibillion-dollar business for larger competitor Monster Beverage.Celsius is still poised to create long-term shareholder value. But as this week reminds investors, it could be a bumpy ride at times.Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Tesla Stock Was Falling (Again) This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tesla-stock-falling-again-191615905.html,The company can't seem to get out of its own way in 2024.,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) were falling again this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric vehicle (EV) leader announced a major recall for its new Cybertruck vehicle, has reduced the costs of autonomous vehicle software, and is still reeling from a poor delivery number for the first quarter. At one point one of the largest companies in the world by market cap, the ""Magnificent Seven"" stock has fallen quickly from highs this year even with the broad market soaring.The stock is down slightly over 10% this week and 40% year to date.Cybertruck recall, major self-driving discountsTesla released the unique-looking Cybertruck back in December 2023. With mixed reviews, it has been unclear over the first few months in production how this product would help (or hurt) Tesla's business prospects. So far, it looks to be hurting the EV maker. This week, the company announced a major recall over a faulty accelerator pedal, which could be incredibly dangerous for any customer. But perhaps the worst part about this news was how few vehicles are getting recalled.The National Highway Safety Administration said it is recalling fewer than 4,000 vehicles, which means Tesla has only sold that many to customers since launching the Cybertruck. While it takes time to ramp up production for automobiles, this is a tiny fraction of Tesla's EV deliveries for a much-hyped vehicle that has been in the works for years.On top of these Cybertruck woes, Tesla is discounting the price of its Full Self-Driving driver assist program to $99 a month. It was previously $199 a month or $15,000 for a one-time purchase. This is troubling news given how much of the bull case is driven by Tesla's software sales. Even if 10 million people start paying for this software subscription (a high bar given the company hasn't even sold that many vehicles yet), that will bring in just over $10 billion in sales for Tesla. Yes, these are high-margin sales, but even in the most optimistic scenario Tesla's autonomous driving revenue will be insignificant for this $100 billion revenue business.Where does the stock go from here?So the Cybertruck is not moving the needle. Software sales are looking bleak with major discounts. Deliveries fell for the first time year over year in the first quarter of 2024. Where does Tesla go from here?I still think this stock looks overvalued, even after falling 40% this year. It has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35, which is above the S&P 500 average. And this is with earnings falling and now new models on the horizon. The forward earnings ratio could be much higher, which does not bode well for the stock. Stay far away from Tesla or any EV stocks for the time being.Story continuesWhere to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,Why EV and Renewable Energy Stocks Collapsed This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ev-renewable-energy-stocks-185743277.html,Tesla's layoffs and higher interest rates combined to make a rough week for EV and renewable stocks.,"The electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy market took a nosedive this week and it seemed everyone was affected. Part of the drop was due to Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) layoffs announced earlier this week, but part was because investors think the market is overvalued if interest rates are going to stay elevated for the foreseeable future.According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Polestar Automotive's (NASDAQ: PSNY) shares dropped 10.3% from Friday's close to 1:45 p.m. ET today, ChargePoint (NYSE: CHPT) was down 13.7%, and Array Technologies (NASDAQ: ARRY) fell 13.3%. They're from slightly different industries, but they're all impacted by the same news this week.Tesla's layoffsLet's start with the biggest news of the week: Tesla's layoffs. The company announced about 10% of workers would be let go in a major restructuring. Management said this would make the company more efficient, but the reality is that demand for vehicles is dropping. Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, down from 422,875 a year ago.If Tesla's demand is falling, it's likely Polestar is seeing the same effect and of course, that will ultimately lead to fewer chargers being installed, which is bad for ChargePoint. But that's not the only bad news this week.Interest rates and renewable energyWhether you're buying a car or building a solar project, interest rates are really important and this week rates moved another step higher. Investors are no longer expecting five or six rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year and there's speculation rates may not move at all.10 Year Treasury Rate ChartHigher interest rates can have a negative impact on the entire economy, but they're especially crucial for EV sales and renewable energy projects.Vehicles are often financed with loans or leases and higher rates make these purchases more expensive. And buyers are often spending based on the monthly payment they can make, not the purchase price of the vehicle.Automakers can respond by lowering the price of vehicles, which some companies have done, or by offering financing incentives. Both eat away at margins at a time when margins are falling and most companies in the space aren't even profitable.For Array Technologies, the impact is the same even if the industry is a little different. Solar projects are financed for 20 to 30 years and higher rates make those projects less valuable, which will likely hurt both demand and pricing.2024 isn't playing out well for EVs and renewablesThese challenges aren't new, but they're impacting the renewable and EV industries all at once in 2024. And they don't seem to be stopping anytime soon.Story continuesEVs seem to have hit a demand ceiling just as supply is starting to explode and that's not great for the future profits of the industry. And renewables may have a future, but they keep taking blow after blow from higher rates.Earnings season will tell a lot, but don't expect it to be positive given the headwinds that everyone in the energy and auto space is experiencing.Should you invest $1,000 in Polestar Automotive Uk Plc right now?Before you buy stock in Polestar Automotive Uk Plc, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Polestar Automotive Uk Plc wasn’t one of them.
