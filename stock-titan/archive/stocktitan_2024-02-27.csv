(""Nano One"" or the ""Company"") is a clean technology company with patented processes for the production of lithium-ion battery cathode materials that enable secure and resilient supply chains by driving down cost, complexity, energy intensity, and environmental footprint. Nano One is pleased to update its valued shareholders, potential financial partners and customers on the Company's feasibility study, as it moves towards its first commercial LFP production facility.""Nano One is pleased to announce it has commenced a feasibility study for its first commercial plant"", commented Alex Holmes, Chief Operating Officer."" This plant design will also form the basis for our turn-key Design-Once-Build-Many strategy to address the broader LFP market. The study will provide us with an optimal production line layout and maximum utility of key equipment. Furthermore, this study will examine an ready to duplicate design , to address our mid-to-longer-term objective of deploying multi-line facilities under license or joint venture (JV) with partners in Asian, Indo-Pacific, North American and European jurisdictions.""Progress at Nano One's Candiac pilot plant, as reported on December 19, 2023 and February 5, 2024, has helped the company de-risk, improve and optimize its One-Pot process for LFP in commercial scale equipment while informing its engineering plans and providing confidence to its collaborators on the long-term competitive viability of its One-Pot LFP technology.Update on First Commercial PlantThrough a competitive bidding process, Nano One chose BBA to conduct an FEL 3 which will optimize plant layout, further refine capital and operating costs and project timelines for the construction of a 25,000 tonne per annum (tpa) LFP production facility.Denis Geoffroy, Chief Commercialization Officer, stated, ""Our confidence in working with the BBA team is built on a strong foundation based on the involvement of key members of the team in the engineering, design and construction of the Candiac plant over a decade ago when I was the General Manager. More recently, BBA was also involved in the design and engineering of our 200 tpa LFP pilot line which was successfully built and commissioned in Q3 2023. BBA brings a deep expertise in mining, metals, energy, chemicals, power and renewables. We are pleased to building on their experience while adding nearly twenty years of our own, in technology scaling, commercialization and production.""As an integral part of its feasibility study, the Company has been in active dialogue with governments and their agencies on key factors that impact its ability to scale-up rapidly and meet market demands. To that end, Nano One has determined that it is in its best interests to consider a broader set of site options that may be more suitable for future growth expansion beyond the first 25,000 tpa capacity plant. Key considerations include government incentives in the form of grants and forgivable loans, access to sufficient utilities (power, water, natural gas) and location preferences from collaborating stakeholders in the first commercial plant. Nano One with the support of provincial and municipal governments has identified potential site options in Québec and Ontario. The Company remains in active discussions with governments at all levels, as well as other strategic partners in 2024 to narrow down its site selection. Nano One is also closely monitoring government incentive programs in America and with its free trade partners, and has been engaged in conversations with several state and local governments to ensure that we can align our business plans and scale-up to meet emerging market needs in America.With an emerging market for LFP projected to be tens of billions of dollars by 20351, the company is addressing this opportunity by aligning its first facility and partnerships to showcase the advantages of the One-Pot process and the speed-to-market benefits of its Design-Once-Build-Many growth strategy.2024 Path to CommercializationThe company remains well capitalized and is looking to maximize opportunities to secure support from governments. The first commercial plant will require completion of the FEL 3, product validation and customer offtake and feedstock supply agreements. These three items are fundamental for project financing and are a top priority for Nano One in 2024.The Company is in active dialogue with government agencies, project finance lenders and strategic partners to secure funding for both its growth activities, first commercial LFP plant and ongoing innovations. A final investment decision will only be made following the securing of plant specific funding. Nano One is evaluating creative structures together with government incentives to bring One-Pot LFP to market sooner while being cognizant of shareholder's interests.In support of its strategic objectives, Nano One will be filing a preliminary base shelf prospectus (""Shelf Prospectus"") that will help provide the most flexible and efficient access to capital markets, if and when it is needed. While the Company has no immediate plans to issue securities at this time, the Shelf Prospectus, when made final or effective, would permit the Company to make offerings of various financial securities, up to an aggregate total of C$175 million at its discretion for an effective period of 25-months. The Company considers this as a prudent step in the normal course of business.During the 25-month period that the Shelf Prospectus would remain effective, the nature, size and timing of any financings would be dependent on the Company's assessment of its requirements for funding and general market conditions. At the time any securities covered by the Shelf Prospectus are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement containing specific information regarding the terms of the securities being offered would be provided. A copy of the Base Shelf Prospectus will available on the Company's issuer profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any Securities in any jurisdiction. This news release is not an offer for sale within the United States of any Securities or other securities of Nano One.Candiac Facility UpdateNano One has confirmed orders from its Candiac facility for approximately 1.3 tonnes of LFP samples for the purposes of commercial evaluation and collaboration. Sample evaluation by potential offtakers has been positive with a collaborative approach to optimizing Nano One's commercial LFP offerings. Building on initial samples sold in Q4 2023, there is significant interest in validating Nano One's LFP product at scale for future offtake. The decisions to offtake LFP are being driven by advancements at Nano One's innovation hub in Burnaby, commercialization hub in Candiac, and electric vehicle adoption policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as well as the equally important energy storage solutions (ESS), for industrial and military sectors.Further and full automation of the Candiac pilot plant could help it reach up to 2000 tpa capacity and is contingent on initial sales commitments, customer technology validation needs, capital support from government and financial returns. The Company remains positive about potential opportunities in this growing market and believes that a portfolio of customers, both large and small, will help provide the right-sized offtakes to leverage the capacity of its pilot plant, to fill the capacity of a much larger first commercial plant and to secure the necessary project finance.Dan Blondal, Chief Executive Officer and Founder stated, ""Our Design-Once-Build-Many growth strategy capitalizes on both near-term and mid-term market opportunities and enables rapid growth via licensing and joint venture. Our One-Pot process reduces cost, complexity and GHG emissions in the supply chain, while eliminating wastewater, large volumes of challenging sulfate by-products, and the need for intermediate processing in foreign jurisdictions of concern. Through this combination of compelling enviro-economic value and turn-key deployment, we believe we can prudently address LFP's rapid growth opportunity, capture market share and deliver value to shareholders, partners and government stakeholders.""###About BBABBA has been providing a wide range of consulting engineering services for over 40 years.

Ltd, submits Akili's digital therapeutic SDT-001 for marketing approval in Japan, a localized version of AKL-T01. The Phase 3 clinical trial results show significant improvements in pediatric ADHD patients. Positive outcomes pave the way for potential nationwide marketing approval. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The submission of Akili's digital therapeutic SDT-001 for marketing approval in Japan represents a significant advancement in the treatment landscape for pediatric ADHD. The Phase 3 clinical trial data indicating statistically significant improvements in ADHD symptoms with SDT-001 provides a strong foundation for the potential approval of this non-pharmaceutical intervention. It is noteworthy that the trial addressed both the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity components of ADHD, which are critical for comprehensive patient care. The absence of serious adverse events underscores the safety profile of SDT-001, which could be a considerable advantage over traditional ADHD medications that often come with a range of side effects. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the entry of SDT-001 into the Japanese market could disrupt the current ADHD treatment paradigm, especially considering the limited availability of pharmaceutical options in Japan. The digital therapeutic space is rapidly growing and Akili's EndeavorRx has already set a precedent in the United States. Approval in Japan could pave the way for further international expansion and potentially open up a significant new revenue stream for PureTech Health and its Founded Entity, Akili, Inc. Market acceptance will depend on factors such as efficacy perception, ease of integration into existing treatment protocols and reimbursement policies by Japanese health insurance systems. Healthcare Economist Considering the economic impact, the introduction of SDT-001 could potentially reduce overall healthcare costs associated with ADHD treatment in Japan. Digital therapeutics may offer a cost-effective alternative to long-term pharmaceutical treatments, which can be expensive and may require continuous monitoring for side effects. In addition, the use of digital therapeutics like SDT-001 could lead to indirect cost savings by potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the need for additional support services. However, the pricing strategy and reimbursement decisions will be crucial factors in determining the economic viability and accessibility of SDT-001 for patients and healthcare providers. 02/27/2024 - 02:00 AM Japanese Product Now Under Review for Nationwide Marketing Approval BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PureTech Health plc (Nasdaq: PRTC, LSE: PRTC) (""PureTech"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to changing the lives of patients with devastating diseases, noted that its Founded Entity Akili, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKLI) announced that its Japanese partner Shionogi & Co. Ltd has submitted Akili’s digital therapeutic SDT-001 for marketing approval with the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. SDT-001 is the Japanese, localized version of Akili’s AKL-T01 (marketed as EndeavorRx® in the United States), which has previously been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the world's first prescription digital therapeutic for improving attentional functioning in pediatric ADHD patients aged 8 to 17. ""We are pleased by this additional validation of Akili’s EndeavorRx,” said Eric Elenko, Ph.D., Chief Innovation Officer at PureTech. “This game-changing technology is now poised to address the needs of pediatric patients with ADHD in Japan if approved, and this exciting milestone is yet another example of PureTech’s contribution to changing the lives of patients in need.” The full text of the announcement from Akili is as follows: Akili Announces Positive Results from Shionogi’s Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Localized Version of Akili’s EndeavorRx ® for Pediatric ADHD Patients in Japan Japanese Product Now Under Review for Nationwide Marketing Approval BOSTON – Akili, Inc. (Nasdaq: AKLI), a leading digital medicine company, today announced that its Japanese partner Shionogi & Co. Ltd has submitted Akili’s digital therapeutic SDT-001 for marketing approval with the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. SDT-001 is the Japanese, localized version of Akili’s AKL-T01 (marketed as EndeavorRx® in the United States), which has previously been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as the world's first prescription digital therapeutic for improving attentional functioning in pediatric ADHD patients aged 8 to 17. “The latest Japanese clinical trial of our patented, clinically proven technology is an important milestone for many reasons,” said Dr. Scott Kollins, Chief Medical Officer at Akili. “It not only further validates the efficacy and safety of EndeavorRx, it also moves us and our international partner SHIONOGI a step closer to making the product available in Japan. And if approved in Japan, it will provide an effective and safe option in a country where some front line pharmaceutical therapies are not as widely available to pediatric patients with ADHD.” The submission for marketing approval in Japan is based on the favorable results of the Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by SHIONOGI in the country. The trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SDT-001 in 164 pediatric ADHD patients aged 6 to 17 who received conventional treatments such as environmental adjustments and psychosocial therapies. The SDT-001 group, undergoing approximately 25 minutes of treatment once daily for 6 weeks (1 cycle), demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the change from baseline in the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) Inattention score compared to the control group (continuing conventional treatments) at the 6-week mark (p < 0.05), achieving the primary endpoint of the trial. Moreover, statistically significant improvements were observed in the change from baseline in the total ADHD-RS-IV score and the hyperactivity/impulsivity score at the 6-week mark in the SDT-001 group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). No safety concerns or serious adverse events related to SDT-001 were observed. Furthermore, symptom improvements were sustained even after two cycles of SDT-001 use, with no safety concerns noted.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in net revenues and gross billings for Gaotu Techedu Inc. indicates a growing demand for its educational services, which is a positive signal for the company's top-line growth. However, the substantial increase in loss from operations and shift from a net income to a net loss year-over-year is concerning. This points to significant operational challenges or increased investment in growth that has yet to yield profitability. Stakeholders should evaluate the sustainability of the company's growth strategy and whether the increased losses are indicative of a strategic investment in market expansion or a sign of deeper operational inefficiencies.Furthermore, the slight increase in net operating cash inflow, despite the net loss, suggests that the company's cash management may be effective, or there could be timing differences in cash flows. Investors should scrutinize the cash flow statement to understand the underlying reasons for this discrepancy. A detailed analysis of the company's cost structure and the competitive landscape of online education in China is also crucial to assess the long-term viability of Gaotu's business model. Market Research Analyst The education technology sector in China has been under regulatory scrutiny, which adds a layer of risk to companies like Gaotu Techedu Inc. The reported figures reflect the company's ability to grow its revenue despite a challenging environment, which may be indicative of strong market demand or successful adaptation to regulatory changes. The increase in gross billings is a testament to the company's sales efforts and could be a result of expanded course offerings or successful marketing strategies.However, the significant operational loss raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of these strategies. It is important for investors to consider the broader industry trends, including regulatory impacts, competitive pressures and consumer preferences, as these will play a critical role in shaping the company's future. An analysis of the company's customer acquisition costs and lifetime value of customers would provide further insights into the efficiency of its growth strategy. Economist From an economic perspective, the performance of Gaotu Techedu Inc. must be contextualized within the broader economic conditions of China, particularly the education sector. The increase in net revenues aligns with the growing middle class's demand for quality education. However, the transition from net income to net loss may reflect macroeconomic pressures, such as rising costs or decreased consumer spending power, which could affect the company's profitability in the long term.The reported financials also suggest a potential for scalability, as evidenced by the revenue growth. Yet, the ability to achieve economies of scale is crucial and will depend on the company's capacity to manage costs effectively. Investors should monitor economic indicators such as consumer spending, disposable income and education policy changes, as these can significantly influence Gaotu's operational performance and future outlook. 02/27/2024 - 02:00 AM BEIJING, Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Gaotu Techedu Inc.

The Company defines gross billings for a specific period as the total amount of cash received for the sale of course offerings in such period, net of the total amount of refunds in such period.

For some courses, the Company continues to provide students with 12 months to 36 months access to the pre-recorded audio-video courses after the online live courses are delivered. The Company believes that gross billings provides valuable insight into the sales of its course packages and the performance of its business. As gross billings have material limitations as an analytical metrics and may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude share-based compensation expenses. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance.

This collaboration aims to enhance network resiliency and mobile coverage in Turkiye, benefiting the local population, businesses, and visitors. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The partnership between Lynk Global, Inc. and Turkcell represents a strategic move to enhance mobile network resilience and coverage in Turkiye. The introduction of satellite-direct-to-mobile-phone (Sat2Phone) services is a significant technological advancement, as it aims to bridge the connectivity gap in remote areas. This is particularly important for Turkiye, which has diverse topography that can challenge terrestrial network coverage. The ability to provide consistent and reliable communication services across the entire country could lead to increased customer satisfaction and potentially attract new subscribers, thereby strengthening Turkcell's market position.From an industry perspective, such innovative solutions are indicative of the evolving telecommunications landscape, where satellite technology is increasingly integrated with traditional cellular networks to offer ubiquitous coverage. This trend is likely to accelerate as customer demand for seamless connectivity grows and companies that pioneer these technologies could gain a competitive edge. However, the cost implications and the scalability of these solutions are critical factors that will influence their adoption rate and impact on Turkcell's financial performance. Market Research Analyst With Turkcell's extensive subscriber base and its status as a dual-listed company on NYSE and BIST, the announcement of the Sat2Phone service collaboration is likely to be perceived positively by investors and industry observers. The move aligns with global trends towards enhancing digital infrastructure and can be seen as a proactive step to safeguard the company's relevance in an increasingly digitalized world. The emphasis on innovation and the potential to deliver life-saving emergency alerts could also resonate with socially conscious investors.Long-term benefits may include the strengthening of Turkcell's brand as an innovator in the telecom space and the potential to create new revenue streams from untapped markets within Turkiye. The expansion of services to voice and data will likely be a key driver for future growth. However, the market will be closely watching the execution of this service rollout and its operational impact, as well as the customer uptake and satisfaction levels with the new Sat2Phone services. Risk Management Expert Integrating Sat2Phone technology presents both opportunities and risks for Turkcell. On one hand, the enhancement of network resiliency, especially in regions prone to natural disasters, could mitigate the risk of network downtime and associated revenue loss. It also presents an opportunity to diversify Turkcell's service offerings, which is beneficial from a risk distribution standpoint. On the other hand, the implementation of new technologies carries inherent risks such as technical challenges, potential delays in deployment and unforeseen costs.Moreover, as the service is initially rolling out with SMS and plans to expand to voice and data, it is crucial for Turkcell to manage expectations and deliver on its promises to maintain its reputation and customer trust. The company will need to invest in robust risk management strategies to monitor and mitigate these risks effectively. This includes ensuring the reliability and security of the Sat2Phone services, which are essential for customer adoption and retention. 02/27/2024 - 12:00 AM Turkcell is the leading mobile network operator in Turkiye with approximately 40 million subscribers FALLS CHURCH, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lynk Global, Inc.

Ian Cockerill, CEO, commented: “We are extremely pleased with our progress as we start wet commissioning at the BIOX® Expansion project. Importantly, we have achieved this milestone with no lost-time injuries having worked more than 3 million man hours, which is a testament to the strong safety culture that is a hallmark of our in-house construction teams. At completion, Sabodala-Massawa will become a true top tier asset with 2024 production of up to 400koz at an industry leading AISC of less than $850/oz, with costs expected to improve further in the coming years, embedding the mine firmly in the lowest cost quartile. This year, Endeavour is well positioned to transition from a phase of investment in organic growth, to a more cash flow generative phase in the second half of the year. This inflection point will allow us to focus our efforts on increasing our shareholder returns while de-levering our balance sheet, as we continue to execute on our strategy.” Wet commissioning of the BIOX® Expansion was delivered in less than 23 months after construction was launched in April 2022. During construction activities, up to 1,300 employees and contractors were on site, 82% of whom were Senegalese nationals, successfully completing over three million man-hours with zero lost time injuries. The addition of the 1.2Mtpa BIOX® Expansion, with an initial capital cost of $290 million, is expected to add 194koz per annum of incremental production over the first five years, lifting Sabodala-Massawa to top-tier status with expected production of 360-400koz at an AISC of between $750-850/oz in FY-2024, increasing to above 400koz from 2025.

This test campaign follows a successful pre-FEED performed for the same site. It will enable the full-scale implementation of multiple Just Catch 400 modular capture facilities with permanent storage, and the creation of carbon removal credits. Aker Carbon Capture has extensive testing experience, with more than 60,000 operational hours worldwide on multiple industrial flue gases. The company's mobile test unit will now be applied to the pulp and paper industry for the first time. The initial results from the campaign are expected towards the end of 2024, ahead of the project's expected final investment decision. ""We are delighted to work with CO280 and a leading US pulp and paper company to implement their first carbon capture project. This is a robust business opportunity for our customer since it is supported both by 45Q carbon tax credits and additional revenues from the sale of carbon removal credits. With its strong cost and schedule advantages, our modular Just Catch 400 offering is an ideal fit for pulp and paper mills across the US,"" said Egil Fagerland, Chief Executive Officer at Aker Carbon Capture. ""This test campaign signifies a milestone for Aker Carbon Capture's rapid expansion into the significant North American market,"" Fagerland continued. CO280 partners with pulp and paper companies to finance, own, and operate carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects that deliver a new standard of permanent, high-quality, and affordable carbon removal credits to the voluntary carbon market. In May 2023, CO280 entered a long-term agreement with JP Morgan to supply carbon removal credits, in one of the largest carbon removal agreements ever announced. ""This marks an important first step towards our ambitious goal of scaling-up carbon removal by capturing and permanently storing biogenic CO2 from the pulp and paper industry. We have selected Aker Carbon Capture based on its proven modular design and deep experience with amine technology, which is a key enabling solution for the carbon removal projects we are developing across the pulp and paper industry,"" said Jonathan Rhone, Chief Executive Officer at CO280. The US pulp and paper industry emits approximately 150 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually, primarily of biogenic origin. By capturing and storing these emissions permanently, one achieves negative emissions, as more carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere than is being emitted from the process. Carbon removals provides an opportunity to not only compensate for hard-to-abate emissions, but also historical emissions, which is crucial to reaching net zero in 2050. Aker Carbon Capture is already enabling the creation of high-quality carbon removal credits through its delivery to Ørsted Kalundborg Hub. ""The pulp and paper industry is a priority market for Aker Carbon Capture in the US and we are exited to collaborate with CO280 to develop this market. The use of carbon capture and sequestration technology provides a financial opportunity to benefit from favorable tax incentives, a chance to support local economic development as these facilities are built locally, and a pathway towards meeting the US' climate goals,"" said Jonah Margulis, Aker Carbon Capture's Head of North America. ""We look forward to continuing to partner with CO280 and other industry leaders to bring our proven technology to pulp and paper mills across the country."" Aker Carbon Capture's Mobile Test Unit is a complete CO2 capture plant that includes the company's advanced carbon capture technology where the test results are scalable when implementing full scale plants. Aker Carbon Capture's Just Catch™ modular offering is a standardized product that enables the pre-fabrication of carbon capture units.

(TSXV:ZNX),(FRA:M9R) is a Canadian exploration and development company creating value in the critical metals space - with a focus on zinc. Zinc is a versatile and essential material for the energy transition to a lower-carbon economy. It is already one of the most used metals in the world behind iron, aluminum and copper but also has applications in energy storage. It also plays a vital role in enabling other clean energy technologies like solar and wind.ZincX Resources is well-positioned to take advantage of the worldwide looming shortfall in zinc production with the development of its Cardiac Creek (Akie property) deposit - which can help Canada meet its need for the critical mineral zinc and the global push towards decarbonization to combat climate change.The Akie Zn-Pb-Ag ProjectThe 100% owned Akie property is situated within the Kechika Trough, the southernmost area of the regionally extensive Paleozoic Selwyn Basin and one of the most prolific sedimentary basins in the world for the occurrence of SEDEX zinc-lead-silver and stratiform barite deposits.Drilling on the Akie property by ZincX Resources (formerly Canada Zinc Metals Corp) since 2005 has identified a significant body of baritic-zinc-lead SEDEX mineralization known as the Cardiac Creek deposit. The deposit is hosted by siliceous, carbonaceous, fine-grained clastic rocks of the Middle to Late Devonian Gunsteel Formation.The Company updated the estimate of mineral resources at Cardiac Creek in 2018, as follows:5% Zinc Cut-Off GradeContained Metal:CategoryTonnes(million)Zn (%)Pb (%)Ag (g/t)Zn (B lbs)Pb (B lbs)Ag (M oz)Indicated22.78.321.6114.14.1620.80410.3Inferred7.57.041.2412.01.1690.2052.9The Company announced robust positive results from the 2018 Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). The PEA envisages a conventional underground mine and concentrator operation with an average production rate of 4,000 tonnes per day. The mine will have an 18-year life with potential to extend the life-of-mine (LOM) through resource expansion at depth. Key parameters for the PEA are as follows:ParameterBase Case1Tonnes Mined25.8 MtMined Head Grades7.6% Zn; 1.5% Pb; 13.08 g/t AgTonnes Milled19.7 MtMilled Head Grades (after DMS2 upgrade)10.0% Zn; 1.9% Pb; 17.17 g/t AgTotal Payable Metal (LOM)$3,960M3Initial CAPEX$302.3M including $45.7M contingencyLOM Total CAPEX$617.9M including $58.5M contingencyAll-in Total OPEX$102.4 per tonne milledPre-Tax NPV7%$649MPre-Tax IRR35%Pre-Tax Payback2.6 yearsAfter-Tax NPV7%$401MAfter-Tax IRR27%After-Tax Payback3.2 years1. The base case used metal prices are calculated from the 3 year trailing average coupled with two year forward projection of the average price; and are: US$1.21/lb for zinc, US$1.00/lb for lead and US$16.95 for silver. A CDN$/US$ exchange rate of 0.77 was used. The NPV discount rate is 7%. 2. DMS = dense media separation. 3. All dollar amounts expressed in Canadian dollars.The PEA is considered preliminary in nature and includes mineral resources, including inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have not yet demonstrated economic viability. Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to mineral resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of a mineral resource will be upgraded to mineral reserves. Therefore, there is no certainty that the results concluded in the PEA will be realized.Kechika Regional ProjectIn addition to the Akie Project, the Company owns 100% of eight of eleven large, contiguous property blocks that comprise the Kechika Regional Project including the advanced Mt. Alcock prospect. The remaining three contiguous blocks (Pie, Yuen and Cirque East) are owned 49% by ZNX and 51% by Cirque Operating Corporation which is a 50/50 joint venture between Teck Resources Limited (TSX:TECK.A) and (TSX:TECK.B);(NYSE:TECK) and Korea Zinc Co., Ltd. Six additional blocks which constitute the Kechika North project have been optioned to an arm's length third party. All of these properties collectively extend northwest from the Akie property for approximately 140 kilometres covering the highly prospective Gunsteel Formation shale; the main host rock for known SEDEX zinc-lead-silver deposits in the Kechika Trough of northeastern British Columbia. The Kechika Trough represents tremendous potential for additional discoveries. These properties are located approximately 260 kilometres north-northwest of the town of Mackenzie, British Columbia, Canada.Zinc (Zn)Zinc is one of many critical metals facilitating the transition to a low-carbon and greener future and is used in renewable energy storage systems and through the protection of steel to improve its durability and service life in solar and wind turbine applications. The primary uses of zinc are the galvanization of steel protecting against corrosion due to weather conditions, the production of brass and bronze, and in die-casting to produce a wide range of metal products. In agriculture, zinc can also increase crop yields and crop quality and is an essential nutrient in human development and disease prevention.Qualified PersonKen MacDonald P.Geo., Vice President of Exploration for the Company, is the designated Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 and is responsible for the technical information contained in this release.

(“LIFT” or the “Company”) (TSXV: LIFT) (OTCQX: LIFFF) (Frankfurt: WS0) is pleased to report assays from 8 drill holes completed at the Fi Southwest, BIG West, Nite, & Fi Boye pegmatites within the Yellowknife Lithium Project (“YLP”) located outside the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Figure 1). Drilling intersected significant intervals of spodumene mineralization, with the following highlights: Highlights: YLP-0199: 22 m at 1.05% Li2O, (Fi Southwest) including: 9 m at 1.87% Li2O YLP-0195: 15 m at 1.0% Li2O, (Nite)including: 2 m at 1.42% Li2Oand including: 8 m at 1.26% Li2O YLP-0189: 4 m at 1.11% Li2O, (Fi Boye) Discussion of Results This week’s drill results are from 1,325 m drilled across eight holes, including the first hole of the 2024 winter program at Fi Southwest as well as 2023 results from the Nite, BIG West, and Fi Boye pegmatites. A table of composite calculations, general comments related to this discussion, and a table of collar headers are provided towards the end of this section. David Smithson, SVP, Geology of LIFT comments, “Results from the deep drilling at Nite this week continue to impress with hole 195 intercepting 15 m at 1.0% Li2O at 250 m from the surface. This is the second deep hole we have drilled on the Nite structure following on from 10 m at 1.4% Li2O drilled at the same level in 2023. The Fi Southwest dyke was similarly impressive this week returning 22 m at 1.0% Li2O near to the surface. Drilling to date on the Fi Southwest dyke has defined over 900 m of good shallow mineralization so we are very excited to test the rest of the structure to depth in the 2024 drill program currently underway in the field.” Figure 1 – Location of LIFT’s Yellowknife Lithium Project. Drilling has been thus far focused on the Near Field Group of pegmatites which are located to the east of the city of Yellowknife along a government-maintained paved highway, as well as the Echo target in the Further Afield Group. The Fi-SW dyke strikes over at least 1.1 km on surface with an average outcropping width of approximately 20 m. The dyke dips between 60°-80° to the east-southeast and trends towards the north-northeast. Drilling of Fi SW shows that it ranges from a single 20-40 m wide dyke to 2-3 dykes of similar cumulative width within a 50-70 m wide corridor. YLP-0199 is the first hole drilled in the 2024 winter program and was collared to test the Fi SW pegmatite approximately 150 m from its northern mapped extent and 50 m beneath the surface. Drilling intersected 4 m and 15 m wide pegmatites separated by 3 m of country rock with assays returning a wall-to-wall composite of 1.05% Li2O over 22 m that includes 9 m of 1.87% Li2O (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 3). Figure 2 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Southwest pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 3 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0199 with results as shown in the Fi Southwest pegmatite dyke with a 22 m interval of 1.05% Li2O. Nite Pegmatite The Nite pegmatite complex comprises a north-northeast trending corridor of parallel-trending dykes that is exposed for at least 1.4 km of strike length and dips approximately 50°-70° degrees to the east. The northern part of this complex consists of a main dyke flanked by one or more thinner dykes whereas the southern part comprises a fanning splay of 5-10 thinner dykes that is up to 200 m wide. YLP-0192 explored the Nite pegmatite approximately 400 m from its northern end, 150 m beneath the surface, and 100 m downdip of previously released YLP-0152 (1.24% Li2O over 5 m). Drilling intersected five pegmatite dykes ranging from 1-7 m wide for cumulative pegmatite of 19 m over 45 m of core. The deepest of these three dykes returned 0.87% Li2O over 6 m that includes 2 m of 1.99% Li2O. YLP-0195 was drilled on a section 300 m south of YLP-0192 to test the Nite pegmatite 700 m from its northern end, 250 m beneath the surface, and 200 m downdip of YLP-0138 (1.51% Li2O over 12 m). New drilling intersected a 17 m wide dyke flanked by several 1-8 m dykes for cumulative 28 m of pegmatite over 59 m of core. Sampling of the thick dyke returned an assay composite of 1.00% Li2O over 15 m that includes subintervals of 1.42% Li2O over 2 m and 1.26% Li2O over 8 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 4 & 5). Figure 4 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Nite pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 5 – Cross-section of YLP-0195 which intersected the Nite pegmatite dyke with a 15 m interval of 1.00% Li2O. BIG West Pegmatite The BIG West pegmatite complex comprises a northeast-trending corridor of parallel-trending dykes that is exposed for at least 1.5 km along strike and is steeply west dipping to subvertical. The complex is bound by two relatively continuous dyke structures that are 50-100 m apart in the northern half of the corridor and 150 m apart in the south. These dykes are here referred to as the east- (EB) and west-bounding (WB) dykes. This week’s results are described from southern- to northern-most. YLP-0180 tested the WB dyke approximately 450 m from its southern mapped extent and <25 m beneath the surface, as well as 50 m and 100 m up-dip of previously released holes (YLP-0160, 0164) that both returned negligible grades. Drilling intersected a single 11 m wide pegmatite dyke that returned an assay composite of 0.54% Li2O over 5 m, which includes 1 m of 1.60% Li2O. YLP-0185 was collared just west of the EB dyke and 200 m from the northern mapped extent of the BIG West complex to target the WB dyke approximately 50 m beneath the surface and 100 m up-dip of YLP-0191 (see below). Drilling intersected a single one-metre-wide pegmatite dyke that returned negligible grade. YLP-0191 was drilled on the same section as YLP-0185 but was collared just east of the EB dyke, so that it tested this dyke within 25-50 m of the surface and the WB dyke at 150 m depth. Drilling shows that these bounding dykes are separated by ~100 m of country rock, with the EB dyke comprising two 11-12 m dykes flanked by 2-3 m wide dykes for cumulative 28 m of pegmatite over 70 m of drill core whereas WB comprises a single 27 m wide dyke. Significant assays were returned only from the EB dyke and includes composites of 0.74% Li2O over 11 m (including 1.48% Li2O over 4 m) and 0.54% Li2O over 12 m (with 1.44% Li2O over 3 m). YLP-0183 is the most northerly hole drilled on the BIG West complex in 2023, just ~150 m from its northern mapped extent and targeting the EB dyke within 25 m of the surface. Drilling intersected a 13 m wide dyke flanked by several 1-7 m wide dykes for 33 m of pegmatite over 69 m of drill core. Assays from the thick dyke returned a composite of 0.51% Li2O over 6 m that includes a 1 m interval of 1.16% Li2O whereas the flanking dykes returned negligible grade (Table 1 & 2, Figures 6 & 7). Figure 6 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the BIG West pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 7 – Cross-section of YLP-0191 which intersected the BIG West pegmatite dyke with a 11 m interval of 0.74% Li2O. Fi Boye Pegmatite The Fi Boye pegmatite comprises a corridor of mostly north-south striking, steeply east-dipping, dykes that run parallel to, and lie 500-700 m west of, the Fi Main complex. The Fi Boye corridor has at least 1.7 km of striking length, contains between 1-5 dykes, and ranges from approximately 10-200 m in width. The two holes reported below comprise all the drilling done on Fi Boye in 2023. YLP-0189 was drilled to test the Fi Boye dyke approximately 200 m from its northern mapped extent and 50 m beneath the surface. Drilling intersected a 14 m wide dyke flanked by several 1-2 m wide dykes for cumulative pegmatite of 16 m over 31 m. The thick dyke returned an assay composite of 1.11% Li2O over 4 m (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8).

Currently, LIFT has reported results from 189 out of 198 diamond drill holes (33,309 m). General Statements Six of the eight holes described in this news release were drilled broadly perpendicular to the dyke orientation so that the true thickness of reported intercepts will range somewhere between 65-100% of the drilled widths. A collar header table is provided below. Two of the three holes drilled at the north end of the BIG West complex (YLP-0185, 0191) were drilled broadly downdip because collar locations for drilling perpendicular to dyke orientation fall within Big Hill Lake. The true thickness of these downdip intercepts will range between 40-50% of the drilled widths. Mineralogical characterization for the YLP pegmatites is in progress through hyperspectral core scanning and X-ray diffraction work. Visual core logging indicates that the predominant host mineral is spodumene.

Drill core was transported from the drill platform to the core processing facility where it was logged, photographed, and split by diamond saw prior to being sampled. Samples were then bagged, and blanks and certified reference materials were inserted at regular intervals. Field duplicates consisting of quarter-cut core samples were also included in the sample runs. Groups of samples were placed in large bags, sealed with numbered tags to maintain a chain-of-custody, and transported from LIFT’s core logging facility to ALS Labs (“ALS”) laboratory in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Sample preparation and analytical work for this drill program were carried out by ALS. Samples were prepared for analysis according to ALS method CRU31: individual samples were crushed to 70% passing through 2 mm (10 mesh) screen; a 1,000-gram sub-sample was riffle split (SPL-21) and then pulverized (PUL-32) such that 85% passed through 75-micron (200 mesh) screen. A 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was then dissolved in a sodium peroxide solution and analysed for lithium according to ALS method ME-ICP82b. Another 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was analysed for 53 elements according to ALS method ME-MS89L. All results passed the QA/QC screening at the lab, all inserted standards and blanks returned results that were within acceptable limits.

Limited to manufacture QDENGA, a dengue vaccine, is a significant development in the public health sector. This collaboration is poised to enhance the availability of the vaccine in endemic regions, which could potentially lead to a reduction in the global incidence of dengue fever. The move to produce multi-dose vials (MDVs) is a strategic one, as MDVs offer cost-saving benefits by reducing packaging and storage costs and also help in minimizing medical and environmental waste. This is particularly relevant for national immunization programs in resource-limited settings where such savings can be redirected towards other healthcare initiatives.The increase in manufacturing capacity to 50 million doses a year by Biological E. Limited complements Takeda's existing production capabilities and its partnership with IDT Biologika GmbH. This expanded capacity is crucial in meeting the long-term goal of producing 100 million doses annually by 2030. The scale-up in vaccine production could also serve as a case study for other vaccine manufacturers in terms of strategic partnerships and capacity building. Economist From an economic perspective, the partnership between Takeda and Biological E. Limited has the potential to stimulate economic activity within the vaccine market, especially in the context of emerging economies such as India. The production of QDENGA in India, a country with a significant burden of dengue fever, could lead to positive externalities such as job creation and technological transfer. Furthermore, the focus on multi-dose vials aligns with the need for cost-effective healthcare solutions in developing countries. By reducing the per-dose cost of vaccines, there is an opportunity to improve the affordability and accessibility of dengue immunization, which could, in turn, reduce the economic burden of the disease on public health systems.Additionally, the strategic partnership may influence stock market perceptions of both Takeda and Biological E. Limited. Investors may view this collaboration as a growth opportunity given the increasing demand for dengue vaccines due to rising global incidence rates. This could potentially lead to an increase in investor confidence and positive movements in the stock prices of the companies involved, depending on market sentiment and the perceived success of the partnership. Global Health Expert As dengue fever continues to pose a significant threat to global health, particularly in the Americas, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions, the implications of a successful QDENGA vaccine are profound. The collaboration between Takeda and Biological E. Limited represents a strategic move to address a critical public health need. By focusing on multi-dose vials, the partnership is directly responding to the logistical challenges faced by national immunization programs, which often struggle with limited resources. The projected availability of 100 million doses per year by 2030 signals a substantial increase in the global vaccine supply, which could lead to improved dengue control and prevention efforts.Moreover, the partnership highlights the importance of international collaborations in tackling global health issues. The expertise of Biological E. Limited in vaccine manufacturing paired with Takeda's research and development capabilities exemplifies how cross-border cooperation can accelerate access to essential medicines and strengthen health systems worldwide. This is especially relevant for dengue-endemic countries that bear the highest burden of disease and require sustainable solutions to protect vulnerable populations. 02/26/2024 - 11:30 PM Biological E.

About QDENGA® ▼ (Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine [Live, Attenuated]) QDENGA® (TAK-003) is a dengue vaccine that is based on a live-attenuated dengue serotype 2 virus, which provides the genetic “backbone” for all four dengue virus serotypes and is designed to help protect against any of these serotypes. In the European Union (EU) Member States, QDENGA is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals from four years of age and should be administered subcutaneously as a 0.5 mL dose at a two-dose (0 and 3 months) schedule pursuant to approved dosing regimen. The indications for use of QDENGA may vary in different countries/regions. The use of QDENGA should be in accordance with local recommendations. Important Safety Information Please consult the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before prescribing. Guidance for use: QDENGA should be administered by subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm in the region of deltoid. QDENGA must not be injected intravascularly, intradermally or intramuscularly. Vaccination should be postponed in subjects suffering from an acute severe febrile illness. The presence of a minor infection, such as a cold, should not result in a deferral of vaccination. Vaccination should be preceded by a review of the individual’s medical history (especially with regards to previous vaccination and possible hypersensitivity reactions which occurred after vaccination). Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must always be readily available in the event of a rare anaphylactic reaction following administration of the vaccine. Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions may occur in association with vaccination as a psychogenic response to the needle injection. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. A protective immune response with QDENGA may not be elicited in all vaccinees against all serotypes of dengue virus and may decline over time. It is currently unknown whether a lack of protection could result in an increased severity of dengue. It is recommended to continue personal protection measures against mosquito bites after vaccination. Individuals should seek medical care if they develop dengue symptoms or dengue warning signs. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substances or excipients listed, or to previous QDENGA dose. Individuals with congenital or acquired immune deficiency, including immunosuppressive therapies such as chemotherapy or high doses of systemic corticosteroids (e.g., 20 mg/day or 2 mg/kg body weight/day of prednisone for 2 weeks or more) within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. Individuals with symptomatic HIV infection or asymptomatic HIV infection with impaired immune function. Pregnant and breast-feeding women. ▼ This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information.

About Dengue Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that spreads rapidly around the world and was one of the WHO’s top 10 threats to global health in 2019.3,4 Dengue is mainly spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and, to a lesser extent, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.3 It is caused by any of four dengue virus serotypes, each of which can cause dengue fever or severe dengue.5 The prevalence of individual serotypes varies across different geographies, countries, regions, seasons and over time.6 Recovery from infection by one serotype provides lifelong immunity against only that serotype, and later exposure to any of the remaining serotypes is associated with an increased risk of severe disease.3,7 Important Notice For the purposes of this notice, “press release” means this document, any oral presentation, any question and answer session and any written or oral material discussed or distributed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”) regarding this release.

Preliminary GAAP net loss of $109.9 million. CEO optimistic about future growth despite revenue challenges. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported preliminary Q4 revenue of $225.5 million, in line with guidance, indicates a stable financial trajectory for ADTRAN Holdings, albeit within a challenging macroeconomic landscape. The sequential improvement in GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses, with reductions of 7.6% and 15.1% respectively, suggests effective cost management strategies are being implemented. This cost discipline is critical for maintaining profitability, especially when revenue growth is under pressure.However, the negative preliminary GAAP operating margin of 16.7% and a non-GAAP operating margin of -1.4% raise concerns about the company's current ability to generate profit. The GAAP net loss of $109.9 million and non-GAAP net loss of $85.9 million are significant and could impact investor sentiment. The negative diluted loss per share figures, both GAAP ($1.40) and non-GAAP ($1.09), may also weigh on the stock's performance in the short term.Investors should also consider the year-over-year gross margin improvements, which indicate increased efficiency in cost control. The reduction in inventory write-offs, from $21 million in Q3 to $3.3 million in Q4, suggests better inventory management and could be a sign of operational improvement. Market Research Analyst The communication from ADTRAN Holdings' CEO highlights a strategic pivot towards operational efficiency and cost reduction, which is a common response to the current economic headwinds faced by the tech sector. The emphasis on a favorable customer and product mix contributing to a non-GAAP gross margin increase to 41.9% demonstrates the company's ability to adapt to market demands and optimize its product portfolio for better margins.Despite the current revenue challenges, the CEO's statement about the unchanged fundamental demand landscape suggests a positive outlook for the industry's long-term growth. This is underpinned by the ongoing need for global infrastructure buildouts, particularly in expanding fiber networks and enhancing bandwidth. For investors, this could indicate potential for recovery and growth once macroeconomic conditions improve.ADTRAN's commitment to becoming a 'more streamlined and efficient company' could resonate well with stakeholders who value long-term strategic planning and may mitigate concerns over short-term financial losses. The expectation that the company will excel 'when spending returns to normal levels' provides a forward-looking perspective that might influence investor confidence in the company's resilience and future performance. Economist The macroeconomic environment, characterized by elevated customer inventories and cautious spending, is reflected in ADTRAN Holdings' preliminary financial results. The company's negative operating margins and net losses underscore the broader economic challenges that are affecting corporate profitability across sectors.The strategic focus on cost improvement measures, however, is indicative of a proactive approach to weathering economic downturns. By reducing operating expenses, ADTRAN is better positioned to maintain financial stability during periods of reduced revenue growth. This approach is in line with broader economic principles of cost management during downturns to preserve capital and ensure sustainability.The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape that includes fluctuating demand, supply chain disruptions and cautious capital expenditure by service providers. The CEO's reference to a steady demand landscape, despite short-term challenges, points to an expectation of sector recovery, which is contingent on the stabilization of macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence. 02/26/2024 - 11:00 PM Preliminary Q4 revenue at $225.5 million and at mid-point of guidance Sequential improvement in preliminary GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4, with a 7.6% reduction in GAAP operating expenses and a 15.1% reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses respectively HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ADTRAN Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADTN and FSE: QH9) (“ADTRAN Holdings” or the “Company”) today announced its preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023. All results in this release are approximate due to the preliminary nature of the announcement. Preliminary GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 34.8% and improved by 483 bps year-over-year and 754 bps quarter-over-quarter. Besides lower purchasing and transportation costs, the main driver for this improvement were lower acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments. Additionally, the current quarter was negatively impacted by an inventory write-off of $3.3 million compared to a $21 million inventory write-off in Q3 2023. Preliminary non-GAAP gross margin of 41.9% was positively impacted by a favorable customer and product mix. This compares to 40.3% in Q3 2023 and 39.1% in the year-ago quarter representing an increase of 155 bps sequentially and 277 bps year over year. Preliminary GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was negative 16.7%, and it was negatively impacted by lower revenue and acquisition-related expenses, amortizations and adjustments. The company reduced GAAP operating expenses by 7.6% sequentially and 17.0% year-over-year. Preliminary non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was negative 1.4%, which was at the upper end of the guidance range of between -7% and 0% of revenues. The Company reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 15.1% sequentially and 17.7% year-over-year. Preliminary GAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $109.9 million. Preliminary diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter was $1.40. Preliminary non-GAAP net loss attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $85.9 million. Preliminary non-GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to the Company for the fourth quarter was $1.09. ADTRAN Holdings’ Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Tom Stanton stated, ""Preliminary Q4 revenue came in as expected with non-GAAP profitability at the upper end of our guidance driven by continued gross margin improvements and lower operating expenses. Although revenues continued to remain challenging due to the macroeconomic environment and elevated customer inventories, we believe the fundamental demand landscape remains unchanged. Service providers continue to pursue the same objectives of expanding their fiber footprint and enhancing bandwidth, necessitating global infrastructure buildouts. With the ongoing implementation of our cost improvement measures, we believe that we are transforming into a more streamlined and efficient company. We expect that this will position us well to excel when spending returns to normal levels.""

Fowke III as interim CEO & President, while Sara Martinez Tucker becomes Chair of the Board. The company also discloses its 2023 financial results and reaffirms its 2024 operating earnings guidance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The appointment of Benjamin G.S. Fowke III as interim CEO and President of American Electric Power (AEP) is a strategic move that could influence investor confidence and the company's direction. Fowke's extensive experience in the utility sector, particularly his decade-long tenure at Xcel Energy, provides him with a comprehensive understanding of operations, finance and regulatory policy. His immediate past role as chair of AEP's Finance Committee suggests familiarity with the company's financial strategy, which is crucial as AEP reaffirms its operating earnings guidance for 2024.The leadership transition, especially when not prompted by performance issues, often signals a shift in strategic priorities or a refocusing of corporate vision. Investors typically monitor such changes closely, as they can impact the company's long-term value creation. The market's response will likely be measured against the continuity and stability Fowke can provide during this interim period and the effectiveness of the search for a permanent CEO. Energy Sector Analyst The energy sector is particularly sensitive to leadership changes due to the complex regulatory environment and the capital-intensive nature of the business. AEP's emphasis on managing its portfolio and advancing its generation fleet transformation is indicative of the industry's larger transition towards more sustainable and resilient energy production. Fowke's background in sustainability aligns with this trajectory and may reassure stakeholders that AEP is committed to navigating the regulatory and operational challenges inherent in this shift.Furthermore, AEP's focus on grid reliability and resiliency is critical given the increased frequency of extreme weather events and the national interest in infrastructure modernization. The interim CEO's ability to enhance regulatory relationships will be pivotal in securing necessary approvals for capital projects and could affect AEP's stock performance based on the perceived success of these initiatives. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transition in AEP's leadership comes at a time when the company is reaffirming its 2024 earnings guidance, suggesting confidence in its financial projections and operational stability. Investors will be attentive to the upcoming earnings webcast for insights into the company's year-end performance and the interim CEO's strategic priorities.While AEP's financial results are not directly tied to this leadership change, the guidance range provided will be scrutinized for indications of underlying business health and potential growth trajectories. The market will also look for Fowke's commentary on portfolio actions aimed at simplifying and de-risking the business, as these are critical factors in evaluating AEP's investment potential and risk profile. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM AEP Board Member and Former Chairman and CEO of Xcel Energy, Benjamin G.S.

Although AEP and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries believe that their expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any such statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those projected. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changes in economic conditions, electric market demand and demographic patterns in AEP service territories; the economic impact of increased global trade tensions including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the adoption or expansion of economic sanctions or trade restrictions; inflationary or deflationary interest rate trends; volatility and disruptions in the financial markets precipitated by any cause, including failure to make progress on federal budget or debt ceiling matters, particularly developments affecting the availability or cost of capital to finance new capital projects and refinance existing debt; the availability and cost of funds to finance working capital and capital needs, particularly if expected sources of capital such as proceeds from the sale of assets, subsidiaries and tax credits, and anticipated securitizations, do not materialize or do not materialize at the level anticipated, and during periods when the time lag between incurring costs and recovery is long and the costs are material; decreased demand for electricity; weather conditions, including storms and drought conditions, and AEP's ability to recover significant storm restoration costs; limitations or restrictions on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with natural disasters or operations; the cost of fuel and its transportation, the creditworthiness and performance of fuel suppliers and transporters and the cost of storing and disposing of used fuel, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; the availability of fuel and necessary generation capacity and the performance of generation plants; AEP's ability to recover fuel and other energy costs through regulated or competitive electric rates; the ability to transition from fossil generation and the ability to build or acquire renewable generation, transmission lines and facilities (including the ability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals and permits) when needed at acceptable prices and terms, including favorable tax treatment, and to recover those costs; the impact of pandemics and any associated disruption of AEP's business operations due to impacts on economic or market conditions, costs of compliance with potential government regulations, electricity usage, supply chain issues, customers, service providers, vendors and suppliers; new legislation, litigation and government regulation, including changes to tax laws and regulations, oversight of nuclear generation, energy commodity trading and new or heightened requirements for reduced emissions of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, carbon, soot or particulate matter and other substances that could impact the continued operation, cost recovery, and/or profitability of generation plants and related assets; the impact of federal tax legislation on results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or credit ratings; the risks associated with fuels used before, during and after the generation of electricity and the byproducts and wastes of such fuels, including coal ash and spent nuclear fuel; timing and resolution of pending and future rate cases, negotiations and other regulatory decisions, including rate or other recovery of new investments in generation, distribution and transmission service and environmental compliance; resolution of litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations; AEP's ability to efficiently manage operation and maintenance costs; prices and demand for power generated and sold at wholesale; changes in technology, particularly with respect to energy storage and new, developing, alternative or distributed sources of generation; AEP's ability to recover through rates any remaining unrecovered investment in generation units that may be retired before the end of their previously projected useful lives; volatility and changes in markets for coal and other energy-related commodities, particularly changes in the price of natural gas; the impact of changing expectations and demands of customers, regulators, investors and stakeholders, including focus on environmental, social and governance concerns; changes in utility regulation and the allocation of costs within regional transmission organizations, including ERCOT, PJM and SPP; changes in the creditworthiness of the counterparties with contractual arrangements, including participants in the energy trading market; actions of rating agencies, including changes in the ratings of debt; the impact of volatility in the capital markets on the value of the investments held by AEP's pension, other postretirement benefit plans, captive insurance entity and nuclear decommissioning trust and the impact of such volatility on future funding requirements; accounting standards periodically issued by accounting standard-setting bodies; other risks and unforeseen events, including wars and military conflicts, the effects of terrorism (including increased security costs), embargoes, wildfires, cyber security threats and other catastrophic events; and the ability to attract and retain the requisite work force and key personnel.

Perrigo Increases its Quarterly Dividend,2024-02-26T21:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) increases its quarterly dividend by 1% to $0.276 per share, marking the 21st consecutive year of dividend growth.","Perrigo Increases its Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO) increases its quarterly dividend by 1% to $0.276 per share, marking the 21st consecutive year of dividend growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The dividend increase by Perrigo Company plc represents a continuation of the company's long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value through consistent dividend growth. With this being the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases, it signals to the market a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders. The 1% increase, while modest, may not significantly alter investor returns in the short-term, but it does reinforce the perception of Perrigo as a stable investment, particularly for income-focused shareholders.From a financial perspective, the dividend policy should be sustainable given the company's cash flow and earnings. Investors should, however, monitor the payout ratio to ensure that dividends are not compromising the company's ability to reinvest in growth opportunities or maintain operational flexibility. Additionally, the market may have already priced in the expectation of a dividend increase, given the company's history, which could mean the immediate stock price reaction may be muted. Market Research Analyst The consumer self-care industry is characterized by stable demand and cash flow, which supports consistent dividend payouts. Perrigo's decision to increase its dividend could be seen as an indicator of management's confidence in the company's financial health and the stability of its market position. This move could also be strategically aimed at attracting a certain investor demographic that prioritizes dividend yield in their investment decisions.It is important to consider the broader market context. If peers in the industry are also raising dividends, Perrigo's increase may be necessary to remain competitive in attracting and retaining investors. Conversely, if Perrigo's increase is out of step with industry trends, it could either suggest a stronger performance relative to its peers or a potential overextension if the industry is facing headwinds that Perrigo is not accounting for. Economist In an economic environment where interest rates and inflation are fluctuating, a company's decision to increase dividends can be particularly significant. For income investors, dividends can be a hedge against inflation, especially when the increase outpaces inflation rates. In the case of Perrigo, the 1% increase should be evaluated against current inflation trends to determine its real value to shareholders.Furthermore, the broader economic context can affect consumer spending on self-care products. Economic downturns typically see a rise in consumer focus on value-based purchases, which could benefit companies like Perrigo. However, investors should also be aware of the potential impact of economic recovery, which could shift consumer spending away from self-care products to more discretionary items, potentially affecting Perrigo's revenue and, by extension, its ability to maintain or increase dividends in the future. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM DUBLIN, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Perrigo Company plc (NYSE: PRGO), a leading global provider of Consumer Self-Care Products, announces that its Board of Directors has approved a 1% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.276 per share, or $1.10 per share on an annual basis, up from $0.273 per share. This marks the 21st consecutive year Perrigo has increased its dividend. The cash dividend is payable on March 26, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 8, 2024.

Cash and equivalents at year-end amounted to Ps.15,691.8 million. Negative Negative revenue trend with a 5.5% decline. Decrease in EBITDA by 5.8% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin dropped from 75.3% to 67.7%. Net Debt to EBITDA LTM ratio negative at -0.2x. Market Research Analyst The reported 1.1% year-over-year increase in total passenger traffic for Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASUR) in 4Q23 is a modest indicator of recovery in the aviation sector. This metric is crucial as it directly correlates with revenue potential from both aeronautical and non-aeronautical sources. The growth in Mexico and Puerto Rico, with a particularly strong 12.5% increase in Puerto Rico, suggests a rebound in tourism and business travel in these regions. Conversely, the 12.9% decline in Colombia highlights regional disparities, likely attributable to specific market dynamics such as the suspension of operations by local airlines.Furthermore, the 5.5% decline in revenue juxtaposed with an increase in passenger traffic indicates a possible yield dilution or a change in revenue composition. This could suggest that despite more passengers, each passenger may be generating less revenue, which could be due to a variety of factors such as changes in service offerings, pricing strategies, or a shift in passenger demographics.The reported 19.1% increase in cash and cash equivalents provides the company with a robust liquidity position to navigate short-term uncertainties or invest in capital expenditures. However, the significant 52% reduction in Capex could imply a strategic decision to conserve cash or a completion of a major investment cycle, which would be worth monitoring for future implications on growth and service enhancements. Financial Analyst The EBITDA decline of 5.8% year-over-year, despite a slight increase in passenger traffic, raises concerns about cost management and profitability. The Adjusted EBITDA margin decline from 75.3% in 4Q22 to 67.7% in 4Q23 suggests that the company's operating efficiency may have decreased. It is important to consider whether this margin contraction is due to temporary factors or indicative of a longer-term trend that could affect profitability.Additionally, the negative Net Debt to EBITDA LTM ratio of -0.2x is an unusual but positive financial position, reflecting that the company has more cash on hand than debt. This could provide financial flexibility, but it also raises questions about the company's capital allocation strategy and whether it is effectively deploying its resources to generate returns.An examination of the commercial revenue per passenger increase of 6.6% is a positive sign, particularly in the context of the total revenue decline. This suggests that the company's commercial activities, such as retail and parking, are performing well and could be a strategic focus area to offset aeronautical revenue pressures. Economist The reported financials of ASUR provide a snapshot of the regional economic activity and the health of the aviation sector in Latin America. The increase in passenger traffic in Mexico and Puerto Rico can be seen as a positive economic indicator, suggesting increased consumer confidence and spending power. In contrast, the decline in Colombia may reflect economic headwinds or market-specific challenges.The exchange rates used for converting financial figures could also have an impact on the reported revenue and earnings in Mexican pesos. Currency fluctuations can significantly affect multinational companies like ASUR and these effects should be considered when evaluating the company's financial performance.Finally, the discrepancy between the growth in passenger numbers and the decline in revenue might also be reflective of broader economic trends, such as pricing pressures in the aviation industry or shifts in consumer behavior post-pandemic. Understanding these trends is essential for forecasting the company's future performance and the overall economic outlook of the regions in which it operates. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM Total passenger traffic in 4Q23 increased 1.1% YoY MEXICO CITY, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V.

Access Code: 13744137 For a full version of ASUR's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release, please visit: https://www.asur.com.mx/informacion-financiera-page-0 Definitions Concession Services Agreements (IFRIC 12 interpretation). In Mexico and Puerto Rico, ASUR is required by IFRIC 12 to include in its income statement an income line, ""Construction Revenues,"" reflecting the revenue from construction or improvements to concessioned assets made during the relevant period. The same amount is recognized under the expense line ""Construction Costs"" because ASUR hires third parties to provide construction services. Because equal amounts of Construction Revenues and Construction Costs have been included in ASUR's income statement as a result of the application of IFRIC 12, the amount of Construction Revenues does not have an impact on EBITDA, but it does have an impact on EBITDA Margin. In Colombia, ""Construction Revenues"" include the recognition of the revenue to which the concessionaire is entitled for carrying out the infrastructure works in the development of the concession, while ""Construction Costs"" represents the actual costs incurred in the execution of such additions or improvements to the concessioned assets. Majority Net Income reflects ASUR's equity interests in each of its subsidiaries and therefore excludes the 40% interest in Aerostar that is owned by other shareholders. Other than Aerostar, ASUR owns (directly or indirectly) 100% of its subsidiaries. EBITDA means net income before provision for taxes, deferred taxes, profit sharing, non-ordinary items, participation in the results of associates, comprehensive financing cost, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as an indicator of liquidity. Our management believes that EBITDA provides a useful measure that is widely used by investors and analysts to evaluate our performance and compare it with other companies. EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may be calculated differently by different companies. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by total revenues excluding construction services revenues for Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia and excludes the effect of IFRIC 12 with respect to the construction or improvements to concessioned assets. ASUR is required by IFRIC 12 to include in its income statement an income line reflecting the revenue from construction or improvements to concessioned assets made during the relevant period. The same amount is recognized under the expense line ""Construction Costs"" because ASUR hires third parties to provide construction services. In Mexico and Puerto Rico, because equal amounts of Construction Revenues and Construction Costs have been included in ASUR's income statement as a result of the application of IFRIC 12, the amount of Construction Revenues does not have an impact on EBITDA, but it does have an impact on EBITDA Margin, as the increase in revenues that relates to Construction Revenues does not result in a corresponding increase in EBITDA. In Colombia, construction revenues do have an impact on EBITDA, as construction revenues include a reasonable margin over the actual cost of construction. Like EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as an indicator of liquidity and is not defined under U.S. GAAP or IFRS and may be calculated differently by different companies.

FDA accepted NDA for Priority Review of tovorafenib in October 2023. Hiring of 18 sales representatives in the U.S. for commercial preparedness of tovorafenib launch. Enrollment ongoing in Phase 3 FIREFLY-2/LOGGIC clinical trial for tovorafenib. Patient enrollment continues in Phase 1b/2 substudy of the FIRELIGHT-1 trial.

Participation in the 44th Annual TD Cowen Health Care Conference on March 5, 2024. Negative Increase in R&D and G&A expenses for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss of $54.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 with non-cash stock compensation expense. Net loss of $188.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results of Day One Biopharmaceuticals, with a cash position of $366.3 million at the end of 2023, suggest a stable financial footing that can sustain operations into 2026. This runway is critical for investors assessing the company's risk profile, especially given the capital-intensive nature of drug development. The increase in R&D expenses to $130.5 million for the full year, up from $85.6 million in the prior year, reflects the company's investment in the clinical advancement of tovorafenib. While this increase indicates progress in their lead product candidate's development, it also contributes to the reported net loss of $188.9 million for the year. The non-cash stock compensation expenses, which are a common tool for biotech companies to attract and retain talent, have also risen, suggesting an expanding team and increased operational scale. For stakeholders, the financial health of Day One is a balance between the costs of advancing their pipeline and the potential market opportunity upon successful product launch. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) for tovorafenib by the FDA for Priority Review and the setting of a PDUFA date are significant milestones. The Priority Review designation indicates that the FDA considers the drug to have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment of a serious condition. The focus on pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG), a rare and often difficult-to-treat cancer, could position Day One to address an unmet medical need, potentially leading to orphan drug status and associated market exclusivities. The publication of Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 trial results in a prestigious journal like Nature Medicine adds scientific credibility and visibility to the company's research efforts. The ongoing Phase 3 trial and the combination study with pimasertib are also important to track as they will provide further data on efficacy and safety, which are crucial for eventual market penetration and competitive positioning. Market Research Analyst The hiring of 18 sales representatives in anticipation of tovorafenib's approval indicates a proactive commercial strategy by Day One. This early buildout of a sales force is a strategic move to ensure immediate market penetration upon drug approval. The potential approval of tovorafenib and the eligibility for a Priority Review Voucher, which can be sold or used for future drug applications, represent significant commercial opportunities. The presence of seasoned biotechnology veterans joining the Board of Directors can be seen as a move to strengthen the company's governance and strategic decision-making in the oncology space. The market will be closely watching the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule expected in the second half of 2024 as it will provide insights into the drug's commercial viability and potential treatment protocols. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM PDUFA target action date for tovorafenib NDA in relapsed or progressive pLGG remains set for April 30, 2024 Phase 2 FIREFLY-1 tovorafenib registrational data published in Nature Medicine Ended 2023 with $366.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments providing runway into 2026 BRISBANE, Calif., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Day One Biopharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: DAWN) (“Day One” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies for people of all ages with life-threatening diseases, today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and highlighted recent corporate achievements. “We have a monumental year ahead of us at Day One with the upcoming PDUFA date for tovorafenib,” said Jeremy Bender, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Day One. “Our team is trained and ready to deliver our first expected commercial medicine to children in need of new treatment options.

Corporate Highlights and Upcoming Milestones Elly Barry, MD, has been promoted to Chief Medical Officer where she will lead the execution and expansion of Day One’s clinical development programs.

Positive Record diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS for Q4 2023 increased by 182% and 55% respectively compared to the prior year. Net sales for the quarter were $494.3 million, down 1% due to an extra week impact in the prior year, but up 3% excluding this impact. Generated $60 million of cash from operating activities, repaid $30 million of debt, and repurchased $15 million of its shares during the quarter.

Gross margin increased by 780 basis points year-over-year, contributing to the improved financial results. 2024 guidance includes expectations of 3% to 5% net sales growth, diluted EPS in the range of $4.71 to $5.01, and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. The Company focused on reducing debt, repaying $159 million in the year, and acquiring $15 million of its stock under the share repurchase program. Conference call for investors scheduled on February 27, 2024, to discuss the financial results and future outlook. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net sales of $494.3 million, representing a minor decline of 1% from the previous year, suggest a relatively stable revenue stream for Dorman Products, Inc. However, the adjusted growth rate of 3% when accounting for the extra week in the prior year is a more accurate indicator of the company's underlying sales performance. The significant increase in diluted EPS by 182% and adjusted diluted EPS by 55% is a robust indicator of profitability and operational efficiency, likely reflecting the company's effective cost management and margin improvement strategies.From a financial perspective, the gross margin increase of 780 basis points is particularly noteworthy, as it implies a substantial improvement in the company's cost of goods sold or pricing power. Additionally, the aggressive debt repayment of $30 million and the share repurchase program signal a strong balance sheet and a management team that is confident in the company's intrinsic value. These actions could be interpreted as positive signals by investors, potentially influencing the stock's performance.Considering the full year figures, the 11% increase in net sales and the 6% increase in diluted EPS year-over-year are indicative of sustained growth. However, the 5% decrease in adjusted diluted EPS compared to the prior year warrants analysis to understand the adjustments made and their implications on the company's core earnings quality. Market Research Analyst The automotive aftermarket industry, in which Dorman operates, is sensitive to macroeconomic factors such as consumer spending, vehicle age and miles driven. The company's ability to achieve record net sales in a challenging economic environment may reflect a competitive advantage in its product offerings or market share gains. The segment results, with Light Duty showing stability, Heavy Duty experiencing a 12% decline and Specialty Vehicle increasing by 3%, provide insights into varying market conditions and customer preferences within the industry.Dorman's guidance for 2024, projecting net sales growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.70, suggests a positive outlook for the company's performance. This forward-looking statement, however, should be considered in the context of the current economic climate, with potential risks such as supply chain disruptions, inflation and interest rate changes. The company's ability to navigate these challenges will be crucial in meeting these projections. Economist The financial results of Dorman Products, Inc. offer a microcosmic view of the broader economic trends affecting the motor vehicle aftermarket industry. The company's substantial gross margin improvement suggests that it has effectively navigated inflationary pressures, possibly through strategic pricing or cost reductions. The repayment of debt and stock repurchases reflect a strategic allocation of capital that could be favorable in an environment of rising interest rates, as reducing leverage can minimize interest expense and enhance shareholder value.The provided 2024 guidance, assuming a tax rate of 24%, indicates that the company has factored in the current tax environment into its future financial planning. The inclusion of recent cost reduction actions in the guidance implies a proactive approach to maintaining profitability in the face of potential economic headwinds. Investors should consider these factors when assessing the company's resilience and potential for sustained growth amid economic uncertainties. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM Highlights (All comparisons are to the prior year period unless otherwise noted): Net sales of $494.3 million for the quarter, down 1% reflecting the impact of an extra week in the prior year period, up 3% excluding this impactRecord diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.60 for the quarter, up 182% compared to $0.57 Record adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.57 for the quarter, up 55% compared to $1.01Generated $60 million of cash from operating activities; repaid $30 million of debt and repurchased $15 million of its shares during the quarterFor full year 2023, achieved diluted EPS of $4.10, adjusted diluted EPS* of $4.54 and record net sales of $1.93 billion COLMAR, Pa., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorman Products, Inc. (the “Company” or “Dorman”) (NASDAQ: DORM), a leading supplier in the motor vehicle aftermarket industry, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Kevin Olsen, Dorman’s President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We delivered record profits and robust cash flow in the fourth quarter. These results were driven by the continued improvement of our gross margin, which increased 780 basis points year-over-year. As a result, we achieved fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.57, which increased 55% over last year. Net sales declined 1% in the quarter due to a comparison to the prior year period that included an extra week. We estimate the extra week in the fourth quarter of 2022 contributed $19 million in net sales for that period. Excluding this impact, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 would have increased 3%. “In addition, we had another quarter of healthy cash flow, with cash from operations of $60 million. Over the last few quarters, we focused on reducing our debt, repaying $30 million in the quarter and $159 million in the year. During the fourth quarter, we also acquired $15 million of our stock under our share repurchase program at an average price of $76. “These results were only made possible by the effort of our incredible group of Contributors who continue to work tirelessly to drive innovation for both our customers and installers.” Fourth Quarter Financial ResultsThe Company reported fourth quarter 2023 net sales of $494.3 million, down 1% compared to net sales of $501.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit was $194.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, or 39.3% of net sales, compared to $157.8 million, or 31.5% of net sales, for the same quarter last year. Adjusted gross margin* was 39.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 32.8% in the same quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $117.0 million, or 23.7% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $125.0 million, or 24.9% of net sales, for the same quarter last year. Adjusted SG&A expenses* were $118.1 million, or 23.9% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $113.4 million, or 22.6% of net sales, in the same quarter last year. Diluted EPS was $1.60 in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 182% compared to diluted EPS of $0.57 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted diluted EPS* was $1.57 in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 55% compared to adjusted diluted EPS* of $1.01 in the same quarter last year. The fourth quarter of 2022 included an extra week, which we estimate benefitted diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS* by $0.08.

The company executed multiple capital allocation initiatives, including the acquisition of the Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill. The outlook for 2024 shows continued growth and strategic investments. Positive Strong RevPAR growth of 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 9.0% for the full year. Total revenue increased to $319.7 million in Q4 and $1.3 billion for the year. Net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $1.7 million in Q4 and $51.3 million for the year. Adjusted EBITDA reached $79.2 million in Q4 and $364.5 million for the year. Acquisition of the Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill for $125 million. Repurchased 7.6 million shares for $77.2 million in 2023. Declared quarterly cash dividends for common and preferred shares. Provided outlook for 2024 with expected growth in RevPAR, Hotel EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted FFO. Announced completion of conversions and share repurchases. Maintained strong liquidity with $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) by 5.2% for the fourth quarter and a 9.0% increase for the full year signifies a robust recovery in the hospitality sector, particularly for RLJ Lodging Trust's urban-centric portfolio. This performance metric is crucial as it combines both room rates and occupancy rates, providing a comprehensive view of the company's operational efficiency. The disclosed net income growth of 466.7% for the quarter and 205.4% for the year indicates a significant turnaround in profitability, which is likely to be well-received by shareholders and could have a positive impact on the company's stock valuation.Additionally, the company's capital allocation strategies, including share repurchases and dividend declarations, demonstrate a commitment to returning value to shareholders. The repurchase of shares at an average price that appears to be below the industry average price-to-earnings ratio suggests management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company. Moreover, the increase in Adjusted Funds From Operations (FFO) per share by 22.1% is a key indicator of the company's ability to generate cash flow from its operations, which is a vital aspect for real estate investment trusts (REITs) and their investors. Market Research Analyst RLJ's strategic acquisitions and conversions, such as the purchase of the Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill and the rebranding of properties to Marriott's Autograph Collection, indicate a forward-thinking approach to asset management and brand alignment. These moves could enhance the company's competitive edge in the market. The emphasis on urban leisure, business travel and group bookings aligns with broader industry trends indicating a resurgence in city travel and corporate events post-pandemic. The forecast for 2024, with a projected RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 5.5%, suggests cautious optimism in the face of potential economic headwinds and reflects a realistic assessment of market conditions. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst The disclosed liquidity of $1.1 billion, with a substantial portion in unrestricted cash, positions RLJ Lodging Trust advantageously for both operational stability and strategic investments. The balance sheet strength, evidenced by the undrawn revolver capacity, provides flexibility for future growth initiatives or to weather potential market volatility. The debt level of $2.2 billion should be evaluated in the context of the company's asset value and income-generating potential, as well as industry benchmarks for leverage ratios. Investors would benefit from monitoring the interest expense increase due to expiring swaps, which could affect net income margins. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM Fourth Quarter RevPAR increased 5.2% Executed Multiple Capital Allocation Initiatives in 2023 Acquired the Wyndham Boston Beacon Hill BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RLJ Lodging Trust (the “Company”) (NYSE: RLJ) today reported results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023.

For additional information or to receive press releases via email, please visit our website: http://www.rljlodgingtrust.com RLJ Lodging Trust Non-GAAP and Accounting Commentary Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“Non-GAAP”) Financial Measures The Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) EBITDAre, (5) Adjusted EBITDA, (6) Hotel EBITDA, and (7) Hotel EBITDA Margin. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as a measure of its operating performance. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel EBITDA, and Hotel EBITDA Margin, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms. Funds From Operations (“FFO”) The Company calculates Funds from Operations (“FFO”) in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company’s operations. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders. The Company’s calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing the Company to non-REITs. The Company presents FFO attributable to common shareholders, which includes unitholders of limited partnership interest (“OP units”) in RLJ Lodging Trust, L.P., the Company’s operating partnership, because the OP units may be redeemed for common shares of the Company. The Company believes it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common shares and OP units. EBITDA and EBITDAre Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is defined as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sales of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization expense. The Company considers EBITDA useful to an investor in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of its operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense) from its operating results. In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. In addition to EBITDA, the Company presents EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, which defines EBITDAre as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax benefit or expense, depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment, and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. The Company believes that the presentation of EBITDAre provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's operating performance and can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs. Adjustments to FFO and EBITDA The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDAre for certain items that the Company considers outside the normal course of operations. The Company believes that Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDAre provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance that, when considered with net income or loss, FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDAre, are beneficial to an investor’s understanding of the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO, EBITDA, and EBITDAre for the following items: Transaction Costs: The Company excludes transaction costs expensed during the period Pre-Opening Costs: The Company excludes certain costs related to pre-opening of hotels Non-Cash Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-cash items such as the amortization of share-based compensation, non-cash income tax expense or benefit, and non-cash interest expense related to discontinued interest rate hedges Other Non-Operational Expenses: The Company excludes the effect of certain non-operational expenses representing income and expenses outside the normal course of operations Hotel EBITDA and Hotel EBITDA Margin With respect to Consolidated Hotel EBITDA, the Company believes that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses and certain non-cash items provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and operators have direct control.

Financial Analyst The early repayment of the Senior Secured Convertible Note by Eightco Holdings Inc. signals a strategic move to strengthen the company's balance sheet. This action directly impacts the company's financial leverage, potentially improving its creditworthiness and reducing interest expense. The repayment allows for greater financial flexibility and the reduction of debt levels is typically well-received by investors as it can lead to an improved debt-to-equity ratio.Furthermore, the private placement at $0.82 per share suggests a fundraising effort to inject capital, which could be utilized for growth initiatives or further debt reduction. The price of the private placement relative to the current market price of OCTO's stock could indicate the investor's perception of the company's value and growth prospects. Investors will be keen to assess the dilutive impact of the private placement, as well as the terms of the promissory notes, which can affect shareholder value. Market Research Analyst Eightco Holdings Inc.'s focus on reducing ongoing costs at the parent company level to prioritize growth for its subsidiary Forever 8 suggests a strategic realignment. By streamlining operations, the company may be aiming to enhance operational efficiency and allocate resources more effectively. The market will be interested in how these cost reductions translate into improved margins and profitability.The ability to attract efficient capital post-repayment could indicate that the company is positioning itself for expansion or new ventures. Market analysts will monitor the company's subsequent moves to gauge the potential for revenue growth and market expansion, which are critical factors in assessing the company's future performance and stock valuation. Legal Expert The private placement and issuance of promissory notes under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D highlight the company's approach to raising capital without public offering. This method allows the company to bypass the extensive regulatory requirements of a public offering, but also limits the pool of potential investors to accredited investors.It is essential for potential investors to understand that the securities offered in the private placement are not registered and are subject to restrictions on resale. The legal framework and compliance with securities laws are crucial in such transactions to avoid potential legal ramifications, which could impact the company's reputation and financial standing. 02/26/2024 - 04:30 PM Easton, PA, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eightco Holdings Inc.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Albany International Corp. indicate a robust performance with record revenues and an impressive increase in free cash flow. The revenue growth of 11% and the doubling of free cash flow are significant indicators of the company's operational efficiency and financial health. The integration of Heimbach and the expansion within the Engineered Composites segment are strategic moves that have contributed to this growth. As revenue is a critical metric for assessing a company's performance, the reported figures suggest that Albany International is managing to expand its market presence and improve its top-line growth.From a financial perspective, the increase in GAAP EPS and Adjusted EPS reflects the company's ability to translate higher revenues into profitable growth. However, it is important to note that the Adjusted EPS growth rate is lower than the revenue growth rate, which could indicate rising costs or investments that have not yet fully translated into earnings. The effective tax rate reduction, a result of favorable discrete tax items and a shift in taxable income to lower-rate jurisdictions, is a positive for net income, but stakeholders should be aware of the sustainability of such tax strategies.Looking ahead, the guidance for 2024 implies a continuation of revenue growth, although the projected increase in pension expense, depreciation and amortization and interest expenses will likely impact earnings. The expected capital expenditures of $90 to $95 million indicate that the company is continuing to invest in its growth, which could be beneficial in the long-term but may also affect short-term cash flows. Market Research Analyst The reported growth in both the Machine Clothing and Engineered Composites segments is indicative of Albany International's diversified business model and its adaptability to different market conditions. The Machine Clothing segment's revenue growth, despite soft business conditions in Europe, demonstrates the segment's resilience and the potential benefits of the Heimbach acquisition. The Engineered Composites segment's growth, driven by new program wins, suggests that the company is effectively capitalizing on opportunities in advanced material applications, which is a growing market.It's also worth noting the company's international operations, as evidenced by the adjustments for currency translation. The ability to grow revenues in constant currency terms suggests that the underlying demand for Albany International's products is strong, independent of currency fluctuations. This is a positive sign for the company's global competitiveness and market position.For investors and stakeholders, the company's performance in segments that cater to different industries could provide a degree of risk mitigation against sector-specific downturns. The continued investment in these segments, as indicated by the capital expenditure guidance, is likely to further enhance the company's competitive edge and market share. Legal Expert Albany International Corp's financial report includes non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA. These measures are often used by companies to provide a clearer picture of operational performance by excluding items that may be considered non-recurring or not indicative of future performance. However, it is important for stakeholders to understand the nature of these adjustments and to consider the GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measures to get a full picture of the company's financial health.The adjustments made to earnings, such as restructuring expenses, foreign currency revaluation gains/losses, CEO transition expenses, inventory step-up impacting cost of goods sold and acquisition/integration costs, are important for stakeholders to consider. These adjustments can provide insight into the company's operational and strategic decisions and their financial implications. It is also crucial for stakeholders to understand the tax implications of these adjustments, as they can significantly affect the net income attributable to the company.Furthermore, the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures is a regulatory requirement and provides transparency, allowing investors to make informed decisions based on standardized financial reporting. Stakeholders should also be aware of the legal and regulatory environment surrounding non-GAAP reporting to ensure compliance and to assess the quality of the company's financial disclosures. 02/26/2024 - 04:22 PM ROCHESTER, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Albany International Corp. (NYSE:AIN) today reported operating results for its full year and fourth quarter of 2023, which ended December 31, 2023. ""In 2023, our business remained focused on operational execution and delivered outstanding financial performance,"" said Gunnar Kleveland, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""I am pleased to report record revenues of $1.15 billion in 2023, up 11% from last year. GAAP EPS grew in the mid-teens, and Adjusted EPS of $4.06, was up 4.9% from last year. Importantly the company delivered 2023 free cash flow of $64 million, up significantly from the $32 million generated in 2022. ""Fourth quarter results were particularly strong with outstanding contributions from both of our business segments,"" continued Kleveland. ""Our first full quarter of Heimbach integration is complete, and we are on track to deliver on the promise of that acquisition. Meanwhile, our core Machine Clothing operations grew fourth quarter revenue and expanded profit margins despite soft business conditions in Europe. The Engineered Composites segment continues to grow. We have completed another year of growth on our commercial programs, and recent program wins were also important drivers of year-over-year revenue and profit growth in the business. We are well positioned for another strong year in 2024."" For the fourth-quarter ended December 31, 2023: Net revenues were $323.6 million, up 20.4%, or 19.6% after adjusting for currency translation, when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by Heimbach's contribution during the fourth quarter and growth in the Engineered Composites segment. Gross profit of $119.9 million was 23.5% higher than the $97.1 million reported for the same period of 2022, mainly due to higher net revenues from the Machine Clothing segment due to the addition of Heimbach and higher net revenues from new programs and commercial programs in the Engineered Composites segment. Selling, General, and Administrative expenses were $67.7 million, compared to $49.4 million in the same period of 2022. The increase was due to the addition of Heimbach. Operating income was $41.8 million, compared to $37.9 million in the prior year, an increase of 10.2%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% compared to a 42.0% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2022. Favorable discrete tax items in 2023 vs. unfavorable discrete tax items in 2022 and a shift in taxable income to lower-rate jurisdictions resulted in a lower effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023. Net income attributable to the Company was $30.5 million ($0.97 per share), compared to $18.1 million ($0.58 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted Diluted earnings per share (or Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP measure) was $1.22 per share, compared to $0.75 per share for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) was $75.0 million, compared to $58.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of 28.5%. Please see the tables below for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures. ""We are on sound financial footing as we enter 2024,"" said Robert Starr, Chief Financial Officer. ""Our businesses continue to deliver outstanding execution that will help sustain solid results and generate healthy cash flow this year. We will continue to invest thoughtfully to drive long-term growth."" Outlook for the Full-Year 2024 Albany International's initial financial guidance for the full-year 2024: Total company revenue between $1.26 and $1.33 billion; Effective income tax rate between 29% and 31%; Capital expenditures in the range of $90 to $95 million; Diluted earnings per share between $3.55 and $4.05. This includes: Higher pension expense due to the expiration of the prior service cost benefit (approximately $0.09 per share); Higher Depreciation and Amortization due to the recording of Heimbach-acquired assets at fair value (approximately $0.08 per share); and Higher interest expense resulting from the termination of interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter of 2024 (approximately $0.06 per share, assuming the current interest rate environment). Total company Adjusted EBITDA between $260 to $290 million; Machine Clothing revenue between $760 to $790 million; Machine Clothing Adjusted EBITDA between $230 and $250 million; Albany Engineered Composites (AEC) revenue between $500 to $540 million; and Albany Engineered Composites Adjusted EBITDA between $97 to $107 million.

(b) Our Adjusted EPS excluded the benefit from the reclassification of stranded income tax effects caused by the TCJA associated with the US pension plan liability that was eliminated in September 2022, a one-time event that would not recur in the future. Such stranded income tax effect represented a one-time benefit that distorted the effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date ended September 30, 2022, and would not be indicative of ongoing or expected future income tax rate at the Company. Management believes excluding pension settlement expense and its income tax impact, including the stranded income tax effects, from its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS for the quarter and year-to-date ended September 30, 2022 would provide investors a transparent view and enhanced ability to better assess the Company’s ongoing operational and financial performance.

Additional information about the Company and its products and services can be found at www.albint.com. Non-GAAP Measures This release, including the conference call commentary associated with this release, contains certain non-GAAP measures, that should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Such non-GAAP measures include net revenues and percent change in net revenues, excluding the impact of currency translation effects; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA margin; Net debt; Net leverage ratio; and Adjusted Diluted earnings per share (or Adjusted EPS). Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Company’s operational performance. Presenting Net revenues and change in Net revenues, after currency effects are excluded, provides management and investors insight into underlying revenues trends. Net revenues, or percent changes in net revenues, excluding currency rate effects, are calculated by converting amounts reported in local currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate of a prior period. These amounts are then compared to the U.S. dollar amount as reported in the current period. EBITDA (calculated as net income excluding interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization), Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS are performance measures that relate to the Company’s continuing operations. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding costs or benefits that are not reflective of the Company’s ongoing or expected future operational performance. Such excluded costs or benefits do not consist of normal, recurring cash items necessary to generate revenues or operate our business. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net revenues. The Company defines Adjusted EPS as diluted earnings per share (GAAP), adjusted by the after tax per share amount of costs or benefits not reflective of the Company’s ongoing or expected future operational performance. The income tax effects are calculated using the applicable statutory income tax rate of the jurisdictions where such costs or benefits were incurred or the effective tax rate applicable to total company results. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Net debt aids investors in understanding the Company’s debt position if all available cash were applied to pay down indebtedness. Net leverage ratio informs the investors of the Company's financial leverage at the end of the reporting period, providing an indicator of the Company's ability to repay its debt. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Forward-Looking Statements This press release may contain statements, estimates, guidance or projections that constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined under U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “will,” “should,” “look for,” “guidance,” “guide,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. Because forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties (including, without limitation, those set forth in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this release or in the webcast include, without limitation, statements about macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary cost pressures, as well as global events, which include but are not limited to geopolitical events; paper-industry trends and conditions during 2023 and in future years; expectations in 2023 and in future periods of revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues), Adjusted EPS, income, gross profit, gross margin, cash flows and other financial items in each of the Company’s businesses, and for the Company as a whole; the timing and impact of production and development programs in the Company’s AEC business segment and the revenues growth potential of key AEC programs, as well as AEC as a whole; the amount and timing of capital expenditures, future tax rates and cash paid for taxes, depreciation and amortization; future debt and net debt levels and debt covenant ratios; and changes in currency rates and their impact on future revaluation gains and losses. Furthermore, a change in any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material effect on the Company’s financial results in any period. Such statements are based on current expectations, and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Statements expressing management’s assessments of the growth potential of its businesses, or referring to earlier assessments of such potential, are not intended as forecasts of actual future growth, and should not be relied on as such. While management believes such assessments to have a reasonable basis, such assessments are, by their nature, inherently uncertain. This release and earlier releases set forth a number of assumptions regarding these assessments, including historical results, independent forecasts regarding the markets in which these businesses operate, and the timing and magnitude of orders for our customers’ products. Historical growth rates are no guarantee of future growth, and such independent forecasts and assumptions could prove materially incorrect in some cases.

Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Franklin Street Properties Corp. (FSP) reported its Q4 and full-year 2023 results, highlighting property dispositions, debt reduction, leasing activities, and financial performance. The company aims to increase shareholder value through strategic property sales and occupancy enhancement. FSP's financials show a mix of net income and losses, Funds From Operations (FFO), debt repayments, and amendments to debt facilities. Positive FSP sold three office properties in Q4 2023 for a total of $151 million, with total dispositions since December 2020 reaching $1 billion. The company reported GAAP net income of $3.6 million for Q4 2023 and a net loss of $48.1 million for the full year. FFO for Q4 2023 was $6.9 million, with $30.0 million for the full year. FSP had approximately $127.9 million in cash or cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, and repaid $102 million of debt on February 21, 2024. Leasing activities in 2023 included leasing 706,000 square feet, with a portfolio occupancy rate of 74.0% as of December 31, 2023. The company's average lease term increased to 6.8 years in 2023, with higher average rents achieved compared to 2022. FSP consolidated the operations of its sponsored REIT, Monument Circle, into its financial statements as of January 1, 2023, following amendments to the Sponsored REIT Loan. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share was declared for the three months ended December 31, 2023, paid on February 15, 2024. The company remains focused on debt reduction through asset sales and strategic financial management. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The strategic disposition of properties by Franklin Street Properties Corp. (FSP) indicates a focused effort to optimize its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt. The sale of properties in Texas and Florida, regions with dynamic real estate markets, particularly in the commercial sector, suggests that FSP is capitalizing on favorable market conditions to liquidate assets at a significant average price per square foot. This strategy may enhance shareholder value by improving the company's financial position and potentially allowing for reinvestment in higher-yield opportunities or return of capital to shareholders.The consolidation of the operations of Monument Circle into FSP's financial statements reflects a move to streamline operations and may provide a clearer picture of the company's financial health. By obtaining voting rights and consolidating a sponsored REIT, FSP is likely to gain greater control over the asset, which could lead to more strategic flexibility in managing or disposing of the property.It is also noteworthy that the weighted average GAAP base rent per square foot increased, indicating effective leasing strategies or a shift to more lucrative markets or property types. However, the decrease in the leased percentage points to potential challenges in tenant retention or acquisition that need to be addressed to maintain revenue stability. Financial Analyst The repayment of $102 million of debt and the amendment of debt facilities to extend maturities to April 1, 2026, provide FSP with a more manageable debt profile and could improve its credit standing. By converting the revolving line of credit to a term loan and securing longer-term debt at presumably favorable terms, FSP demonstrates prudent financial management. This approach may also be well-received by investors as it suggests a reduced risk of near-term liquidity issues.From a financial perspective, the reported GAAP net income for the fourth quarter and the net loss for the year highlight volatility in earnings, which could be a point of concern for stakeholders. However, the positive Funds From Operations (FFO) for both the quarter and the year are indicative of a healthy operational cash flow, a key metric for REITs, as it reflects the ability to generate cash from leasing activities.The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend, despite the net loss for the year, may signal confidence in the company's cash flow and long-term strategy. It also aligns with the typical REIT model of returning a substantial portion of income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Market Research Analyst Given the current real estate trends, FSP's focus on the Sunbelt and Mountain West regions could be strategically beneficial due to the population growth and economic expansion in these areas. These regions are becoming increasingly attractive for businesses and residents, which could lead to higher demand for commercial real estate.Tracking over 600,000 square feet of new prospective tenants is a positive sign of potential leasing activity. However, the actual conversion of these prospects into tenants is crucial for improving the occupancy rates and achieving stable revenue growth. The increase in the average lease term and the higher average rent per square foot compared to the previous year suggest that FSP is securing tenants with potentially more lucrative and longer-term leases, which could enhance financial stability.The real estate industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles and FSP's proactive asset management and leasing strategies appear to be aligned with the goal of navigating the current market conditions effectively. The company's optimism for 2024 and beyond may be grounded in these strategic moves, although the real estate market's response to macroeconomic factors will continue to play a significant role in FSP's performance. 02/26/2024 - 04:28 PM WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Street Properties Corp. (the “Company”, “FSP”, “we” or “our”) (NYSE American: FSP), a real estate investment trust (REIT), announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. George J. Carter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented as follows: “As the first quarter of 2024 begins, we continue to believe that the current price of our common stock does not accurately reflect the value of our underlying real estate assets. We will seek to increase shareholder value by continuing to (1) pursue the sale of select properties where we believe that short to intermediate term valuation potential has been reached and (2) strive to increase occupancy through the leasing of vacant space. We intend to use proceeds from property dispositions primarily for debt reduction. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold two office properties for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $116 million. On October 26, 2023, we sold an office property located in Plano, Texas, known as One Legacy Circle, for gross proceeds of approximately $48 million. On December 6, 2023, we sold an office property located in Miami, Florida, known as Blue Lagoon, for gross proceeds of approximately $68 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on January 26, 2024, we sold an office property located in Richardson, Texas, known as Collins Crossing, for gross proceeds of approximately $35 million. Collectively, these three dispositions resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $151 million. Since December 2020, our dispositions have resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion and reflect an average sales price per square foot of approximately $217. As a result of our recent property dispositions and our ongoing operations, as of December 31, 2023, we had cash, or cash equivalents on our balance sheet of approximately $127.9 million. On February 21, 2024, we repaid approximately $102 million of our debt and entered into amendments of our outstanding debt facilities pursuant to which all of our debt now matures on April 1, 2026. We look forward to the remainder of 2024 and beyond with anticipation and optimism.” Financial Highlights GAAP net income was $3.6 million and net loss of $48.1 million, or $0.03 and $(0.47) per basic and diluted share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Funds From Operations (FFO) was $6.9 million and $30.0 million, or $0.07 and $0.29 per basic and diluted share, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on February 21, 2024, we repaid approximately $102 million of debt. Immediately following the debt repayment and related transaction closing costs, including accrued interest, we had approximately $39.2 million in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on February 21, 2024, we entered into amendments to each our bank term loan, revolving line of credit agreement and Series A and Series B notes. As a result of these amendments, we changed the maturity date and repaid the principal amounts of each as set forth in the table below. In addition, the amendment to the revolving line of credit converted the revolving loan to a term loan. Additional information on the amendments is available in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. (in 000’s) Debt Principal Amount Outstanding Prior to Amendment Principal Amount Repaid Principal Amount Outstanding After Amendment Maturity Date Prior to Amendment Maturity Date After Amendment Bank Term Loan $115,000 $28,963 $86,037 October 1, 2024 April 1, 2026 Revolving Line of Credit* 90,000 22,667 67,333 October 1, 2024 April 1, 2026 Series A Notes 116,000 29,215 86,785 December 20, 2024 April 1, 2026 Series B Notes 84,000 21,155 62,845 December 20, 2027 April 1, 2026 Total $405,000 $102,000 $303,000 *Revolving line of credit converted to a term loan Leasing Highlights During the year ended December 31, 2023, we leased approximately 706,000 square feet, including 228,000 square feet of new leases. Our directly owned real estate portfolio of 17 owned properties, totaling approximately 5.6 million square feet, was approximately 74.0% leased as of December 31, 2023, compared to approximately 75.6% leased as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in the leased percentage is primarily a result of lease expirations and property dispositions, which was partially offset by leasing completed during the year ended December 31, 2023. The weighted average GAAP base rent per square foot achieved on leasing activity during the year ended December 31, 2023, was $29.71, or 7.4% higher than average rents in the respective properties for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average lease term on leases signed during the year ended December 31, 2023, was 6.8 years compared to 6.4 years during the year ended December 31, 2022. Overall, the portfolio weighted average rent per occupied square foot was $30.72 as of December 31, 2023, compared to $30.48 as of December 31, 2022. We are currently tracking more than 600,000 square feet of new prospective tenants, including approximately 300,000 square feet of prospective tenants that have identified our properties on their respective short lists of potential locations. We believe that our continuing portfolio of real estate is well located, primarily in the Sunbelt and Mountain West geographic regions, and consists of high-quality assets with upside leasing potential. Investment Highlights We have primarily used asset sale disposition proceeds for debt reduction and remain committed to seeking to sell select properties during 2024 and continue using proceeds primarily for debt reduction. Since December 2020, our dispositions have resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $1 billion and reflect an average sales price per square foot of approximately $217. On October 26, 2023, we completed the sale of One Legacy in Plano, Texas for approximately $48 million in gross proceeds. On December 6, 2023, we completed the sale of Blue Lagoon in Miami, Florida for approximately $68 million in gross proceeds. Subsequent to December 31, 2023, on January 26, 2024, we completed the sale of Collins Crossing in Richardson, Texas for approximately $35 million in gross proceeds. Dividends On January 12, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend for the three months ended December 31, 2023, of $0.01 per share of common stock that was paid on February 15, 2024, to stockholders of record on January 26, 2024. Consolidation of Sponsored REIT As of January 1, 2023, we consolidated the operations of our Monument Circle sponsored REIT into our financial statements. On October 29, 2021, we agreed to amend and restate our existing loan to Monument Circle that is secured by a mortgage on real estate owned by Monument Circle, which we refer to as the Sponsored REIT Loan. The amended and restated Sponsored REIT Loan extended the maturity date from December 6, 2022 to June 30, 2023 (and was further extended to September 30, 2023 on June 26, 2023), increased the aggregate principal amount of the loan from $21 million to $24 million, and included certain other modifications. On September 26, 2023, the maturity date was further extended to September 30, 2024. In consideration of our agreement to amend and restate the Sponsored REIT Loan, we obtained from the stockholders of Monument Circle the right to vote their shares in favor of any sale of the property owned by Monument Circle any time on or after January 1, 2023. As a result of our obtaining this right to vote shares, GAAP variable interest entity (VIE) rules required us to consolidate Monument Circle as of January 1, 2023. A gain on consolidation of approximately $0.4 million was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023. Additional information about the consolidation of Monument Circle can be found in Note 1, “Organization, Properties, Basis of Presentation, Financial Instruments, and Recent Accounting Standards – Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)” and Note 3, “Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans”, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Earnings Release Supplementary Schedule H Reconciliation and Definitions of Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) A reconciliation of Net income to FFO and AFFO is shown below and a definition of FFO and AFFO is provided on Supplementary Schedule I. Management believes FFO and AFFO are used broadly throughout the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry as measurements of performance. The Company has included the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and notes that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently. The Company’s computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO or AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define FFO or AFFO differently.

The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness, acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on mortgage loans, properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. Other real estate companies and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, may define this term in a different manner. We have included the NAREIT FFO as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income or loss and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) The Company also evaluates performance based on Adjusted Funds From Operations, which we refer to as AFFO. The Company defines AFFO as (1) FFO, (2) excluding loss on extinguishment of debt that is non-cash, (3) excluding our proportionate share of FFO and including distributions received, from non-consolidated REITs, (4) excluding the effect of straight-line rent, (5) plus the amortization of deferred financing costs, (6) plus the value of shares issued as compensation and (7) less recurring capital expenditures that are generally for maintenance of properties, which we call non-investment capex or are second generation capital expenditures. Second generation costs include re-tenanting space after a tenant vacates, which include tenant improvements and leasing commissions. We exclude development/redevelopment activities, capital expenditures planned at acquisition and costs to reposition a property. We also exclude first generation leasing costs, which are generally to fill vacant space in properties we acquire or were planned for at acquisition. AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company’s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. Other real estate companies may define this term in a different manner. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, AFFO should be examined in connection with net income or loss and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements. Franklin Street Properties Corp. Earnings Release Supplementary Schedule I Reconciliation and Definition of Sequential Same Store results to property Net Operating Income (NOI) and Net Income Net Operating Income (“NOI”) The Company provides property performance based on Net Operating Income, which we refer to as NOI. Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income or loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned in the periods presented, which we call Sequential Same Store. The comparative Sequential Same Store results include properties held for all periods presented. We exclude properties that have been placed in service, but that do not have operating activity for all periods presented, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy settlements and lease termination fees.

(GOOD) Q4 2023 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Stonegate Capital Partners updates coverage on Gladstone Commercial Corp. (GOOD) with strong fundamentals, high occupancy levels, industrial property diversification, and 100% rent collection in 2023. Positive Strong fundamentals with 97.4% occupancy levels as of February 21, 2024 Diversification with 60% of properties being industrial 100% rent collection in 2023 Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent update on Gladstone Commercial Corp. indicates a robust occupancy level of 97.4% as of February 21, 2024, which is a strong indicator of the company's asset utilization and operational efficiency. High occupancy rates are often correlated with steady revenue streams in the commercial real estate sector. The diversification of Gladstone's portfolio, with 60% of properties being industrial, suggests a strategic move to balance risk and tap into the industrial real estate market, which has seen growth due to increased e-commerce activity and changes in supply chain management.Furthermore, the report of 100% rent collection in 2023 is a testament to the company's effective credit management and tenant selection processes. This level of rent collection efficiency surpasses many industry averages and showcases the company's financial health. For investors, these metrics are crucial as they reflect the company's ability to generate and maintain cash flows, which is fundamental for dividend payouts and reinvestment opportunities. Financial Analyst An occupancy level of 97.4% is significantly above the industry average, which typically hovers around 90-95% for well-performing commercial real estate firms. Such high occupancy may lead to increased Net Operating Income (NOI) and potentially higher dividends for shareholders. The focus on industrial properties aligns with current market trends favoring this sector due to its resilience and the rise of logistics driven by online commerce. This strategic allocation could position Gladstone Commercial Corp. for long-term growth and stability.Investors should note the company's rent collection rate, as it is a direct contributor to the firm's revenue stability. A 100% collection rate is particularly notable given the economic challenges that can affect tenants' ability to pay rent. This level of performance could positively influence the company's stock performance, as it suggests lower default risks and a strong tenant base. Additionally, it may provide the company with a buffer to withstand economic downturns, making it an attractive option for investors seeking defensive stocks. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst The details provided about Gladstone Commercial Corp. reflect a company that is performing exceptionally well in the commercial real estate space, particularly as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). The diversification into industrial properties is a strategic move, considering the sector's low sensitivity to economic cycles compared to retail or office spaces. This diversification can lead to a more stable income for the REIT and, by extension, its investors.For a REIT, maintaining high occupancy rates is vital as it directly affects the company's ability to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, a requirement for maintaining its tax-advantaged status. The reported occupancy rate and rent collection are indicators of a strong potential for consistent and possibly growing dividend yields, which are a significant aspect for REIT investors. The data suggests that Gladstone Commercial Corp. is well-positioned to meet its dividend distribution obligations, which is a key factor for investor confidence in this sector. 02/26/2024 - 04:21 PM Dallas, Texas--(Newsfile Corp. - February 26, 2024) - Gladstone Commercial Corp.

Positive Acquisition of high-performing Lexus dealerships in California Expected annual revenues of $350 million Year-to-date acquired revenues for 2024 totaling $850 million Share repurchase update of 174,964 shares at an average price of $264.88, totaling $46.3 million Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Newport Lexus and Tustin Lexus by Group 1 Automotive represents a strategic move to strengthen its presence in the luxury automotive market, particularly in the affluent region of Southern California. The expected $350 million in annual revenues from these dealerships is a significant addition to Group 1's portfolio, which has seen a year-to-date total acquired revenues for 2024 of $850 million. This follows a substantial $1.1 billion in acquired revenues in 2023, indicating a consistent growth trajectory for the company.The automotive retail industry is highly competitive and dealerships with strong brand affiliations, such as Lexus, can command higher margins due to the brand's luxury status. Group 1's focus on larger, more profitable dealerships aligns with industry trends where scale can lead to operational efficiencies and improved negotiating power with manufacturers. The move to dispose of smaller, less profitable stores may improve overall profitability and streamline operations. Financial Analyst Group 1 Automotive's update on share repurchase activity is a signal of the company's financial health and management's confidence in its stock value. Repurchasing 174,964 shares at an average price of $264.88 for a total of $46.3 million reflects a proactive approach to capital allocation. With $97.0 million still available under the current authorization, this suggests that the company has a robust cash flow and is committed to delivering shareholder value. Share repurchases can be accretive to earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding, potentially leading to a positive market reaction.Investors often view share buybacks as a positive indicator of a company's belief in its intrinsic value and future prospects. However, it is important to consider the opportunity cost of these buybacks, as the funds could alternatively be used for further acquisitions or internal investments. The balance between returning value to shareholders and investing in growth is a critical aspect of financial strategy that investors should monitor closely. Automotive Industry Expert The strategic portfolio optimization mentioned by Group 1's President and CEO highlights the importance of brand alignment and market positioning in the automotive retail sector. Lexus, being a luxury automotive brand, offers a dealership model that can yield high revenue per unit sold. The emphasis on growth through the acquisition of larger dealerships is indicative of the industry's consolidation trend, where economies of scale can be a significant driver of profitability.Group 1's Southern California expansion is particularly noteworthy given the region's high concentration of wealth and preference for luxury vehicles. The acquisition not only increases market share but also enhances the company's brand portfolio, potentially attracting a more affluent customer base. The experience Group 1 has in the market area can be leveraged to maximize the performance of the newly acquired dealerships, optimizing both sales and after-sales service revenue streams. 02/26/2024 - 04:17 PM Expected Annual Revenues of $350 MillionThe Company Also Provides a Share Repurchase UpdateHOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Group 1 Automotive, Inc.

Operating income before taxes increased by 38.3% in 2023 compared to 2022, showing significant growth. Management fee revenue and net investment income also saw positive growth in 2023. ERIE remains a Fortune 500 company and is rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best. Erie Insurance Group is the 12th largest homeowners insurer, 12th largest automobile insurer, and 13th largest commercial lines insurer in the United States based on direct premiums written. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in net income per diluted share from $5.71 to $8.53 year-over-year represents a significant growth in profitability for Erie Indemnity Company. This could be indicative of a robust operational performance and efficient cost management, which are key factors in evaluating a company's financial health. The substantial rise in operating income before taxes by 38.3% further underscores the company's expanding margins. Investors may interpret these results as a positive signal, potentially influencing the stock's performance in the market.From an investment perspective, the growth in management fee revenue suggests an increase in policy issuance and renewal services, reflecting potentially higher customer retention and acquisition rates. However, the rise in non-commission expenses, particularly in information technology, points to increased investment in digital infrastructure, which could be a strategic move to enhance long-term competitiveness despite short-term margin pressure.It's also noteworthy that the company has managed to reduce net impairment losses on investments, which may reflect a strategic shift in the investment portfolio or better market conditions. This, combined with an increase in net investment income, could be a sign of effective asset management. Insurance Industry Analyst An increase of 17% in management fee revenue from policy issuance and renewal services indicates a strong market position and growth in Erie Indemnity's core business activities. The insurance industry often relies on these fees as a stable revenue source and growth in this area can be a good indicator of customer base expansion and improved product penetration.The report highlights a growth in direct and affiliated assumed written premium, which is a measure of the total premium collected before reinsurance costs. This growth can be a testament to the company's underwriting capabilities and market demand for its insurance products. Given the competitive nature of the insurance market, such performance differentiates Erie Indemnity and may contribute to investor confidence.However, the increase in personnel costs, driven by higher compensation and incentive plan awards, could indicate a tightening labor market or a strategy to attract and retain talent. These costs need to be carefully managed to maintain profitability without compromising on service quality and operational efficiency. Economist The reported financials by Erie Indemnity Company reveal broader economic trends such as increased consumer demand for insurance products, possibly influenced by economic recovery or changes in consumer behavior. The growth in policies in force suggests a healthy consumer base which is a positive sign for the economy as a whole.Moreover, the increase in investment income, despite limited partnership losses, could be reflective of the current investment climate and interest rate environment. The ability to generate higher investment income in such a climate could be indicative of a well-diversified investment strategy and prudent financial management.Lastly, the reported decrease in advertising expenses leading to cost savings could be a strategic response to changing market dynamics, where digital marketing might be becoming more cost-effective compared to traditional advertising channels. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Net Income per Diluted Share was $2.12 for the Quarter and $8.53 for the Year ERIE, Pa., Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Erie Indemnity Company (NASDAQ: ERIE) today announced financial results for the full year and quarter ending December 31, 2023.

Indentures Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Healthpeak Properties, Inc. announces successful receipt of consents from holders of Physicians Realty L.P. senior notes for proposed amendments in connection with the merger with Physicians Realty Trust.

Healthpeak guarantees prompt payment to the holders of DOC Notes post-merger completion.

Barclays Capital Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as Solicitation Agents for the consent solicitation and offers to guarantee. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The receipt of required consents for amendments to the indentures governing Physicians Realty L.P.'s senior notes is a strategic financial maneuver that has significant implications for both Healthpeak Properties, Inc. and Physicians Realty Trust. By securing these consents, Healthpeak ensures a smooth transition towards the merger with Physicians Realty Trust, which could potentially streamline operations and financial obligations. This move indicates a proactive approach to risk management and debt structuring, which is particularly relevant to investors and creditors monitoring the stability and financial health of the involved entities.The modifications to the debt covenants and the issuance of the Healthpeak Guarantee post-merger are critical because they reflect a change in the financial obligations and protections afforded to note holders. The alignment of debt covenants with Healthpeak's existing indentures could suggest a harmonization of financial practices and risk profiles between the two entities. The elimination of the maintenance of properties covenant may raise questions regarding the future upkeep of physical assets, which could impact the long-term value of the real estate portfolio. However, this could also imply a more flexible approach to asset management. The amendments to the financial reporting covenant will necessitate investors to adapt to Healthpeak's reporting standards, which may differ from those of Physicians Realty L.P. Legal Expert The successful consent solicitation and subsequent amendments to the indentures represent a legally binding change in the terms of the DOC Notes. The legal process of consent solicitation is a mechanism that allows issuers to modify bond agreements with the approval of a majority of bondholders, thereby avoiding the need for a more cumbersome and potentially contentious renegotiation process. The legal implications of the consent solicitation and the amendments are substantial, as they alter the contractual landscape under which the DOC Notes were issued.The execution of the Supplemental Indenture, which becomes effective upon delivery, is a legally transformative event that solidifies the Healthpeak Guarantee and the agreed-upon amendments. The guarantee by Healthpeak and Healthpeak OP underscores their commitment to honoring the financial obligations of Physicians Realty L.P.'s notes, which could enhance the creditworthiness of the notes and potentially affect their market value. The specificity of the amendments, particularly the alignment with existing Healthpeak covenants and the removal of certain obligations, illustrates a tailored approach to legal and financial integration post-merger. Market Research Analyst The market's response to the consent solicitation and the impending merger between Healthpeak Properties, Inc. and Physicians Realty Trust will likely be influenced by the perceived benefits and risks associated with the amendments to the DOC Notes. The market will interpret the successful consent solicitation as a sign of bondholder confidence in the merger's prospects and Healthpeak's future financial stability. The $1.00 per $1,000 principal amount consent payment is a minor expense for Healthpeak but serves as an incentive for note holders to agree to the amendments, potentially avoiding any holdout situations that could delay the merger.From a market perspective, the amendments could affect the liquidity and trading patterns of the DOC Notes. The alignment of covenants with Healthpeak's existing indentures may be viewed favorably if investors believe that Healthpeak's covenants provide a more robust framework for financial governance. Conversely, the removal of the maintenance of properties covenant could lead to concerns about asset quality deterioration over time, which may impact investor sentiment. Ultimately, the market will closely monitor the completion of the merger and the operational synergy it creates, as these factors will influence the long-term performance of both Healthpeak's and Physicians Realty Trust's securities. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Healthpeak Properties, Inc.

Financial Analyst Callon Petroleum's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results indicate a strong operational and financial performance, characterized by consistent free cash flow generation and a strategic focus on capital efficiency. The reported net cash provided by operating activities of $298.3 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year, alongside an adjusted free cash flow of $120.2 million for the quarter, reflect a robust cash position. This performance is crucial for investors as it highlights the company's ability to generate surplus cash that can be used for debt reduction, share repurchases, or reinvestment in growth opportunities.Additionally, the reduction of long-term debt to $1.9 billion and a leverage ratio of less than 1.5x is a positive sign of financial prudence. The deleveraging process enhances the company's creditworthiness and financial flexibility, potentially leading to lower borrowing costs and a stronger balance sheet. The share buyback program, with 1.7 million shares repurchased, signifies management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company and serves as a tool for enhancing shareholder value. However, investors should note that share repurchases are halted due to the pending merger with APA Corporation, which could impact the short-term liquidity but may result in long-term strategic benefits. Market Research Analyst The operational highlights, such as total production surpassing guidance and well productivity gains, are indicative of Callon's operational excellence and technological advancements. The increase in production to an average of 103.4 MBoe/d, with a significant liquids mix, suggests a favorable product portfolio in the current market environment where oil prices are relatively stable. The focus on the Permian Basin and the divestiture of non-core assets align with industry trends of concentrating on high-margin, low-cost regions.Furthermore, the anticipated combination with APA Corporation is expected to create a larger entity with an expanded asset base in the Permian Basin. This merger could lead to operational synergies and further cost reductions, enhancing the competitive position of the combined company. The market will be looking closely at how the integration of both companies' best practices and technical expertise can drive incremental performance gains and whether the merger will deliver the projected value to shareholders. Energy Sector Analyst Callon's progress in reducing well costs and improving well productivity is significant for the energy sector, where cost efficiency is a critical factor for sustainability and competitiveness. The reported 19% and 26% decrease in well costs in the Delaware and Midland Basins, respectively, coupled with a 20% increase in completion intensity, positions Callon favorably against industry peers. These improvements can lead to higher margins and better returns on investment.The company's ESG updates, including the reduction of GHG intensity and methane emissions, are also noteworthy. Achieving environmental targets ahead of schedule demonstrates Callon's commitment to responsible operations and could enhance its reputation among investors increasingly focused on sustainability. As the industry moves towards a lower carbon future, Callon's proactive ESG measures could provide a competitive edge and align with investor preferences for environmentally responsible investments. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth quarter results top expectations for production Long-term debt further reduced to $1.9 billion Realized reductions in well costs and gains in well productivity to drive 2024 capital efficiency HOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Callon Petroleum Company (NYSE: CPE) (""Callon"" or the ""Company"") today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial and operating results. Due to the pending merger (the ""Merger"") with APA Corporation (""APA""), Callon will not host a conference call or webcast to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results.

Using SEC prices, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $5.4 billion with an associated PV-10 metric of $5.9 billion (73% PDP)""The steps we took in 2023 to focus on the Permian and improve overall capital efficiency are paying dividends as demonstrated in the fourth quarter. We posted exceptional results, with a sequential production increase and capital spending on target with plan. Our recent operational initiatives, including fit-for-purpose completion designs and artificial lift optimization, generated tangible improvements in well performance and pave the way for sustained uplift in the future,"" said Joe Gatto, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Callon is firing on all cylinders today with a solid capital efficiency trajectory driven by both well productivity and significant reductions in wells costs. Our pending combination with APA will further increase the value proposition for shareholders from an expanded Permian footprint and organization that can drive incremental gains in performance through the application of best practices and technical expertise from both companies."" Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial and Operating Summary Fourth quarter 2023 net income of $169.0 million, or $2.51 per share, (all share amounts are stated on a diluted basis), and adjusted EBITDAX of $325.8 million. Adjusted income was $109.0 million, or $1.62 per share. Fourth quarter production was above the high end of guidance and averaged 103.4 MBoe/d (57% oil and 79% liquids). During the quarter, 14 gross wells were TIL. Notably, cumulative oil production from fourth quarter wells were 51% more productive on a per lateral foot basis in the first 90 days of production (6,848 Bbl / 1,000 lateral ft.) compared to third quarter 2023 wells. Average realized commodity prices during the quarter were $79.05 per Bbl for oil (101% of NYMEX WTI), $20.94 per Bbl for natural gas liquids, and $1.60 per MMBtu for natural gas (55% of NYMEX HH). Total average realized price for the period was $51.54 per Boe on an unhedged basis. Lease operating expense, which includes workover expense, for the quarter was $77.9 million or $8.19 per Boe compared to $73.5 million or $7.85 per Boe in the third quarter of 2023. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $170.5 which was within guidance. Over the course of the second half of 2023, relative to prior activity plans, Callon drilled an incremental nine wells (all to be completed in 2024) and completed roughly 40,000 incremental lateral feet at higher than planned intensities while staying within the original budget guidance. The incremental completions activity was related to an eleven-well project placed on production in Q1 of 2024. Entering 2024, these types of realized efficiency gains have positioned the Company to deliver significantly lower average well costs, including facilities, of approximately $980 per lateral foot in the Delaware Basin (a 19% decrease to 2023 actuals) and $682 per lateral foot in the Midland Basin (a 26% decrease to 2023 actuals). This well cost structure also includes an average 20% increase in completion intensity, or proppant lb/ft, compared to 2023 actuals. These capital cost estimates, which underpin our AFEs currently in process for 2024, are consistent with previously disclosed estimates of per well cost reductions of at least 15% for 2024 versus 2023. Shareholder Returns During the fourth quarter, Callon repurchased 1.3 million shares of common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $32.02 per common share for a total cost of $40.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining authorized repurchase amount under the share repurchase program was $244.5 million; however, Callon is restricted under its merger agreement with APA from share repurchases. Environmental, Social, and Governance (""ESG"") Updates The Company is committed to GHG emission reductions and has made significant progress in its 2023 environmental performance, including reaching its 2024 goals for GHG emissions a year earlier than expected. Highlights of the 2023 program include: Attained corporate 2024 goal of reducing GHG intensity by more than 50% over 2019 levelsReduced methane emissions by more than 80% as compared to 2021 levels to exceed our 2024 goal of methane emissions <0.2% of total gas producedAccelerated achievement of 2024 goal to reduce Callon-controlled flaring to less than 1%2024 Guidance Due to the pending merger with APA, Callon has discontinued providing guidance.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures This news release refers to non-GAAP financial measures such as ""adjusted free cash flow,"" ""adjusted EBITDAX,"" ""adjusted income,"" ""adjusted income per diluted share,"" ""net debt"" and ""PV-10."" These measures, detailed below, are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our filings with the SEC and posted on our website. Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is defined by the Company as net cash provided by operating activities before net change in working capital, changes in accrued hedge settlements, merger, integration and transaction expense, and other income and expense, less capital expenditures before increase (decrease) in accrued capital expenditures. We believe adjusted free cash flow provides useful information to investors because it is a comparable metric against other companies in the industry and is a widely accepted financial indicator of an oil and natural gas company's ability to generate cash for the use of internally funding their capital development program and to service or incur debt. Adjusted free cash flow is not a measure of a company's financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities, or as a measure of liquidity.Callon calculates adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, (gains) losses on derivative instruments excluding net settled derivative instruments, (gain) loss on sale of oil and gas properties, impairment of oil and gas properties, non-cash share-based compensation expense, exploration expense, merger, integration and transaction expense, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, and certain other expenses. Adjusted EBITDAX is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, it should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flow provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDAX provides useful information to investors because it provides additional information with respect to our performance or ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Adjusted income and adjusted income per diluted share are non-GAAP measures that Callon believes are useful to investors because they provide readers with a meaningful measure of our profitability before recording certain items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably determined. These measures exclude the net of tax effects of these items and non-cash valuation adjustments, which are detailed in the reconciliation provided. Adjusted income and adjusted income per diluted share are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Accordingly, neither should be considered as a substitute for net income (loss), operating income (loss), or other income data prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, the Company believes that adjusted income and adjusted income per diluted share provide additional information with respect to our performance. Because adjusted income and adjusted income per diluted share exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted income and adjusted income per diluted share presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.Net debt is a supplemental non-GAAP measure that is defined by the Company as total debt excluding unamortized premiums, discount, and deferred loan costs, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, total debt, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management uses net debt to determine the Company's outstanding debt obligations that would not be readily satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. We believe this metric is useful to analysts and investors in determining the Company's leverage position since the Company has the ability to, and may decide to, use a portion of its cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt.Callon believes that the presentation of PV-10 provides greater comparability when evaluating oil and gas companies due to the many factors unique to each individual company that impact the amount and timing of future income taxes. In addition, we believe that PV-10 is widely used by investors and analysts as a basis for comparing the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other oil and gas companies. PV-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other measure of a company's financial or operating performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Neither PV-10 nor the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows purport to represent the fair value of our proved oil and gas reserves.Adjusted Income and Adjusted EBITDAX.

Returning value to investors through dividend growth and share repurchases. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results from ONEOK, Inc. highlight several key performance indicators that are crucial for evaluating the company's financial health and future prospects. A significant uptick in net income to $688 million and adjusted EBITDA surpassing $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter, along with an impressive 20% increase in Rocky Mountain region NGL raw feed throughput volumes, paints a robust picture of the company's operational efficiency and market position.From a financial perspective, the 17% increase in natural gas volumes processed and the 15% surge in wells connected in the Rocky Mountain region signal strong operational growth, which is likely to bolster investor confidence. The guidance for 2024, with a net income midpoint of $2.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.1 billion, suggests a forward-looking optimism that is underpinned by strategic capital expenditure planning, ranging from $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion.Moreover, the company's strategic moves, such as the Elk Creek Pipeline expansion and the Saguaro Connector Pipeline's Presidential Permit approval, are expected to enhance ONEOK's capacity and market reach. The company's focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to capital growth opportunities, including dividend growth and share repurchases, is indicative of a commitment to shareholder returns.However, it is important to monitor the debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which stands at 3.46 times, to ensure it aligns with industry norms and does not pose a risk to the company's financial stability. The share repurchase program, which is a sign of management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the stock, should be evaluated in the context of the overall capital allocation strategy and its impact on shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The energy sector, particularly the midstream segment where ONEOK operates, is sensitive to both macroeconomic factors and industry-specific trends. The company's record volumes and strong financial performance in 2023, coupled with the positive guidance for 2024, indicate a favorable competitive position within the industry. The increase in throughput volumes and natural gas processing is reflective of a robust demand for energy infrastructure services, which is a positive signal for the industry.Furthermore, the acquisition of Magellan and the subsequent integration synergies demonstrate ONEOK's strategic intent to diversify operations and create a more resilient business model. The projected double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024, due in part to the acquisition, suggests potential benefits from economies of scale and operational efficiencies.The company's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index and its AAA MSCI ESG Rating underscore its commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, which are increasingly important to investors. As ESG factors become more integrated into investment decisions, ONEOK's strong ESG performance could enhance its attractiveness to a broader investor base.It is also essential to consider the impact of regulatory changes and geopolitical events on the energy sector, as these can significantly affect market dynamics and the company's operations. The authorization of the Saguaro Connector Pipeline's Presidential Permit is a critical milestone that can lead to new growth opportunities, but it also highlights the importance of navigating the regulatory landscape effectively. Energy Sector Analyst ONEOK's recent financial results and strategic initiatives must be examined within the context of the broader energy sector. The company's performance in the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast/Permian regions suggests a strong alignment with the ongoing trends in domestic energy production and infrastructure development.The 54% increase in total wells connected indicates aggressive expansion in shale plays, which are a key driver of U.S. energy independence. The focus on expanding the Elk Creek Pipeline and the potential Saguaro Connector Pipeline underscores the strategic importance of enhancing infrastructure to support the growing production of natural gas liquids (NGLs).The company's capital expenditure guidance for 2024, which includes significant projects such as the MB-6 NGL fractionator and West Texas NGL pipeline expansion, reflects a targeted investment approach aimed at reinforcing its core business segments. This approach is crucial in an industry where capital discipline and return on investment are paramount.Additionally, the emphasis on maintaining more than 90% fee-based earnings across several segments provides a degree of revenue predictability and resilience against commodity price volatility. This is particularly relevant in the context of fluctuating oil and gas prices, which can impact margins and profitability.Overall, the company's strategic direction, with a focus on growth through infrastructure expansion and a strong ESG profile, positions it favorably for future challenges and opportunities within the energy sector. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Record Rocky Mountain Region Volumes Announces 2024 Financial Guidance TULSA, Okla., Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ONEOK, Inc.

LINK TO EARNINGS TABLES AND PRESENTATION: https://ir.oneok.com/financial-information/financial-reports NON-GAAP (GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES) FINANCIAL MEASURES: ONEOK has disclosed in this news release adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP financial metric, used to measure the company's financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization, noncash impairment charges, income taxes, noncash compensation expense, and other noncash items; and includes adjusted EBITDA from the company's unconsolidated affiliates using the same recognition and measurement methods used to record equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated affiliates is calculated consistently with the definition above and excludes items such as interest, taxes, depreciation and other noncash items. Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it and similar measures are used by many companies in the industry as a measure of financial performance and is commonly employed by financial analysts and others to evaluate ONEOK's financial performance and to compare the company's financial performance with the performance of other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, this calculation may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is included in the tables. At ONEOK (NYSE: OKE), we deliver energy products and services vital to an advancing world.

The company had a successful 2023 with a return on equity of 10% and plans for increased private market transaction activity in 2024. Positive FSK declares a distribution of $0.70 per share for the first quarter of 2024, combined with a special distribution for a total of $0.75 per share. Financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, include net investment income of $0.71 per share, adjusted net investment income of $0.75 per share, net asset value of $24.46 per share, total net realized and unrealized loss of $0.39 per share, and earnings per share of $0.32. The company reported total purchases of $680 million versus $664 million of sales and repayments for the quarter, with a net debt to equity ratio of 113% as of December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, FSK had net investment income of $3.18 per share, adjusted net investment income of $3.11 per share, total net realized and unrealized loss of $0.70 per share, and paid cash distributions to stockholders totaling $2.95 per share. CEO Michael C. Forman highlighted a successful 2023 with a return on equity of 10% and plans for increased private market transaction activity in 2024, expecting distributions to total a minimum of $2.90 per share. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent declaration by FS KKR Capital Corp. of a first quarter 2024 distribution of $0.70 per share, alongside a special distribution, culminating in a $0.75 per share payout, is a notable event for investors and market analysts. This distribution announcement is particularly significant when juxtaposed with the company's net investment income reporting a decrease from $0.84 to $0.71 per share quarter-over-quarter. The decrease in net investment income and net asset value, from $24.89 to $24.46 per share, suggests that FSK may be experiencing some underlying portfolio challenges, possibly due to the inflationary pressures and a higher interest rate environment as stated by the CEO.Moreover, the company's net debt to equity ratio increased slightly from 110% to 113%, which indicates a higher leverage position. While this may not be alarming in isolation, it warrants attention as it could impact the company's financial flexibility in adverse market conditions. The total net realized and unrealized loss of $0.39 per share further underscores potential volatility in the investment portfolio. Investors should consider these factors in the context of the company's overall performance and risk management strategies. Market Research Analyst The strategic commentary provided by the CEO, Michael C. Forman, sheds light on the company's portfolio rotation strategy and its forward-looking stance on private market transaction activity. The projection of a minimum of $2.90 per share in distributions for 2024 signals a commitment to shareholder returns. This forward guidance could be a positive signal for investors, reflecting management's confidence in the company's ability to maintain or increase its distribution levels despite the challenges faced in the previous quarter.The mention of KKR's experienced workout team suggests that the company is proactively addressing the challenges faced by some portfolio companies. The effectiveness of these workout strategies could be a critical factor in the company's ability to sustain performance and deliver on its distribution promises. The role of private equity expertise in managing and turning around portfolio companies is a key element that can differentiate FSK's performance in a competitive market. Economist FSK's financial results and distribution declarations must be contextualized within the broader economic environment of inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. These macroeconomic factors can affect the performance of investment portfolios, especially those with exposure to variable-rate debt instruments or companies sensitive to economic cycles. The company's acknowledgment of these pressures indicates a realistic appraisal of the external challenges that could impact its portfolio companies.Furthermore, the increase in private market transaction activity anticipated for 2024 could be indicative of a shift in investor sentiment or a search for yield in a potentially stabilizing economic environment. The ability of FSK to navigate this landscape and capitalize on transactional opportunities will be critical in maintaining its distribution levels and achieving the projected annual return on equity. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Declares First Quarter 2024 Distribution of $0.70 per share, Which When Combined with the Company's Previously Declared $0.05 per share Special Distribution, Results in a Total First Quarter Distribution of $0.75 per share PHILADELPHIA and NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FS KKR Capital Corp.

FSK uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing financial results and believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends and in comparing FSK's financial results with other BDCs. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures, and should be read only in conjunction with FSK's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures(1) Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 GAAP net investment income per share $0.71 $0.84 Accretion resulting from merger accounting ($0.03) ($0.04) Excise Taxes $0.07 — Adjusted net investment income per share(2) $0.75 $0.80 GAAP Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) per share ($0.39) $0.11 Unrealized appreciation from merger accounting $0.03 $0.04 Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain(2) ($0.36) $0.14 Year Ended December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 GAAP net investment income per share $3.18 $3.05 Accretion resulting from merger accounting ($0.14) ($0.19) Excise Taxes $0.07 $0.07 Adjusted net investment income per share(2) $3.11 $2.93 GAAP Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) per share ($0.70) ($2.73) Unrealized appreciation from merger accounting $0.14 $0.19 Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain(2) ($0.56) ($2.54) 1) Per share data was derived by using the weighted average shares of FSK's common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Per share numbers may not sum due to rounding. 2) Adjusted net investment income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net investment income is presented for all periods as GAAP net investment income excluding (i) the accrual for the capital gains incentive fee for realized and unrealized gains; (ii) excise taxes (iii) the impact of accretion resulting from merger accounting; and (iv) certain non-recurring operating expenses that are one-time in nature and are not representative of ongoing operating expenses incurred during FSK's normal course of business. FSK uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally in analyzing financial results and believes that the use of this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends and in comparing its financial results with other business development companies. Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted net realized and unrealized gain is presented for all periods as GAAP realized and unrealized gains to exclude the impact of the merger accounting. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP net investment income to adjusted net investment income and GAAP net realized and unrealized gain to adjusted net realized and unrealized gain can be found above. 3) Net debt to equity ratio is debt outstanding, net of cash and foreign currency and net payable/receivable for investments purchased/sold and repaid, divided by net assets. 4) The per share data for distributions reflects the amount of distributions paid per share of our common stock to stockholders of record during each applicable period. 5) See FSK's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for important information, including information related to the calculation and definition of weighted average annual yield on accruing debt investments, weighted average annual yield on all debt investments, variable rate debt investments, fixed rate debt investments, other income producing investments and non-income producing investments. 6) Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. See FSK's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of FSK's revenue recognition policy. 7) Does not include investments on non-accrual status.

Decrease in operating income compared to Q4 2022. Subdued demand in the North Sea due to COVID-19-related delays. Financial Analyst The reported financials of KNOT Offshore Partners LP indicate a mixed performance in Q4 2023. While the total revenues have remained relatively stable, the shift from a net income in Q3 to a net loss in Q4 is noteworthy. The operating income has seen a marginal decrease, which could be attributed to increased vessel operating expenses. This situation is not unusual in the shipping industry, where costs can fluctuate based on operational and market factors. The Adjusted EBITDA remains robust, suggesting that the company is maintaining operational profitability before considering interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.From a liquidity perspective, the company has a healthy cash position, which is critical for managing its short-term obligations. However, the outstanding debt and upcoming balloon repayments present significant financial obligations that the company must address. The interest rate swap agreements indicate a proactive approach to managing interest rate risk, which is prudent given the variable rate borrowings and the current economic environment where interest rates are subject to volatility.Overall, stakeholders should be aware of the company's efforts to secure new charters and its strategic positioning in the Brazilian market, which may have long-term benefits. However, the immediate financial challenges, including managing debt and maintaining vessel utilization rates, require careful monitoring. Market Research Analyst The shuttle tanker market, particularly in Brazil, is a critical factor for KNOT Offshore Partners LP. The company's focus on this market is justified, given the increasing charter rates and demand driven by offshore oil production. The mention of Petrobras' high production levels and new FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) start-ups supports the notion of a tightening market, which could lead to more favorable charter terms in the future.However, the North Sea market's slower rebalancing presents a contrast and suggests geographical diversification in the company's operations. The strategic extension of existing charters and the pursuit of new contracts are positive signs for the company's ability to sustain revenue streams. The fleet utilization rates exceeding 99% for scheduled operations signal strong operational efficiency, which is a positive indicator for potential clients and investors.The newbuild orders by Knutsen NYK and other operators, backed by charters in Brazil, reflect industry confidence in the medium to long-term demand for shuttle tankers. This could indicate a favorable outlook for KNOT Offshore Partners LP, given their significant presence in this sector. However, the impact of new vessel deliveries on supply dynamics must be considered, as an oversupply could pressure rates and utilization. Energy Sector Analyst In the context of the energy sector, KNOT Offshore Partners LP's operations are closely tied to the offshore oil production industry. The Brazilian pre-salt fields are particularly important due to their high yield and the requirement for shuttle tankers. The company's anticipation of market tightening in Brazil suggests a strategic alignment with the projected growth in offshore oil production.The age of the fleet and the remaining contracted forward revenue are important metrics for assessing the company's future prospects. An average fleet age of 9.7 years is relatively moderate, suggesting that the company's vessels are not excessively aged, which can be an advantage in terms of reliability and operating costs. The contracted revenue provides visibility on future cash flows, which is a positive sign for financial stability.It's also worth noting the potential for acquisitions from Knutsen NYK, which could expand the company's fleet and enhance its market position. However, the success of these acquisitions would depend on the approval of the Conflicts Committee, which introduces an element of uncertainty. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM ABERDEEN, Scotland--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Financial Highlights For the three months ended December 31, 2023 (“Q4 2023”), KNOT Offshore Partners LP (“KNOT Offshore Partners” or the “Partnership”): Generated total revenues of $73.0 million, operating income of $18.1 million and net loss of $5.3 million. Generated Adjusted EBITDA1 of $45.7 million Reported $63.9 million in available liquidity at December 31, 2023, which was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $63.9 million. Other Partnership Highlights and Events Fleet operated with 99.6% utilization for scheduled operations in Q4 2023, and 96.0% utilization taking into account the scheduled drydockings of the Torill Knutsen and the Ingrid Knutsen, which were carried out during Q4 2023. On January 16, 2024, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.026 per common unit with respect to Q4 2023, which was paid on February 8, 2024, to all common unitholders of record on January 29, 2024. On the same day, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution to holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Units (“Series A Preferred Units”) with respect to Q4 2023 in an aggregate amount of $1.7 million. On January 9, 2024, an extension to the existing bareboat charter party for the Dan Sabia was signed with Transpetro, extending the vessel’s fixed employment to early June 2024. On December 15, 2023, Repsol Sinopec exercised its extension option to the existing time charter for the Carmen Knutsen extending the vessel’s fixed employment to mid-January 2025. A further 1 year’s option remains available to Repsol. On December 15, 2023, the Partnership received the Dan Cisne back via redelivery, following expiry of its bareboat charter party to Transpetro. The Dan Cisne is being assessed for shuttle tanker operation in the North Sea and has also been deployed on short-term conventional tanker contracts in Europe. The Hilda Knutsen, Torill Knutsen and Bodil Knutsen each continued to operate on separate time charter contracts with a subsidiary of the Partnership’s sponsor, Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS (“Knutsen NYK”), at a reduced charter rate. On January 2, 2024, these rolling monthly contracts were extended to January 2025 (in the cases of the Hilda Knutsen and the Torill Knutsen) and March 2024 for the Bodil Knutsen, to terminate in time for delivery to Equinor. The Partnership continues to market the Hilda Knutsen, Torill Knutsen, Dan Cisne and Dan Sabia for new, third-party employment and is in active discussions with both existing charterers and others, including Knutsen NYK. On November 2, 2023, the Partnership entered into an at-the-market sales agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Partnership may offer and sell up to $100 million of common units (the “ATM program”), from time to time, through the Agent. This new sales agreement replaces and supersedes the prior sales agreement with the Agent entered into on August 26, 2021. Derek Lowe, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of KNOT Offshore Partners LP, stated, “We are pleased to report another strong performance in Q4 2023, marked by safe operation at over 99% fleet utilization for scheduled operations, along with consistent revenue and operating income. 1 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures used by management and external users of the Partnership’s financial statements. Please see Appendix A for definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Including those contracts signed since December 31, 2023, we now have 79% of charter coverage in 2024 from fixed contracts, which rises to 91% if charterers’ options are exercised. Having executed a number of new contracts, we remain focused on filling the remaining gaps in our charter portfolio. In Brazil, the main offshore oil market where we operate, the outlook is continuing to improve, with robust demand and increasing charter rates. Driven by Petrobras’ continued high production levels and FPSO start-ups in the pre-salt fields that rely upon shuttle tankers, we believe the world’s biggest shuttle tanker market is tightening materially. Our secondary geography, in the North Sea, is taking longer to re-balance, where we anticipate progressive improvement during and beyond 2024. We are aware that Knutsen NYK has recently ordered three new shuttle tankers with delivery over 2026-2027; and we note recent reports of another operator ordering three new shuttle tankers, with delivery by early 2027. We anticipate that all these new orders are backed by charters to clients in Brazil, and see this as a sign of confidence in the medium-long term demand for the global shuttle tanker fleet. These new orders bring anticipated deliveries to a total of eleven within the coming three years. While delivery of these orders will add to the supply of vessels into the global shuttle tanker fleet, we continue to believe that growth of offshore oil production in shuttle tanker-serviced fields across both Brazil and the North Sea is on track to outpace shuttle tanker supply growth in the coming years, particularly as increasing numbers of shuttle tankers reach or exceed typical retirement age. As the largest owner and operator of shuttle tankers (together with our sponsor, Knutsen NYK), we believe we are well positioned to benefit from such an improving charter market. We remain focused on generating certainty and stability of cashflows from long-term employment with high quality counterparties, and are confident that continued operational performance and execution of our strategy can create unitholder value in the quarters and years ahead.” Financial Results Overview Results for Q4 2023 (compared to those for the three months ended September 30, 2023 (“Q3 2023”)) included: Revenues of $73.0 million in Q4 2023 ($72.7 million in Q3 2023), with the increase due to loss of hire insurance recoveries in Q4 2023. Vessel operating expenses of $25.5 million in Q4 2023 ($23.2 million in Q3 2023), with the increase due to higher costs for supplies, equipment and repairs. Depreciation of $27.6 million in Q4 2023 ($27.5 million in Q3 2023). General and administrative expenses of $1.6 million in Q4 2023 ($1.1 million in Q3 2023). Operating income consequently of $18.1 million in Q4 2023 ($20.6 million in Q3 2023). Interest expense of $18.1 million in Q4 2023 ($18.5 million in Q3 2023) with the decrease due to outstanding debt decreasing and lower fluctuations in interest rates. Realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments of $4.8 million in Q4 2023 (gain of $4.4 million in Q3 2023), including unrealized loss (i.e. non-cash) elements of $8.9 million in Q4 2023 (gain of $0.5 million in Q3 2023). Net loss consequently of $5.3 million in Q4 2023 (net income of $12.6 million in Q3 2023). By comparison with the three months ended December 31, 2022 (“Q4 2022”), results for Q4 2023 included: a decrease of $1.5 million in operating income (to $18.1 million in Q4 2023 from $19.6 million in Q4 2022), driven primarily by higher vessel operating expenses; an increase of $9.1 million in finance expense (to finance expense of $22.3 million in Q4 2023 from finance expense of $13.2 million in Q4 2022), due to fluctuations in interest rates; and a decrease of $11.3 million in net income (to a net loss of $5.3 million in Q4 2023 from net income of $6.0 million in Q4 2022). Fleet utilization The Partnership’s vessels operated throughout Q4 2023 with 99.6% utilization for scheduled operations, and 96.0% utilization taking into account the scheduled drydockings of the Torill Knutsen and the Ingrid Knutsen, which were offhire for 23 days and 33 days respectively in Q4 2023. Financing and Liquidity As of December 31, 2023, the Partnership had $63.9 million in available liquidity, which was comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $63.9 million. The Partnership’s revolving credit facilities are fully drawn and mature between August 2025 and November 2025. The Partnership’s total interest-bearing obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2023 were $963.0 million ($956.8 million net of debt issuance costs). The average margin paid on the Partnership’s outstanding debt during Q4 2023 was approximately 2.28% over SOFR. These obligations are repayable as follows: (U.S. Dollars in thousands) Sale & Leaseback Period repayment Balloon repayment Total 2024 $ 13,805 $ 76,650 $ 63,393 $ 153,848 2025 14,399 68,581 181,583 269,563 2026 15,060 51,596 219,521 286,177 2027 15,751 26,481 — 42,232 2028 and thereafter 119,120 13,241 78,824 211,185 Total $ 178,135 $ 236,549 $ 548,321 $ 963,005 As of December 31, 2023, the Partnership had entered into various interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount outstanding of $426.5 million, to hedge against the interest rate risks of its variable rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, the Partnership receives interest based on SOFR and pays a weighted average interest rate of 1.9% under its interest rate swap agreements, which have an average maturity of approximately 1.8 years. The Partnership does not apply hedge accounting for derivative instruments, and its financial results are impacted by changes in the market value of such financial instruments. As of December 31, 2023, the Partnership’s net exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations was approximately $294.5 million based on total interest-bearing contractual obligations of $963.0 million, less the Raquel Knutsen and Torill Knutsen sale and leaseback facilities of $178.1 million, less interest rate swaps of $426.5 million, and less cash and cash equivalents of $63.9 million. On January 9, 2024, the loan facility secured by the Dan Sabia was repaid in full with a $10.4 million payment. The Dan Sabia and the Dan Cisne are now debt-free and there are no plans to incur additional borrowings secured by these vessels until such time as the Partnership has better visibility on the vessels’ future employment. In May 2024, the loan facility secured by the Hilda Knutsen is due for repayment, for which the balloon repayment is $57 million. Negotiations are well-advanced with potential lenders for a new facility, to be secured also by the Hilda Knutsen, sufficient to finance the balloon repayment of the maturing facility. Management believe that such facility will be refinanced on acceptable and similar terms prior to maturity. However, there can be no guarantees of the success of any financing exercise. On November 2, 2023, the Partnership entered into an at-the-market sales agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. for a new ATM program pursuant to which the Partnership may offer and sell up to $100 million of common units from time to time, through the Agent. This new sales agreement replaces and supersedes the prior sales agreement with the Agent entered into on August 26, 2021, which had provided for a $100 million at-the-market offering program for our common units. The Partnership intends to use the net proceeds of any sales of offered units for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of indebtedness or the funding of acquisitions or other capital expenditures. Assets Owned by Knutsen NYK Pursuant to the omnibus agreement the Partnership entered into with Knutsen NYK at the time of its initial public offering, the Partnership has the option to acquire from Knutsen NYK any offshore shuttle tankers that Knutsen NYK acquires or owns that are employed under charters for periods of five or more years. There can be no assurance that the Partnership will acquire any additional vessels from Knutsen NYK. Given the relationship between the Partnership and Knutsen NYK, any such acquisition would be subject to the approval of the Conflicts Committee of the Partnership’s Board of Directors. Knutsen NYK owns, or has ordered, the following vessels and has entered into the following charters: 1. In February 2021, Tuva Knutsen was delivered to Knutsen NYK from the yard and commenced on a five-year time charter contract with a wholly owned subsidiary of the French oil major TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies has options to extend the charter for up to a further ten years. 2. In November 2021, Live Knutsen was delivered to Knutsen NYK from the yard in China and commenced on a five-year time charter contract with Galp Sinopec for operation in Brazil. Galp has options to extend the charter for up to a further six years. 3. In June 2022, Daqing Knutsen was delivered to Knutsen NYK from the yard in China and commenced on a five-year time charter contract with PetroChina International (America) Inc for operation in Brazil. The charterer has options to extend the charter for up to a further five years. 4. In July 2022, Frida Knutsen was delivered to Knutsen NYK from the yard in Korea and commenced in December 2022 on a seven-year time charter contact with Eni for operation in North Sea. The charterer has options to extend the charter for up to a further three years. 5. In August 2022, Sindre Knutsen, was delivered to Knutsen NYK from the yard in Korea and commenced in September 2023 on a five-year time charter contract with Eni for operation in the North Sea. The charterer has options to extend the charter for up to a further five years. 6. In May 2022, Knutsen NYK entered into a new ten-year time charter contract with Petrobras for a vessel to be constructed and which will operate in Brazil where the charterer has the option to extend the charter by up to five further years. The vessel will be built in China and is expected to be delivered in late 2024. 7. In November 2022, Knutsen NYK entered into a new fifteen-year time charter contract with Petrobras for a vessel to be constructed and which will operate in Brazil where the charterer has an option to extend the charter by up to five further years. The vessel will be built in China and is expected to be delivered in late 2025. 8. In February 2024, Knutsen NYK entered into a new ten-year time charter contract with Petrobras for each of three vessels to be constructed and which will operate in Brazil, where the charterer has an option to extend each charter by up to five further years. The vessels will be built in China and are expected to be delivered over 2026 - 2027. Outlook At December 31, 2023, the Partnership’s fleet of eighteen vessels had an average age of 9.7 years, and the Partnership had charters with an average remaining fixed duration of 2.0 years, with the charterers of the Partnership’s vessels having options to extend their charters by an additional 2.1 years on average. The Partnership had $699 million of remaining contracted forward revenue at December 31, 2023, excluding charterers’ options and excluding contracts agreed or signed after that date. The market for shuttle tankers in Brazil, where fourteen of our vessels have been operating, has continued to tighten in Q4 2023, driven by a significant pipeline of new production growth over the coming years, a limited newbuild order book, and typical long-term project viability requiring a Brent oil price of only $35 per barrel. While the Dan Cisne and Dan Sabia stand out among the Partnership’s fleet as being of a smaller size than is optimal in today’s Brazilian market, we remain in discussions with our customers and continue to evaluate all our options for the Dan Cisne and Dan Sabia vessels, including but not limited to redeployment in the tightening Brazilian market, deployment to the North Sea, charter to Knutsen NYK (subject to negotiation and approvals) and sale. Shuttle tanker demand in the North Sea has remained subdued, driven by the impact of COVID-19-related project delays. We expect these conditions to persist for several more quarters until new oil production projects that are anticipated come on stream. Looking ahead, based on supply and demand factors with significant forward visibility and committed capital from industry participants, we believe that the overall medium and long-term outlook for the shuttle tanker market remains favourable. In the meantime, the Partnership intends to pursue long-term visibility from its charter contracts, build its liquidity, and position itself to benefit from its market-leading position in an improving shuttle tanker market. The Partnership’s financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in this press release is preliminary and unaudited and is subject to change in connection with the completion of the Partnership’s year end close procedure and further financial review, Actual results may differ as a result of the completion of the Partnership’s year end closing procedures, review adjustment and other developments that may arise between now and the time the audit for the year ended December 31, 2023 is finalized.

APPENDIX A—RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation, impairments, taxes and other financial items (including other finance expenses, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments and net gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions). EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as the Partnership’s lenders, to assess its financial and operating performance and compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions contained in its financing agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess the Partnership’s financial and operating performance. The Partnership believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA assist its management and investors by increasing the comparability of its performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in its industry that provide EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA information. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, taxes, impairments and depreciation, as applicable, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. The Partnership believes that including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as financial measures benefits investors in (a) selecting between investing in the Partnership and other investment alternatives and (b) monitoring the Partnership’s ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or any other indicator of Partnership performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. The table below reconciles EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

The company introduced PowerBuddy™, an AI-powered virtual assistant for personalized education guidance. PowerSchool's CEO, Hardeep Gulati, highlighted the company's momentum and growth in 2023. Negative None. Financial Analyst PowerSchool Holdings, Inc.'s recent financial results demonstrate a robust performance with a 13% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenue and an 11% increase for the full year. Notably, the company's Adjusted EBITDA growth outpaces revenue growth, which could indicate improving operational efficiency and cost management. The consistent figure of 33% of total revenue for both Q4 and the full year suggests a stable margin, which is a positive signal for investors. However, the reported GAAP net loss highlights the need to understand the underlying expenses and investments that are impacting profitability.Furthermore, the 18% increase in ARR suggests a strong and growing base of recurring revenue, a key metric for the stability and predictability of future earnings. The Net Revenue Retention Rate of 106.7% indicates that existing customers are spending more year-over-year, which is a testament to the company's ability to expand its relationships with current clients. The acquisition of Allovue could potentially expand PowerSchool's product offerings and drive future revenue growth. However, investors should monitor how this acquisition is integrated and contributes to the company's overall financial performance. Market Research Analyst The K-12 educational technology sector is experiencing significant growth, driven by the increasing adoption of digital solutions for school management and learning. PowerSchool's cross-sell and new logo transactions, including contracts with large districts such as Los Angeles Unified and Miami Dade Public Schools, underscore the company's competitive positioning within this expanding market. The introduction of AI-driven solutions like PowerSchool PowerBuddy™ is indicative of the company's commitment to innovation and could represent a competitive edge as educational institutions seek more advanced, personalized tools.As PowerSchool continues to expand its platform, including the acquisition of Allovue, it is essential to assess the company's ability to integrate new technologies and maintain a high level of service without incurring prohibitive costs. The K-12 market's sensitivity to budget constraints and the need for proven ROI on educational expenditures mean that PowerSchool's value proposition must remain compelling for sustained growth. The company's focus on operational efficiencies and teacher effectiveness aligns with industry demands, potentially reinforcing its market leadership. Educational Technology Expert PowerSchool's recent financial performance and business developments suggest a strategic focus on leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance the educational experience. The launch of PowerBuddy™, an AI-powered virtual assistant, exemplifies the trend towards personalized learning and administrative efficiency in educational technology. This innovation could potentially reshape interactions between students, educators and administrators, fostering a more supportive and efficient educational environment.PowerSchool's platform expansion through the acquisition of Allovue aligns with the broader industry movement towards data-driven decision-making in education. Allovue's budgeting and analytics tools are critical for school districts that are increasingly looking for ways to optimize resource allocation and ensure equitable funding. The integration of such financial planning tools into PowerSchool's suite of services could enhance the company's overall value proposition and help solidify its position as a comprehensive provider of educational technology solutions. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Fourth quarter total revenue increased 13% year-over-year to $182.1 million, meeting outlook Full year total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $697.7 million, meeting outlook Fourth quarter GAAP net loss was $18.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year-over-year to $59.4 million, exceeding outlook and representing 33% of total revenue Full year GAAP net loss was $39.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $231.9 million, exceeding outlook and representing 33% of total revenue ARR* increased 18% over the prior year to $701.5 million as of December 31, 2023 FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PowerSchool Holdings, Inc.

The Company is unable to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net loss without unreasonable efforts because the Company is currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact net income (loss) for these periods but would not impact Adjusted EBITDA. Such items include stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired intangible assets, severance, and other items. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on net income (loss). The foregoing financial outlook reflects the Company’s expectations as of today's date. Given the number of risk factors, uncertainties, and assumptions discussed below, actual results may differ materially. The Company does not intend to update its financial outlook until its next quarterly results announcement. Important disclosures in this earnings release about and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures are provided below under “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Conference Call Details PowerSchool will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results on February 26, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harder provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any statements made in this press release that are not statements of historical fact, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements and should be evaluated as such. Forward-looking statements are not assurances of future performance and may include information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations, including our financial outlook and descriptions of our business plan and strategies. Forward-looking statements are based on PowerSchool management’s beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “can have,” “likely,” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. Factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: potential effects on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic; our history of cumulative losses; competition; our ability to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis and the extent to which existing customers renew and upgrade their subscriptions; our ability to sustain and expand revenues, maintain profitability, and to effectively manage our anticipated growth; our ability to retain, hire, and integrate skilled personnel including our senior management team; our ability to identify acquisition targets and to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses; our ability to maintain and expand our strategic relationships with third parties, including with state and local government entities; the seasonality of our sales and customer growth; our reliance on third-party software and intellectual property licenses; our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce intellectual property protection for our current and future solutions; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches or other cyber-attacks or other disruptions; and the other factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Annual Report”), filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Copies of the Annual Report may be obtained from the Company or the SEC. We caution you that the factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. All forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, to reflect future events, future developments or circumstances, or new information. Definitions of Certain Key Business Metrics Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) ARR represents the annualized value of all recurring contracts as of the end of the period. ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term, one-time discounts given to help customers meet their budgetary and cash flow needs, and the sales mix for recurring and non-recurring revenue. We record ARR at the time a customer purchases a new product or renews an existing product, and at a value that represents the contracted annual recurring revenue value excluding any granted one-time discounts. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast, and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers. Net Revenue Retention Rate (“NRR”) We believe that our ability to retain and grow recurring revenues from our existing customers over time strengthens the stability and predictability of our revenue base and is reflective of the value we deliver to them through upselling and cross selling our solution portfolio. Typically, our customer agreements are sold on a three-year basis with one-year rolling renewals and annual price escalators. These annual renewal processes provide us an additional opportunity to upsell and cross sell additional products. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as Net Revenue Retention Rate (“NRR”). For the purposes of calculating NRR, we exclude from our calculation of NRR any changes in ARR attributable to Intersect customers, as this product is sold through our channel partnership with EAB Global, Inc. and is pursuant to annual revenue minimums, therefore the business will not be managed based on NRR. We calculate our dollar-based NRR as of the end of a reporting period as follows: Numerator. We measure ARR from renewed and new sale opportunities booked as of the last day of the current reporting period from customers with associated ARR as of the last day of the prior year comparative reporting period. Denominator. We measure, as of the last day of the current reporting period, the last twelve months of ARR that was scheduled for renewal. The quotient obtained from this calculation is our dollar-based net revenue retention rate. Our NRR provides insight into the impact on current year recurring revenues of expanding adoption of our solutions by our existing customers during the current period. Our NRR is subject to adjustments for acquisitions, consolidations, spin-offs, and other market activity. Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for analytical and supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Gross Profit: Adjusted Gross Profit is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not made under GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to gross profit, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted for depreciation, share-based compensation expense and the related employer payroll tax, restructuring and acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized product development costs. We use Adjusted Gross Profit to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit is a useful measure to us and to our investors because it provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metric generally eliminates the effects of the variability of depreciation, share-based compensation, restructuring expense, acquisition-related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangibles and capitalized product development costs from period to period, which may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. We believe that the use of this measure enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA: Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that are not made under GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income (loss), GAAP cost of revenue, and GAAP operating expenses, as applicable. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense and the related employer payroll tax, management fees, restructuring expense, and acquisition-related expenses. We define Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue and Operating Expenses as their respective GAAP measures adjusted for share-based compensation expense and the related employer payroll tax, management fees, restructuring expense, and acquisition-related expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for all of the above items, net interest expense, nonrecurring litigation expense, and provision for (benefit from) income tax. We use Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Cost of Revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, and Adjusted EBITDA to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods and, when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, help provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow: Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are supplemental measures of liquidity that are not made under GAAP and that do not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized product development costs. We define Unlevered Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow plus cash paid for interest on outstanding debt. We believe that Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are useful indicators of liquidity that provide information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our operations inclusive of that used for investments in property and equipment and capitalized product development costs as well as cash paid for interest on outstanding debt. These non-GAAP financial measures have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a replacement for their respective comparable financial measures, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

The company aims to return to growth in 2024 with revenue guidance of $840 to $860 million, showcasing 1% to 3% annual growth over 2023. Positive Delivered revenue and earnings in line with recent guidance Demonstrated disciplined cost control during 2H23 resulting in lowest SEA expenses in 4Q23 Generated strong cash from operations of $33.7 million in 4Q23 Paid down $19.7 million of total debt in 4Q23, the second sequential quarterly reduction Establishing 2024 revenue guidance of approximately $840 to $860 million, or 1% to 3% annual growth over 2023 Negative Gross profit and margin declined due to lower volume and restructuring costs Operating income and net income saw significant declines Diluted EPS and Non-GAAP EPS dropped substantially compared to the previous year Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 330 basis points compared to the year ago period Financial Analyst Helios Technologies' financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicate a mixed performance with revenue and earnings meeting guidance but showing a decline from the previous year. The revenue dip of 1% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, alongside a gross margin contraction of 360 basis points for the quarter and 240 basis points for the year, suggest a challenging operating environment. The company's ability to generate the highest cash from operations for the year in 4Q23, however, reflects strong working capital management and cash conversion capabilities. This is underscored by their ability to pay down $19.7 million in debt during the quarter, demonstrating a commitment to reducing leverage. Looking ahead, Helios' guidance for 2024 indicates a return to growth, albeit modest, with projected revenue growth of 1% to 3%. This suggests confidence in their strategic investments and cost management practices. However, the anticipated annual growth rate is relatively low, potentially signaling cautious optimism in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Investors may view the disciplined approach to cost control and the focus on debt reduction as positive signs for margin improvement and balance sheet strength in the long term. Market Research Analyst Helios Technologies' recent acquisitions, including Schultes and i3, are strategic moves aimed at filling product solution gaps and enhancing their offering. The acquisitions' incremental expenses have been absorbed without significantly impacting SEA expenses, showcasing effective cost management. The 7% revenue improvement in the Electronics segment, primarily in Health & Wellness, is a bright spot that may reflect well on the company's ability to navigate and capitalize on shifting market demands. Geographically, the sales performance shows a mixed picture with growth in the Americas but declines in EMEA and APAC regions. The company's ability to grow in the Americas despite broader market contractions could be indicative of strong regional strategies or market share gains. However, the declines in EMEA and APAC may raise concerns about competitive pressures or regional economic headwinds. The supply chain constraints delaying an estimated $7.4 million in sales highlight ongoing industry challenges but also a potential for future revenue recovery as these issues are resolved. Economist The results from Helios Technologies reflect broader macroeconomic headwinds that have affected many industries, including manufacturing. The gross profit decline can be partly attributed to higher wage and benefit costs, which are consistent with inflationary pressures and a tighter labor market. Additionally, the operating margin contraction is a clear indicator of the cost pressures the company has faced. Helios' focus on operational efficiency and cost control measures, such as SEA expense reductions, is a direct response to these economic challenges. The company's outlook for 2024, with a focus on profitable sales growth and operational leverage, suggests a strategic pivot towards efficiency and a leaner cost structure in anticipation of continued economic uncertainty. The emphasis on working capital improvement initiatives and debt reduction aligns with a conservative financial strategy that prioritizes liquidity and balance sheet health, which is prudent in an uncertain economic climate. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Delivered revenue and earnings in line with recent guidance; revenue of $193.4 million in 4Q23 and $835.6 million for FY23 Demonstrated disciplined cost control during 2H23 resulting in 4Q23 SEA expenses at the lowest quarterly level in FY23 even while absorbing incremental expenses from acquisitions in 1H23 Generated strong cash from operations of $33.7 million in 4Q23, the highest quarter of the year demonstrating disciplined working capital management and strong cash conversion Paid down $19.7 million of total debt in 4Q23, the second sequential quarterly reduction; maximizing debt paydown remains a capital allocation priority in 2024 Expect return to growth in 2024 leveraging value from the methodical investments made; combined with disciplined cost management and operational efficiencies to elevate our profitability levels Establishing 2024 revenue guidance of approximately $840 to $860 million, or 1% to 3% annual growth over 2023; excluding potential system sales opportunities SARASOTA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Helios Technologies, Inc.

Nevertheless, Helios believes that providing these specific Non-GAAP figures are important for investors and other readers of Helios financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Helios management to better understand operating performance. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP. Please carefully review the attached Non-GAAP reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the related additional information provided throughout. Because these metrics are Non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, these figures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. Sales Changes in Market Mix: Electronics segment revenue improved 7% primarily in Health & Wellness compared with the year ago period helping to offset the 5% decline in Hydraulics which was spread across several end markets we serve. Compared with third quarter 2023, Hydraulics segment revenue remained relatively stable with 1% improvement while the Electronics segment was down 14% driven by macroeconomic shifts. Sales included $9.4 million in revenue from acquisitions. (See the Organic and Acquired Revenue table in this release that provides acquired revenue by segment by quarter). By Region: Sales in the Americas were up by 4% while there was a 10% decline in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and a 5% decline in Asia Pacific (""APAC”) compared to the year ago period. Other Impacts: Favorable foreign currency (FX) translation was $1.7 million. Supply chain constraints delayed an estimated $7.4 million in sales, which has leveled back to a more normalized operating range. Profits and margins Gross profit and margin impacts: Gross profit declined primarily on lower volume, restructuring costs, higher wage and benefit costs, partially offset by acquisitions and pricing. Gross margin contraction was primarily due to under absorption of overhead on lower volume and unfavorable mix. Selling, engineering and administrative (“SEA”) expenses: SEA sequentially were down $2.5 million, or 7%, and up less than 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 despite absorbing higher run-rate SEA from 1H23 acquisitions. The sequential decrease was primarily related to cost control measures deployed during 2H23. Amortization of intangible assets: $8.2 million up 9% compared with the prior year period reflecting the Company’s flywheel acquisitions. Non-operating items Net interest expense: down $0.1 million sequentially due to total debt reduction of 4% compared to the third quarter of 2023; and up $3.6 million in the quarter compared with the prior year period, reflecting higher interest rates and increased average net debt balance related to the debt financing of 1H23 acquisitions. Effective tax rate: 23.3% compared with (2.3%) in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 23.8% for full year 2023 compared with 19.2% in the year ago period reflecting the mix in income to various tax jurisdictions with a state tax benefit in 2022. Net income, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), Non-GAAP EPS, and adjusted EBITDA margin GAAP net income and diluted EPS: $3.3 million and $0.10 diluted EPS. Diluted Non-GAAP EPS: $0.38 compared with $0.78 in the fourth quarter of 2022 primarily the result of lower volume, compressed margins on lost absorption, and increased interest expense (of $0.08 per share), taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin: 16.7% contracted 330 basis points compared with the year ago period driven by the items discussed previously in this report. Hydraulics Segment Review (Refer to sales by geographic region and segment data in accompanying tables) ($ in millions) (Unaudited) Hydraulics For the Three Months Ended December 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change % Change Net Sales Americas $ 60.2 $ 56.8 $ 3.4 6 % EMEA 38.1 43.3 (5.2 ) (12 %) APAC 35.4 40.1 (4.7 ) (12 %) Total Segment Sales $ 133.7 $ 140.2 $ (6.5 ) (5 %) Gross Profit $ 41.2 $ 48.6 $ (7.4 ) (15 %) Gross Margin 30.8 % 34.7 % (390 ) bps SEA Expenses $ 21.2 $ 18.0 $ 3.2 18 % Operating Income $ 20.0 $ 30.6 $ (10.6 ) (35 %) Operating Margin 15.0 % 21.8 % (680 ) bps Fourth Quarter Hydraulics Segment Review Sales: Grew 6% in the Americas which partially offset weakness in EMEA and APAC, resulting in a 5% year-over-year contraction in segment sales. Acquisitions contributed $7.1 million in the fourth quarter. Sales declined broadly across several end markets compared with the year ago period. Sales improved 1% sequentially compared with the third quarter of 2023 driven by growing throughput levels in our North American Centers of Excellence. FX had a favorable $1.6 million impact on sales and supply chain constraints delayed an estimated $4.2 million in sales. Gross profit and margin drivers: Lower gross profit and margin year-over-year were primarily the result of lower volume, the different margin profile of acquired businesses, restructuring costs, and higher wage and benefit costs. Restructuring costs included in cost of sales included $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating income and operating margin: Reflect impact of lower volume on gross profit year-over-year as well as costs related to acquisitions and maintaining investment levels in new product development. Notably, SEA expenses declined sequentially 7% compared with third quarter 2023. Electronics Segment Review (Refer to sales by geographic region and segment data in accompanying tables) ($ in millions) (Unaudited) Electronics For the Three Months Ended December 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Change % Change Net Sales Americas $ 48.8 $ 48.0 $ 0.8 2 % EMEA 5.8 5.3 0.5 9 % APAC 5.1 2.5 2.6 104 % Total Segment Sales $ 59.7 $ 55.8 $ 3.9 7 % Gross Profit $ 14.1 $ 14.6 $ (0.5 ) (3 %) Gross Margin 23.6 % 26.2 % (260 ) bps SEA Expenses $ 13.1 $ 13.9 $ (0.8 ) (6 %) Operating Income $ 1.0 $ 0.7 $ 0.3 43 % Operating Margin 1.7 % 1.3 % 40 bps Fourth Quarter Electronics Segment Review Sales: Improved by 7% over the prior year driven by increases in all regions combined with a $2.3 million contribution from acquisitions. Sales grew driven by a double-digit increase over the year ago period in health and wellness, partially offset by continued softness in the marine and industrial end markets. Sales declined 14% sequentially as expected from the swift market shift cited in the third quarter of 2023. Foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact sales and supply chain constraints delayed an estimated $3.2 million in sales. Gross profit and margin drivers: Compared with the year ago period, lower gross profit and margin reflects decreased sales volume and mix, higher material costs, the different margin profile of acquired businesses, and restructuring costs. Operating income and operating margin: Grew compared with the year ago period in spite of lower gross profit as a result of disciplined cost control lowering total SEA expenses down 6% compared to the year ago period and down 9% sequentially. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Review Total debt: at quarter-end was $524.8 million, down from $544.5 million at the end of the third quarter as the Company’s capital allocation priorities include debt reduction. A higher total debt balance compared with the year ago period reflect the acquisitions of Schultes and i3 that were partially financed with debt. Cash and cash equivalents: as of December 30, 2023 were $32.4 million, down 8% sequentially from the third quarter 2023 while paying down $19.7 million of debt highlighting the focus on working capital management. Inventory: increased $6.4 million to $215.1 million from the third quarter of 2023. The increase was the result of the decline in volume from the swift macro shifts cited in the third quarter of 2023 and the timing lag effect. Additionally, as a part of integrating and consolidating operations through opening the North American Hydraulics Centers of Excellence, there has been some inventory build required to maintain timely workflows. Pro-forma net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA: slight sequential increase to 3.01x at quarter end compared with 2.98x at the end of the third quarter (pro-forma for Schultes and i3). At the end of the fourth quarter 2023, the Company had $200.1 million available on its revolving lines of credit. Net cash provided by operations: was $33.7 million in the fourth quarter 2023 compared with $11.8 million in the third quarter 2023 and $35.7 million in the year ago period, bringing the twelve month cash flow from operations to $83.9 million compared with $109.9 million for the comparable period in 2022. Capital expenditures: were $8.8 million in the fourth quarter 2023, or 4.6% of sales finalizing many of the capacity expansion projects. This compares with $10.0 million, or 5.1% of sales, in the year ago period. For the full year, capital expenditures were $34.3 million, or 4.1% of sales. This compares with $31.9 million, or 3.6% of sales in 2022. Dividends: Paid 108th sequential quarterly cash dividend on January 19, 2024. Establishing Full Year 2024 Outlook: Sean Bagan, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We have clear financial priorities in 2024 to (i) Execute on our profitable sales growth plan by realizing operating leverage inherent in our business, while fully instilling investment and cost discipline; (ii) Shorten our cash conversion cycle through sustainable working capital improvement initiatives; and (iii) Reduce debt utilizing the free cash flow conversion proceeds. We know execution is critical in delivering on our commitments this year as we strive for more predictable results in 2024. We expect this renewed financial focus will in turn elevate Helios to be the scalable, integrated operating Company into which we are evolving.” The following provides the Company’s expectations for 2024 as of February 26, 2024. This assumes constant currency, using quarter end rates, and that markets served are not further impacted by the macroeconomic or the geopolitical environment. 2023 Actual 2024 Outlook Consolidated revenue $835.6 million $840 - $860 million Net income $37.5 million $50 - $63 million Adjusted EBITDA $161.4 million $163 - $180 million Adjusted EBITDA margin 19.3% 19.5% - 21.0% Interest expense $31.2 million $34 - $35 million Effective tax rate 24% 22% - 24% Depreciation $30.2 million $34 - $36 million Amortization $33.6 million $33 - $35 million Capital expenditures % total revenue 4% of sales 3% - 4% of sales Diluted EPS $1.14 $1.50 - $1.90 Diluted Non-GAAP EPS $2.34 $2.35 - $2.75 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and diluted Non-GAAP EPS represent Non-GAAP financial measures. The Company has presented the comparable GAAP figures in the table above. For 2023, adjusted EBITDA excludes $17.2 million of costs for restructuring activities and acquisition related costs including integration. For 2023, diluted Non-GAAP EPS excludes $1.20 per diluted share of costs primarily for amortization, restructuring activities, acquisition related costs including integration and the related tax impact on these items.

This news release will discuss some historical Non-GAAP financial measures, which Helios believes that providing these specific Non-GAAP figures are important for investors and other readers of Helios financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Helios management to better understand operating performance. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these Non-GAAP measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income recognized in a given period. You should not consider the inclusion of this additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please carefully review the Non-GAAP reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the related additional information provided throughout. Because these metrics are Non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, these figures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. This news release also presents forward-looking statements regarding Non-GAAP measures, including adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and sales in constant currency. The Company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because such information is not available, and management cannot reliably predict the necessary components of such GAAP measures without unreasonable effort or expense. In addition, the Company believes that such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s 2024 financial results. These Non-GAAP financial measures are preliminary estimates and are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, among others, changes in connection with quarter-end and year-end adjustments. Any variation between the Company’s actual results and preliminary financial data set forth above may be material.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Forward-looking Financial Measures: Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and sales in constant currency are not measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP. Nevertheless, Helios believes that providing these specific Non-GAAP figures are important for investors and other readers of Helios financial statements, as they are used as analytical indicators by Helios management to better understand operating performance. These Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for GAAP. Please carefully review the attached Non-GAAP reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and the related additional information provided throughout. Because these metrics are Non-GAAP measures and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, these figures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share disclosed above in our 2024 Outlook, to their comparable GAAP financial measures because it could not do so without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of the information needed to calculate reconciling items and due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the Non-GAAP financial measures in future periods.

(CSE: CANN) (OTCQB: HERTF) (“Heritage” or the “Company”), today announced its financial results as at and for the three- and twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2023. All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted. “Remaining true to our vision of sustainable growth, Heritage continued to optimize our products in 2023 while maintaining a close focus on production efficiencies, operational spending, and high gross margin sales, all of which were key in achieving growth in gross margin of over 50% for the year and 628% for the quarter compared to last year, showing a very promising trend for the start of this year,” said David Schwede, CEO of Heritage. “Our products continue to see significant demand, specifically for our newly launched RAD vape products and Adults Only brand (#9 vape brand in Canada), which contributed to our concentrate revenues growing by 6% in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., we have six SKUs in New York – our newest state - and our more established business in Missouri and West Virgina saw strong growth with over $3.5 million in sales for the year. With Q1 revenues and gross margins expected to continue this trend and SG&A expected to be down, we are keen to build on these successful ventures throughout 2024 and continue to explore additional revenue channels both in the U.S and internationally.” Selected Financial Highlights Selected financial highlights for the three- and twelve-month periods ended October 31, 2023 and 2022 include the following: Three months ended Years ended (in $CDN) Oct 31, 2023 $ Oct 31, 2022 $ Oct 31, 2023 $ Oct 31, 2022 $ Gross revenue 11,409,434 11,148,059 42,054,936 41,996,297 Net revenue (net of excise tax) 7,977,839 8,038,105 29,794,289 29,566,385 Cost of sales 4,875,162 7,611,993 17,709,500 21,599,867 Gross margin 3,102,677 426,112 12,084,789 7,966,518 General and administrative expenses 5,803,160 5,953,751 20,144,123 20,588,796 Other Income (Expenses) (12,520,156) (22,718,884) (13,262,707) (14,297,205) Comprehensive Income (Loss) (14,123,548) (26,895,045) (19,906,411) (23,937,773) 2023 Financial Highlights The Company reported gross revenue of $11,409,434 for the three months ended October 31, 2023, an increase of $261,373 compared to the gross revenue of $11,148,059 for the three months ended October 31, 2022.

Cost of sales for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was $4,875,162, a decrease of $2,736,831 compared to $7,611,993 for the three months ended October 31, 2022. The decrease represented a 24% improvement, as a percentage of sales, in the current period. As stated in previous quarters, the Company is continuously reviewing its processes for optimization either on the manufacturing side or through material costing which continued to positively impact the results in the current quarter. Cost of sales for the year ended October 31, 2023 was $17,709,500, a decrease of $3,890,367, compared to $21,599,867 for the year ended October 31, 2022. The decrease represented a 9% improvement, as a percentage of sales, in the current period. The improvement was a result of continued production refinements to enable more efficient production and improved inventory management strategies. Gross margin for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was $3,102,677 (27%) compared to gross margin of $426,112 (4%) for the three months ended October 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin of $2,676,565 (+23%) was primarily a result of continually improving production efficiencies and maintaining an overall excise duty rate of under 30% of gross revenues. Gross margin for the year ended October 31, 2023 was $12,084,789 compared to gross margin of $7,966,518 for the year ended October 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin of $4,118,271 was a result of improved production efficiencies over the course of the year, maintaining a lower excise rate in the period and an improved inventory control system resulting in a decrease of inventory adjustments of $1,752,837 from $2,471,371 for the year ended October 31, 2022, to $718,534 for the year ended October 31 2023. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, the Company recorded a comprehensive loss of $14,123,548 or $0.01 loss per share compared to a comprehensive loss of $26,895,045 or $0.03 loss per share for the three months ended October 31, 2022. The decrease in comprehensive loss of $12,771,497 during this period was attributable to increased non-excisable sales, decreased inventory costs and production efficiencies in the period. For the year ended October 31, 2023, the Company recorded a comprehensive loss of $19,906,411 or $0.02 loss per share compared to a comprehensive loss of $23,937,773 or $0.03 loss per share for the year ended October 31, 2022. The decrease in comprehensive loss of $4,031,362 during the period was due to the gross margin gains noted above and the cost management in general and administrative expenses which was partially offset by the intangible asset and goodwill impairment in the period. Q4 2023 Growth, Operational, and Corporate Highlights On August 15, 2023, the Company announced the appointment of Jasmine Paige as Interim Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), replacing Dan Phaure as he pursues new opportunities. On September 6, 2023, the Company announced that products from its Pura Vida brand were approved for listing by Société québécoise du cannabis for retail and online distribution in the province of Québec. This is a noteworthy achievement for Heritage as it continues to expand its product offerings and increase distribution across Canada, now actively selling products in every province in the country. Québec is the fourth-largest market in Canada and while the Company’s products have been available online through partner medical platforms in the province, Heritage looks forward to directly building a strong portfolio of offerings for Québec consumers. On October 11, 2023, the Company announced the procurement of an EU GMP certified extraction machine to be added to the existing fleet of extractors which is anticipated to double the Company’s hydrocarbon processing capacity. The extractor has the capacity to add 3,600,000 grams of cannabis processing and is EU GMP certified – a global standard for manufacturing practices - allowing for increased international sales of Heritage’s cannabis derivative products to countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and others as cannabis legalization continues to expand across the globe. Heritage has been experiencing an increased demand for its products both across Canada, and the United States where the Company has already launched products in New York, Missouri, and West Virginia. This new extractor is expected to help to boost production in order to meet the growing Canadian retail demand, as well as create supply to enter global markets as demand for EU GMP certified extracts grows internationally. Additionally, Heritage has been actively pursuing and participating in the vibrant B2B market and amping up production of extracts will support this important and growing sector of the market. On October 23, 2023, the Company announced that it had officially commenced recreational product sales in the state of New York. Manufacturing of Heritage’s RAD branded vape and concentrate products began in the state during the summer of 2023, and the Company achieved its first commercial sale in New York – Heritage’s third state where its brands are now available. Heritage continues to target the legal markets in the US with an asset light model, and in New York has a manufacturing and distribution agreement with a local partner that produces and sells products using Heritage’s innovative formulations and flavours that the RAD brand is known for. Heritage plans to introduce additional RAD products including live resin, rosin, and infused pre-rolls, and is expanding product offerings with additional Heritage brands. On October 30, 2023, the Company announced its intention to sell the Company’s real estate properties in Ontario (the “Ontario Property”) and British Columbia (the “BC Property”) to BJK Developments Ltd. (the “BJK Purchaser”) for a net purchase price of $9,714,475 (the “Purchase Price”) and lease the Ontario and BC properties back from the BJK Purchaser (the “Sale and Leaseback Transaction”). Pursuant to the Sale Leaseback Transaction, Heritage entered into ten (10) year lease agreements with the Purchaser, for its Health Canada licensed Ontario Property and BC Property, where the Company will continue to operate its best-in-class manufacturing and processing capabilities for its domestic and international business segments. Further, the lease terms include a 12-month free rent period, representing approximately $1,389,000 of savings during the period, which commences at closing; and, that the Company also retains an option to repurchase the Ontario Property and BC Property for a period of two years, from the BJK Purchaser, pursuant to option agreements. The Purchase Price was used to set-off the amount owing by the Company to its lender, BJK Holdings Ltd. (“BJK”), a related entity of the BJK Purchaser, reducing the Company’s remaining term debt by approximately 57% to $7,303,640. The remaining term financing, as amended within a Third Amending Agreement has been extended through to January 31, 2025, with interest calculated at the Royal Bank of Canada prime lending rate (“RBC Prime”) minus 1.75%. In addition, the Company retains its revolving line of credit of up to $5,000,000 (the “LOC”) with BJK, which has also been extended until January 31, 2025. In connection with the Third Amending Agreement, Heritage agreed to amend existing warrant certificates held by BJK dated October 8, 2021 which entitled BJK to subscribe for and purchase up to 10,000,000 common shares in the capital of Heritage at an exercise price of $0.25 per common share, and dated September 29, 2022 which entitled BJK to subscribe for and purchase up to 50,000,000 common shares in the capital of Heritage at an exercise price of $0.10 per common share (the “Existing Warrants”). Effective, October 31, 2023, the Company amended the Existing Warrants so that the expiry date for BJK to exercise the Existing Warrants is extended from February 28, 2025, to February 28, 2026, and so that the exercise price of the Existing Warrants shall be repriced to $0.07 per Common Share.

Financial Analyst The completion of Vocodia Holdings Corp's initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company, injecting substantial capital into its operations. The raised funds, amounting to $5.95 million, are poised to catalyze Vocodia's strategic initiatives, including acquisitions and technology enhancements. The dual issuance of both common stock and warrants (Series A and B) offers investors varied leverage and risk exposure opportunities. The warrants, in particular, with exercise prices of $5.5250 and $8.5000, provide insights into the company's future valuation expectations.From a financial perspective, the underwriters' partial exercise of their over-allotment option, specifically targeting Series B Warrants, suggests a cautious but optimistic outlook on the company's long-term growth potential. It is also noteworthy that the IPO is the first to be listed on the BZX Exchange of CBOE Global Markets, potentially expanding investor reach and visibility for Vocodia.The intended use of net proceeds for business expansion and technological advancements indicates a growth-oriented strategy, which could enhance Vocodia's competitive position in the AI software market. However, investors should monitor the deployment of these funds closely to ensure they are utilized effectively to drive shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The AI software industry is a rapidly evolving landscape, with significant growth potential. Vocodia Holdings Corp's entry into the public market could signal a strategic move to capitalize on this growth. The company's focus on practical AI functions suggests an aim to address concrete market needs rather than theoretical applications. This pragmatic approach could resonate well with investors who prioritize tangible product offerings and market-ready solutions.The decision to use IPO proceeds for the acquisition of websites and technologies indicates an aggressive expansion strategy that could enable Vocodia to scale quickly and integrate new capabilities. This is a common move for tech companies looking to stay ahead in a competitive sector. However, the success of such acquisitions will depend on the company's ability to seamlessly integrate new assets and technologies without disrupting existing operations.Investors should also consider the broader market context, including the competitive landscape of AI software providers and how Vocodia's product offerings and market strategy align with current industry trends and demands. The company's performance post-IPO will be a key indicator of its ability to execute its strategic plans and deliver on its growth promises. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding Vocodia's IPO, particularly the compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is crucial for investor confidence. The effectiveness of the registration statement by the SEC and the role of legal counsel in advising both the company and the underwriters underscore the importance of due diligence and regulatory compliance in public offerings.Investors should take note of the legal provisions, including the 45-day option granted to underwriters to purchase additional securities, which could potentially dilute existing shares. The legal intricacies of the warrants, such as the specific terms and conditions of their exercise, are also significant for investors to understand, as they can impact the future financial structure of the company.It is essential for stakeholders to review the final prospectus and other legal documents associated with the IPO to fully grasp the terms of the offering and the rights conferred by the securities purchased. The legal framework not only protects investors but also establishes the foundation for Vocodia's obligations and representations to its new shareholders. 02/26/2024 - 08:19 PM Shares, Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants Trading under Ticker Symbols ""VHAI"", ""VHAI+A"", and ""VHAI+B"", respectively CHICAGO, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vocodia Holdings Corp (CBOE: VHAI) (""Vocodia"" or the ""Company""), an AI software company that builds practical AI functions, today announced the closing of its underwritten initial public offering of 1,400,000 Units (collectively the ""Units"" or ""Unit""), each consisting of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 (""Common Stock""), one Series A Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock exercisable at $5.5250 (the ""Series A Warrant""), and one Series B Warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock exercisable at an exercise price of $8.5000 (the ""Series B Warrant""), at a public offering price of $4.2500 per Unit (the ""Public Offering Price"").

(“Sandfire America” or the “Company”) announces the positive ruling by the Montana Supreme Court which reversed a 2021 district court decision and instructed the District Judge to have the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MT DEQ) to completely reinstate Tintina Montana Inc.’s Mine Operating Permit, of the Black Butte Copper Project. The Montana Supreme Court granted the Company’s request for summary judgement allowing Black Butte Copper to move forward with construction of its highly engineered, underground copper mine. The Company won on all counts in the Montana Supreme Court decision with a 5-2 decision upholding the 2020 decision of the MT DEQ to allow copper mining at the Black Butte Copper Project, overturning a District Court ruling that had invalidated the mining permit. The original suit was filed jointly against the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and Tintina Montana Inc. (“Tintina,” Sandfire America’s wholly owned subsidiary) on June 4th, 2020, and the Montana Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case on June 21, 2023. Additional intervenors in the suit supporting the MT DEQ and Tintina, include Meagher County, Broadwater County, and the Montana Department of Justice. Lincoln Greenidge, CEO of Sandfire America shared, “Today’s victory in the Montana Supreme Court is a validation of the thoughtful and deliberate efforts of the Sandfire America team to design a world-class, environmentally safe mining project from the beginning. The fact is, ours is the most reviewed and examined proposed project in the history of Montana mining. The Court record stands at over 90,000 pages of testimony, information, and analysis. We thank the justices for their ruling, and their ability to recognize the amount of effort and extensive work that has gone into this project. Now, we look forward to progressing the project in a safe, responsible, and sustainable manner.” Senior VP, Jerry Zieg concluded stating, “Tintina’s permit has been diligently considered by the professional and hardworking staff at the MT DEQ. It is a fantastic, well-designed project with a plan centered around safety which is why we were successful today. Over a decade ago, we set out to design a state of the art, environmentally protective underground mining project, and this decision is proof we’ve been successful.” Black Butte Copper now has all permits to proceed with the project. Stipulated agreements regarding water rights granted through the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (MT DNRC) for the project have been finalized with all water rights being issued and available. There is a challenge to the Montana Constitution’s definition of the “beneficial use of water” using Black Butte Copper’s water use permit to challenge this definition. This case does not currently affect the Company’s water rights package. The challenge, naming both the MT DNRC and Tintina Montana Inc., was appealed by objectors after their loss at District Court and will be heard by Montana Supreme Court on Friday, March 29, 2024.

The ICs are suitable for various applications including TVs, monitors, appliances, LED lighting, and industrial power supplies. Negative None. Electrical Engineer The introduction of the InnoMux-2 family of integrated circuits (ICs) by Power Integrations represents a significant advancement in power conversion technology. By integrating both AC-DC and DC-DC conversion stages into a single chip, these ICs address a common challenge in power supply design: the efficiency loss due to multiple conversion stages. Traditionally, each stage of conversion incurs a loss of energy, typically as heat, which not only affects the system's performance but also contributes to increased operational costs and environmental impact.The use of 750 V PowiGaN gallium-nitride transistors is a key factor in the reduction of power losses. Gallium nitride (GaN) is known for its high electron mobility and thermal conductivity, which allows for faster switching and less heat generation compared to silicon-based transistors. This results in higher efficiency and the potential for downsizing the power supply components. Moreover, the zero-voltage switching technique reduces switching losses, contributing to the overall efficiency of the system.The potential impact on businesses, particularly those manufacturing white goods, industrial systems and displays, is substantial. The reduction in component count and printed circuit board (PCB) footprint not only simplifies the manufacturing process but also reduces material costs. Additionally, the increased efficiency and compliance with the European Union's energy-using product (EuP) regulations for standby usage make these ICs an attractive option for companies looking to enhance the energy efficiency of their products and reduce their ecological footprint. Market Analyst From a market perspective, Power Integrations' launch of the InnoMux-2 ICs could potentially disrupt the power supply component market by setting a new standard for energy efficiency and integration. The company's pricing strategy, starting at $1.11 for 50,000-unit quantities, positions the product competitively, which may influence the pricing dynamics within the industry and impact the market share of existing power supply ICs.The high efficiency and reduced component count provided by InnoMux-2 ICs are not only in line with the increasing demand for energy-efficient and compact electronic devices but also offer manufacturers the ability to streamline their supply chains. This could lead to a reallocation of market share among suppliers, with Power Integrations poised to capture a larger segment if the product is adopted widely.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate of InnoMux-2 ICs and any resulting shifts in customer preference. Companies that quickly integrate these ICs into their products may gain a competitive advantage in terms of cost savings and regulatory compliance, which could translate into improved financial performance and stock valuation. Environmental Analyst From an environmental standpoint, the InnoMux-2 ICs contribute to the global effort to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The energy efficiency gains, achieving system efficiency above 90 percent, are significant when considering the scale at which these ICs could be deployed in consumer and industrial electronics. This efficiency leap aligns with broader sustainability trends and regulatory pressures, such as the European Union's directives on energy consumption.By enabling products to meet stringent energy regulations, Power Integrations is not only providing a technical solution but also supporting the corporate social responsibility objectives of its clients. The reduction in no-load consumption to less than 30 mW is particularly noteworthy, as it demonstrates the company's commitment to addressing the often-overlooked issue of standby power draw, which can accumulate to substantial energy usage at scale.Environmental considerations are increasingly influencing business decisions and consumer behavior and Power Integrations' focus on energy-efficient technologies could enhance its brand reputation and customer loyalty, ultimately impacting its financial success and investor sentiment. 02/26/2024 - 08:00 PM New GaN-based ICs combine AC-DC and DC-DC stages into a single power converter; cut power system losses by up to 50 percent LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- APEC 2024 – Power Integrations (NASDAQ: POWI), the leader in high-voltage integrated circuits for energy-efficient power conversion, today announced the InnoMux™-2 family of single-stage, independently regulated multi-output offline power-supply ICs. InnoMux-2 ICs consolidate AC-DC and downstream DC-DC conversion stages into a single chip, providing up to three independently regulated outputs for use in white goods, industrial systems, displays and other applications requiring multiple voltages.

Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone provide. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), net income (loss) margin, or general and administrative expenses, as applicable, as measures of financial performance or cash provided by operating activities as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not intended to be measures of free cash flow available for management’s discretionary use, as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to invest in the business growth or to reduce indebtedness. Our non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on any applicable debts; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense, or the cash necessary to pay income taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of earnings or cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and general and administrative expenses, excluding equity-based compensation and certain non-recurring public company costs, differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

The company entered into a standby equity purchase agreement to sell up to $10 million worth of shares to start production of the i300 electric urban motorcycle. Despite a net loss of $222.1 million in 2023, Zapp remains optimistic about scaling quickly after launching in Europe and key Asian markets. Positive Zapp reported financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The company entered into a standby equity purchase agreement to sell up to $10 million worth of shares. Zapp completed vehicle testing required for homologation in the European Union and Thailand. The company received two additional design awards, bringing the total to eight. Zapp partnered with the Paris-based fintech firm Younited to offer European customers instant credit payment solutions. Zapp's 2023 financial results showed a net loss of $222.1 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. Operating loss was $7.8 million compared to $3.6 million in the prior year. Zapp's Founder and CEO, Swin Chatsuwan, expressed optimism about the start of production and commercial rollout of the i300 electric urban motorcycle. Negative IFRS Net loss of $222.1 million in 2023. Operating loss of $7.8 million in 2023. Financial Analyst Zapp Electric Vehicles Group Limited's recent financial results indicate a significant net loss of $222.1 million, which is a substantial increase from the previous year's $3.6 million. This loss primarily stems from other expenses related to a business combination, signaling a strategic move that could be transformative for the company's future. However, the magnitude of the loss warrants a closer examination of the company's operational efficiency and the synergies expected from the business combination.The standby equity purchase agreement to sell up to $10 million worth of shares is a liquidity measure that provides Zapp EV with a capital infusion. This move is crucial as it offers the financial support needed for the company to transition into production and commercial rollout phases. Investors should note the potential dilutive effect of such an equity sale on existing shares, which could impact share value in the short term.From an investment standpoint, the market will likely react to both the reported financial losses and the strategic moves undertaken by Zapp EV. The company's success in scaling up after the rollout in Europe and key Asian markets, including India, will be critical in determining its long-term financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst Zapp's i300 electric urban motorcycle appears to be positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for urban mobility solutions, particularly in congested city environments. The completion of vehicle testing for homologation in the European Union and Thailand suggests that Zapp is targeting strategic markets with potential high demand for electric vehicles (EVs).Partnerships, such as the one with Younited for instant credit payment solutions, could enhance customer acquisition by making the purchasing process more accessible. This could be a competitive advantage in the EV space, as financial barriers often deter potential buyers. The approach could also reflect positively on customer satisfaction and brand loyalty.The operational highlights, including design awards and patents, may not directly influence financial performance but contribute to brand prestige and technological credibility. These factors can indirectly impact consumer perception and market acceptance, which are vital for the success of new products in the competitive EV industry.

B&G Foods Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend,2024-02-26T23:10:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) declares a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, with an annualized yield of 8.1%. This marks the 78th consecutive quarterly dividend since the company's IPO in 2004.","B&G Foods Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS) declares a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share, with an annualized yield of 8.1%. This marks the 78th consecutive quarterly dividend since the company's IPO in 2004. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.19 per share by B&G Foods represents a significant aspect of shareholder return and the annualized yield of 8.1% stands out as particularly high compared to the average dividend yield of the S&P 500, which historically hovers around 2%. This high yield could be indicative of the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders, or it could signal a higher risk profile if the market perceives the dividend as unsustainable in the long term.Investors typically view regular dividends as a sign of a company's financial health and stability. However, a yield as substantial as 8.1% may also raise questions about the company's growth prospects and whether it is the best use of capital. In the context of B&G Foods, this could suggest that the company is generating sufficient cash flow to support the dividend, but it's essential to analyze the payout ratio to assess the sustainability of these payments. A payout ratio that exceeds earnings may not be sustainable in the long run. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, B&G Foods' announcement of its 78th consecutive quarterly dividend since its IPO in 2004 is indicative of a consistent return policy, which can be appealing to income-focused investors, especially in an environment where consistent income streams are highly valued. This consistency may also reflect positively on the company's brand and could potentially attract a more conservative investor base.However, it's important to consider the broader industry context. The food industry is subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, changing consumer tastes and increased competition. Companies that manage to maintain a stable dividend in such an environment may be seen as having a competitive advantage. Still, it's critical to evaluate whether the company is balancing this with necessary investments in innovation and growth to ensure long-term competitiveness. 02/26/2024 - 06:10 PM PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- B&G Foods, Inc.

Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico Announces Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2023,2024-02-27T00:27:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (PAC) reports positive financial results for Q4 2023, with total revenues increasing by 14.1%.

Despite a 10.7% peso appreciation, aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues grew. Passenger traffic increased by 2.5%, with new routes added. EBITDA decreased by 2.6%, and operating income margin dropped from 45.6% to 37.8%. Financial position remained strong with Ps. 10,055.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (GAP) for the fourth quarter of 2023 reveal several key indicators of the company's performance. A modest increase in aeronautical and non-aeronautical services revenues by 0.3% and a more significant total revenue increase of 14.1% indicate a diversified growth strategy. However, the decrease in income from operations by 5.5% and EBITDA by 2.6% suggests rising costs or potential operational inefficiencies that may concern investors. The EBITDA margin decline, from 69.8% to 67.8%, could signal a contraction in operational profitability, which is a critical metric for assessing a company's financial health.Notably, the comprehensive income increase by 17.9% is a positive sign, reflecting a stronger bottom line despite operational challenges. The financial position, with an increase in cash and cash equivalents, demonstrates liquidity and the ability to meet short-term obligations. The refinancing of credit with Scotiabank Inverlat using a new credit line from Banco Santander México, S.A. indicates active management of the company's debt profile, which is a prudent approach to financial stewardship.The appreciation of the peso versus the U.S. dollar has had a mixed impact—beneficial for dollar-denominated expenses but adverse for revenues from international tariffs. Investors should consider currency risks and the company's hedging strategies when evaluating its financial stability. Market Research Analyst Passenger traffic growth of 2.5% compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year underscores an upward trend in the aviation sector, likely reflecting a post-pandemic recovery. The introduction of new routes, both domestic and international, could be a strategic move to capture market share and stimulate further passenger growth. It is essential to consider the competitive landscape and the potential for increased revenue from these new routes.Domestic passenger numbers show a mixed pattern, with some airports experiencing declines and others seeing significant growth. The 12.2% year-over-year increase in total domestic passengers across all 14 airports is a robust indicator of market recovery and potential for revenue growth in the domestic segment. Meanwhile, the international passenger segment, with a 4.7% increase, suggests that GAP's airports are becoming more attractive to international travelers, likely due to the new routes and possibly due to strategic marketing efforts. The data on CBX users, which show a decline, may point to specific challenges in cross-border travel that could warrant further investigation. Legal Expert Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico's adherence to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) ensures transparency and comparability of its financial statements. The recognition of revenues from improvements to concession assets in accordance with IFRIC 12, despite having no cash impact, affects reported revenues and profitability ratios. Stakeholders should be aware of these accounting treatments as they can significantly inflate reported revenues without an immediate cash benefit.The legal and regulatory environment in which GAP operates, particularly in relation to concession assets, is a critical factor for long-term sustainability. The company's ability to negotiate and renew concessions and comply with regulatory requirements will be essential in maintaining its revenue streams and operational capabilities. Investors should monitor any changes to regulatory frameworks or concession agreements that could impact GAP's business model. 02/26/2024 - 07:27 PM GUADALAJARA, Mexico, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, S.A.B. de C.V.

However, this recognition does not have a cash impact or impact on the Company’s operating results. Amounts included as a result of the recognition of IFRIC 12 are related to construction of infrastructure in each quarter to which the Company has committed. This is in accordance with the Company’s Master Development Programs in Mexico and Capital Development Programs in Jamaica. All margins and ratios calculated using “Total Revenues” include revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC 12), and, consequently, such margins and ratios may not be comparable to other ratios and margins, such as EBITDA margin, operating margin or other similar ratios that are calculated based on those results of the Company that do have a cash impact. This increase in total operating costs was primarily due to the following factors: Mexican airports: Operating costs increased by Ps. 1,137.7 million, or 30.8%, compared to 4Q22, primarily due to a Ps. 1,101.9 million, or 54.2%, increase in the cost of improvements to the concession assets (IFRIC-12), a Ps. 95.6 million, or 20.4%, increase in depreciation and amortization, and Ps. 66.8 million, or 7.2%, increase in the cost of services. This increase was offset by a combined Ps. 8.5 million, or 1.9%, decrease in technical assistance fees and concession taxes, (excluding the cost of improvements to the concession assets, operating costs increased by Ps. 135.7 million, or 7.4%). The change in the cost of services during 4Q23 was mainly due to: Employee costs increased Ps. 75.8 million, or 23.6%, compared to 4Q22, mainly due to the hiring of 362 additional personnel during 2023, mainly for the operation of business lines operated directly by us, as well as the adjustments in salaries and changes in Labor Law.Cost of business operated directly by us increased by Ps. 20.5 million or 41.2%, compared to 4Q22, derived from increased operations and income in VIP lounges and convenience stores.Safety, security, and insurance costs increased Ps. 15.4 million, or 12.4%, compared to 4Q22, mainly due to an increase in the number of security staff, minimum wages and changes in Labor Law, and the opening of additional operational areas.These increases were offset by the decrease in maintenance cost by Ps. 48.5 million, or 19.4%. Jamaican Airports: Operating costs increased by Ps. 187.7 million, or 28.3%, compared to 4Q22, mainly due to a Ps. 107.6 million, or 180.8% increase in the cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12), increase in concession taxes by Ps. 103.5 million, or 41.6%, offset by a decrease in the cost of services by Ps. 17.2 million, or 7.7%, and a decrease in the depreciation and amortization by Ps. 6.8 million, or 5.3%. Operating income margin went from 45.6% in 4Q22 to 37.8% in 4Q23. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, the operating income margin went from 60.0% in 4Q22 to 56.6% in 4Q23. Income from operations decreased by Ps. 199.4 million, or 5.5%, compared to 4Q22. EBITDA margin went from 53.1% in 4Q22 to 45.4% in 4Q23.

Financial result decreased by Ps. 99.7 million, or 13.3%, from a net expense of Ps. 750.1 million in 4Q22 to a net expense of Ps. 650.4 million in 4Q23. This change was mainly the result of: Foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which went from an expense of Ps. 260.6 million in 4Q22 to an expense of Ps. 154.5 million in 4Q23. This generated a foreign exchange gain of Ps. 106.1 million. This was mainly due to the appreciation of the peso. The currency translation effect income increased to Ps. 96.5 million, compared to 4Q22.Interest expenses increased by Ps. 50.3 million, or 6.7%, compared to 4Q22, mainly due to higher debt as a result of the issuance of long-term debt securities and the drawdown of credit lines.Interest income increased by Ps. 43.9 million, or 14.2%, compared to 4Q22, mainly due to an increase in the reference interest rates. In 4Q23, comprehensive income increased by Ps. 296.6 million, or 17.9%, compared to 4Q22. Mainly due to the decrease in the income before taxes by Ps. 526.1 million, and the decrease in the financial result of Ps. 99.7 million, this was offset by the decrease in revenues in dollars due to the appreciation of the peso by 10.7%, the decrease in income from the currency translation effect in Ps. 96.5 million, among others. During 4Q23, net income increased by Ps. 426.4 million, or 23.3%, compared to 4Q22. Taxes for the period decreased by Ps. 526.1 million, income taxes decreased by Ps. 390.1 million and the benefit for deferred taxes increased by Ps. 136.0 million, mainly due to an increase in the inflation rate, from 1.4% in 4Q22 to 1.7% in 4Q23 and the application of tax losses of Ps. 28.1 million.

Revenues from improvements to concession assets2 Revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12) increased by Ps. 2,944.9 million, or 60.8%, compared to 2022. The change was composed primarily of: The Company’s Mexican airports, which increased by Ps. 2,822.7 million, or 59.8%, due to increased investments under the Master Development Program for the 2020-2024 period.Improvements to concession assets at the Company’s Jamaican airports, which increased Ps. 122.3 million, or 94.3%. 2 Revenues from improvements to concession assets are recognized in accordance with International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee 12 “Service Concession Arrangements” (IFRIC 12), but this recognition does not have a cash impact or an impact on the Company’s operating results. Amounts included as a result of the recognition of IFRIC 12 are related to construction of infrastructure in each quarter to which the Company has committed in accordance with the Company’s Master Development Programs in Mexico and Capital Development Program in Jamaica. All margins and ratios calculated using “Total Revenues” include revenues from improvements to concession assets (IFRIC 12), and, consequently, such margins and ratios may not be comparable to other ratios and margins, such as EBITDA margin, operating margin or other similar ratios that are calculated based on those results of the Company that do have a cash impact. Total operating costs increased by Ps. 4,519.2 million, or 33.3%, compared to 2022, mainly due to a Ps. 2,244.9 million, or 60.8% increase in the cost of improvements to the concession assets (IFRIC-12), a combined Ps. 732.4 million, or 32.6%, increase in concession taxes and technical assistance fees, a Ps. 599.0 million, or 15.8%, increase in cost of services, and a Ps. 232.4 million, or 10.0%, increase in depreciation and amortization (excluding the cost of improvements to concession assets, operating costs increased Ps. 1,574.3 million, or 18.1%). This increase in total operating costs was composed primarily of the following factors: Mexican Airports: Operating costs increased by Ps. 3,897.1 million, or 34.9%, compared to 2022, primarily due to a Ps. 2,822.7 million, or 59.8%, increase in the cost of improvements to the concession assets (IFRIC-12), a Ps. 637.1 million, or 21.3%, increase in cost of services, a combined Ps. 240.6 million, or 13.3%, increase in depreciation and amortization, a Ps. 202.3 million, or 12.2%, increase in technical assistance fees and concession taxes (excluding the cost of improvements to the concession assets, operating costs increased by Ps. 1,074.4 million or 16.7%). The change in the cost of services during 2023 was mainly due to: Employee costs increased Ps. 355.6 million, or 30.6%, compared to 2022, mainly due to the hiring of additional personnel as well as the adjustments in salaries and changes in Labor Law.Safety, security, and insurance costs increased Ps. 101.4 million, or 23.9%, compared to 2022, mainly due to an increase in the number of security staff, an increase in minimum wages, changes in Labor Law, and the opening of additional operational areas.The cost of business operated directly by us increased by Ps. 83.7 million or 51.7%, compared to 2022, derived from increased operations and income in VIP lounges and convenience stores.Utilities increased by Ps. 46.1 million, or 16.1%, compared to 2022. Jamaican Airports: Operating costs increased by Ps. 622.1 million, or 25.9%, compared to 2022, mainly due to a Ps. 530.0 million, or 53.6%, increase in concession taxes, a Ps. 122.2 million or 94.3%, increase in cost of improvements to concession assets (IFRIC-12), offset by the decrease in cost of services by Ps. 38.1 million, or 4.8%, and the depreciation and amortization by Ps. 8.2 million, or 1.6%, mainly due to the appreciation of the peso by 10.7%, which represented a decrease in the cost of pesos. Operating margin went from 50.5% in 2022 to 45.6% in 2023. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, the operating margin went from 61.3% in 2022 to 59.5% in 2023. Operating income increased by Ps. 1,324.5 million, or 9.6%, compared to 2022. EBITDA margin went from 58.9% in 2022 to 53.2% in 2023. Excluding the effects of IFRIC-12, EBITDA margin went from 71.6% in 2022 to 69.5% in 2023. The nominal value of EBITDA increased Ps. 1,556.9 million, or 9.7%, compared to 2022. Financial cost increased by Ps. 838.5 million, or 54.5%, from a net expense of Ps. 1,538.5 million in 2022 to a net expense of Ps. 2,377.0 million in 2023. This change was mainly the result of: Foreign exchange rate fluctuation, which went from an income of Ps. 81.4 million in 2022 to a loss of Ps. 340.7 million in 2023. This generated an increase in the foreign exchange loss of Ps. 422.1 million, due to the peso appreciation. The currency translation effect expense increased Ps. 405.4 million, compared to 2022.Interest expenses increased by Ps. 994.6 million, or 40.5%, compared to 2022, mainly due to the increase in debt due to the issuance of bond certificates and the contracting of bank loans in 2023, as well as the substantial increase in interest rates.Interest income increased by Ps. 567.0 million, or 67.9%, compared to 2022, mainly due to an increase in the reference interest rates. In 2023, comprehensive income decreased by Ps. 96.9 million, or 1.1%, compared to 2022. Income before taxes increased by Ps. 486.0 million, mainly due to the increase in traffic and the commercial strategy. However, net and comprehensive income decreased mainly due to the decrease of the effect of foreign currency translation in Ps. 405.4 million, and a decrease in cash flow hedges for Ps. 170.9 million. During 2023, net income increased by Ps. 504.1 million, or 5.5%, compared to 2022. Taxes for the period decreased by Ps. 18.1 million, due to a decrease of income taxes by Ps. 233.0 million, and the benefit for deferred taxes decreased by Ps. 214.8 million, mainly due to the inflation rate, from 7.8% in 2022 to 4.7% in 2023. Statement of Financial Position Total assets as of December 31, 2023, increased by Ps. 6,939.5 million compared to December 31, 2022, primarily due to the following items: (i) a Ps. 8,736.8 million increase in net improvements to concession assets, (ii) a Ps. 630.9 million increase in other current assets, (iii) a Ps. 527.6 million increase in deferred income taxes. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of (i) Ps. 2,316.3 million in cash and cash equivalents (ii) a Ps. 889.7 million decrease in airport concessions, and (iii) a Ps. 117.1 million decrease in account receivables, among others. Total liabilities as of December 31, 2023, increased by Ps. 5,822.9 million compared to December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the following items: (i) issuance of Ps. 4,798.0 million (net) in long-term debt securities, and (ii) Ps. 1,424.4 million in bank loans. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of (i) Ps. 153.6 million in deferred taxes and (ii) Ps. 102.5 million in accounts payable, among others.

As a part of the adoption of IFRS, the effects of inflation on common stock recognized under Mexican Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) through December 31, 2007, were reclassified as retained earnings because accumulated inflation recognized under MFRS is not considered hyperinflationary according to IFRS. For Mexican legal and tax purposes, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, S.A.B. de C.V., as an individual entity, will continue preparing separate financial information under MFRS. Therefore, for any transaction between the Company and its shareholders related to stockholders’ equity, the Company must take into consideration the accounting balances prepared under MFRS as an individual entity and determine the tax impact under tax laws applicable in Mexico, which requires the use of MFRS. For purposes of reporting to stock exchanges, the consolidated financial statements will continue to be prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 05:52 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release provides shareholders of Cohen & Steers Closed-End Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NYSE: FOF) (the ""Fund"") with information regarding the sources of the distribution to be paid on February 29, 2024 and cumulative distributions paid fiscal year-to-date. In December 2021, the Fund implemented a managed distribution policy in accordance with exemptive relief issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The managed distribution policy seeks to deliver the Fund's long-term total return potential through regular monthly distributions declared at a fixed rate per common share. The policy gives the Fund greater flexibility to realize long-term capital gains throughout the year and to distribute those gains on a regular monthly basis to shareholders. The Board of Directors of the Fund may amend, terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. The Fund's monthly distributions may include long-term capital gains, short-term capital gains, net investment income and/or return of capital for federal income tax purposes. Return of capital includes distributions paid by the Fund in excess of its net investment income and net realized capital gains and such excess is distributed from the Fund's assets. A return of capital is not taxable; rather, it reduces a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares of the Fund. The amount of monthly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors, including changes in portfolio and market conditions. At the time of each monthly distribution, information will be posted to cohenandsteers.com and mailed to shareholders in a concurrent notice. However, this information may change at the end of the year because the final tax characteristics of the Fund's distributions cannot be determined with certainty until after the end of the calendar year. Final tax characteristics of all of the Fund's distributions will be provided on Form 1099-DIV, which is mailed after the close of the calendar year. The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution and the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date from the sources indicated. All amounts are expressed per common share. DISTRIBUTION ESTIMATES February 2024 YEAR-TO-DATE (YTD) February 29, 2024* Source Per Share Amount % of Current Distribution Per Share Amount % of 2024 Distributions Net Investment Income $0.0304 34.94 % $0.0601 34.54 % Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0000 0.00 % Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gains $0.0000 0.00 % $0.0000 0.00 % Return of Capital (or other Capital Source) $0.0566 65.06 % $0.1139 65.46 % Total Current Distribution $0.0870 100.00 % $0.1740 100.00 % You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's managed distribution policy. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only estimates, are likely to change over time, and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The amounts and sources of distributions year-to-date may be subject to additional adjustments. *THE FUND WILL SEND YOU A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR THAT WILL TELL YOU HOW TO REPORT THESE DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES The Fund's Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2024 (January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2024) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Year-to-date Cumulative Total Return with the Fund's Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2024. In addition, the Fund's Average Annual Total Return for the five-year period ending January 31, 2024 is set forth below. Shareholders should note the relationship between the Average Annual Total Return with the Fund's Current Annualized Distribution Rate for 2024. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table is based on the Fund's net asset value per share (NAV). The Fund's NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total liabilities, divided by the total number of shares outstanding. While NAV performance may be indicative of the Fund's investment performance, it does not measure the value of a shareholder's individual investment in the Fund. The value of a shareholder's investment in the Fund is determined by the Fund's market price, which is based on the supply and demand for the Fund's shares in the open market.

(CGBD) reports positive financial results for Q4 and FY 2023, with net investment income of $0.56 per share in Q4 and a 0.8% increase in net asset value. The company plans to increase its base dividend by $0.03 to $0.40 per share, reflecting confidence in its portfolio and future prospects.

Financial Analyst Carlyle Secured Lending's (CSL) announcement of increased dividends and steady net asset value per share reflects a robust financial position, likely resonating positively with investors. The dividend hike from $0.37 to $0.40 per share, an 8% increase, signals confidence in the company's future income-generating ability. This move may attract income-focused investors and could potentially increase the stock's demand, positively influencing its price. Additionally, the steady net asset value per share at $16.99 suggests a stable underlying asset base, which is critical for a business development company (BDC) like CSL that relies on the performance of its investment portfolio.It's important to note that BDCs are often evaluated based on their ability to generate and sustain high levels of current income for shareholders. CSL's reported net investment income of $0.56 per share for Q4 and $2.10 per share for the full year aligns with this goal. However, investors should consider the broader market conditions, including interest rate trends and economic indicators, which could affect the company's portfolio performance and, consequently, its ability to maintain or increase dividends in the future. Market Research Analyst The strategic emphasis on disciplined investment sourcing and the effective use of the OneCarlyle platform by CSL indicates a proactive approach to navigating an evolving market. The company's performance amidst market complexities suggests a competitive edge in deal origination and structuring. This is particularly relevant for middle-market lending, where the ability to source and structure deals can be a significant differentiator.For stakeholders, the implications of CSL's strategy are twofold: the potential for continued strong performance in the future and a high-quality portfolio that may offer resilience against market volatility. The emphasis on attractive pricing, terms and structures relative to historical originations may also indicate that CSL is well-positioned to withstand potential downturns or credit market tightening. Economist The increase in dividends during a period of economic uncertainty can be interpreted as a counter-cyclical move, potentially indicating that CSL is not only weathering current economic challenges but also capitalizing on them to strengthen its market position. The company's focus on middle-market lending, a segment that can be particularly sensitive to economic shifts, further underscores the importance of its strategic approach to risk management.From an economic perspective, CSL's strategy and results may reflect broader trends in the credit markets and the health of the middle-market sector. A stable or growing net asset value in such a company could be a positive sign for the overall economy, suggesting that there is ongoing investment and activity in this critical business segment. 02/26/2024 - 05:49 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carlyle Secured Lending, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” “CSL” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CGBD) today announced its financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. Aren LeeKong, CSL’s Chief Executive Officer said, “We are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results, which we believe were due to our ability to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the OneCarlyle platform and drive performance throughout an evolving market environment.

As a result of our continued execution of this strategy, the quality of our portfolio, and confidence in the future, we are increasing our base dividend by $0.03 to $0.40 per share.” Net investment income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $0.56 per common share, and net asset value per common share increased by 0.8% for the fourth quarter to $16.99 from $16.86 as of September 30, 2023.

Brookfield Corporation Announces Pricing of $750 Million Notes Offering,2024-02-26T22:18:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Brookfield Corporation announces the pricing of a $750 million public offering of senior notes due 2054, with an interest rate of 5.968% per annum.

The notes will be issued by Brookfield Finance Inc. and guaranteed by Brookfield, with proceeds earmarked for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Brookfield's public offering of senior notes to the tune of $750 million, with a notable interest rate of 5.968%, is a significant move in the company's capital structure strategy. This level of interest rate suggests a strategic response to the current macroeconomic environment, where interest rates have risen in response to inflationary pressures. Investors and analysts would assess the offering's attractiveness relative to current bond yields, keeping in mind the long maturity of the notes.From a financial perspective, the use of net proceeds for general corporate purposes is quite broad, implying that the funds could be allocated towards debt refinancing, capital expenditures, or other strategic investments. The fact that these notes are fully guaranteed by Brookfield underlines the parent company's commitment to the issuance and may be indicative of the subsidiary's strategic importance to the overall business.For stakeholders, the implications of this move will hinge on the company's subsequent deployment of the raised capital. Efficient use could lead to improved financial agility and potential growth initiatives, whereas suboptimal allocation might increase the firm's risk profile, especially given the long-term nature of the debt. Market Research Analyst The issuance of senior notes by Brookfield indicates a capital market transaction that could influence investor sentiment towards the company's stock. The interest rate set at 5.968% is a crucial factor in this context. It reflects both the company's creditworthiness and the prevailing market conditions, which could affect the demand for the notes. The rate must be competitive enough to attract investors while also reflecting the risk associated with a long-dated obligation.Analyzing the potential impact on Brookfield's stock, one must consider the market's view on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-issuance. If the market perceives the debt level as sustainable and the interest rate as justified by the company's growth prospects, the stock could react favorably. Conversely, if the issuance is seen as over-leveraging the company or if the interest rate is deemed too high, implying higher costs of capital, the stock may experience negative pressure. Economist The decision by Brookfield to issue senior notes at a rate of 5.968% is reflective of broader economic conditions, particularly the interest rate environment established by central banks. In a higher interest rate environment, corporations tend to face increased borrowing costs, which can affect their investment decisions and profitability. The long-term nature of these notes, maturing in 2054, suggests that Brookfield is locking in current rates in anticipation of potential future rate increases, which may be a prudent hedge against forecasted economic trends.For the broader economy, such corporate debt issuances are indicative of the business cycle phase and the level of corporate confidence. A successful issuance could signal to the market that there is investor appetite for long-term corporate debt, which may encourage other firms to enter the capital markets. However, the high-interest rate also reflects the risk premium investors demand for long-term commitments amid economic uncertainties. 02/26/2024 - 05:18 PM BROOKFIELD, NEWS, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brookfield Corporation (“Brookfield”) (NYSE: BN, TSX: BN) today announced the pricing of a public offering of $750 million principal amount of senior notes due 2054 (the “notes”), which will bear interest at a rate of 5.968% per annum.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Wabtec Corporation's recent announcement of pricing a public offering of $500 million in Senior Notes at a 5.611% interest rate is a significant event for the company's financial structure. This move indicates a proactive approach to managing the company's debt profile by refinancing the upcoming maturity of its 4.15% Senior Notes due in 2024. The higher interest rate on the new notes compared to the existing ones suggests a shift in the market's interest rate environment or a reevaluation of the company's creditworthiness.Investors and analysts should consider the implications of this refinancing on Wabtec's interest expenses and debt servicing costs. The decision to use the proceeds to repay the 2024 Notes could improve the company's debt maturity schedule and liquidity position. However, the increased interest rate will likely lead to higher annual interest expenses, which could impact the firm's net income and cash flow.It is also worth noting the strategic timing of the offering and the lack of contingency on the 2024 Credit Agreement, which suggests confidence in the company's ability to secure necessary funding and a stable credit standing. Market Research Analyst The public offering of Senior Notes by Wabtec is a strategic financial decision that may influence the company's market perception. The guaranteed nature of these notes by Wabtec's current and future subsidiaries provides investors with an additional layer of security, potentially making the offering more attractive. Analyzing the market's response to the offering will be crucial, as it will provide insights into investor confidence in Wabtec's long-term financial health and growth prospects.Furthermore, the involvement of prominent financial institutions as joint book-running managers could enhance the offering's credibility. The market will closely observe the uptake of the notes and the subsequent impact on Wabtec's stock performance, as large-scale debt offerings can sometimes lead to short-term volatility in share prices. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, Wabtec's adherence to SEC regulations by filing an automatic shelf registration statement is noteworthy. This compliance ensures that the offering meets all necessary legal standards and provides transparency to potential investors. The legal framework surrounding such offerings is designed to protect investors and the integrity of the financial markets.Investors should be aware of the legal guarantees provided by Wabtec’s subsidiaries, as these guarantees can affect the overall risk profile of the investment.

Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Greif, Inc. (GEF) declares quarterly cash dividends of $0.52 per share for Class A Common Stock and $0.78 per share for Class B Common Stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of quarterly cash dividends by Greif, Inc. indicates a stable or positive outlook on the company's cash flow and profitability. Dividends are often seen as a signal of confidence by the management in the company's future earning potentials. A consistent or increasing dividend payout can attract income-focused investors and potentially increase the stock's demand, leading to a higher share price.However, it is essential to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price. If the yield is significantly higher than the industry average, it could indicate that the share price has declined due to underlying issues, or it might suggest an exceptionally generous dividend policy. Conversely, a lower yield might reflect a higher share price or a conservative dividend approach. Market Research Analyst Examining Greif, Inc.'s dividend announcement in the context of the industrial packaging sector provides insights into the company's competitive positioning. The packaging industry is typically characterized by stable demand, which can support consistent dividend payouts. However, factors such as raw material costs, supply chain efficiency and environmental regulations can significantly impact profit margins.Investors may want to consider how Greif's dividend payout ratio—the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends—compares with its peers. A high payout ratio could limit the company's ability to reinvest in growth opportunities or weather economic downturns. Conversely, a lower ratio could suggest a more cautious approach, potentially signaling room for future dividend growth or investment in strategic initiatives. Economist From an economic perspective, dividend declarations can be reflective of broader economic conditions. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividend-paying stocks like Greif, Inc. become more attractive as they offer better yields than many fixed-income alternatives. However, if interest rates are rising, dividend stocks might lose some appeal, as fixed-income yields become more competitive.Additionally, the timing of the dividend payments can have implications for the stock's performance. The ex-dividend date, which is typically set two business days before the record date, can see increased trading volume as investors position themselves to capture the dividend. This can sometimes lead to short-term volatility in the stock price. 02/26/2024 - 05:11 PM DELAWARE, Ohio, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greif, Inc.

(AAN) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on April 3, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 14, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly cash dividend by The Aaron's Company, Inc. is a strong signal to investors regarding the company's current financial health and its confidence in generating consistent cash flows. A dividend of $0.125 per share translates to a yield that investors will compare against industry benchmarks and risk-free rates to assess attractiveness. It's important to note how this dividend payment aligns with the company's historical payout ratios and whether it is sustainable given its earnings, free cash flow and debt levels.From a shareholder's perspective, regular dividends often imply a reliable income stream, which can be particularly appealing to income-focused investors. However, it's also critical to evaluate the opportunity cost of these dividends, as the funds could alternatively be used for reinvestment in the company to fuel growth. The impact on the stock market could be twofold: a potential increase in share price due to perceived financial stability and attractiveness to dividend investors, balanced against any concerns about whether the capital allocation is optimal for long-term growth. Market Research Analyst Assessing the market implications of The Aaron's Company's dividend announcement requires an understanding of the broader retail and lease-to-own industry's performance. The sector's health, consumer spending trends and competitive landscape all play roles in determining whether the dividend is a sign of strength or a defensive move in a challenging market. It's also vital to consider the reaction of the market to similar announcements from competitors, as this could indicate whether Aaron's dividend policy is in line with market expectations or if it stands out as an exception.Furthermore, the timing of the announcement and the dividend's payment date could be strategically chosen to align with market sentiment and fiscal periods. Investors will often look for patterns in dividend growth, payout consistency and timing to gauge management's forward-looking strategies and the potential impact on the company's stock performance. 02/26/2024 - 05:00 PM ATLANTA, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Aaron's Company, Inc.

The company's ability to generate $24 million of cash flow from operations and $16 million in free cash flow is noteworthy, as it reflects operational efficiency and a strong cash conversion cycle. The reduction in capital expenditures forecast for 2024, by approximately 75%, suggests a strategic shift towards capital preservation and could signal a maturation of the company's investment phase. This conservative approach to capex, combined with the reduction of net debt by $10 million within a quarter, demonstrates a commitment to strengthening the balance sheet.Share repurchases and dividend increases send a positive signal to the market, indicating the management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value and future performance. The 9% increase in the dividend reflects a strong commitment to shareholder returns, which can be attractive to income-focused investors. However, the decline in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year and sequential basis should be a point of concern and warrants further investigation into the underlying causes, such as market demand and operational challenges. Market Research Analyst The decrease in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA suggests that Solaris may be experiencing headwinds in the market, potentially due to decreased demand for ancillary last mile logistics services or a reduction in the number of frac crews followed. The oilfield services industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to oil prices, which can impact the number of active drilling sites and subsequently, the demand for Solaris' services. The 5% decrease in fully utilized systems from the previous quarter indicates a potential decrease in market share or competitive pressures.While the company's strategic focus on free cash flow generation is commendable, stakeholders should monitor the industry trends closely. The expected significant increase in free cash flow in 2024 could provide Solaris with the flexibility to pursue organic and inorganic growth opportunities, but it is essential to consider the broader market context and competitive landscape when evaluating these future prospects. Economist The company's financial strategy, particularly the reduction of borrowings and the significant decrease in planned capital expenditures, suggests a response to broader economic conditions that may favor fiscal prudence. In an environment where interest rates may rise, reducing leverage is a prudent measure to mitigate interest rate risk. Furthermore, the reduction in capital expenditures could be seen as a response to potential economic slowdowns, which typically lead to reduced demand for commodities such as oil.The commitment to shareholder returns through both dividends and share repurchases could be interpreted as an attempt to bolster investor confidence during uncertain economic times. However, it's important to balance these returns with the need to invest in the business and maintain operational capabilities. The 20% increase in Solaris’ dividend per share since initiation, coupled with a 9% net reduction in total shares outstanding over the last five years, reflects a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy but may raise questions about long-term growth strategies in the context of a potentially contracting market. 02/26/2024 - 05:00 PM Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary Results and Shareholder Return Highlights Revenue of $63 million Net income of $7 million, or $0.14 per diluted Class A share; Adjusted pro forma net income of $7 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share Adjusted EBITDA of $21 million Generated $24 million of cash flow from operations and $16 million in free cash flow; reduced borrowings outstanding on the credit facility by $7 million Returned a total of $47 million to shareholders in 2023 through share repurchases and dividends Solaris’ fourth quarter 2023 dividend of $0.12 per share, which was paid on December 11, 2023, was a 9% increase from the prior quarter and represented Solaris’ third per-share dividend raise since initiation in 2018 Approved first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.12 per share on February 19, 2024, to be paid on March 21, 2024, which, once paid, will represent Solaris’ 22nd consecutive dividend Repurchased approximately 85,000 shares for $0.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2023; from January 19, 2024 to February 9, 2024, repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for approximately $8 million HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. (NYSE:SOI) (“Solaris” or the “Company”), today announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial and operational results. “2023 was a strong year for Solaris on multiple fronts. We generated positive free cash flow, raised our dividend per share twice, returned $47 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and grew Adjusted EBITDA by 15% from the prior year as we built a fleet of new equipment and deployed more Solaris systems on the well sites we service,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Zartler commented. “Looking to 2024, we expect to generate significantly higher free cash flow as we harvest cash from the organic investments we made over the last couple of years. We believe this additional cash flow should support continued shareholder returns and maintain our healthy balance sheet, while creating optionality in our long-term strategy for capital allocation, including organic and inorganic investments.” Shareholder Returns On October 25, 2023, Solaris’ Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.12 per share of Class A common stock, which was paid on December 11, 2023 to holders of record as of December 1, 2023, and a distribution of $0.12 per unit for holders of units in Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, LLC (“Solaris LLC,” and such holders “Solaris LLC Unitholders”), subject to the same payment and record date, or approximately $5 million in aggregate to shareholders. This represented a 9% raise in Solaris’ per-share dividend as compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the third dividend raise in Solaris’ history since initiation in 2018. On February 19, 2024, Solaris’s Board of Directors approved a first quarter 2024 cash dividend of $0.12 per share of Class A common stock, to be paid on March 21, 2024 to holders of record as of March 11, 2024, and a distribution of $0.12 per unit to Solaris LLC Unitholders, which is subject to the same payment and record dates, or approximately $5 million in aggregate to shareholders. Solaris repurchased 85,278 shares during the fourth quarter of 2023 for $0.7 million. From January 19, 2024 to February 9, 2024, Solaris repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for approximately $8.1 million. Approximately $15 million remains in the current share repurchase authorization. Since initiating the repurchase authorization in the first quarter of 2023, Solaris has repurchased a total of 4.3 million shares of Class A common stock. Pro forma for the announced first quarter 2024 dividend and share repurchases to date, Solaris has returned approximately $172 million cumulatively to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases since 2018, of which $47 million was returned in 2023. These shareholder returns also reflect a 20% increase in Solaris’ dividend per share since initiation and an approximately 9% net reduction in total shares outstanding over the last five years. Free Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Liquidity Free cash flow (defined as net cash provided by operating activities less investment in property, plant and equipment) after asset disposals was positive $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, including a working capital source of $4 million and capital expenditures of $7 million. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately $7 million, down over 50% from the third quarter of 2023, and were primarily related to manufacturing of top fill systems. Capital expenditures for full year 2023 were $64 million and Solaris expects full year 2024 capital expenditures to be less than $15 million, an approximately 75% year over year reduction. As of December 31, 2023, Solaris had $6 million of cash on the balance sheet. Solaris reduced net borrowings on the credit facility by $7 million and ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $30 million in borrowings outstanding and $47 million of liquidity. Net debt (defined as total debt outstanding less cash) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 declined to $24 million compared to $34 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Review Net income was $7 million, or $0.14 per diluted Class A share, for fourth quarter 2023, compared to third quarter 2023 net income of $8 million, or $0.16 per diluted Class A share, and fourth quarter 2022 net income of $8 million, or $0.15 per diluted Class A share. Adjusted pro forma net income for fourth quarter 2023 was $7 million, or $0.15 per fully diluted share, compared to third quarter 2023 adjusted pro forma net income of $9 million, or $0.19 per fully diluted share, and fourth quarter 2022 adjusted pro forma net income of $10 million, or $0.22 per fully diluted share. Revenue was $63 million for fourth quarter 2023, which was down 9% from third quarter 2023 and down 25% from fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2023 was $21 million, which was down 9% from third quarter 2023 and down 7% from fourth quarter 2022. The sequential decrease in revenue was driven by decreases in lower-margin ancillary last mile logistics services activity and frac crews followed. The sequential decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by the decline in Solaris system deployments related to fewer frac crews followed, as the average industry frac crew count softened into the end of 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Solaris earned revenue on 103 fully utilized systems, which includes sand systems, top fill systems and AutoBlend™ systems. Total fully utilized systems were down 5% from third quarter 2023 and down 6% from fourth quarter 2022. Solaris followed an average of 64 industry frac crews on a fully utilized basis in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was down 4% from 67 frac crews followed in the third quarter of 2023. See “About Non-GAAP Measures” below for additional detail and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the accompanying financial tables. Full Year 2023 Financial Review Net income was $39 million, or $0.78 per diluted Class A share, for full year 2023, compared to 2022 net income of $34 million, or $0.64 per diluted Class A share. Adjusted pro forma net income for full year 2023 was $37 million, or $0.83 per fully diluted share, compared to 2022 adjusted pro forma net income of $36 million, or $0.76 per fully diluted share. Revenue was $293 million for full year 2023, which was down 8% from 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for full year 2023 was $97 million, which was up 15% from 2022. The sequential decrease in revenue was driven by a decrease in lower-margin ancillary last mile logistics services activity, partially offset by an increase in Solaris system deployments. The higher system deployments drove the sequential increase in Adjusted EBITDA.

SOLARIS OILFIELD INFRASTRUCTURE, INC AND SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION AND CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL MEASURES (In thousands) (Unaudited) EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA We view EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as important indicators of performance. We use them to assess our results of operations because it allows us, our investors and our lenders to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of varying levels of interest expense due to our capital structure, depreciation and amortization due to our asset base and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding trends and other factors affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). We define EBITDA as net income, plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) interest expense and (iii) income tax expense, including franchise taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) stock-based compensation expense and (ii) certain non-cash items and extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring gains, losses or expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results of operation and financial condition as reported in accordance with GAAP. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternative to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated. Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2023 2022 Net income $ 6,959 $ 7,988 $ 7,638 $ 38,775 $ 33,512 Depreciation and amortization 9,518 8,657 9,179 36,185 30,433 Interest expense, net 912 181 1,057 3,307 489 Income taxes (1) 1,370 1,913 1,305 7,820 7,803 EBITDA $ 18,759 $ 18,739 $ 19,179 $ 86,087 $ 72,237 Property tax contingency (2) — — — — 3,072 Stock-based compensation expense (3) 1,911 1,427 1,917 7,732 6,092 Loss on disposal of assets (4 ) 2,729 746 386 3,754 Impairment on fixed assets (4) — — 1,423 1,423 — Change in payables related to Tax Receivable Agreement (5) — (10 ) — — (663 ) Credit losses 650 — — 810 (420 ) Other (6) 6 159 163 255 (290 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 21,322 $ 23,044 $ 23,428 $ 96,693 $ 83,782 _________________________ (1) Federal and state income taxes.

The ruling is currently under appeal and we anticipate a ruling to be delivered sometime in the first half of 2024. (3) Represents stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units. (4) Impairment recorded on certain fixed assets classified as assets held for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2023. (5) Reduction in liability due to state tax rate change. (6) Other includes gains on insurance claims and other settlements. ADJUSTED PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER FULLY DILUTED SHARE Adjusted pro forma net income represents net income attributable to Solaris assuming the full exchange of all outstanding membership interests in Solaris LLC not held by Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. for shares of Class A common stock, adjusted for certain non-recurring items that the Company doesn't believe directly reflect its core operations and may not be indicative of ongoing business operations. Adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share is calculated by dividing adjusted pro forma net income by the weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming the full exchange of all outstanding units of Solaris LLC (“Solaris LLC Units”), after giving effect to the dilutive effect of outstanding equity-based awards. When used in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share are supplemental measures of operating performance that the Company believes are useful measures to evaluate performance period over period and relative to its competitors. By assuming the full exchange of all outstanding Solaris LLC Units, the Company believes these measures facilitate comparisons with other companies that have different organizational and tax structures, as well as comparisons period over period because it eliminates the effect of any changes in net income attributable to Solaris as a result of increases in its ownership of Solaris LLC, which are unrelated to the Company's operating performance, and excludes items that are non-recurring or may not be indicative of ongoing operating performance. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share should not be considered alternatives to net income and earnings per share, as determined under GAAP. While these measures are useful in evaluating the Company's performance, it does not account for the earnings attributable to the non-controlling interest holders and therefore does not provide a complete understanding of the net income attributable to Solaris. Adjusted pro forma net income and adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of adjusted pro forma net income to net income attributable to Solaris, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the computation of adjusted pro forma earnings per fully diluted share are set forth below.

Court hearing scheduled for April 26, 2024.","California American Water Files Motion to Dismiss Monterey Peninsula Water Management District's Condemnation Suit Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary California American Water files motion to dismiss Monterey Peninsula Water Management District's lawsuit for eminent domain takeover of water system, citing legal deficiencies. Court hearing scheduled for April 26, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert An eminent domain case such as the one involving California American Water and the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District has significant legal and financial implications. The main point of contention here is the legal standing and authority of the District to initiate a takeover of the water system. From a legal perspective, the case hinges on whether the District has the authorization from both the California Legislature and the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission, which governs municipal boundaries and service areas.Furthermore, the argument that the lawsuit seeks to take property outside the District’s territory could raise substantial questions about jurisdiction and the scope of eminent domain. If the court finds merit in California American Water's motion, it could set a precedent affecting the limits of local government powers in similar cases. Conversely, if the motion is dismissed and the case proceeds, we could see a shift in the balance of power between private utilities and public entities, potentially altering the landscape for utility management and governance in California. Financial Analyst The financial stakes in this eminent domain lawsuit are considerable, not only for California American Water but also for the residents of the Monterey Peninsula. Legal battles of this nature can incur millions of dollars in costs, which may ultimately be borne by taxpayers and customers in the form of higher taxes or water rates. Moreover, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of this case could impact investor confidence in California American Water and potentially affect its stock valuation.An important aspect to consider is the company's claim of the District lacking technical expertise to manage the water system. Should the District succeed in taking over the water system, the transition period and its effectiveness in managing the complex infrastructure could have financial repercussions, ranging from the costs of capacity building to potential disruptions in service that could affect local businesses and the economy. Economist From an economic standpoint, the dispute has implications for resource allocation and efficiency. The Monterey Peninsula's water system is described as one of the most complex in California, suggesting that the management of this system requires specialized expertise. The transition from private to public management could lead to changes in how resources are allocated, potentially impacting water pricing and investment in infrastructure.Additionally, the outcome of this lawsuit could influence the broader debate on the privatization versus public management of essential utilities. It raises questions about economic efficiency, public welfare and the role of competition in service provision. The case could serve as a microcosm for similar debates happening nationally and could have ripple effects on how other regions approach the management of critical resources. 02/26/2024 - 10:05 PM PACIFIC GROVE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, California American Water filed a motion asking the Monterey County Superior Court to dismiss the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District's (District) lawsuit seeking a government takeover of the company's Monterey Peninsula water system through eminent domain. The motion argues that the District’s lawsuit fails to meet fundamental legal requirements necessary to proceed with such a significant action and should be dismissed. The motion is scheduled for a hearing by the court on April 26, 2024. ""We remain committed to serving the Monterey Peninsula community with safe, reliable water service, and we will continue to do so,"" said Evan Jacobs, Senior Director of External Affairs for California American Water. ""The condemnation suit is going to waste millions of dollars in legal fees negatively impacting our residents, and we believe the District has neither the legal standing nor technical expertise to provide retail water service on the Monterey Peninsula."" California American Water’s motion asserts that the District lacks legal authorization from both the California Legislature and the Monterey County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) to become the retail water service provider on the Monterey Peninsula. In addition, California American Water asserts that the District’s lawsuit improperly seeks to take property outside the boundaries of the District’s territory. ""The residents who must pay the taxes and fees to support the District deserve sustainable water supplies, not more litigation and an unnecessary waste of District resources,"" added Jacobs. California American Water and its predecessor companies have operated the Monterey Peninsula’s water system for more than 60 years. The system currently serves roughly 100,000 people with a network of over 680 miles of pipeline and over 100 storage tanks. It is one of the most complex water systems in California.

The net proceeds are estimated at approximately $1,728.4 million, to be used for redeeming existing notes and general corporate purposes.","Wesco Announces Pricing of Private Offering of Senior Notes Due 2029 and Senior Notes Due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary WESCO International, Inc. announces the pricing of $900 million 5-Year Notes and $850 million 8-Year Notes offering by its subsidiary, WESCO Distribution, Inc. The net proceeds are estimated at approximately $1,728.4 million, to be used for redeeming existing notes and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst WESCO International's recent announcement regarding the pricing of its senior notes offering indicates a strategic move to restructure its debt profile. By increasing the aggregate principal amount of both the 5-Year and 8-Year Notes, WESCO Distribution is tapping into the debt market to secure a lower interest rate compared to its existing 7.125% senior notes due 2025. This is a common financial strategy known as refinancing, which can lead to interest expense savings and improved cash flow management.The choice to issue these notes at 100% of the aggregate principal amount suggests that the market conditions are favorable for WESCO, reflecting investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness. However, investors should be mindful of the debt-to-equity ratio post-issuance, as an increase in debt levels can impact the company's financial leverage and potentially its stock price. The use of proceeds to reduce other forms of debt, like the Receivables Facility and the ABL Facility, indicates a proactive approach to debt management which could be seen positively by the market. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding WESCO's offering is critical to understand the regulatory implications. The offering is being conducted under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons without the need for a public registration. This approach is often used to expedite the capital-raising process and reach a wider pool of potential investors.However, the lack of registration with the Securities Act means that these securities have limited liquidity and are subject to certain restrictions on resale. This could impact the attractiveness of the notes to some investors who prefer more liquid investments. Additionally, the guarantees provided by WESCO and Anixter Inc. add a layer of assurance for investors, as these entities are backing the obligations, which could influence the demand and pricing of the notes. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the issuance of senior notes by WESCO Distribution reflects broader industry trends where companies are seeking to lock in interest rates before potential rate hikes. The indicated rates of 6.375% for the 5-Year Notes and 6.625% for the 8-Year Notes are competitive within the current market environment and signal WESCO's assessment of future interest rate movements.It's important for stakeholders to consider the credit rating of WESCO and its subsidiaries, as it affects the cost of borrowing and investor perception. The successful issuance of these notes could be a testament to WESCO's operational stability and market position, but investors should also consider the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its increased debt obligations. The planned redemption of the Wesco 2025 Notes will likely be viewed favorably, as it suggests a reduction in near-term financial risk. 02/26/2024 - 08:06 PM PITTSBURGH, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WESCO International, Inc. (NYSE: WCC) (""Wesco""), a leading provider of business-to-business distribution, logistics services, and supply chain solutions, today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, WESCO Distribution, Inc. (""Wesco Distribution""), priced its previously announced offering (the ""Offering"") to eligible purchasers of $900 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2029 (the ""5-Year Notes"") and $850 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due 2032 (the ""8-Year Notes"" and, together with the 5-Year Notes, the ""Notes""). The aggregate principal amount of the 5-Year Notes to be issued in the Offering has been increased from the previously announced $750 million to $900 million. The aggregate principal amount of the 8-Year Notes to be issued in the Offering has been increased from the previously announced $750 million to $850 million. The 5-Year Notes will be issued at a price of 100.000 % of the aggregate principal amount thereof. The 8-Year Notes will be issued at a price of 100.000% of the aggregate principal amount thereof. The issuance and sale of the Notes is scheduled to settle on March 7, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Wesco estimates that the net proceeds from the Offering will be approximately $1,728.4 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and estimated offering expenses. Wesco Distribution intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering to redeem all of its outstanding 7.125% senior notes due 2025 (the ""Wesco 2025 Notes"") on or after June 15, 2024 and for general corporate purposes. Prior to repaying the Wesco 2025 Notes, Wesco Distribution intends to (i) use the net proceeds from this Offering temporarily to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under its accounts receivable securitization facility (the ""Receivables Facility"") and to repay all of the outstanding borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facility (the ""ABL Facility""), and (ii) subsequently redraw under the Receivables Facility and the ABL Facility in an aggregate amount sufficient to redeem the Wesco 2025 Notes. The Notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated debt obligations of Wesco Distribution, and will rank equally with Wesco Distribution's other existing and future unsecured, unsubordinated obligations. The Notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by Wesco and its wholly owned subsidiary, Anixter Inc. (the ""Guarantees""). The Notes and related Guarantees will be offered only to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and to non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States under Regulation S of the Securities Act. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws. This press release does not and will not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the Notes or any other securities, nor will there be any sale of the Notes or other securities, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful. Any offer will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. This press release does not constitute a notice of redemption with respect to the Wesco 2025 Notes.

Announces Notice to the Market of Filing of Form 20-F Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A. announces filing of Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2023 with SEC and CVM. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Reviewing the annual financial disclosures such as the Form 20-F for Banco Santander Brasil provides critical insights into the bank's financial health and operational performance over the previous year. Key financial metrics to scrutinize include net income, return on equity (ROE) and non-performing loan (NPL) ratios. A significant deviation from the industry averages in these metrics could indicate underlying strengths or weaknesses in the bank's operations. Additionally, the bank's capital adequacy ratio, as per Basel III guidelines, is essential for assessing its resilience against potential financial shocks.An upward trend in ROE suggests efficient use of shareholder equity, while improvements in NPL ratios could point to better credit risk management. However, stakeholders should also consider macroeconomic factors such as interest rate fluctuations and currency volatility, as these can have material impacts on the bank's financial outcomes, particularly for a bank operating in an emerging market like Brazil. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Banco Santander Brasil's financial results can influence investor sentiment and stock performance. Investors often look for growth in key areas such as net interest income, which is driven by the bank's lending activities. Additionally, the bank's strategy in digital banking adoption and fintech partnerships can be a significant indicator of its future competitiveness and ability to capture market share in Brazil's banking sector.Market trends such as the increasing demand for digital banking services in Brazil, driven by a tech-savvy population, are relevant. The bank's investments in technology and digital infrastructure, as mentioned in the 20-F, could signal its commitment to innovation and customer experience enhancement. Such strategic initiatives are likely to impact the bank's long-term valuation and market position. Economist An economist's viewpoint would entail examining the broader economic implications of Banco Santander Brasil's financial results. The bank's performance can be a bellwether for the Brazilian economy, particularly in reflecting credit growth and consumer confidence. A robust set of financials might suggest a healthy lending environment and potentially signal economic expansion. Conversely, signs of stress in the bank's loan portfolio could hint at broader economic challenges.Furthermore, the bank's exposure to different sectors and its credit portfolio diversification are crucial in understanding systemic risks and the potential impact of economic downturns on its operations. The economist would also evaluate the bank's provisions for loan losses and how these align with current economic forecasts, inflation rates and monetary policy changes in Brazil. 02/26/2024 - 04:49 PM SAO PAULO, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Banco Santander (Brasil) S.A.

Positive None. Negative NSTGQ faces legal challenges due to doubts raised by the court regarding financial disclosures and business practices. 02/26/2024 - 06:18 PM Court expresses significant doubts about the validity of the patent asserted by 10x Genomics in its ongoing litigation with NanoString SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NanoString Technologies, Inc. (OTC: NSTGQ) (“NanoString”), a leading provider of life science tools for discovery and translational research, today announced that the European Unified Patent Court (“UPC”) Court of Appeal overturned a preliminary injunction that was previously issued by the Munich local division of the UPC in September and was impacting NanoString’s CosMx™ Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) products in the EU. The decision allows NanoString to immediately resume sales of all CosMx products in 16 impacted UPC member countries. In its detailed ruling, the court cited substantial concerns about the invalidity of the asserted claim of European Patent 4108782B1 (the “‘782 Patent”), noting that it is “highly probable that the patent will not prove to be legally valid.” “We have maintained from the outset of this case that the patents being asserted by 10x and Harvard against us are invalid. The court’s ruling is significant validation of our position. We are grateful to the UPC Court of Appeal for its in-depth analysis of the validity of the patent at issue and feel vindicated by its finding that it is ‘overwhelmingly likely’ that the patent is invalid on the basis of prior art,” said Brad Gray, President and CEO of NanoString. “Going back to 2021, 10x has chosen to deploy a highly questionable litigation campaign against NanoString and several other innovative companies in the marketplace in what we believe is an effort to eliminate competition in the research tools space to the detriment of science and the public good,” Gray continued. “We believe that with today’s decision, the tide is turning in favor of NanoString and scientific freedom. By seeking to enforce invalid and ill-gotten patents, 10x has caused untold disruption to scientific progress and tremendous harm to NanoString’s customers, employees, and investors. NanoString is committed to continuing our fight for choice and intends to seek damages that will compensate for the hardship caused by the plaintiffs’ unjustified preliminary injunction. Throughout this process, we will remain steadfast in our mission to invest our resources in innovation as opposed to litigation.” Today’s decision lifts the preliminary injunction in all 17 UPC member countries in the EU. In a separate decision in December concerning the related European patent 2794928 B1 (the “‘928 Patent”), the German Higher Regional Court of Munich ordered the lifting of an injunction on the sale of CosMx products in Germany subject to a security bond payment. NanoString is evaluating its next steps in Germany in light of today’s decision from the UPC and for now the German injunction remains in place. Earlier in February, in an open letter to Genetic Engineering News, leading scientists sounded the alarm on the negative impact that patent litigation is having on the field of spatial biology and called for antitrust action. NanoString provides the scientific community with highly effective spatial biology tools with capabilities for both spatial transcriptomics and spatial proteomics that exceed those of any other spatial analysis systems. The company is proud of the role its CosMx SMI products serve in helping the scientific community to better understand the genome and its functions and ultimately drive breakthrough scientific discoveries that produce lifesaving medical benefits for patients around the world. The CosMx SMI platform has been installed at approximately 180 customer sites to date.

Financial Analyst The acquisition of 75 USPS properties by Postal Realty Trust, Inc. represents a strategic expansion of their real estate portfolio, which is noteworthy for investors considering the company's growth trajectory. The $20.7 million investment, excluding closing costs, enhances the company's asset base and is likely to contribute to its revenue stream, given the 100% collection of contractual rents. The increase in rental income by 20% from 2022 to 2023 is a strong indicator of the company's ability to scale its operations effectively.Furthermore, the consistent raise in dividends for the fifth consecutive year signals a confidence in the company's financial health and a commitment to delivering shareholder value. The raised dividend, coupled with a net income of $3.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share and an AFFO of $27.3 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, may attract income-focused investors looking for stability in their investments. However, it is crucial to consider the company's debt position, with approximately $239 million of net debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.14% and assess the sustainability of these dividend increases in the context of their long-term debt obligations. Real Estate Investment Trust Analyst The operational metrics provided by Postal Realty Trust, Inc., such as the 99.7% occupancy rate and the acquisition of properties with a weighted average rental rate of $12.27 per leasable square foot, are strong indicators of the company's portfolio quality and management's effectiveness. The differentiation in rental rates between last-mile, flex and industrial properties reflects a strategic positioning that caters to different segments of the USPS's operational needs.Investors should note the company's proactive capital markets activity, including the issuance of shares and the amendment of credit facilities to add a SOFR-based option, which demonstrates an agile approach to financing and interest rate management. The use of interest rate swaps to fix rates on term loans is a prudent move to hedge against potential interest rate volatility. This financial maneuvering is essential for maintaining a healthy balance sheet and ensuring the company's ability to continue its growth without undue financial strain. Market Research Analyst The broader implications of Postal Realty Trust, Inc.'s results and activities within the market context are multifaceted. On one hand, their targeted investment in properties leased to the USPS leverages the stability of a government tenant, which could be seen as a defensive play in a volatile market. On the other hand, the company's exposure to the USPS comes with inherent risks, such as changes in government funding or postal service operations that could impact the demand for such properties.The real estate investment market is highly competitive and Postal Realty Trust's focus on USPS properties differentiates it from other REITs that have a more diversified tenant base. As e-commerce continues to grow, the demand for last-mile delivery centers is likely to increase, potentially benefiting Postal Realty Trust. However, investors should also be mindful of the macroeconomic environment, including interest rates and real estate market trends, which can significantly impact REIT valuations and performance. 02/26/2024 - 04:40 PM - Acquired 75 USPS Properties for $20.7 Million in Fourth Quarter 2023 -- Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of $0.12 and Adjusted Funds from Operations of $1.07 Per Diluted Share for the Year Ended 2023 -- Raised Dividend Per Share for Fifth Consecutive Year -- Collected 100% of Contractual Rents - CEDARHURST, N.Y., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Postal Realty Trust, Inc.

The Company further exercised $25.0 million of term loan accordion under the term loan maturing in January 2027 and, on a delayed-draw basis, $10.0 million of term loan accordion under the term loan maturing in February 2028. In connection with the accordion exercise, the Company also entered into an interest rate swap that effectively fixed the interest rate on the $25.0 million of term loan through January 2027 at a current rate of 5.736%. On September 27, 2023, the Company fixed the interest rate on the $10.0 million of term loan through February 2028 at a current rate of 6.049%. During the year, the Company issued through its at-the-market offering program 1,861,407 shares of common stock at an average gross sales price of $14.94 per share. In 2023, the Company entered into its first forward sales transactions and, as of December 31, 2023, all shares from the transactions had been settled. In addition, the Company issued 693,648 common units in its operating partnership at an average price of $13.87 per unit during the year as part of consideration for property acquisitions.

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Information An explanation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release, including, FFO, AFFO and net debt, as well as reconciliations of those non-GAAP financial measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is included below. The Company calculates FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition. NAREIT currently defines FFO as follows: net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, and impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by an entity. Other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than the Company does and therefore the Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs. The Company calculates AFFO by starting with FFO and adjusting for recurring capital expenditures (defined as all capital expenditures and leasing costs that are recurring in nature, excluding expenditures that (i) are for items identified or existing at the time a property was acquired or contributed (including through the Company’s formation transactions), (ii) are part of a strategic plan intended to increase the value or revenue-generating ability of a property, (iii) are considered infrequent or extraordinary in nature, or (iv) for casualty damage), acquisition-related expenses (defined as expenses that are incurred for investment purposes and business acquisitions and do not correlate with the ongoing operations of the Company’s existing portfolio, including due diligence costs for acquisitions not consummated and certain professional fees incurred that were directly related to completed acquisitions or dispositions and integration of acquired business) that are not capitalized, and certain other non-recurring expenses and then adding back non-cash items including: write-off and amortization of deferred financing fees, straight-line rent and other adjustments (including lump sum catch up amounts for increased rents, net of any lease incentives), fair value lease adjustments, income on insurance recoveries from casualties, non-real estate depreciation and amortization and non-cash components of compensation expense. AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be viewed as an alternative to net income calculated in accordance with GAAP as a measurement of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes that AFFO is widely used by other REITs and is helpful to investors as a meaningful additional measure of the Company’s ability to make capital investments. Other REITs may not define AFFO in the same manner as the Company does and therefore the Company’s calculation of AFFO may not be comparable to such other REITs. The Company calculates its net debt as total debt less cash and property-related reserves. Net debt as of December 31, 2023 is calculated as total debt of approximately $242 million less cash and property-related reserves of approximately $2.8 million. These metrics are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be viewed as an alternative measurement of the Company’s operating performance to net income. Management believes that accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, the Company believes that the additive use of FFO and AFFO, together with the required GAAP presentation, is widely-used by the Company’s competitors and other REITs and provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s performance and a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make investment decisions.

Amended credit facility to increase leverage ratio covenant. Financial Analyst Examining the financial results of Douglas Dynamics, Inc. for the full year 2023, the company's net sales decreased to $568.2 million from $616.1 million the previous year, reflecting a 7.8% decline. This contraction in sales is substantial, potentially indicating reduced market demand or operational challenges. The gross profit margin also saw a slight compression from 24.6% to 23.6%, which suggests that while the company has maintained some pricing power or cost control, margins are under pressure.The net income reduction to $23.7 million from $38.6 million is a significant drop of approximately 38.6% and the diluted earnings per share (EPS) followed suit, decreasing from $1.63 to $0.98. Such a decrease in profitability metrics can negatively influence investor sentiment and the company's valuation. Furthermore, the increase in interest expense from $11.3 million to $15.7 million is a concern, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, as it impacts the company's cost of capital and net income.From a liquidity standpoint, the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow is alarming, as it may affect the company's ability to invest in growth opportunities or return capital to shareholders. The decision to maintain the dividend at $0.295, despite the downturn in financial performance, indicates a commitment to shareholder returns but raises questions about the sustainability of such a policy if the financial situation does not improve. Market Research Analyst The company's performance was heavily influenced by external factors, particularly the unprecedented weather trends that led to a lack of snowfall. This environmental anomaly had a direct impact on the Work Truck Attachments segment, which experienced a decline in net sales from $382.3 million to $291.7 million. The company's reliance on seasonal weather patterns exposes it to significant risk and volatility in demand.In response to these challenges, Douglas Dynamics has implemented a 2024 Cost Savings Program, which is projected to yield $8 – 10 million in annual pre-tax savings. This strategic move to reduce costs is critical in mitigating the impact of lower sales volumes. However, the success of these measures will depend on the company's ability to effectively streamline operations without compromising its ability to capitalize on market recovery.The backlog remains elevated at approximately $296 million, which could be a sign of pent-up demand or supply chain issues. This backlog figure is an important indicator for future revenue potential and warrants close monitoring. Economist The company's results and outlook are influenced by broader economic factors such as interest rates and economic conditions. The rising interest expense is indicative of the broader macroeconomic environment of rising interest rates, which increases the cost of borrowing and can compress corporate earnings.The amendment of the credit facility to increase the leverage ratio covenant suggests a need for greater financial flexibility, which could be a response to the challenges faced in 2023. This move, while providing immediate relief, will be critical to monitor as it may affect the company's financial stability and creditworthiness in the long term.Looking ahead, the company's projection of sales growth and adjusted EBITDA for 2024 suggests optimism for a rebound. However, these projections are based on assumptions of stable economic conditions and a return to average snowfall, both of which are uncertain. Investors should consider the potential volatility and risks associated with these projections, especially given the unpredictable nature of weather-related demand. 02/26/2024 - 06:00 PM Full Year 2023 Highlights: Work Truck Solutions produced significantly improved 2023 resultsWork Truck Attachments performance hindered by unprecedented weather trendsImplementation of 2024 Cost Savings Program on track to deliver $8 – 10 million in annualized savingsDelivered Net Sales of $568.2 million, Net Income of $23.7 million, and Diluted Earnings per Share of $0.98 Announced 1Q24 quarterly dividend of $0.295 per shareOutlined 2024 full year outlook MILWAUKEE, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Douglas Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE: PLOW), North America’s premier manufacturer and upfitter of work truck attachments and equipment, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “The improved performance of our Solutions segment was clearly the highlight of 2023,” commented Bob McCormick, President and CEO. “I want to commend the Solutions team for their dedication and ingenuity and am pleased the 2024 outlook remains positive, with more opportunities to grow and improve ahead of us.” “The weather was not in our favor in 2023, which is shown in the Attachments segment results this year. The unprecedented lack of snowfall means our operational discipline has been put to full use and we took the proactive steps to implement significant budget cuts and other cost saving measures throughout 2023, to minimize the impact on our bottom line. At the start of 2024, we made tough decisions to align our structure to the current demand environment. We look forward to improved weather conditions and driving volumes as demand returns.” Consolidated Results $ in millions(except Margins & EPS)Q4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022Net Sales$134.3 $159.8 $568.2 $616.1 Gross Profit Margin22.0% 23.7% 23.6% 24.6% Income from Operations$12.6 $16.7 $44.9 $58.8 Net Income$7.1 $11.5 $23.7 $38.6 Diluted EPS$0.29 $0.49 $0.98 $1.63 Adjusted EBITDA$14.9 $22.9 $68.1 $86.8 Adjusted EBITDA Margin11.1% 14.3% 12.0% 14.1% Adjusted Net Income$4.5 $12.3 $24.4 $43.5 Adjusted Diluted EPS$0.19 $0.52 $1.01 $1.84 Fourth quarter and Full Year 2023 results were lower compared to the previous year, primarily due to the significant impact of lack of snowfall in core markets on Work Truck Attachments results, which was partially offset by both top and bottom-line improvements at Work Truck Solutions.Full year gross margins remained relatively stable, based on price realization and cost control measures implemented throughout the year, plus improvements at Solutions.Full year Net Income decreased to $23.7 million in 2023 when compared to full year Net Income of $38.6 million in 2022 due to a lack of snowfall in core markets in both the first and fourth quarters of the year, partially offset by the factors described above favorably impacting gross margin.Full year selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 4.1% to $78.8 million for 2023 compared to $82.2 million for the prior year.Interest expense was $15.7 million for 2023 compared to $11.3 million in 2022, which was primarily due to higher borrowings on the revolving line of credit and higher variable interest rates compared to last year.The effective tax rate for 2023 was 18.9% compared to 18.5% for 2022. The rate for 2023 was impacted by a tax benefit related to the purchase of investment tax credits. The rate for 2022 was lower than historical averages due to higher tax credits and state income tax rate changes.Total backlog at the start of 2024 was approximately $296 million and remains significantly elevated compared to historical averages. Work Truck Attachments $ in millions (except Adjusted EBITDA Margin)Q4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022Net Sales$55.4 $97.9 $291.7 $382.3 Adjusted EBITDA$6.2 $18.6 $50.6 $78.2 Adjusted EBITDA Margin11.1% 19.0% 17.3% 20.5% The Attachments segment experienced record low snowfall on the east coast during the 2022-23 snow season, and the trend continued as the fourth quarter 2023 snowfall totals were nearly 70% below the ten-year average.This resulted in the lowest fourth quarter order activity on record and confirmed the equipment replacement cycle has lengthened.For example, until January 2024, there was a record 700 plus day gap between measurable snowfalls in important east coast markets.“As we noted last month, the lack of snowfall was the reason our 2023 results came in well below our expectations. Due to the unprecedented nature of the weather patterns we’ve experienced, it will likely take us more than one snow season to return to an average demand environment. Based on the actions we have taken to control our costs, we believe we are well positioned to manage through this environment.” Work Truck Solutions $ in millions (except Adjusted EBITDA Margin)Q4 2023Q4 2022FY 2023FY 2022Net Sales$78.9 $61.9 $276.5 $233.8 Adjusted EBITDA$8.8 $4.3 $17.6 $8.6 Adjusted EBITDA Margin11.1% 6.9% 6.4% 3.7% The Solutions segment completed a strong finish to 2023 driven by higher volumes and price realization, plus improved production efficiencies.Fourth quarter 2023 Net Sales increased 28%, and Adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 100% compared to the previous year, which produced double digit EBITDA margins.On a full year basis, the segment delivered Net Sales growth of 18% and adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 100% when compared to 2022 results, which is a testament to the progress made on margin improvement and baseline profit initiatives. McCormick noted, “The Solutions team showed significant improvement in 2023 and delivered on its goal of mid-single digit EBITDA margins. Our recent performance bodes well for the coming year, especially as overall demand remains positive, and we still have a strong backlog to work through. We believe the 2023 UAW strike did not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results, but we expect to see some impact in the first quarter of 2024, which has been taken into account with our guidance.” 2024 Cost Savings Program The previously announced 2024 Cost Savings Program is expected to yield annual pre-tax savings of $8 million to $10 million, with approximately 75% of the anticipated annualized savings expected to be realized in 2024.The program focuses on both the Work Truck Attachments segment and corporate functions, primarily in the form of headcount reductions, and is expected to lead to approximately $2 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, incurred primarily in the first quarter of 2024. Capital Allocation & Liquidity Sarah Lauber, Executive Vice President and CFO, explained, “While the dividend remains our top capital allocation priority, based on 2023 results, management and the Board have decided it is prudent to maintain the current dividend at $0.295 for the time being, with the aim of increasing the dividend when conditions allow.” A quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per share of the Company's common stock was declared on December 6, 2023, and paid on December 29, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 19, 2023.The Board of Directors also approved and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.295 per share for the first quarter of 2024. The declared dividend will be paid on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 18, 2024.Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for 2023 decreased to $12.5 million from $40.0 million in 2022 and Free Cash Flow for 2023 decreased to $1.9 million from $28.0 million in 2022. Both are a result of the earnings impact from the lower volumes in Work Truck Attachments.As of December 31, 2023, liquidity comprised of approximately $24.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and borrowing availability of approximately $102.5 million under the revolving credit facility. Amended Credit Facility As previously reported, the Company amended its credit facility, on January 29, 2024, to provide greater financial flexibility by increasing the leverage ratio covenant from 3.5X to 4.25X at December 31, 2023, and 4.0X at March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, returning to 3.5X at September 30, 2024.The Company’s leverage ratio at December 31, 2023 was slightly below 3.5X. 2024 Outlook The projected earnings growth in 2024 includes continued baseline profit improvements, the 2024 Cost Savings Program, and projected higher volumes in Attachments. Ms. Lauber stated, “Following the dismal snowfall totals seen during calendar year 2023, and subsequent lengthened equipment replacement cycle, under this scenario we are assuming approximately half of the weather driven volume decline experienced in 2023 will be recovered in 2024, assuming we see a return to average snowfall.” “Solutions enters 2024 seeing the best conditions since the pandemic, with continued positive demand and backlog trends combined with improved operating performance. With chassis supply expected to remain steady in 2024, the need to replace aging trucks and equipment indicates continued opportunities in the years ahead.” 2024 outlook: Net Sales are expected to be between $600 million and $660 million.Adjusted EBITDA is predicted to range from $70 million to $100 million.Adjusted Earnings Per Share are expected to be in the range of $1.20 per share to $2.10 per share.Adjusted Earnings Per Share are expected to grow between 50% and 100% compared to 2023 results, with further improvement as a multi-year return to average demand takes place in Attachments, and a continued focus on baseline profit improvements and margin expansion.The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%. The long-term financial targets for both segments remain intact: Work Truck Attachments: Sales growth – low to mid-single digit percentagesAdjusted EBITDA margin – mid to high 20%’s Work Truck Solutions: Sales growth – mid to high-single digit percentagesAdjusted EBITDA margin– double digit to low teens Ms. Lauber explained, “For Attachments, we believe the 2024 Cost Savings Program will drive Adjusted EBITDA margin back close to 20%, leaving us well positioned to push for mid to high 20s margins as a multi-year return to average demand takes place. For Solutions, we expect to deliver mid to high single digit sales growth in 2024, with continued improvement towards low double digit EBITDA margins. We also forecast that baseline profit improvement and greater price realization will continue throughout 2024.” The 2024 outlook and long-term financial targets assume the following: Relatively stable economic conditionsStable to slightly improving supply of chassis and componentsCore markets will experience below average or better snowfall in the first quarter of 2024, and average snowfall in the fourth quarter of 2024 With respect to the Company’s preliminary 2024 guidance, the Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP because it does not provide specific guidance for the various extraordinary, nonrecurring, or unusual charges and other certain items. These items have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. As a result, reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance measures to GAAP is not available without unreasonable effort and the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP measures used in this press release are Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share, The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other external users of its consolidated financial statements in evaluating the Company’s operating performance as compared to that of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures can be found at the end of this press release. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as further adjusted for certain charges consisting of unrelated legal and consulting fees, stock-based compensation, severance, restructuring charges, and incremental costs incurred in 2022 related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Such COVID-19 related costs include increased expenses directly related to the pandemic, and do not include either production related overhead inefficiencies or lost or deferred sales. We believe these costs are out of the ordinary, unrelated to our business and not representative of our results. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because it provides the Company and its investors with additional tools to compare its operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company’s core operations. The Company’s management also uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and financial projections, and to evaluate the Company’s ability to make certain payments, including dividends, in compliance with its senior credit facilities, which is determined based on a calculation of “Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” that is substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) represents net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of stock based compensation, severance, restructuring charges, certain charges related to unrelated legal fees and consulting fees, incremental costs incurred in 2022 related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges, net of their income tax impact. Such COVID-19 related costs include increased expenses directly related to the pandemic, and do not include either production related overhead inefficiencies or lost or deferred sales. We believe these costs are out of the ordinary, unrelated to our business and not representative of our results. Adjustments on derivatives not classified as hedges are non-cash and are related to overall financial market conditions; therefore, management believes such costs are unrelated to our business and are not representative of our results. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing the Company’s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance.

The company declares a first quarter regular distribution of $0.32 per share and a supplemental distribution of $0.04. The portfolio has a fair value of $3,027.8 million in 111 companies. Positive NMFC reports a net investment income of $0.40 per weighted average share for the fourth quarter of 2023. The net asset value per share stands at $12.87, showing a decline from $13.06 on September 30, 2023. The Board of Directors declares a first quarter regular distribution of $0.32 per share and a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share. The company's investment portfolio has a fair value of $3,027.8 million across 111 portfolio companies. NMFC generated $142.5 million of originations for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $373.8 million, showing growth from the previous year. As of December 31, 2023, all investments in the company's portfolio had a Green Risk Rating, except for a few exceptions. On January 30, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular first quarter 2024 distribution of $0.32 per share and a supplemental distribution of $0.04 per share. The Company issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.875% notes due 2029 on February 1, 2024. Negative The net asset value per share has declined from the previous quarter. The company recorded net realized and unrealized losses for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Total net expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased compared to the previous year. The company's statutory debt to equity ratio stands at 1.14x as of December 31, 2023. NMFC sold 1,621,833 shares of common stock under its equity distribution agreement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $21.2 million. Financial Analyst The reported net investment income (NII) of $0.40 per share indicates a robust earning capacity for New Mountain Finance Corporation (NMFC) during the fourth quarter. This figure surpasses the regular quarterly distribution of $0.32 per share, suggesting a sustainable dividend policy. The slight decline in net asset value (NAV) per share from $13.06 to $12.87, while notable, is mitigated by the special dividend paid, reflecting prudent capital management. The statutory debt-to-equity ratio of 1.14x, adjusted to 1.10x net of available cash, is within a reasonable range for business development companies (BDCs), offering a snapshot of leverage and underlying financial health.Investors should note the year-over-year earnings growth, which may signal operational efficiency and effective investment strategies. The portfolio's weighted average yield to maturity (YTM) at cost of approximately 10.9% is indicative of the income-generating potential of the investments, although this figure should be considered with caution as it assumes no prepayments or losses and exits at par at maturity, which may not reflect actual future outcomes. Market Research Analyst NMFC's focus on defensive growth sectors, as highlighted by management, positions the company to potentially weather economic downturns. The portfolio composition, with a majority in first lien loans (55.6%), demonstrates a conservative risk profile. The Risk Rating distribution, with the majority of investments rated Green, suggests overall portfolio health and effective risk management practices. However, the presence of investments in the Red and Orange categories, albeit a small percentage, should be monitored for potential default risks.The recent repayment of 2019A Unsecured Notes and the issuance of 2029 Unsecured Notes with a 6.875% interest rate reflect active capital management. This refinancing strategy may impact future interest expenses and income, which are crucial for a BDC's performance. The supplemental distribution related to fourth-quarter earnings indicates a one-time earnings boost, potentially from successful investment exits or other income-generating activities. Legal Expert From a regulatory standpoint, NMFC's compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, as evidenced by the Form 10-K filing, provides transparency and adheres to the required disclosure norms for publicly traded companies. The repayment of the 2019A Unsecured Notes and the issuance of new notes should be executed in accordance with the terms of the indenture and relevant securities laws. The company's management of statutory debt and adherence to debt covenants is a critical aspect that ensures ongoing legal compliance and financial stability.Investors should be aware of the potential implications of the SEC's focus on BDC practices, including fee structures, valuation methods and performance reporting, which could affect NMFC's operations and reporting requirements. 02/26/2024 - 04:35 PM Reports Net Investment Income of $0.40 per Share Declares a First Quarter Regular Distribution of $0.32 per Share and a Supplemental Distribution of $0.04 per Share NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Mountain Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: NMFC) (“New Mountain,” “NMFC,” “New Mountain Finance” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

Kline, CEO, commented, “New Mountain closed out the fourth quarter with year-over-year earnings growth, outpacing its regular dividend for the fourth consecutive quarter. Additionally, NMFC distributed a $0.10 special dividend at the end of 2023 as a result of our team’s ability to monetize the Haven Midstream equity investment.

As described more fully in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the portfolio monitoring procedures are designed to provide a simple, yet comprehensive analysis of the Company’s portfolio companies based on their operating performance and underlying business characteristics, which in turn forms the basis of its Risk Rating. The Risk Rating is expressed in categories of Red, Orange, Yellow and Green with Red reflecting an investment performing materially below expectations and Green reflecting an investment that is in-line with or above expectations.

Diversified Healthcare Trust Provides Monthly SHOP Performance Update,2024-02-26T21:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) provided an update on its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment. In January 2024, occupancy was 79.0%, with revenue and NOI showing significant increases compared to December 2023 and January 2023.","Diversified Healthcare Trust Provides Monthly SHOP Performance Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) provided an update on its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment. In January 2024, occupancy was 79.0%, with revenue and NOI showing significant increases compared to December 2023 and January 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent performance update from Diversified Healthcare Trust (DHC) reflects a mixed scenario with an overall increase in occupancy rates and revenue in their Senior Housing Operating Portfolio (SHOP) segment compared to the previous year. The reported occupancy of 79.0% in January 2024, despite being slightly lower than December 2023, shows a substantial year-over-year improvement. This could signify a recovering trend in the senior housing market, which had been impacted by the pandemic.Furthermore, the increase in Resident Fees and Services revenue by 11.6% compared to January 2023 indicates a growing demand for DHC's services. The significant rise in Net Operating Income (NOI) by 83.4% year-over-year is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests improved operational efficiency and cost management. This is supported by the reduction in operating expenses due to lower repair and maintenance costs and a decrease in contract labor, despite inflationary pressures on wages and food expenses.Investors and stakeholders might view these results as positive indicators of DHC's ability to navigate challenging economic conditions and drive profitability. The improved NOI margin, now at 7.1%, is a critical metric that reflects the company's profitability from its core operations and could be a positive signal for DHC's financial health. Financial Analyst Analyzing DHC's financials, the NOI margin improvement to 7.1% is substantial when considering the 440 basis points increase from the previous month and the 280 basis points increase year-over-year. This margin expansion suggests that DHC is not only increasing its revenue but also effectively controlling its expenses, a key factor for long-term sustainability.It's important to note that the average monthly rate has increased across both ALR/Five Star Managed Communities and Other Operator Managed Communities. This indicates DHC's pricing power in the market, which is critical in an inflationary environment. The ability to pass on higher costs to consumers without significantly affecting occupancy rates is a strong positive for the company's revenue outlook.However, the financials presented are unaudited and preliminary, which means that these figures are subject to change upon the completion of the quarterly financial close process and review. Investors should exercise caution and await the finalized financial statements before drawing concrete conclusions. Healthcare Industry Analyst The data provided offers insights into the senior housing sector, a niche within the broader healthcare real estate industry. DHC's performance reflects broader trends, such as an aging population and increased demand for senior living options. The reported increase in care level increases at DHC’s communities could be indicative of a shift towards more comprehensive and higher-acuity services, which typically command higher fees.The reduction in the use of discounts and community fees could signal a strategic shift towards maintaining revenue growth, which may have contributed to the improved financial performance. Additionally, the mention of higher property insurance premiums in select markets suggests regional variations in operating costs, which could impact future profitability and operational strategies.Overall, the update from DHC provides a snapshot of the company's adaptability in a dynamic healthcare real estate market and may influence investor perception of the sector's resilience and growth potential. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Diversified Healthcare Trust (Nasdaq: DHC) today provided an update regarding the recent performance of its Senior Housing Operating Portfolio, or SHOP, segment. Monthly Unaudited Results in DHC’s Total SHOP Properties: January 2024 occupancy was 79.0%, 30 basis points below December 2023, and 250 basis points above January 2023. January 2024 Resident Fees and Services revenue was $102.7 million, $3.9 million, or 4.0%, above December 2023, and $10.7 million, or 11.6%, above January 2023. January 2024 net operating income, or NOI, was $7.3 million, $4.6 million, or 175.6%, above December 2023, and $3.3 million, or 83.4%, above January 2023. January 2024 NOI margin was 7.1%, 440 basis points above December 2023, and 280 basis points above January 2023. Revenues increased primarily due to increases in average monthly rate and care level increases at DHC’s communities, partially offset by increased use of discounts and decreased community fees. Operating expenses decreased due to lower repair and maintenance expenses and decreases in contract labor, partially offset by annual wage adjustments and hiring expenses. Year over year, increases were primarily attributable to inflationary effects of higher wages and food expenses, as well as higher property insurance premiums in select markets.

Because the quarterly financial close process and review for that period is not yet complete, DHC’s final results upon completion of its quarterly close process and review may vary from these preliminary estimates. (2) The calculation of NOI shown excludes certain components of net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to DHC's property level results of operations. DHC defines NOI as income from its real estate less its property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions that DHC records as depreciation and amortization. DHC uses NOI to evaluate individual and company wide property level performance. Other real estate companies and real estate investment trusts, or REITs, may calculate NOI differently than DHC does.

TriCo Bancshares Announces Increase in Quarterly Cash Dividend,2024-02-26T21:49:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"TriCo Bancshares (NASDAQ: TCBK) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share on its common stock, marking a 10% increase over the previous quarter.

The company has a history of consistent dividend payments since 1989, showcasing its strength and commitment to shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of TriCo Bancshares' dividend increase is a positive signal to shareholders and potential investors, indicating a robust financial position and a commitment to returning value. A 10% increase over the previous quarter suggests confidence in the company's earnings stability and future cash flows. Historically, consistent dividend payments have been associated with mature, profitable companies with less volatile stock prices. Investors typically view such companies as lower risk, which could potentially lead to a more favorable valuation in the market.However, it's crucial to consider the payout ratio—the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends—to assess sustainability. If the ratio is too high, it may indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its operations, which could hinder long-term growth. Conversely, a moderate payout ratio can signify a balance between rewarding shareholders and funding future expansion or debt reduction. Market Research Analyst TriCo Bancshares' continuous dividend payments since 1989 underscore its market positioning as a reliable financial institution. The announcement may also reflect the company's competitive stance within the regional banking sector, where customer service and community presence play a significant role. The bank's comprehensive range of services, including its affiliation with Raymond James Financial Services for brokerage services, enhances its value proposition and could attract a broader customer base.It's also noteworthy that TriCo Bancshares operates in a sector where customer trust and brand loyalty are paramount. The bank's ability to maintain consistent dividends could be interpreted as a testament to its operational efficiency and prudent financial management, factors that can contribute to customer retention and acquisition. Economist From an economic perspective, steady dividend payments by TriCo Bancshares can be seen as an indicator of economic stability within the regions it serves. As a regional bank, its performance is closely tied to the economic health of Northern and Central California. The bank's dividend policy might reflect broader economic trends, such as employment rates, business growth and consumer spending in these areas.Moreover, the bank's dividend increase could be a response to the current interest rate environment. In a rising interest rate scenario, banks generally benefit from wider net interest margins, which could translate into higher profitability and, subsequently, higher dividends. Investors should consider macroeconomic factors, such as monetary policy and inflation rates, as they can significantly impact the banking industry's performance. 02/26/2024 - 04:49 PM CHICO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of TriCo Bancshares (NASDAQ: TCBK) (the “Company”), parent company of Tri Counties Bank, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 (thirty-three cents) per share on its common stock, no par value on February 22, 2024. The dividend is payable on March 22, 2024, to holders of record on March 8, 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/26/2024 - 04:48 PM Unit Program extended until March 31. DALLAS and CAESAREA, Israel, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. (OTC: ZNOG) announces the full acceptance of its work plan by the Supervisory Committee in Israel. ""On February 21, 2024, members of the Supervisory Committee visited our rig site. During this visit, they interacted with staff from Zion Oil & Gas, and our consultants and potential service providers. Some of these interactions occurred at Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, while others were conducted through video conferencing with participants from US, Europe, and the Middle East, among other locations. I'm pleased to report that following these discussions, the Committee has officially accepted our work plan for the MJ-01 project. This acceptance allows us to sign agreements and secure mobilization dates with our service providers to commence and complete the project,"" announced Zion Oil & Gas CEO, Robert Dunn. PROCESS OF ACCEPTANCEOn September 14, 2023, Zion announced that the Israeli Ministry of Energy had issued a new onshore exploration license – the Megiddo Valleys 434 license. On October 7, 2023, during the Celebration of Simchat Torah, Hamas launched a vicious attack on Israel, which led to a declaration of war that is still in effect. On December 6, 2023, the Israeli Ministry of Energy formally approved a detailed, industry-specific operational framework for the planned reentry, production tests, and recompletion of the MJ-01 well. The submission of this work plan is a requirement under Israeli law. With the work plan approved, Zion was able to proceed with convening the required Supervisory Committee meeting. This Committee, consisting of a fifteen-member panel, is tasked with reviewing and endorsing the work plan. It also ensures that our planned operations have sufficiently mitigated potential impacts on the land, local roads, surrounding land uses, available water resources, and addressed other environmental and safety concerns. Under Israeli law, the Supervisory Committee is composed of representatives from the Ministries of Energy, Water, and Environment, and representatives from the local Spring Valley County Council as well as from the surrounding kibbutzim of Sde Eliyahu (where the rig site is located) and Tirat Zvi (adjacent to Zion's rig site). Due to the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, scheduling a meeting with such a large Committee became more complex, as it required finding a date and time suitable for all members. Zion will deploy cutting-edge technologies and innovative stimulation techniques in the MJ-01 well, aiming to unlock hydrocarbon flows in both previously and newly identified zones of interest. UNIT PROGRAM EXTENSIONWith this news, Zion Oil & Gas is also announcing the extension of its current Unit Program. Originally set to conclude on February 29, 2024, the program will now run until March 31, 2024. This extension offers investors additional time to participate in Zion's vision for Israel's energy independence. Each $250 investment per unit will continue to provide investors with $250 worth of ZNOG stock at the trading day's high-low average and fifty 25-cent Warrants, with the exercise period now extended from April 15, 2024, to April 14, 2025. Investors can participate directly in Zion's mission via the company's website at www.zionoil.com through Zion's Direct Stock Purchase Program. John Brown, Zion Founder and Chairman, expressed gratitude for the unwavering support from Zion's shareholders and the diligent efforts of the team in Israel. ""This achievement reflects God's faithfulness toward advancing Israel's energy landscape. We are deeply thankful for the continuous support of our investors and the many prayers by our supporters during this time of difficulty for Israel.""

The company signed the world's first automotive B-sample joint development agreement, focusing on EV B-sample lines and Avatar AI incident prediction accuracy. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst SES AI Corporation's announcement regarding the development and manufacturing of lithium-metal (Li-Metal) rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and Urban Air Mobility (UAM) applications is a significant step in the automotive and aerospace industries. The joint development agreement for automotive B-sample Li-Metal batteries with a major automaker could potentially disrupt the current EV battery market by introducing a more efficient and possibly lighter battery technology, which is crucial for the range and performance of EVs. The focus on EV B-sample indicates a move towards the commercialization phase, which is a critical milestone for technology companies.Furthermore, the mention of shipping the first batch of UAM cells to customers suggests that SES AI is expanding its market reach and is on the verge of entering a new market segment, which could diversify its revenue streams. UAM, being a nascent industry, offers significant growth potential. The improvement of Avatar AI incident prediction accuracy is an indicator of SES AI's commitment to not only hardware but also software solutions, enhancing the value proposition of their products. Financial Analyst The financial results of SES AI Corporation for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 could have implications for investor confidence and the company's stock valuation. The successful commercialization of Li-Metal technology and the expansion into UAM could lead to increased revenue and market share. However, investors should consider the capital expenditures associated with building and operating new B-sample lines and the dedicated UAM Li-Metal line. These investments are critical for future growth but may impact short-term profitability.It is also important to analyze the company's cash flow and balance sheet to assess the sustainability of its growth plans. The strategic partnerships, like the one mentioned for the B-sample joint development, could also provide financial leverage and risk-sharing benefits. As SES AI progresses towards commercialization, the financial community will closely monitor the return on these investments and the scalability of their operations. Energy Sector Analyst The significance of SES AI Corporation's progress in Li-Metal battery technology lies in its potential impact on the energy sector, particularly in the transition towards renewable energy sources and the electrification of transport. Li-Metal batteries could offer higher energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, which is a game-changer for the EV industry as it could significantly increase vehicle range and reduce charging times.Moreover, the development of UAM cells is aligned with the growing interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for urban transportation. The successful adoption of Li-Metal batteries in this field could catalyze the growth of UAM, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions in urban centers. The energy sector will benefit from advancements in battery technology that enable more efficient storage and use of renewable energy, further supporting the global push towards a low-carbon economy. 02/26/2024 - 04:36 PM World’s first to enter automotive B-sample joint development for Li-Metal.

(DPRO) closes underwritten public offering of 13.4 million units, raising approximately US$3.6 million. Each unit includes a common share and a warrant. The offering price was US$0.27 per unit, with warrants exercisable at US$0.36 per share. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and growth initiatives. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Draganfly's recent completion of a public offering is a strategic move to bolster its financial position, raising approximately US$3.6 million in gross proceeds. This influx of capital is pivotal for the company's growth initiatives and the continued development of its core products. By pricing the units at US$0.27 and including warrants with an exercise price of US$0.36, the company has potentially incentivized future investments while immediately increasing its cash reserves.However, the offering price represents a snapshot of the company's valuation and investors might be concerned about potential dilution of their holdings. The immediate exercisability of the warrants could lead to an increased number of shares in the market, which might put downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. Long-term implications hinge on the company's effective deployment of the raised funds towards initiatives that drive revenue growth and market expansion. Market Research Analyst The drone industry is rapidly evolving and Draganfly's decision to allocate net proceeds from the offering to research and development and potential acquisitions is indicative of its commitment to maintaining a competitive edge. The company's focus on meeting demand for new products is crucial in an industry characterized by rapid technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences.Draganfly's strategic use of the proceeds for marketing its core products is also essential for brand positioning and market penetration. The success of these initiatives will be a determining factor in the company's ability to capitalize on industry growth trends and expand its market share. Investors will be monitoring the effectiveness of these strategies in generating a return on investment. Legal Expert The offering, conducted under an effective shelf registration statement on Form F-10 and a Canadian short form base shelf prospectus, demonstrates Draganfly's adherence to regulatory requirements for such financial activities. The exclusion of Canadian purchasers in this offering is a strategic decision that may be based on varying factors, including market conditions and regulatory considerations.It is important for investors to understand that the offering's legal framework ensures transparency and compliance with the SEC. The availability of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying Base Shelf Prospectus provides essential information that can help investors make informed decisions. The legal structuring of the offering, including the terms of the warrants, is a critical aspect that can influence investor perception and the company's legal obligations moving forward. 02/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Saskatoon, SK., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Draganfly Inc.

(NASDAQ: DCOM) reaffirms its commitment to the FHLBNY Small Business Recovery Grant Program to aid struggling small businesses and non-profits in New York. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The participation of Dime Community Bancshares in the FHLBNY Small Business Recovery Grant Program signals a strategic move towards corporate social responsibility and community engagement. This initiative could potentially enhance the bank's reputation among local customers and small business clients, which is crucial in a competitive banking landscape. By providing financial support to small businesses and non-profits, Dime may see an increase in customer loyalty and new business opportunities as the local economy recovers. Furthermore, such programs can lead to a more stable customer base, as supported businesses are more likely to survive economic downturns.However, investors should monitor the program's financial impact on Dime's balance sheet. While the short-term costs might be evident, the long-term benefits, such as increased deposits and loan demand from thriving local businesses, could outweigh initial expenditures. It's essential to analyze the program's scale and the selection criteria for grant recipients to assess the risk-return profile of this community investment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Dime Community Bancshares' continued participation in the FHLBNY Small Business Recovery Grant Program should be evaluated in terms of its impact on the company's profitability and risk exposure. The program is likely to involve some level of financial outlay, which could affect the bank's short-term earnings. However, the decision to support the program may be viewed positively by investors who prioritize sustainable and responsible business practices.It's important to consider the potential for these grants to act as a stimulus for the local economy, which in turn could lead to a healthier business environment for Dime Community Bank. A thriving small business sector typically results in a higher demand for banking services, including loans and deposit accounts, which could drive revenue growth for the bank. The key will be to balance the immediate costs with the anticipated long-term benefits to the bank's financial position.

By supporting small businesses, Dime Community Bancshares is contributing to the economic resilience of the local community, which is a fundamental aspect of macroeconomic stability.Small businesses are often considered the backbone of the economy and their success is directly tied to employment rates and economic diversity.
