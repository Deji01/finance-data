Since the results came out, bond yields moved away from session highs. Equities wavered after a rally that has defied every doomsday scenario on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 recently notching its longest stretch since 2018 without a drop of at least 2%.Read: US 30-Year Auction Stops Through After Selloff Into Bid Deadline“Today’s 30-year auction was strong,” said Vail Hartman at BMO Capital Markets. “Since the result, Treasuries have rallied in the follow-through.”Treasury 30-year yields rose two basis points to 4.33% after topping 4.35% earlier in the day. The S&P 500 was little changed around 5,180, while the tech heavy-Nasdaq 100 underperformed. Nvidia Corp. slipped 2.5% and Tesla Inc. extended its March selloff on an analyst downgrade. Bitcoin hit $73,000.Skepticism grew in the face of a sharp rally in US stocks since October. The S&P 500 gained in 16 of the past 19 weeks amid enthusiasm around corporate earnings, artificial intelligence and economic strength.“This generally positive set up has underwritten the gains in stocks year to date, although it’s important to note that while the fundamentals are positive, they still don’t justify current valuations, making the market vulnerable to a negative surprise,” Essaye said.Earnings for the S&P 500 grew 7.4% in the fourth quarter from the same time a year ago. Excluding the Magnificent Seven group of technology giants, profits in the index posted a 1.7% contraction, data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence show.Story continues“If the S&P is going to have a strong second half of 2024, corporate earnings growth will need to accelerate,” said Nicholas Colas at DataTrek Research.The trading desk at JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects resurfacing goods inflation will make Fed officials less willing to cut interest rates this year — but that still doesn’t dent its bullish view on US equities.A belated pullback of roughly 5% is possible from “momentum unwind risk,” the team led by Andrew Tyler said Wednesday in note to clients. However, near-term artificial intelligence catalysts may prevent a material down move.Colas at DataTrek remarks that while the Nasdaq Composite rally feels like it is slowing, history shows we can still expect reasonably good returns going forward.The gauge is up over 40% in the last 12 months, more than one standard deviation above the long-run mean of 36%, he noted. A look at index back to 1972 shows similar rallies after prior outsized drawdowns. As long as the US economy continues to grow, the Nasdaq continues to generate positive 12-month returns after a return of over 36%, Colas added.Traders will get another economic check on Thursday, with readings on inflation, retail sales and the labor market.Following a hot reading consumer inflation, the producer price index likely rose amid a rebound in energy prices, according to Estelle Ou at Bloomberg Economics. More importantly, components that enter the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — the core PCE deflator — likely sustained some growth momentum from January, posing upside risks to our current core PCE estimates, she noted.This will be the final inflation report before next week’s Fed decision on rates. With policymakers expected to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting, economists will be looking for clues as to when the central bank will start lowering borrowing costs.“We think yields could drift higher in the lead up to next Wednesday’s FOMC decision, especially if PPI surprises to the upside tomorrow,” said Will Compernolle at FHN Financial. “If there really is a collective shrug from market participants regarding yesterday’s hot CPI, the next potential catalyst for rates to set a new anchor will be next week’s dot plot and the press conference.”To Jose Torres at Interactive Brokers, Tuesday’s CPI results have increased the significance of the Fed’s release of its Summary of Economic Projections, or dot plot, next Wednesday. Investors are currently anticipating that the central bank will lower rates in June and make an additional two cuts by year-end.“The Fed’s dot plot will provide insight into how realistic these expectations are with some members of the Fed implying that one or two cuts this year may be sufficient, rather than the three the market is pricing in,” Torres added.Corporate Highlights:The Pentagon pulled out of a plan to spend as much as $2.5 billion on a chip grant to Intel Corp., people familiar with the situation said, putting the onus on another federal agency — the Commerce Department — to make up for the shortfall.United States Steel Corp. tumbled after a report that Joe Biden plans to express “serious concern” over its proposed takeover by Nippon Steel Corp.Dollar Tree Inc. plans to shutter about 1,000 stores in an effort to improve profitability as the discount retailer battles a spate of litigation and other headwinds.Eli Lilly & Co. is teaming up with Amazon.com Inc. to expand its nascent business of selling weight-loss drugs directly to patients.Adidas AG is sticking with its underwhelming earnings forecast for this year as it works through high inventories of unsold sneakers and apparel in North America, disappointing investors anticipating an improved outlook.BP Plc and the United Arab Emirates’ state oil firm suspended a $2 billion bid to buy a major stake in Israel’s NewMed Energy as the war in Gaza upends politics across the region.Key events this week:US PPI, retail sales, initial jobless claims, business inventories, ThursdayChina property prices, FridayJapan’s largest union federation announces results of annual wage negotiations, just ahead of Bank of Japan policy meeting, FridayBank of England issues inflation survey, FridayUS industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire Manufacturing, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 was little changed as of 1:07 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.2%The MSCI World index rose 0.1%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.2%The euro rose 0.2% to $1.0954The British pound was little changed at $1.2802The Japanese yen was little changed at 147.54 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 2.8% to $73,060.29Ether rose 1% to $3,991.5BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced two basis points to 4.17%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced four basis points to 2.37%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced eight basis points to 4.02%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 2.5% to $79.53 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.8% to $2,175.43 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Robert Brand, Sujata Rao, Cecile Gutscher, Jessica Menton, Michael Mackenzie and Ye Xie.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the USMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?Primaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,"Li Auto Stock Has 86% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst Firm",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/li-auto-stock-86-upside-191400993.html,Can 90% sales growth drive an 86% increase in stock price?,"Li Auto (NASDAQ: LI) stock surged 30% last month after it reported tremendous results for 2023 -- sales up 173.5% year over year, free cash flow growing to $6.2 billion, gross profit margins expanding, and net income flipping from a 2022 loss to a 2023 profit of $1.7 billion. No sooner had this Chinese automaker stomped the accelerator, though, than investors slammed on the brakes.Worries that sales might slow in Q1 2024, reinforced by a weak February deliveries report, sent Li stock tumbling. But according to investment banker Morgan Stanley, this sell-off just set up Li stock for a rebound. One year from now, Li shares should be worth as much as $74 apiece, and if that happens, investors who bought at Tuesday's closing price would get an 86% profit.Is Li Auto stock a buy?Morgan Stanley is taking an aggressive position here, but it's not without merit. At $40 billion in market capitalization, Li stock does look undervalued relative to its $6.2 billion in free cash flow. The stock's price-to-free cash flow ratio is a cheap 6.5. For comparison, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock generated only about $4.3 billion in FCF last year, but its stock costs $565 billion, yielding a P/FCF of 131.True, Li is predicting a slowdown in sales in 2024, but so is Tesla, which told investors in January that its ""vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023."" Viewed in that light, Li's prediction of 90% unit volume growth in Q1 -- while slower than what the stock enjoyed in 2023 -- still looks pretty good.It's also worth pointing out that Li only started generating revenue five years ago, versus 16 years for Tesla. Li's a much younger company, and its growth curve is just getting starting, which suggests the company has a lot more room to grow over the next three to five years.As things stand now, Li looks very much like a growth stock selling for a value stock price.Should you invest $1,000 in Li Auto right now?Before you buy stock in Li Auto, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Li Auto wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Dell Technologies Stock Has 18% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dell-technologies-stock-18-upside-183200510.html,Dell had a great 2024. It's 2029 you should worry about.,"Dell Technologies (NYSE: DELL) stock is red hot -- not because PC demand is growing, but because investors have decided that Dell is now an artificial intelligence (AI) stock, a realization that tripled the share price of the computer company over the last 52 weeks.Last quarter, Dell shipped $800 million worth of AI-optimized servers, as Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan points out in a report covered by StreetInsider, and Dell's backlog of AI server orders nearly doubled in comparison to fiscal Q3 2024. Anticipating that this momentum will continue, Mohan raised his price target on Dell stock Wednesday, to $130 a share -- implying an 18% upside.Is Dell stock a buy?Dell is riding a tailwind from the AI revolution, and this is why Mohan believes the stock will continue to outperform the market. But could it be that $130 is too much to pay for a share of Dell stock over the next year?I think it might be.Consider that while Dell enjoyed strong profit growth last quarter, with EPS up nearly 90% year over year, consensus forecasts for the company's long-term prospects don't anticipate anything like that level of growth remaining sustainable. Over the next five years, for example, S&P Global Market Intelligence forecasts Dell's per-share earnings might rise as high as $7.33 -- which would be only a 68% total increase, and closer to 11% per year, compounded.Ordinarily, for a stock growing at 11%, you'd want to pay no more than 11 times trailing earnings. But Dell stock trades at more than twice that -- 24x earnings.What's holding Dell back? You won't be surprised to learn that Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) could be the culprit. As Mohan observed, Dell has plenty of demand for its products, but its supply of Nvidia GPUs is limited. Simply put, Nvidia, which produces the H100 and H200 AI chips that Dell needs for its servers, has a chokehold on this market. This limits both how quickly Dell can grow server production to meet demand -- and lets Nvidia keep most of the profit for itself.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Dell Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Dell Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dell Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"JD.com Stock Has 38% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jd-com-stock-38-upside-180600990.html,"The company has been posting good growth figures recently, but are they good enough to strap a rocket to the shares?","Despite a recent run-up in price thanks to an encouraging quarterly earnings report, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD) stock is still significantly undervalued. At least, that's the latest take on the company's shares by one analyst tracking the Chinese e-commerce specialist. Let's dig in to find out the reasoning behind this extremely bullish stance.Price target bump followed pleasing fourth-quarter resultsIn reaction to those earnings, HSBC prognosticator Charlene Liu made a small change to her price target on JD.com's stock. Granted, it wasn't a major change, but it still implied plenty of upside for the online retailer. Liu added $1 for a new fair value estimate of $39 per share, and maintained her buy recommendation. That $39 is about 38% higher than the stock's price Wednesday.JD.com notched beats on both the top and bottom lines for its fourth quarter, which were convincing.Revenue increased by nearly 4% year-over-year to slightly more than $43 billion, while per-share net income was 10% higher at $0.75. Collectively, analysts had been modeling a bit over $42 billion for revenue, and per-share profitability of only $0.63.With product sales coming in higher than expected for the period, Liu wrote, she's expecting high single-digit growth for both gross merchandise value and revenue this year compared to 2023.Not the hot economy it used to beThis feels overly optimistic to me. The Chinese economy is under pressure from several directions, including the troubled real estate market and the unpopularity of domestic equities.Economists are predicting continued slowdown in growth, so in the coming years, the nation's consumers might be less eager to buy goods from the company (despite the ease and convenience of doing so). People spend more freely when they're confident about the economy, conversely they're tighter when that confidence drops.Given that, $39 might be an ambitious target for a retailer selling to a more dispirited population. I think JD.com will have to outperform to have its stock reach that level, and given the environment, I don't think it has a great chance to do so.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in JD.com right now?Before you buy stock in JD.com, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and JD.com wasn’t one of them.

This appears to be the main import of yesterday's news: that the company is choosing the U.S. as its legal jurisdiction setting the rules for how it launches and operates its satellites all around the planet, preferring the regulatory framework set by the Federal Communications Commission over any other country's laws.It's a rather arcane and technical decision, but investors seem to think it's a good enough excuse to bid up AST's share price today.IS AST SpaceMobile stock a buy?The question is whether this announcement by AST is big enough news to justify adding $40 million or so to the company's market capitalization. And I think the answer to that question is ""no.""The legal certainty provided by AST's decision has some value in an investment, but I don't believe it justifies a 10% or greater increase in the company's market capitalization. As an investor, I would much rather see more detail on how the company will raise the more than $1.8 billion it needs to build out its constellation of satellites. It has only about $133 million in the bank right now.Let's not put the cart before the horse, folks. AST's funding requirements remain the big issue here, and until they're resolved, the stock remains speculative in the extreme.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in AST SpaceMobile right now?Before you buy stock in AST SpaceMobile, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AST SpaceMobile wasn’t one of them.

American Banker,"BNY Mellon, Microsoft jointly market data management platform",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bny-mellon-microsoft-jointly-market-172604826.html,"The custody bank will offer clients technology from Microsoft that lets them analyze their data in near-real time, hosted on the latest versions of Microsoft's public and private clouds.","""When we collaborate with Microsoft we make it easier for clients to say '...through you, we can access the whole ecosystem,'"" said Akash Shah, chief growth officer at BNY Mellon.Bank of New York Mellon is taking the next step forward with its software and data management business.The New York City custody bank announced in February that it was enhancing the tools it offers to clients, which include asset and wealth managers, in a combined effort with Microsoft. For BNY, it's important to be the place ""where clients trust us to connect with their data, store and analyze it, and give them insights to make better trade, risk or operational decisions,"" said Akash Shah, chief growth officer at BNY Mellon.BNY's data and analytics unit is more than 20 years old and has more than 800 clients, including asset managers, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, broker-dealers and registered investment advisors. It connects them to third-party data sources and provides analytics tools that can be accessed via application programming interface, data feeds or a portal, and kept on premise, in the public cloud or in the private cloud through Microsoft Azure.Although its relationship with Microsoft stretches back for years — for instance, the two companies announced several features in 2020 including one that lets investment managers customize their portfolios to environmental, social and governance factors — the February announcement marks the first joint marketing effort by the two companies to sell the software to clients. BNY will offer its data management clients advanced analytics software from Microsoft that lets them crunch their own data, combine it with external data that BNY already provides for one comprehensive view, and analyze it in near-real time, using the latest versions of Microsoft's public and private clouds.It also signifies a nascent trend among custody banks. J.P. Morgan launched Fusion, its cloud-native data management platform for institutional investors, in 2022, with Amazon Web Services as part of its tech stack. State Street Corp. acquired Charles River Development, a provider of investment management front office tools, in 2018.Story continues""It's a competitive space in data management and we're seeing expansion there,"" said Adler Smith, advisor for capital markets at Datos Insights, noting that custody banks are competing with traditional data management players such as SimCorp and GoldenSource.""We've been working closely with Microsoft on our core data management platform for a while, but we thought this was the right time to announce that we are taking these steps beyond that, bringing the latest in technology, cloud and analytics to companies"" to help them manage their data, Shah said. ""Microsoft doesn't typically do this, going to market with clients as a joint solution.""With this latest version of BNY's data and analytics platform, clients will be able to track the performance of their portfolio and analyze investments according to benchmarks and indices. For instance, a dashboard might show a breakdown of a company's market value and book value, with unrealized gains and losses on a position, and construct pie charts illustrating positions in different currencies.""Part of our special sauce is we help clients connect and analyze all sorts of data that lets them get a sense of what their absolute returns are,"" said Shah.Microsoft has also partnered with the London Stock Exchange Group and Moody's Corp. in recent years to jointly develop new products for data and analytics.""The framework of our partnership enables BNY Mellon to take advantage of multiple technologies from Microsoft to develop next-generation data management and software products tailored to the unique needs of capital markets firms,"" said Karen Del Vescovo, U.S. financial services lead at Microsoft, via email. ""We're also actively collaborating on several artificial intelligence capabilities that can be incorporated for improved productivity and better-informed decision making.""Aligning itself with a name like Microsoft could give BNY a competitive edge, said Smith.""Clients don't tend to easily change who they use for data management solutions,"" said.Glenn Kurban, a partner at Capco, agrees.""We're seeing this buying pattern and behavior with clients more and more,"" he said. ""Even if there is better and more competitive technology available they'll say no, we're a Microsoft shop, or we're a Google shop.""Shah echoes a similar sentiment.""When we collaborate with Microsoft we make it easier for clients to say 'BNY Mellon has both the knowledge of the data and the best technology, [so] through you, we can access the whole ecosystem,'"" said Shah."

Generative and predictive AI have been causing a frenzy of sorts, but they’re not the only potential needle movers in the Nasdaq 100 (NDX). Apart from overheated semiconductor stocks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq doesn’t seem to be overly expensive. In fact, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently noted that the Magnificent Seven (the largest contributors to the Nasdaq 100) look undervalued, at least relative to everything else.Therefore, in this piece, we’ll check out three intriguing and relatively affordable ways — UBER, GRAB, EQIX — to ride the tech wave higher. Let’s check in with TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to stack up the three Strong-Buy-rated tech plays to see which is worth adding to your watchlist today.Uber (NASDAQ:UBER)Uber stock has been one of the market’s breakout performers over the past year and change, with shares now up over 260% from their July 2022 low. Undoubtedly, when the leading ride-hailing (or should I say transportation-as-a-service) play was hovering around all-time lows just under two years ago, there were a number of uncertainties as to whether the firm would be successful in pushing toward profitability.A vast majority of Wall Street analysts stayed bullish (with Buy ratings) on Uber stock as it sunk to its darkest depths, and they were proven spot-on in the years that followed. Even after Uber stock’s latest parabolic move, analysts are in no rush to downgrade their recommendations. In fact, the stock continues to hang onto its “Strong Buy” rating in the analyst community. I share Wall Street’s sense of bullishness.Top analysts loved the name when it was trading for around $23 per share, and they’re continuing to love it at more than $79 per share. It’s not hard to see why as the firm continues firing on all cylinders. The company is making good on cost management without having such efforts eat into its ability to grow. For the fourth quarter, mobility sales shot up 34% year-over-year as Uber clocked in its first annual profit.Story continuesLooking ahead, look for the Uber One subscription service to help the firm gain further ground over rivals. At some point further down the road (think five to 10 years or so), the rise of autonomous vehicles could act as Uber’s largest margin driver to date as it’s among the best-equipped to shift gears into the era of self-driving robotaxis. All things considered, there are numerous reasons to stay aboard Uber as it continues driving higher for investors.What Is the Price Target for UBER Stock?Uber stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 34 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average UBER stock price target of $86.09 implies 9.2% upside potential.Grab (NASDAQ:GRAB)If Uber stock’s scorching multi-year rally has you feeling like you missed the boat, perhaps Grab stock is worth a grab. After crashing from the high teens to just $3 and change per share, the southeast-Asian-focused ride-hailer may appear to be a cheaper play for those who have a strong stomach for volatility.However, it’s more expensive, at least on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. At writing, GRAB stock trades at 5.1 times price-to-sales (P/S), slightly above the 4.4 times P/S of Uber. Despite the uglier stock chart and slightly higher P/S, I remain bullish on GRAB, as recent quarterly takeaways were quite encouraging.Like Uber, Grab has been making huge strides to become profitable in recent months. In its latest quarterly reveal, Grab achieved the feat while also announcing an impressive $500 million share repurchase plan.Indeed, the two positive developments seem to be more than enough to support the name as it looks to sustain a rally from its recent depths. For now, though, the stock still seems to be stuck in the ditch, with flat performance endured over the past two years. However, moving ahead, Grab is shooting to keep driving sales, free cash flows, and EBITDA higher for 2024 (and likely beyond). And, of course, the rise of self-driving is a compelling wild card that may give Grab stock a much-needed shot in the arm.Indeed, the Grab story seems to “rhyme” with that of Uber’s. The climate for ride-hailing seems to be looking up. And if Grab can continue on its promising path, I’d not be surprised if the name gains for investors at an above-average rate from here.What Is the Price Target for GRAB Stock?Grab stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average GRAB stock price target of $4.43 implies 35.7% upside potential.Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX)There’s been a ton of buzz surrounding AI-ready data centers, with some of the plays gaining more momentum than the AI chip plays themselves. Though certain high-momentum data center plays may be getting bubbly, Equinix stock (a digital infrastructure real estate investment trust or REIT, with a 1.9% distribution yield) remains modestly priced, perhaps even undervalued, given its growing stake in the AI game.Thus, I remain bullish and view EQIX stock as more of a “catch-up” play as more emphasis is shifted toward fully loaded private AI infrastructure.Shares of EQIX are on the cusp of a big breakout, recently rising to a new all-time high, just shy of $900 per share. Though the breakout has been many years in the making, there are reasons to believe that even greater heights could be around the corner as more light is shined on what could be an AI-heavier future.As a $83 billion titan-sized REIT, Equinix already has an impressive geographical footprint. With top-notch liquid cooling systems, managed services, and the means to house truly impressive AI systems, Equinix stands out to be a huge beneficiary as demand for AI infrastructure stays hot. Looking ahead, the REIT is looking to expand its footprint in Africa, with $390 million set aside to bet on data centers.Just last week, Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) David Barden reiterated his Buy rating to go with a $1,000 price target on the stock (suggesting around 14% upside). He’s not the only analyst who foresees shares hitting the four-digit mark, either.What Is the Price Target for Equinix Stock?Equinix stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and three Holds assigned in the past three months. The average EQIX stock price target of $918.81 implies 4.65% upside potential.ConclusionThe aforementioned ride-hailers (UBER, GRAB) and data center plays (EQIX) have some pretty powerful drivers behind them that could help them sustain a march higher from here. Each driver seems less hyped up than those facing other corners of the tech scene. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside potential from GRAB stock (~36%). I think analysts will be right; the needle could move much higher if Grab does its stock looks to pull off a U-turn.Disclosure"
