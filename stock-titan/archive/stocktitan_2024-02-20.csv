Nine workers are missing, and search and rescue operations are ongoing. The company expresses support for the families and the community, while also addressing legal matters and the revocation of the environmental permit. Remediation efforts are being planned, with third-party resources deployed. Environmental monitoring has shown no contamination so far. Positive None. Negative Revocation of the Çöpler environmental permit leading to suspension of operations, legal charges faced by team members, and ongoing search for missing workers pose challenges for SSR Mining Inc. Environmental Law Expert An incident at SSR Mining's Çöpler mine has led to significant operational and legal consequences. The revocation of the environmental permit is a critical development, as it directly halts operations, impacting the company's production and revenue. The permit revocation suggests non-compliance with environmental regulations, which can lead to costly fines and mandatory remediation efforts. Furthermore, the charges faced by team members indicate potential legal liabilities that could affect the company's financial health and reputation.The requirement for near-term remediation, particularly the relocation of heap leach material, implies a substantial financial burden for SSR Mining. This process is often costly and time-intensive, potentially disrupting the company's financial projections and affecting its stock market performance. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the duration of the suspension and the cost of compliance with environmental standards will have direct implications for the company's short-term liquidity and long-term profitability. Mining Industry Analyst The suspension of operations at the Çöpler mine underscores the inherent risks associated with mining activities, particularly in regions with strict environmental oversight. The incident's impact extends beyond immediate operational disruptions to include potential long-term strategic shifts. Investors should note that mining companies often face elevated risk profiles due to the possibility of unforeseen events such as this, which can lead to operational shutdowns and impact future earnings.Monitoring the environmental assessments by the Turkish Ministry is vital, as they could lead to further regulatory action or provide a basis for the mine's potential reopening. The reported absence of contamination is a positive sign for SSR Mining, possibly mitigating some environmental concerns and associated costs. However, the market may still react negatively to the uncertainty surrounding the mine's future. Crisis Management Consultant SSR Mining's response to the incident, including the establishment of a waiting and information point for families, is a crucial aspect of crisis management, potentially mitigating negative public perception. Effective communication and support for affected individuals are key in maintaining stakeholder trust during such events. The deployment of third-party contractors for recovery and remediation efforts indicates a proactive approach to resolving the issue, which can be seen favorably by investors and regulators alike.However, the company's ability to manage this crisis effectively, including legal support for charged team members and transparent collaboration with authorities, will be under scrutiny. The effectiveness of the crisis response will likely influence investor confidence and could have a lasting impact on the company's brand and ability to attract future investment. 02/18/2024 - 09:37 PM DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SSR Mining Inc. (Nasdaq/TSX: SSRM; ASX: SSR) (“SSR Mining” or the “Company”) provides an update on ongoing rescue efforts at the Çöpler mine in Türkiye.

ASP Isotopes Inc. Announces Proposed Offering of Convertible Notes by Quantum Leap Energy,2024-02-19T01:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"ASP Isotopes Inc.

Announces Proposed Offering of Convertible Notes by Quantum Leap Energy Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI announces a $20 million Notes Offering by its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, for laser enrichment production facilities and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by ASP Isotopes Inc. regarding the convertible notes offering by its subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC, is a significant move that can potentially impact the company's financial structure and capital resources. Convertible notes are debt instruments that investors can convert into equity, usually at a discount to the future equity price. The offering of up to $20 million signifies a strategic capital raise to fund the development of laser enrichment production facilities, which is a capital-intensive endeavor.From a financial perspective, the use of convertible notes is often a preferred instrument for companies seeking to minimize immediate dilution of existing shareholders while still raising capital. The terms of the conversion, particularly the 80% conversion price of the future equity value or a set valuation cap, are crucial to evaluate the level of potential dilution and the attractiveness of the notes to investors. The maturity term of five years provides a medium-term horizon for conversion, which suggests that QLE is optimistic about its growth prospects and the potential for a liquidity event such as an IPO or direct listing within that timeframe.However, investors should be aware that these notes are unsecured and may carry higher risk relative to secured debt. The inability to repay the notes prior to maturity, unless a change of control occurs, indicates that QLE is confident in its future cash flows but also ties the hands of management should they wish to retire the debt early. The use of proceeds for building production facilities indicates a direct investment in the company's core business operations, which could lead to revenue growth if successfully executed. Legal Expert The regulatory aspects of the convertible notes offering are particularly noteworthy. The notes are being offered in offshore transactions to non-U.S. persons, in compliance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933. This exemption allows companies to raise capital from international markets without the need to register the securities with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), thereby reducing regulatory overhead and expediting the capital raise process.However, it is important to note that the securities, both the notes and any common equity securities issued upon conversion, will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws. This limits the ability of investors to sell or transfer the securities within the United States, potentially reducing liquidity for these instruments. Furthermore, the absence of an offer to U.S. persons underscores the intention to target international investors and the need to comply with various international securities regulations.It is also critical to understand that such announcements do not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities. This legal language is standard to avoid prematurely engaging in activities that would be considered a public offering, which is subject to stringent regulations and requirements. Market Research Analyst ASPI's move to fund the development of laser enrichment production facilities through convertible notes is a strategic decision that reflects broader industry trends. Laser enrichment technology is a cutting-edge process that can significantly enhance the efficiency and output of isotope production, which has applications in medical, industrial and energy sectors. The investment in such technology could position QLE as a leader in the advanced materials industry if the technology proves successful.However, the success of this offering and subsequent facility development will hinge on market demand for enriched isotopes and the competitive landscape. If the market for these isotopes expands, due to factors such as increased use in medical diagnostics or clean energy initiatives, QLE could see substantial returns on their investment. Conversely, if the market growth is slower than anticipated or if competitors develop more cost-effective methods, the investment may not yield the expected results.The decision to offer notes offshore also reflects a strategic approach to tap into global capital markets, potentially diversifying the investor base and reducing reliance on domestic markets. This could be beneficial in spreading risk and accessing capital pools that have a strategic interest in the technology being developed by QLE. 02/18/2024 - 08:00 PM WASHINGTON, Feb. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI (""ASP Isotopes” or “ASPI” or the “Company”), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, announced today its intention to commence an offering by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (""QLE”), of up to US$20 million aggregate principal amount of QLE’s convertible notes (the ""Notes""), subject to market and other conditions (the ""Notes Offering""). The Notes will be unsecured and may be convertible into common equity securities of QLE prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain events, including an initial public offering, direct listing or a future equity financing, in each case at a price per share equal to the lower of 80% of the per share price in the applicable transaction or the per share value of one share of QLE’s common equity based on a set valuation cap. The Notes will mature on the fifth anniversary of the initial closing, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. QLE may not repay the Notes prior to maturity, unless a change of control transaction occurs. QLE intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering for the planning for, building and development of laser enrichment production facilities, as well as general corporate purposes. There can be no assurance that the Notes Offering will be consummated or, if consummated, QLE will sell the maximum principal amount of Notes offered. The Notes are offered in offshore transactions outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in compliance with Regulation S under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The Notes and the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and may not be sold or otherwise transferred in the United States except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any other applicable securities laws. No offering of the Notes or the common equity securities of QLE deliverable upon conversion of the Notes (if any) is being made into the United States or to U.S. persons. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any securities, nor shall there be a sale of the securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. This press release contains information about the pending Notes Offering, and there can be no assurance that such transaction will be completed. About ASP Isotopes Inc.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240218296478/en/Rocket Lab's Electron launch vehicle lifts-off for the 'On Closer Inspection' mission for Astroscale Japan. (Photo: Business Wire) The mission, named “On Closer Inspection”, launched from Pad B at Rocket Lab’s Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand at 03:52 NZDT February 19th, 2024 (14:52 UTC, February 18th). Electron deployed the Active Debris Removal by Astroscale-Japan (ADRAS-J), a satellite designed to test technologies and operations for approaching and monitoring debris objects in orbit, also known as space junk. The mission is the first phase in assessing the potential for satellites to rendezvous with orbital debris objects in future and assist in de-orbiting them, supporting space sustainability for future generations. Following the successful launch on Electron, the 150-kilogram ADRAS-J satellite will now approach an aged, derelict rocket stage in orbit to observe it closely, understand how it behaves and determine potential methods for its assisted deorbiting in future. The rocket stage it will be observing is the Japanese H-2A upper stage left in low Earth orbit after the launch of the GOSAT Earth observation satellite in 2009. ADRAS-J will fly around the stage, 11 meters long and four meters in diameter, inspecting it with cameras and sensors. Astroscale’s full mission will take between three and six months to complete. “Congratulations to the Astroscale team on this historic mission that paves the way for new and innovative ways to reduce orbital debris and ensure space remains safely accessible,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck. “It’s a real honor to provide a dedicated launch service and enable the kind of precise orbital maneuvers required for an advanced mission like this.” To enable the ADRAS-J satellite to rendezvous with the derelict H-2A upper stage in orbit, Rocket Lab had to design a mission with strict launch timing and precision orbital deployment parameters. Rocket Lab only received the final perigee, apogee, and inclination from Astroscale 20 days before launch, parameters that are typically determined many months in advance of a launch. Only then could argument of perigee targets for different days within the launch window be selected, essentially determining the timing of Electron Kick Stage burns to facilitate the unique elliptical orbit required depending on the launch date. The mission demanded highly accurate orbital insertion with tighter margins than required on most standard missions. The exact T-0 was only able to be defined the day prior to launch and the required LTAN accuracy only allows for +/- 15 seconds, demonstrating Rocket Lab’s capability to deliver rapid and responsive advanced guidance, navigation and control analysis. “Today’s successful launch of ADRAS-J marks another milestone toward our efforts to grow the on-orbit servicing sector while creating a sustainable space environment,” said Astroscale founder & CEO Nobu Okada. “We are grateful for the collaboration with Rocket Lab, whose expertise in dedicated launch services has been instrumental to the start of this ground breaking mission.” Images and video from the launch of ‘On Closer Inspection’ are available for download here: https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBdtqX ‘On Closer Inspection’ was Rocket Lab’s second launch of 2024 and the Company’s 44th Electron launch overall. + About Rocket Lab Founded in 2006, Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorization for VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) in the European Union to treat patients 16 years of age and older with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy, or a biological agent. “For the 2.6 million people in Europe living with UC, the unpredictable physical, mental, and emotional impacts of the condition can be debilitating. They may cycle through several different conventional treatment options to find relief for their symptoms,” said Séverine Vermeire, MD, PhD, Professor of Medicine at KU Leuven and an investigator in the ELEVATE Registrational Program. “The approval of VELSIPITY helps bridge the gap for those with moderately to severely active UC who need an effective advanced treatment but may be apprehensive about using injectable therapies like biologics.” The marketing authorization for VELSIPITY is valid in all 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. This authorization follows the recommendation for approval by the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in December 2023. It also follows VELSIPITY’s approval for adults with moderately to severely active UC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023, and for adults with moderately to severely active UC who have had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to either conventional therapy or an advanced treatment in Canada in January 2024. Regulatory applications for VELSIPITY in UC have been submitted to additional countries around the world for review. “VELSIPITY can help appropriate patients with UC who are struggling to achieve remission on conventional therapies,” said Alexandre de Germay, Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President, Pfizer. “With convenient, once-daily oral dosing and a favorable benefit-risk profile, VELSIPITY is an attractive potential treatment option and Pfizer is proud to bring this medicine to appropriate UC patients as young as 16 years old in the European Union.” The approval was based on results from the ELEVATE UC Phase 3 registrational program (ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of VELSIPITY 2 mg once-daily on clinical remission in UC patients who had previously failed or were intolerant to at least one conventional, biologic, or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy. Additionally, ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 were the only studies of advanced therapies for UC to include patients with isolated proctitis, which affects approximately 30% of those diagnosed with UC. Both studies achieved all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, with a favorable safety profile consistent with previous studies of VELSIPITY. VELSIPITY also demonstrated improvement in the total inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score, which measures health-related quality of life. The most common adverse reactions were lymphopenia (11%) and headache (7%). About Ulcerative Colitis UC is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse mucosal inflammation.1 Clinical symptoms of UC may include but are not limited to frequent diarrhea, bowel urgency, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, fatigue, fever and anemia.2,3,4 Its impact can span beyond the physical to other aspects of life due to the chronic and unpredictable nature of symptoms.5,6 About VELSIPITY® (etrasimod) VELSIPITY is a once-daily, oral, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that selectively binds with S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4, and 5. Regulatory applications for VELSIPITY in ulcerative colitis have been submitted to additional countries including Australia, India, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. U.S. INDICATION VELSIPITY is a selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator indicated for the treatment of moderately to severely active UC in adults.

(BCRX) receives a positive recommendation from the Italian Medicines Agency for ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) for the prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in Italy, expanding access to a groundbreaking therapy for eligible patients.","BioCryst Launches ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) in Italy Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (BCRX) receives a positive recommendation from the Italian Medicines Agency for ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) for the prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in Italy, expanding access to a groundbreaking therapy for eligible patients. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The decision by the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) to recommend ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) for reimbursement represents a significant milestone for BioCryst Pharmaceuticals. This development not only expands the market for ORLADEYO® in Italy but also sets a precedent for potential future decisions in other European countries. As the first oral, once-daily prophylactic treatment for hereditary angioedema (HAE) available to patients in Italy, this drug addresses a clear unmet medical need. Historically, HAE treatments required frequent injections or infusions, which could be burdensome for patients.From a market perspective, the accessibility of ORLADEYO® could lead to increased adoption rates, which would positively impact BioCryst's revenue streams in the European market. The stock market often reacts favorably to such news of market expansion and reimbursement coverage, as it directly correlates with potential sales growth. It is worth monitoring the company's quarterly financial reports following this announcement to assess the actual impact on sales figures. Additionally, competitor analysis would be crucial to understand the market dynamics and the potential for ORLADEYO® to capture market share from existing HAE treatments. Healthcare Policy Expert The endorsement by AIFA is not just a commercial milestone; it reflects the evolving healthcare policies in favor of patient-centric and convenient treatments in chronic disease management. The recommendation implies that the Italian healthcare system recognizes the value of innovative treatments that can improve patient quality of life. This is particularly relevant given the chronic nature of HAE and the need for routine prevention.For healthcare stakeholders, including policymakers and insurance companies, the reimbursement of ORLADEYO® may serve as a case study in balancing drug innovation with cost management. The long-term implications might include a shift towards more oral therapies being recommended for reimbursement, as they offer greater patient adherence and satisfaction compared to more invasive treatment options. This could lead to a broader discussion on healthcare spending, especially in the context of rare diseases where treatment options are limited and often expensive. Medical Research Analyst The clinical significance of ORLADEYO® lies in its mechanism of action as a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, which is instrumental in preventing the excessive swelling attacks characteristic of hereditary angioedema. The drug's oral administration route is a considerable advantage over traditional intravenous or subcutaneous therapies, potentially leading to better patient compliance and quality of life.From a research standpoint, the AIFA's recommendation validates the clinical data supporting ORLADEYO® and may encourage further research into oral prophylactic therapies for other conditions. It's crucial to analyze post-marketing surveillance data to ensure the drug's efficacy and safety profile remains consistent with clinical trial results. Additionally, as more patients use ORLADEYO®, real-world data could provide deeper insights into its long-term effectiveness and impact on healthcare resource utilization, which are important factors for both clinicians and payers. 02/19/2024 - 07:54 AM RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: BCRX) today announced that the Italian Medicines Agency, Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA), has finalized reimbursement and recommended ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) for the routine prevention of recurrent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in eligible patients 12 years and older. With this recommendation, HAE patients in Italy now have access to the first oral, once-daily therapy for the routine prevention of recurrent HAE attacks. “The positive AIFA recommendation of ORLADEYO® (berotralstat) broadens access to modern prophylaxis in Italy and is great news for Italian clinicians and HAE patients,” said Charlie Gayer, chief commercial officer of BioCryst. The AIFA decision follows European Commission (EC) marketing authorization of ORLADEYO in April 2021. About BioCryst Pharmaceuticals BioCryst Pharmaceuticals is a global biotechnology company with a deep commitment to improving the lives of people living with complement-mediated and other rare diseases. BioCryst leverages its expertise in structure-guided drug design to develop first-in-class or best-in-class oral small-molecule and protein therapeutics to target difficult-to-treat diseases.

(NYSE American: CTGO) owns a 30% interest in the high grade Manh Choh open pit gold mine located in Alaska in partnership with Kinross Gold Corporation - The Peak Gold, LLC (Kinross 70% and Contango 30% with Kinross as Manager and Operator). Ore from Manh Choh is being transported along year-round State maintained highways and then processed at Kinross' existing Fort Knox mill complex located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The use of the Fort Knox mill has accelerated the development of the project and resulted in significantly reduced upfront capital development costs, a smaller environmental footprint, a shorter permitting and development timeline, and less overall risk for the project. Peak Gold LLC has had a mining lease since 2008 on 675,000 acres of private lands owned by the Tetlin Tribe and administered by the Tetlin Tribal Council. The Manh Choh project has received all Federal and State permits and mining operations are underway with ore currently being stockpiled at the Mahn Choh site and transported by highway ore haul trucks to a stockpile area at the Fort Knox mill complex. Peak Gold LLC expects to build a roughly 250,000 ton stockpile and then start processing the stockpiled ore later in 2024. Annual gold production is expected to be 225,000 ounces per year with 30% or approximately 67,500 ounces credited to Contango’s account. According to the Feasibility Study Technical Report (2022), All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) are expected be of $1,116/GEO (Gold Equivalent Ounce), meaning at current gold prices the Company will generate over $50 million in free cash flow annually and with less than 10 million shares O/S, equates to $5/share of free cash flow.The Company will also continue to work on it’s second 100% owned Lucky Shot project on the road system just north of Anchorage, Alaska. In 2023, Contango released an initial SK-1300 resource outlining 105,000 ounces of gold with Indicated grade of 14.5 g/t (0.46 oz.ton). Drilling from surface and underground is on-going to continue to explore the down-dip extension of the historically mined high-grade Lucky Shot vein, with the goal to develop enough ounces to outline 300,000 to 400,000 ounces with a viable mine plan by 2026. Lucky Shot is a fully permitted mine site.For further information:Contango Ore IncRick Van NieuwenhuysePresident & CEO907-888-4273info@contangoore.comwww.contangoore.com When will Contango Ore Inc present at Red Cloud's Pre-PDAC 2024 Mining Showcase?

AI search usage also increased by 470%.","iQIYI Reports Booming Viewing Time Across Diverse Content, AI Search Usage Skyrockets by 470% Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags AI Rhea-AI Summary iQIYI reports significant growth in viewing time during Chinese New Year, with variety shows and drama series experiencing substantial surges. AI search usage also increased by 470%. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The significant increase in viewing time for variety shows and the drama 'Always on the Move' during the Chinese New Year holiday on iQIYI's platform indicates a substantial shift in consumer behavior and preferences. This data is particularly important as it suggests a trend towards digital entertainment consumption, which could have implications for advertising revenue and content strategy. The surge in AI search usage by 470% also points to the successful integration of technology in enhancing user experience, which can be a competitive advantage in the crowded streaming market.From a market research perspective, the popularity of original content like 'Always on the Move' and the 'Super Sketch Show' suggests that investments in exclusive, high-quality content can pay off in terms of viewer engagement and loyalty. This strategy not only attracts new subscribers but may also reduce churn rates. Additionally, the reported box office revenue from iQIYI's 'Action Master' season underscores the potential for monetizing content through innovative distribution channels like Cloud Cinema. Financial Analyst The reported viewership metrics from iQIYI over the Chinese New Year period are indicative of strong performance in terms of user engagement, which could translate to robust financial results for the quarter. A 400% increase in viewing time for a hit drama series and a 175% increase for variety shows, coupled with a 470% increase in AI search usage, are likely to positively affect the company's advertising and subscription revenues. The 6% uptick in film viewing and over 17 million RMB in box office revenue from the 'Action Master' season also suggest a healthy revenue stream from this content vertical.For investors, these metrics may signal potential growth in iQIYI's market share and financial health. It's important to consider the impact of seasonal fluctuations, as the Chinese New Year is a peak period for entertainment consumption. However, the ability to capitalize on this period is crucial and could be a strong indicator of the company's operational efficiency and strategic content placement. Cultural Trends Expert The intersection of entertainment and cultural tourism as seen with iQIYI's VR project 'Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty 2: To the West' is a novel approach that appears to be resonating with audiences. This strategy leverages popular intellectual properties (IPs) to create immersive experiences that extend beyond the screen, potentially creating new revenue streams and marketing opportunities. The 11.2% increase in viewing time for original drama series linked to these offline initiatives suggests that such synergies between digital content and physical experiences can amplify consumer engagement.Furthermore, the rise in popularity of location-based themes, such as those seen in Northeast-themed films, indicates a broader trend in entertainment where regional culture and storytelling are gaining traction. This could inform future content creation strategies, influencing the types of narratives that are developed and how they are marketed to both domestic and international audiences. 02/19/2024 - 07:04 AM Viewing time of variety shows and the new drama release 'Always on the Move' soar by 175% and nearly 400%, respectively BEIJING, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On February 19, iQIYI, an innovative market-leading online entertainment service in China, has released its report detailing the performance during the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday period (Feb. 9 - Feb. 15), marking a period of remarkable growth and success. The data highlights a 175% increase in variety shows viewing time during the holiday compared to the pre-holiday period, and a nearly 400% viewing time surge of the hit drama Always on the Move, along with a 470% increase in AI search usage. Variety Shows Dominate the Festivities As China's most-watched TV program, the 2024 Spring Festival Gala (the Gala) produced and broadcast by China Media Group (CMG), secured the top spot in the variety show rankings on iQIYI during the seven-day holiday season, according to data from the iQIYI Research Institute. Notably, casts from iQIYI's original variety shows and drama series were prominently featured in the Gala. Comedy talents from Super Sketch Show captivated a vast audience with their uproarious sketches, while the cast from Become a Farmer reunited and entertained the audience with their energetic performances on stage. The popularity of their appearances spurred a resurgence of interest in both Super Sketch Show and its sequel, prompting both installations to consistently rank among the top 10 variety shows on iQIYI. iQIYI Original Dramas Thrive and Captivate Audiences For the fifth consecutive year, iQIYI has dominated the CNY holiday season with its highly anticipated drama series. This year's offering, the period drama Always on the Move, triumphed again with an astounding nearly 400% surge in viewing time during the holiday season compared with the pre-holiday period, following the footsteps of the incredible success of A Lifelong Journey and The Knockout in 2022 and 2023 respectively. Meanwhile, previous original dramas also continue to capture audiences. Data indicates that the eight previous acclaimed dramas from iQIYI, including Destined, Mysterious Lotus Casebook, and Story of Kunning Palace, all achieved top 30 rankings for viewing time during the holiday period. Action Films Surprise and AI Technologies Enhance the Viewing Experience In a similar trend, films recorded a 6% uptick in viewing time compared to the previous period, with the comedy Johnny Keep Walking! claiming the top spot in the ranking. Noteworthy among the highlights were three action films from iQIYI's recently launched 'Action Master' season: Blocking the Horse, Eye for an Eye 2, and Hunt the Wicked. Notably, the latter two films claimed the second and third positions on iQIYI's film popularity index. Together, these three action films collectively achieved a box office revenue of over 17 million RMB (approximately 2.4 million USD) on iQIYI Cloud Cinema, where the company bagged more than 2.08 million ticket sales during the seven-day holiday. Additionally, iQIYI's cutting-edge technologies, including AI search, provided viewers with a seamless and immersive experience, enabling effortless access to popular scenes and delivering intelligent personalized recommendations for film choices. The data shows a remarkable 470% increase in AI search usage during the holiday period. Popular IPs Spark Tourism Buzz and Propel Drama Popularity Beyond its digital offerings, iQIYI expanded into offline initiatives in tourist-favored cities over the CNY holiday. Prior to the holiday festivities, iQIYI launched its VR project Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty 2: To the West in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, offering visitors a mesmerizing fusion of traditional and contemporary elements, thus drawing crowds of eager audiences. This surge in cultural tourism activities has concurrently boosted the viewing time of original drama series, resulting in an 11.2% increase in viewing time on iQIYI. A similar trend has been observed with the surge in popularity of the northeastern city of Harbin, Heilongjiang province, and the rise of Northeast-themed films, such as Fight Against Evil.

The LAURA Phase III trial results indicate a favorable trend in overall survival, with TAGRISSO demonstrating impactful clinical benefit in a potentially curative setting. Safety and tolerability profiles remain consistent, with ongoing investigations in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings from the LAURA Phase III trial regarding AstraZeneca's TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) are significant within the field of oncology, particularly for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor mutations (EGFRm). The observed improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) suggests that osimertinib could offer a valuable treatment option for patients with unresectable, Stage III disease post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This is particularly crucial, as Stage III NSCLC patients have limited options and a high likelihood of disease progression and metastasis to the brain. The safety profile consistency and no new concerns further support its potential use in this setting.Understanding the importance of these results requires a grasp of the disease's aggressiveness and the current gap in targeted therapies for this patient subset. The potential of osimertinib to become the first targeted treatment in this context could change the standard of care, providing a new avenue for disease management and possibly improving overall survival rates, which is a key metric in cancer treatment efficacy. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the statistical significance and clinical meaningfulness of the PFS improvement are paramount. These results may influence future clinical guidelines and treatment pathways. Additionally, the ongoing assessment of overall survival (OS) as a secondary endpoint will be critical to fully understand the long-term benefits of osimertinib in this setting. The global prevalence of EGFR mutations in NSCLC underscores the potential widespread impact of these findings.It is also noteworthy that TAGRISSO® is being investigated in various stages of lung cancer, including the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, indicating AstraZeneca's strategic approach to covering the entire treatment continuum for EGFRm NSCLC. The approval of TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy in the US based on the FLAURA2 Phase III trial demonstrates regulatory confidence in its efficacy and safety, which could be a precursor to further approvals contingent on LAURA trial outcomes. Market Research Analyst The positive trial results are likely to have a substantial impact on AstraZeneca's market positioning, particularly within the oncology segment. As the first EGFR inhibitor to show a PFS benefit in Stage III NSCLC, TAGRISSO® could see increased adoption and market share in this niche. The potential expansion of its indications to include earlier stages of lung cancer treatment could further solidify its role in oncology treatment regimens and drive revenue growth for AstraZeneca.Investors should monitor the upcoming medical meeting where the data will be presented, as well as the interactions with global regulatory authorities, which could signal the timeline and likelihood of expanded approvals. The broader implications for the stock market hinge on AstraZeneca's ability to capitalize on these results, the competitive landscape of lung cancer treatments and the company's overall pipeline strength and strategy in targeting early treatment across different cancer types. 02/19/2024 - 07:05 AM First EGFR inhibitor and targeted treatment to demonstrate progression-free survival benefit in Stage III setting WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Positive high-level results from the LAURA Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) demonstrated a statistically significant and highly clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with unresectable, Stage III epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) compared to placebo after CRT. Overall survival (OS) data showed a favorable trend for TAGRISSO, although data were not mature at the time of this analysis. The trial will continue to assess OS as a secondary endpoint. Each year an estimated 2.4 million people are diagnosed with lung cancer globally with 80-85% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC, the most common form of lung cancer.1-3 Approximately 10-15% of NSCLC patients in the US and Europe, and 30-40% of patients in Asia, have EGFR mutations.4-7 More than one in six patients with NSCLC are diagnosed with unresectable Stage III disease (15%).8 Suresh Ramalingam, MD, Executive Director of Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, US, and principal investigator in the trial, said: “These results represent a major advance for patients with Stage III EGFR-mutated lung cancer who have a high propensity for early progression and spread to the brain, and where no targeted therapy is available. LAURA shows osimertinib can provide impactful clinical benefit and could become the first targeted treatment option for patients with Stage III disease.” Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: “These highly impactful results for the LAURA trial in this potentially curative early lung cancer setting further entrench TAGRISSO as the backbone therapy for EGFR-mutated lung cancer. These data together with the ADAURA data, reinforce the imperative to diagnose and treat patients with lung cancer as early as possible.” The safety and tolerability of TAGRISSO in the LAURA trial was consistent with its established profile and no new safety concerns were reported with TAGRISSO maintenance treatment following CRT. The data will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting and shared with global regulatory authorities. In addition, TAGRISSO plus chemotherapy was recently approved in the US based on the FLAURA2 Phase III trial. As part of AstraZeneca’s ongoing commitment to treating patients as early as possible in lung cancer, TAGRISSO is also being investigated in the neoadjuvant setting in the NeoADAURA Phase III trial with results expected later this year, and in the early-stage adjuvant resectable setting in the ADAURA2 Phase III trial. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION There are no contraindications for TAGRISSO Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis occurred in 4% of the 1813 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.4% of cases were fatal. In the FLAURA2 study, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 3.3% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 0.4% of cases were fatal. Withhold TAGRISSO and promptly investigate for ILD in patients who present with worsening of respiratory symptoms which may be indicative of ILD (eg, dyspnea, cough and fever). Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed Heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation occurs in TAGRISSO-treated patients. Of the 1813 TAGRISSO monotherapy-treated patients in clinical trials, 1.1% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 4.3% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. Of the 276 patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy in the FLAURA2 study, 1.8% were found to have a QTc >500 msec, and 10.5% of patients had an increase from baseline QTc >60 msec. No QTc-related arrhythmias were reported. Conduct periodic monitoring with ECGs and electrolytes in patients with congenital long QTc syndrome, congestive heart failure, electrolyte abnormalities, or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Permanently discontinue TAGRISSO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs/symptoms of life-threatening arrhythmia Cardiomyopathy occurred in 3.8% of the 1813 TAGRISSO-treated patients; 0.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. In the FLAURA2 study, cardiomyopathy occurred in 9% of the 276 patients who received TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy; 1.1% of cardiomyopathy cases were fatal. A decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥10% from baseline and to <50% LVEF occurred in 4.2% of 1557 patients who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment. In the ADAURA study, 1.5% (5/325) of TAGRISSO-treated patients experienced LVEF decreases ≥10% from baseline and a drop to <50%. In the FLAURA2 study, 8% (21/262) of patients treated with TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, who had baseline and at least one follow-up LVEF assessment, experienced LVEF decreases ≥10% and a drop to less than 50%. For patients receiving TAGRISSO monotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring in patients with cardiac risk factors, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment. For patients receiving TAGRISSO in combination with pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy, conduct cardiac monitoring in all patients, including assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment. Assess LVEF in patients who develop relevant cardiac signs or symptoms during treatment. For symptomatic congestive heart failure, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO Keratitis was reported in 0.6% of 1813 patients treated with TAGRISSO monotherapy in clinical trials. Promptly refer patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis (such as eye inflammation, lacrimation, light sensitivity, blurred vision, eye pain and/or red eye) to an ophthalmologist Postmarketing cases consistent with erythema multiforme major (EMM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if EMM, SJS, or TEN is suspected and permanently discontinue if confirmed Postmarketing cases of cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis, urticarial vasculitis, and IgA vasculitis have been reported in patients receiving TAGRISSO. Withhold TAGRISSO if cutaneous vasculitis is suspected, evaluate for systemic involvement, and consider dermatology consultation. If no other etiology can be identified, consider permanent discontinuation of TAGRISSO based on severity Aplastic anemia has been reported in patients treated with TAGRISSO in clinical trials (0.06% of 1813) and postmarketing. Some cases had a fatal outcome. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of aplastic anemia including but not limited to, new or persistent fevers, bruising, bleeding, and pallor. If aplastic anemia is suspected, withhold TAGRISSO and obtain a hematology consultation. If aplastic anemia is confirmed, permanently discontinue TAGRISSO.

Notes Lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, accounting for about one-fifth of all cancer deaths.1 Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer.2 The majority of all NSCLC patients are diagnosed with advanced disease.6 Patients with EGFRm NSCLC are particularly sensitive to treatment with an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) which blocks the cell-signaling pathways that drive the growth of tumor cells.10 LAURA LAURA is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, global Phase III trial in patients with unresectable, Stage III EGFRm NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following definitive platinum‑based CRT. Patients were treated with TAGRISSO 80mg once daily oral tablets until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation criteria were met. Upon progression, patients in the placebo arm were permitted to be treated with TAGRISSO. The trial enrolled 216 patients in more than 145 centers across more than 15 countries, including in the US, Europe, South America and Asia. This is the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS. The trial is ongoing and will continue to assess the secondary endpoint of OS. TAGRISSO TAGRISSO® (osimertinib) is a third-generation, irreversible EGFR-TKI with proven clinical activity in NSCLC, including against central nervous system metastases. TAGRISSO (40mg and 80mg once-daily oral tablets) has been used to treat more than 800,000 patients across its indications worldwide and AstraZeneca continues to explore TAGRISSO as a treatment for patients across multiple stages of EGFRm NSCLC. TAGRISSO is approved as monotherapy in more than 100 countries including in the US, EU, China and Japan. These include for 1st-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm NSCLC, locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, and adjuvant treatment of early-stage (IB, II and IIIA) EGFRm NSCLC, where TAGRISSO recently demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS benefit. There is an extensive body of evidence supporting the use of TAGRISSO in EGFRm NSCLC. TAGRISSO is the only targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes in both early-stage disease in the ADAURA Phase III trial and late-stage disease in the FLAURA Phase III trial and FLAURA2 Phase III trial. The Company is also researching ways to address tumor mechanisms of resistance through the SAVANNAH and ORCHARD Phase II trials, and the SAFFRON Phase III trial, which test TAGRISSO plus savolitinib, an oral, potent and highly selective MET TKI, as well as other potential new medicines. AstraZeneca in lung cancer AstraZeneca is working to bring patients with lung cancer closer to cure through the detection and treatment of early-stage disease, while also pushing the boundaries of science to improve outcomes in the resistant and advanced settings. By defining new therapeutic targets and investigating innovative approaches, the Company aims to match medicines to the patients who can benefit most. The Company’s comprehensive portfolio includes leading lung cancer medicines and the next wave of innovations, including TAGRISSO and gefitinib; durvalumab and tremelimumab-aclt; fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki and datopotamab deruxtecan in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo; savolitinib in collaboration with HUTCHMED; as well as a pipeline of potential new medicines and combinations across diverse mechanisms of action. AstraZeneca is a founding member of the Lung Ambition Alliance, a global coalition working to accelerate innovation and deliver meaningful improvements for people with lung cancer, including and beyond treatment.

Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. Ongoing earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of net unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on economic hedges, the net change in unrealized gains and losses on investment securities, pension expense related to previously disposed of gas distribution business, and certain non-recurring, infrequent, and other items that are not indicative of fundamental changes in the earnings capacity of the Company's operations. The Company uses ongoing earnings and ongoing earnings per diluted share to evaluate the operations of the Company and to establish goals, including those used for certain aspects of incentive compensation, for management and employees. While the Company believes these financial measures are appropriate and useful for investors, they are not measures presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for these measures, or any piece of these measures, to represent any financial measure as defined by GAAP. Furthermore, the Company's calculations of these measures as presented may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company uses ongoing earnings guidance to provide investors with management's expectations of ongoing financial performance over the period presented. While the Company believes ongoing earnings guidance is an appropriate measure, it is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not intend for ongoing earnings guidance to represent an expectation of net earnings as defined by GAAP. Since the future differences between GAAP and ongoing earnings are frequently outside the control of the Company, management is generally not able to estimate the impact of the reconciling items between forecasted GAAP net earnings and ongoing earnings guidance, nor their probable impact on GAAP net earnings without unreasonable effort, therefore, management is generally not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for ongoing earnings guidance. Reconciliations between GAAP and ongoing earnings are contained in schedules 1-4.

The acquisition expands Dream Finders' presence in Charleston, Greenville, and Nashville markets. Zelman has completed six M&A transactions worth over $1.5 billion in the past year, showcasing expertise in the housing sector. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Crescent Homes by Dream Finders Homes represents a strategic move to diversify and expand the company's market presence. By entering the Charleston, Greenville and Nashville markets, Dream Finders Homes is not only increasing its geographic coverage but also tapping into the economic growth and demographic shifts favoring the Southeastern United States. The homebuilding industry is cyclical and sensitive to economic indicators such as interest rates, employment levels and consumer confidence. Expanding into these markets could mitigate regional risks and provide new revenue streams.It is also worth noting that the acquisition is part of a broader trend in the industry where consolidation is becoming more common as homebuilders seek economies of scale and market share gains. This trend is often a response to increasing land and construction costs, as well as a way to leverage brand recognition and operational efficiencies. For stakeholders, the short-term benefits may include stock price appreciation due to anticipated synergies, while long-term benefits could include improved competitive positioning and increased market share. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's impact on Dream Finders Homes' balance sheet and earnings is critical. The deal size, while not disclosed in the article, is likely significant given Zelman Partners' historical transaction values. Investors will be keen on understanding the acquisition's financing structure, whether it involves cash, debt, or stock and how it will affect Dream Finders Homes' leverage ratios.Furthermore, the integration process will be closely watched for its efficiency and effectiveness in realizing the projected synergies. Cost savings and cross-selling opportunities are typical justifications for such M&A activity and their realization will be pivotal for the deal to be accretive to earnings. The market will also look for management's guidance on anticipated impacts on revenue and profit margins, as well as any potential changes in the company's strategic direction post-acquisition. Economist An economist's viewpoint would highlight the broader economic implications of the deal. The housing market is a significant component of the U.S. economy and activity in this sector can be a bellwether for overall economic health. The acquisition suggests confidence in the housing market's prospects, particularly in the Southeastern U.S., which has been experiencing population growth and a robust job market.Additionally, the deal could have a multiplier effect on the local economies of the markets Dream Finders Homes is entering. The construction of new homes generates employment and stimulates demand for goods and services. However, it's important to monitor the affordability and supply issues in the housing market, as these could be affected by consolidation in the industry, potentially influencing the pace of new home construction and pricing strategies. 02/19/2024 - 06:00 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Zelman Partners, A Walker & Dunlop Company (NYSE: WD), served as exclusive buy-side M&A advisor to Dream Finders Homes (NYSE: DFH) on its acquisition of privately-owned homebuilder Crescent Homes. The acquisition meaningfully enhances Dream Finders’ geographic footprint and allows the company to expand into the markets of Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. “This is Zelman’s sixth M&A transaction in the last 12 months totaling more than $1.5 billion of transaction value and representing over 70% market share over that time frame. These transactions range in size from $25 million to more than $450 million and include buy-side and sell-side advisory roles involving private homebuilders, single-family land developers and multifamily developers, clearly demonstrating our ability to provide leading M&A services to clients of any size across the housing ecosystem. I’m incredibly proud to be surrounded by the most talented, dedicated, experienced, and hard-working colleagues in the business,” stated Zelman’s Head of Investment Banking, Tony McGill. Patrick Zalupski, Dream Finders’ founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, shared: “We have a long history of working with the Zelman team, initially as an industry advisor when we were raising private capital, then on our IPO in 2021, our debut High Yield issuance in 2023, and as our buy-side advisor on this acquisition. They understand our long-term goals and strategic objectives, and have the right deal experience, horsepower and personality to support our growing organization. Tony and his team seamlessly complimented our internal diligence effort by assisting in aggregating, organizing and analyzing project underwriting and modeling information, supporting our internal approval processes, and helping manage the various parties to keep deal documentation and diligence on track.” “Dream Finder’s stock has tripled since last year for good reason. This is their second acquisition as a public company and fifth acquisition since 2019, demonstrating management’s unwavering commitment to driving shareholder value through increased scale, geographic diversification, and access to high-quality land in highly desirable locations. In addition, the structure of this transaction adheres to Dream Finders’ disciplined land-light operating philosophy that serves the dual purposes of maximizing returns on equity while minimizing capital invested in land,” stated McGill.

Financial Analyst The appointment of Citi as depositary bank for Air Astana's Global Depositary Receipt (GDR) program is a strategic move that could facilitate increased liquidity and access to a broader range of investors. GDRs are a financial instrument used by companies to attract foreign investors without the complexities of listing abroad. For Air Astana, this could mean enhanced visibility and potentially better valuation due to the diversification of its investor base.From a financial perspective, the partnership with a reputable institution like Citi, known for its extensive equity distribution network, could bolster investor confidence in Air Astana's GDRs. The ability to trade on the London Stock Exchange and Astana International Exchange provides a dual market exposure, which is often attractive to institutional investors seeking to diversify their portfolios across emerging markets.However, it is crucial to monitor the trading volume and price performance of Air Astana’s GDRs post-appointment to gauge the effectiveness of Citi's investor outreach initiatives. The success of such programs is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including market conditions and investor sentiment towards the airline industry, which can be volatile. Market Research Analyst The airline industry has seen significant challenges and companies like Air Astana must navigate these while maintaining investor interest. The partnership with Citi could provide Air Astana with strategic advantages in terms of market research and investor relations advisory, which are critical for understanding investor behavior and market trends.By tapping into Citi's global network, Air Astana could gain insights into how to position itself competitively in the global market. This includes understanding the nuances of investor expectations in different regions, which can significantly impact the demand for GDRs. Furthermore, the dual listing on the LSE and AIX could offer a unique proposition to investors looking for exposure to Central Asian markets.It will be important to analyze the long-term impact of this move on Air Astana's market share and financial health. The ability to attract foreign capital can be a catalyst for growth, but it also requires the company to adhere to international reporting standards and maintain transparency, which can be a challenge for some firms. 02/19/2024 - 05:00 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citi’s Issuer Services, acting through Citibank, N.A., has been appointed by Air Astana Group (“Air Astana”), the flag carrier airline of Kazakhstan, to act as depositary bank for its Global Depositary Receipt (“GDR”) program.

GlobalFoundries and Biden-Harris Administration Announce CHIPS and Science Act Funding for Essential Chip Manufacturing,2024-02-19T10:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"GlobalFoundries (Nasdaq: GFS) secures $1.5 billion investment for expansion and modernization of facilities in New York and Vermont, enhancing chip manufacturing capabilities for automotive and other key markets.

The investment will support the creation of new state-of-the-art fabs and drive growth in essential chip production. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The announcement of the $1.5 billion investment into GlobalFoundries, supported by the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, signifies a strategic move to bolster the domestic semiconductor industry. This investment is expected to have a profound macroeconomic impact, enhancing the U.S.'s competitiveness in a critical technology sector and potentially reducing reliance on foreign chip manufacturing. The semiconductor industry is a cornerstone of modern technology and its growth is tightly coupled with the overall economic progress and national security.From an economic standpoint, the creation of over 1,500 manufacturing jobs will contribute to local economies, potentially improving employment rates and stimulating economic activities in New York and Vermont. Additionally, the modernization and expansion efforts are likely to have a multiplier effect, attracting further investments and fostering innovation within the sector. The long-term implications include bolstering the supply chain resilience, which is crucial given the recent disruptions experienced globally.However, one must consider the risks associated with such large-scale investments. The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and the market demand can fluctuate significantly. Moreover, the success of these initiatives depends on the execution and the ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving technology landscape. Market Research Analyst The expansion of GlobalFoundries' facilities aligns with the growing demand for semiconductor chips, particularly in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries. The strategic investment to expand and construct new fabrication facilities is poised to meet the expected surge in customer demand for U.S.-made chips. Given the semiconductor market is forecasted to double over the next decade, GlobalFoundries' move to capture a significant share of the essential chip segment, which constitutes over 60% of the market, is a calculated decision.From a market perspective, this investment could enhance GlobalFoundries' competitive position, potentially increasing its market share and revenue. The focus on feature-rich mature chips is particularly noteworthy, as these components are crucial for a wide array of applications and less susceptible to the rapid obsolescence seen in cutting-edge chips. The diversification into new technologies and end markets could provide a hedge against market volatility.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to scale production efficiently and the adoption rate of the new technologies, such as gallium nitride semiconductors, which are expected to play a pivotal role in next-generation applications. Financial Analyst The planned investment of $1.5 billion by the Department of Commerce, along with additional state funding and incentives, reflects a strong public-private partnership model. This model is instrumental in financing large-scale infrastructure projects that might otherwise be too capital-intensive for private entities to undertake alone. The financial implications for GlobalFoundries include not just an influx of capital but also the potential for increased valuation due to anticipated growth and capacity expansion.Investors should consider the impact of these investments on GlobalFoundries' balance sheet and future cash flows. While the capital infusion and increased capacity are positive indicators, the actual return on investment will depend on the company's operational efficiency and market demand. It is also important to note the additional $600 million in benefits, which could provide a significant financial cushion and support for workforce development and infrastructure upgrades.Long-term, the investments are expected to increase wafer production to 1 million per year, which could lead to economies of scale and potentially lower production costs per unit. However, the capital expenditure and ongoing costs associated with maintaining and operating state-of-the-art facilities must be weighed against these benefits. 02/19/2024 - 05:30 AM $1.5 billion potential investment will support the expansion of GlobalFoundries New York facility, including construction of a new state-of-the art fab, and the modernization of its Vermont facility, adding secure capacity for essential chip manufacturing for automotive and other key markets Additional $600 million plus planned in New York State Green CHIPS and other State benefits over the 10-year term of the New York projects MALTA, N.Y. and ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt., Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce today announced $1.5 billion in planned direct funding for GlobalFoundries (Nasdaq: GFS) (GF) as part of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This investment will enable GF to expand and create new manufacturing capacity and capabilities to securely produce more essential chips for automotive, IoT, aerospace, defense, and other vital markets. New York-headquartered GF, celebrating its 15th year of operations, is the only U.S.-based pure play foundry with a global manufacturing footprint including facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Singapore. GF is the first semiconductor pure play foundry to receive a major award (over $1.5 billion) from the CHIPS and Science Act, designed to strengthen American semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains and national security. The proposed funding will support three GF projects: Expansion of GF’s existing Malta, NY, fab by adding critical technologies already in production in GF’s Singapore and Germany facilities geared towards enabling the U.S. auto industry. As vehicles transition from mechanical to electronic systems, the number of semiconductor chips in each car or truck continues to soar. This expansion is key to ensuring supply chain resilience for the growing demand and to delivering for GF’s automotive customers including General Motors. This will continue to diversify GF’s flagship Malta fab into new technologies and end markets.Construction of a new state-of-art fab on the Malta campus to meet expected customer demand for U.S.-made essential chips across a broad range of markets and applications including automotive, aerospace, defense and AI. The new fab, which has already been granted some necessary permitting, will leverage the site’s existing infrastructure and ecosystem, enabling a fast and efficient path from construction to production. The semiconductor market is expected to double over the next decade, and GF’s new fab will be uniquely positioned to capture the feature-rich mature, essential chip segment which is expected to continue to represent more than 60% of the semiconductor market. Construction of this new fab combined with expansion of GF’s existing site is expected to triple the existing capacity of the Malta campus over the next 10+ years. These two projects are expected to increase wafer production to 1 million per year once all phases are complete.Modernization of GF’s longest continuously operated fab and the nation’s first and largest Trusted 200mm facility in Essex Junction, Vermont. The project will upgrade existing facilities, expand capacity as well as create the first U.S. facility capable of high-volume manufacturing of next-generation gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for use in electric vehicles, power grids, data centers, 5G and 6G smartphones and other critical technologies. Based on market requirements and demand, GF plans to invest more than $12 billion over the next 10 plus years across its two U.S. sites through public-private partnerships with support from the federal and state governments as well as from its ecosystem partners, including key strategic customers. In support of the two Malta, New York projects, Governor Hochul today announced $575 million in planned direct funding for New York State Green CHIPS. Also announced was $15 million in planned funding for NYS Workforce Development activities for GlobalFoundries as well as $30 million in planned funding for NYS Infrastructure upgrades and Energy incentives provided by the New York Power Authority (NYPA). Combined, these investments are expected to create over 1,500 manufacturing jobs and about 9,000 construction jobs over the life of these projects. “GF is proud to announce this proposed funding from the Department of Commerce and New York State and appreciates the collaboration of the CHIPS Office and the Empire State Development Corporation throughout this process. These proposed investments, along with the investment tax credit (ITC) for semiconductor manufacturing, are central to the next chapter of the GlobalFoundries story and our industry. They will also play an important role in making the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem more globally competitive and resilient and cements the New York Capital Region as a global semiconductor hub,” said Dr. Thomas Caulfield, president and CEO of GF. “With new onshore capacity and technology on the horizon, as an industry we now need to turn our attention to increasing the demand for U.S.-made chips, and to growing our talented U.S. semiconductor workforce.” “Semiconductors are in everything from our cellphones, to refrigerators, to cars, and our most advanced weapons systems, and access to them carries important economic and national security implications. It was the shortages of semiconductors during the COVID-19 pandemic that raised prices for consumers and led to the shutdown of automobile manufacturing sites across the country,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, we're working to onshore these critical technologies in order to bolster the supply of domestic chips that are essential to manufacturing cars, electronics, and national defense systems in New York, Vermont, and states across the country.” “I have long said my CHIPS & Science Law would deliver big for New York, and I meant big with a capital ‘B.’ I am proud to announce GlobalFoundries has reached a preliminary agreement for the largest award thus far from the CHIPS program I created for $1.5 billion in grant funding. This will triple production capacity of GlobalFoundries’ already massive campus in Saratoga County, spur billions in public-private investment, and help bring thousands of new good-paying manufacturing and union construction jobs to the Capital Region,” said Senator Schumer. “When I wrote the CHIPS & Science Law, I made sure there was funding especially for the feature-rich, legacy chips that GlobalFoundries produces in Malta and that are essential for America’s auto industry and national defense. We all remember the days of the pandemic when chip shortages sky rocketed car prices and created supply chain issues leading to months-long wait times for cars and electronics, and investments like this are how we can help prevent that from happening again. Ever since GlobalFoundries’ first Fab 8 broke ground 15 years ago, I knew how significant the company would be for the Capital Region and Upstate NY. Today, the plans for their second chip facility and thousands of new good-paying jobs move forward thanks to the CHIPS & Science Law I fought hard to create.” “New York State is becoming the best place on earth to build a business,” said Governor Hochul. “Thanks to our pro-business policies, commitment to innovation and best-in-the-nation workforce, green jobs and high-tech manufacturers are flocking to the Empire State. This $11 billion investment from GlobalFoundries is a game changer, and with the partnership of the Biden administration, New York’s congressional delegation, and all of our local stakeholders, the best is yet to come.” To attract and cultivate a pipeline of semiconductor talent that will be needed in New York and Vermont, GF is creating and investing in numerous initiatives. The company recently announced a new student loan repayment program to help current employees and new recruits pay down student loan debt. The new benefit program is part of the company’s multi-million-dollar investment to strengthen the semiconductor talent workforce by helping to ease the financial burden of higher education and training of the company’s present and future employees. GF is also partnering with a broad range of universities and community colleges nationwide to help build a diverse workforce and semiconductor talent pipeline. As part of receiving CHIPS and Science Act funding, GF will continue to invest in and develop new workforce development efforts including curriculum development, internship and apprenticeship programs, K-12 STEM outreach as well as additional education and training programs. All of GF’s design and construction plans for its expansions and modernizations in New York and Vermont will reflect GF’s ongoing commitment to sustainable operations and comply with the company’s sustainability goals. Customers, government officials and academia celebrate the news from the U.S. Department of Commerce and GF: “We are pleased that GlobalFoundries will be receiving a $1.5 billion investment from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act,” said Dr. Lisa Su, Chair and CEO of AMD. “GlobalFoundries is a strategic supplier and key enabler of AMD's high-performance computing products. The planned investment demonstrates the commitment of the U.S. government to strengthen the domestic chip supply chain for economic growth and ensure the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem.” “Semiconductors are critical to today’s vehicles,” said General Motors President Mark Reuss. “GlobalFoundries' investment in New York both ensures a robust supply of semiconductors in the U.S. to help GM meet demand and supports U.S. leadership in automotive innovation.” “Lockheed Martin is proud of our strategic partnership with GlobalFoundries to help increase access to domestically produced microelectronics – a true national security imperative,” said Jim Taiclet, chairman, president and CEO of Lockheed Martin. “The Department of Commerce’s announcement led by Secretary Raimondo will enable GlobalFoundries to continue providing essential technology to further strengthen Lockheed Martin’s secure and robust global supply chain. We look forward to the results of this announcement as part of our commitment to delivering cutting-edge 21st Century Security capabilities that advance deterrence and keep our customers ahead of emerging threats.” “Qualcomm welcomes today’s announcement from the U.S. Department of Commerce CHIPS office regarding funding for GlobalFoundries expansion of their U.S. chip making operations. GlobalFoundries’ commitment to providing additional chip production capacity that allows us to continue pushing the boundaries of the innovation for 5G, Automotive and IoT applications. We are pleased to partner with a company that shares our vision for a more resilient global supply chain for chip production,” said Dr. Roawen Chen, Chief Supply Chain and Operations Officer, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. “GlobalFoundries has been a national leader in semiconductor and chips innovation, putting Vermont at the forefront of this emerging technology. This is a well-deserved recognition of GlobalFoundries’ commitment to bolstering the on-shore growth of U.S.-made chips,” said Sen. Peter Welch. “This investment, made possible by the CHIPS and Science Act and the White House and Secretary Raimondo’s commitment to competitiveness and security, will create jobs while making our supply chains more resilient. Even more impressive, this new site will see its commitment to sustainability through with a plan to use carbon-free neutral energy practices — leading in innovation and in action.” “This is huge news for Vermont and the region,” said Governor Phil Scott. “The CHIPS Act funding will help encourage innovation and expansion of this vital sector in our state and across the country. I’m proud of the work my team has done with GF and others to assist and I want to thank the Biden Administration and our congressional delegation for their continued partnership.” “Today’s announcement is nothing short of a gamechanger for Saratoga County and the greater Capital Region. It is proof positive that our Investing in America agenda not only bolsters national security and global economic competitiveness, it can create thousands of good paying jobs right here at home. I look forward to working closely with GlobalFoundries and local, state and federal partners to make these historic plans a reality,” said Congressman Paul Tonko. “We extend our congratulations to GlobalFoundries for achieving this important milestone that will ignite regional economic growth while reinforcing the vital collaboration between Hudson Valley Community College and GF. Since 2021, through a first-of-its kind U.S. Registered Apprenticeship program, HVCC has been assisting GF in expanding its technical workforce by providing top-notch education and training to apprentices.

While fraud protection is crucial for individuals, lengthy ID checks can deter customers from opening accounts. Key findings include 34% prioritizing good fraud protection when opening new accounts, with biometrics being a popular security choice. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Strong fraud strategies are increasingly becoming a competitive differentiator in the financial sector. The study highlights that 34% of consumers consider good fraud protection as their primary concern when opening a new account, with a significant 73% ranking it in their top three concerns. This consumer sentiment can influence customer acquisition strategies for financial institutions. A focus on fraud protection can lead to increased customer trust and loyalty, which are key drivers for long-term business growth.However, there's a balance to be struck. With 18% of potential customers willing to abandon the account opening process if identity checks are cumbersome, financial institutions must optimize their verification processes to be both secure and user-friendly. This presents an opportunity for technology investment in areas such as biometrics, which 68% of respondents preferred, signaling a market shift towards more sophisticated security measures that enhance user experience. Financial Analyst The emphasis on fraud protection as a priority for customers can have a direct impact on the bottom line of financial institutions. As security becomes a selling point, companies that invest in advanced fraud detection and prevention technologies could see a positive effect on their market share and profitability. The potential customer attrition due to lengthy or complex ID checks—cited by one in five respondents—serves as a warning. Institutions that fail to streamline their fraud prevention measures may face increased customer acquisition costs and a higher churn rate, which can adversely affect their stock performance. Cybersecurity Expert The report underscores the importance of cybersecurity in the financial industry. With identity theft being a primary concern for customers, institutions must deploy robust cybersecurity frameworks to protect customer data. The adoption of biometrics, such as fingerprint recognition preferred by 68% of survey participants, indicates a trend towards more personal and secure authentication methods. This approach not only enhances security but also aligns with consumer preferences, potentially reducing friction in the customer experience. As cybersecurity threats evolve, financial institutions that stay ahead of the curve in protecting customer data can gain a competitive edge. 02/19/2024 - 04:15 AM Report on Fraud, Identity and Digital Banking reveals that good fraud strategies are the secret weapon to win and retain customers – as long as checks don’t take too long LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FICO (NYSE: FICO): A new study of 1,000 UK consumers by global analytics software leader FICO1 has put the spotlight on the customer acquisition and retention advantages of strong fraud strategies. Once simply viewed as necessary overhead, according to the new research fraud departments are now the secret weapon in winning customers. Fraud protection was cited as the highest priority for individuals when choosing a provider for a new financial account. However, enhanced fraud prevention processes cannot come at any cost. One in five said they would abandon opening an account if ID checks take too long. More information: https://www.fico.com/en/latest-thinking/ebook/fraud-identity-and-digital-banking-consumer-survey-2023-united-kingdom Key findings 34% rank good fraud protection as their top consideration when opening a new account; 73% had it in their top three The type of fraud that worried Brits most is the threat of a fraudster using their identity to open an account, followed by their card being stolen and used 18% will abandon opening a current account if identity checks are too difficult or time-consuming Biometrics are a favourite security choice, with 68% preferring to use fingerprints “Financial institutions should use fraud protection as a competitive advantage,” commented James Roche, a principal fraud consultant at FICO. “Customers are looking for providers they can trust, so institutions should shout about the excellent fraud protection they provide. But when it comes to application and onboarding, they must be sure those protections, fraud checks and identity proofing are appropriate, proportionate and time-efficient to reduce the chance of dropouts.” Whilst 34% said they are more likely to open a financial account digitally than they were a year ago, the expectation for a frictionless experience has also increased. Consumers expect the application process to be fast. Almost one in five will abandon an application if the checks are too difficult or take too long. Two thirds expect to spend less than 30 minutes opening a current account. “If one place in the onboarding process sees a high proportion of dropouts, FIs should consider altering the order in which checks are made and whether some could happen once the customer has been accepted,” added Roche. The new report - Fraud, Identity and Digital Banking - reveals how the landscape has changed when it comes to identity verification. Just a few years ago biometrics was an unknown science for consumers. The FICO research shows the shift, as 54% believe fingerprint scans provide essential protection; 52% ranked face scans and 49% iris scans. However, more education is still needed on behavioural biometrics, with just 17% believing these provide excellent protection. The FICO report also identifies the financial crimes that consumers are most worried about, with identity theft to open a new account the top ranked concern at 30%. Bank account takeover was ranked the crime most feared by 20% of respondents and 16% ranked being tricked into sending money to a fraudster as the top concern. Giving customers confidence that a financial institution is using the best processes to mitigate against these threats is, therefore, critical. “Aiming for completely frictionless experiences could leave a financial institution over-exposed to fraud,” concluded Roche. “Indeed, appropriate friction can actually help customers feel protected. The reality is, checks must be proportionate and personal to each customer and interaction. Therefore, fraud protection needs to be adaptive, using all streams of customer data for the best outcome for the customer and the institution.” FICO® Platform unites core capabilities that aid detection and resolution across the customer lifecycle, including pre- and post-book. API access to third-party providers allows users to add and remove data sources as they see fit, and FICO Platform gives data science teams what they need to get their models into production. FICO models reduce false positives so fewer applicants are subjected to additional fraud checks.

The expansion showcases a commitment to industrial growth and customer support, integrating cutting-edge technology like robotics and automation for enhanced MRO performance. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Pratt & Whitney's engine center in Singapore is a strategic move that aligns with the growing demand for its Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines. The addition of a 48,000 square-foot facility represents a significant increase in capacity, allowing the company to overhaul more engines and reduce turnaround times for maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services. This development is particularly beneficial for airlines operating GTF-powered aircraft, as it promises enhanced service availability in the Asia Pacific region, which is a critical market for commercial aviation.From a market perspective, this expansion could strengthen Pratt & Whitney's competitive position in the MRO sector. By leveraging advanced technologies such as robotics, automation and machine learning, the company is poised to improve operational efficiency and safety, which could lead to cost savings and higher customer satisfaction. This may translate into increased market share and potentially higher revenues for Pratt & Whitney, thereby positively impacting the financial performance of its parent company, Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX). Aerospace Industry Analyst The aerospace industry is witnessing a surge in demand for fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly engines, with the GTF engine being a front-runner in this space. Pratt & Whitney's investment in expanding MRO capabilities is a direct response to the growing GTF fleet. By 2025, the company anticipates a network of 19 active GTF MRO shops globally, indicating a robust aftermarket service infrastructure. This expansion is not only a testament to the success of the GTF engine but also a strategic initiative to capture the aftermarket revenue that is crucial for the long-term profitability of aerospace companies.Furthermore, the integration of transformative technologies in MRO processes is expected to set new industry standards. Pratt & Whitney's approach to automating complex procedures such as high-pressure compressor rotor stacking and utilizing collaborative robots (cobots) to assist human inspectors could become a benchmark for efficiency and safety in engine maintenance. As airlines and leasing companies often consider the availability and quality of MRO services when selecting engine options, Pratt & Whitney's enhanced capabilities could influence future engine selection decisions and fleet renewals. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the capital investment in expanding the MRO facility could lead to significant operational leverage for Pratt & Whitney. By increasing the throughput of engine overhauls and reducing labor-intensive tasks through automation, the company is likely to see improved margins on its MRO services. Additionally, the increased capacity may allow the company to secure more service contracts, which are typically high-margin and provide a stable revenue stream.Investors in Raytheon Technologies (NYSE: RTX) will likely monitor the impact of this expansion on the company's aftermarket services revenue, which is a key driver of profitability in the aerospace sector. The ability to service a larger number of engines efficiently could also serve as a hedge against cyclical downturns in new engine sales, making the company's revenue streams more resilient. It is important to note that such expansions are capital-intensive and may affect short-term cash flows; however, the long-term benefits are expected to outweigh these initial costs. 02/19/2024 - 01:00 AM SINGAPORE, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- (SINGAPORE AIRSHOW) Pratt & Whitney, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, today announced the official opening of a 48,000 square-foot expansion of its Singapore based engine center, Eagle Services Asia (ESA).

Positive Trident Royalties Plc extends the completion date for the acquisition of a 3.0% Gross Revenue Royalty over the Sonora Lithium Project in Mexico to 2026.

Trident Royalties Plc is not required to provide funding for Sonoroy if changes in Mexico's regulatory regime significantly impact the Sonora project. The company aims to secure a Tier 1 royalty position with significant upside potential in the Sonora Lithium Project. Trident Royalties Plc emphasizes the long-life and expansion optionality of the Sonora project, operated by Ganfeng Lithium Co, Ltd., a world-class specialist in lithium. The extension of the acquisition completion date allows for resolution of ongoing litigation and administrative review challenges, providing a protected position for Trident Royalties Plc. Adam Davidson, the CEO of Trident Royalties Plc, highlights the potential of the Sonora royalty to offer exposure to a lucrative lithium project. The Estate of Colin Orr-Ewing, along with its advisors, are commended for their partnership with Trident Royalties Plc in navigating the evolving situation.

Trident has also agreed that other than in limited circumstances, the repayment date for its loan to Sonoroy is extended until the earlier of: (i) 31 December 2026; or (ii) completion of the Transaction.As previously notified, the Royalty is the subject of litigation between the Estate and Bacanora, which is being adjudicated by the Court of King's Bench of Alberta. Trident may terminate the JV if the litigation is finally resolved in favor of Bacanora, or if it is unresolved by the long-stop date. In addition, the project operator Ganfeng Lithium Co, Ltd., and its Mexican subsidiaries, have filed administrative review recourses before the Secretary of Economy in relation to the cancellation of nine lithium concessions by the Mexican Government, which comprise the Sonora project. Ganfeng notes the cancellation as violating both Mexican and international law.1 Trident is not required to provide funding in respect of Sonoroy to enable it to complete the acquisition, if at the time of funding there are changes to Mexico's regulatory regime which, in Trident's reasonable opinion, materially affects the Sonora project.Adam Davidson, Chief Executive Officer of Trident commented:""The Sonora royalty has the potential to become a Tier 1 royalty, providing exposure to a long-life lithium project with expansion optionality and operated by a world class lithium specialist. The transaction structure provides Trident with the ability to participate in the potential significant upside associated with the project from a low-cost and protected position.This extension to complete the Sonora royalty acquisition gives sufficient time to allow a resolution to both the Alberta litigation, as well as the administrative review filed by Ganfeng regarding the cancellation of the project concessions.

Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt.

The application is based on results from the TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial, showing significant improvements in progression-free survival compared to standard care. Positive Acceptance of BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan in the U.S. for nonsquamous NSCLC treatment. Results from TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial led to the BLA acceptance. Statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival observed with datopotamab deruxtecan. Interim results show a favorable trend in overall survival compared to docetaxel. Safety profile consistent with previous trials, no new safety concerns identified. Potential for datopotamab deruxtecan to become the first TROP2 directed ADC for lung cancer patients. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent acceptance of the Biologics License Application for datopotamab deruxtecan by the FDA marks a significant milestone in the treatment of nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Given the complexity of cancer treatment and the limited options for patients with advanced stages of NSCLC, the development of new therapies is critical. Datopotamab deruxtecan, as a TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC), represents an innovative approach, leveraging targeted therapy to deliver cytotoxic drugs directly to cancer cells, potentially reducing systemic toxicity. From a clinical perspective, the improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) is a promising outcome, indicating a delay in disease progression. Although the overall survival (OS) data are not yet statistically significant, the trend towards benefit is encouraging. The safety profile's consistency with previous trials suggests a manageable risk profile, which is of utmost importance for patients already burdened with treatment side effects. Medical Research Analyst The TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial's results are pivotal for the potential approval of datopotamab deruxtecan. The trial's dual primary endpoints, PFS and OS, are standard measures of efficacy in oncology clinical trials. The statistically significant PFS improvement over docetaxel positions datopotamab deruxtecan favorably against the current standard of care. However, investors and stakeholders should remain cautious until the final OS results are available, as regulatory approval and market adoption can be significantly influenced by these outcomes. Furthermore, the parallel submission for breast cancer treatment and additional global submissions indicate a strategic approach to expanding the drug's market presence. The potential approval in multiple indications could lead to a substantial increase in the addressable patient population, which is a critical factor for the financial performance of Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. Market Research Analyst The acceptance of datopotamab deruxtecan's BLA by the FDA is indicative of its potential market impact. NSCLC accounts for a significant proportion of lung cancer cases and nonsquamous NSCLC represents a considerable segment within this category. As such, the introduction of a new treatment option could disrupt existing treatment paradigms and capture market share. The market will be closely monitoring the PDUFA date set for December 20, 2024, as approval could lead to rapid commercialization efforts. It's important to note that the competitive landscape includes other pharmaceutical companies developing targeted therapies for NSCLC. The market's reception of datopotamab deruxtecan will depend on its comparative efficacy, safety profile and pricing strategy in relation to these competitors. Additionally, the ongoing regulatory discussions and submissions for other indications suggest a long-term strategy for growth and diversification of the product portfolio, which could have a positive impact on the company's stock performance and market valuation. 02/19/2024 - 02:00 AM Application based on results from the TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial If approved, Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca’s datopotamab deruxtecan may be the first TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate for patients with lung cancer TOKYO & BASKING RIDGE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Daiichi Sankyo (TSE: 4568) and AstraZeneca’s (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) Biologics License Application (BLA) for datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) has been accepted in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received prior systemic therapy. Datopotamab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered TROP2 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action date for its regulatory decision, is December 20, 2024. The BLA is based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Lung01 phase 3 trial presented at a Presidential Symposium at the European Society for Medical Oncology (#ESMO23) 2023 Congress. In the trial, datopotamab deruxtecan demonstrated a statistically significant improvement for the dual primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) compared to docetaxel, the current standard of care, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC treated with at least one prior line of therapy. For the dual primary endpoint of overall survival (OS), interim results numerically favored datopotamab deruxtecan over docetaxel in the overall population, however, results did not reach statistical significance at the time of data cut-off. In patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, datopotamab deruxtecan showed a clinically meaningful PFS benefit and a numerically favorable OS trend. The trial is ongoing and OS will be assessed at final analysis. The safety profile of datopotamab deruxtecan was consistent with that observed in other ongoing trials with no new safety concerns identified. “Today’s news is an important step forward in our goal of creating new standards of care that have the potential to transform the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer,” said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. “We are encouraged by the FDA's acceptance of the BLA as we endeavor to make datopotamab deruxtecan the first TROP2 directed antibody drug conjugate approved to treat patients with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer after disease progression on prior systemic therapy. We look forward to working closely with the FDA to bring datopotamab deruxtecan to patients.” “Datopotamab deruxtecan has the potential to offer patients with previously treated advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer an effective and tolerable alternative to conventional chemotherapy,” said Susan Galbraith, MBBChir, PhD, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca. “With regulatory discussions ongoing around the world and a parallel submission underway in the U.S. in breast cancer, this is only the beginning of our efforts to make this novel treatment available to patients as quickly as possible.” A parallel BLA for datopotamab deruxtecan based on results from the pivotal TROPION-Breast01 phase 3 trial is pending acceptance in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic hormone receptor (HR) positive, HER2 negative (IHC 0, IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-) breast cancer. Additional regulatory submissions for datopotamab deruxtecan in lung and breast cancer are underway globally. About TROPION-Lung01 TROPION-Lung01 is an ongoing global, randomized, multicenter, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with and without actionable genomic alterations previously treated with at least one prior line of therapy. Patients with actionable genomic alterations were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and an approved targeted therapy. Patients without known actionable genomic alterations were previously treated, concurrently or sequentially, with platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. The dual primary endpoints of TROPION-Lung01 are PFS as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and OS. Key secondary endpoints include investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate, duration of response, time to response, disease control rate as assessed by both BICR and investigator, and safety. TROPION-Lung01 enrolled approximately 600 patients in Asia, Europe, North America and South America. For more information visit ClinicalTrials.gov. About Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Nearly 250,000 lung cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2023.1 NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of cases.1 Approximately 70% and 30% of NSCLC tumors are of nonsquamous or squamous histology, respectively.2 While immunotherapy and targeted therapies have improved outcomes in the first-line setting, most patients eventually experience disease progression and receive chemotherapy.3,4,5 For decades, chemotherapy has been the last treatment available for patients with advanced NSCLC, despite limited effectiveness and known side effects.3,4,5 TROP2 is a protein broadly expressed in the majority of NSCLC tumors.6 There is currently no TROP2 directed ADC approved for the treatment of lung cancer.7,8 About Datopotamab Deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is an investigational TROP2 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo’s proprietary DXd ADC Technology, datopotamab deruxtecan is one of six DXd ADCs in the oncology pipeline of Daiichi Sankyo, and one of the most advanced programs in AstraZeneca’s ADC scientific platform. Datopotamab deruxtecan is comprised of a humanized anti-TROP2 IgG1 monoclonal antibody, developed in collaboration with Sapporo Medical University, attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers. A comprehensive development program called TROPION is underway globally with more than 14 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of datopotamab deruxtecan across multiple cancers, including NSCLC, triple negative breast cancer and HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer. Beyond the TROPION program, datopotamab deruxtecan also is being evaluated in novel combinations in several ongoing trials. About the Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca Collaboration Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca entered into a global collaboration to jointly develop and commercialize ENHERTU in March 2019 and datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in July 2020, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo maintains exclusive rights for each ADC.

The common shares will remain registered in the Securities Registry and continue to be traded on the Santiago Stock Exchange and the Chilean Electronic Exchange. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The cancellation of the registration of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS with the SEC is a significant financial event that may have various implications for the bank's liquidity and international investor base. From a financial standpoint, the termination of the ADS program could suggest a strategic pivot towards the bank's domestic market and operations. This move might be interpreted as a way to streamline operations and reduce the regulatory burden associated with SEC reporting requirements. However, it could also limit the bank's access to a broader range of international investors and potentially narrow the liquidity of its shares.It is important to consider the cost-benefit analysis that led to this decision. The costs of compliance with SEC regulations can be substantial and if the trading volume and interest in the ADS were low, it might not justify the expenses. Additionally, the bank will continue to be listed on the Santiago Stock Exchange, which could mitigate some of the potential negative impacts on liquidity. Investors should closely monitor the bank's future financial disclosures for any changes in its capital structure or funding strategies that may arise from this decision. Market Research Analyst The termination of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS program reflects a broader trend where some international companies are delisting from U.S. exchanges. This could be due to the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, shifts in market strategies, or a focus on consolidating investor bases within their primary markets. For the Chilean banking sector, this move may signal a more localized approach to capital markets, potentially affecting how Chilean banks engage with international investors.Market participants should assess the potential impact on the bank's valuation, as the perceived accessibility and attractiveness to foreign investors might change. Furthermore, the bank's decision to maintain its presence on the Chilean exchanges indicates a commitment to its local market, which could have implications for its domestic competitive positioning. Stakeholders should also consider the potential for similar moves by other firms in the region, which could influence the overall dynamics of capital flows and foreign investment in Latin America. Legal Expert The legal implications of Banco Itaú Chile's ADS cancellation involve a release from the reporting obligations imposed by the SEC. This decision will affect the legal framework within which the bank operates, particularly in terms of disclosure and compliance. The bank's adherence to the regulatory deadlines highlights its commitment to regulatory compliance, even in the process of delisting. For the bank, this could mean a reduction in legal and administrative costs related to SEC filings.It is also essential to consider the legal ramifications for current ADS holders, as they will no longer have the protections and transparency afforded by SEC oversight. This shift requires careful communication with shareholders and adherence to Chilean regulations to maintain trust and uphold the bank's reputation in the financial community. The bank's continued registration in the Chilean Securities Registry ensures it remains under the purview of local regulations, which may differ from those of the SEC in terms of reporting standards and investor protections. 02/19/2024 - 05:11 PM SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BANCO ITAÚ CHILE (SSE: ITAUCL) (the “Company”) today announces that it filed a Material Event Notice with the Chilean Commission for the Financial Market (Comisión para el Mercado Financiero) announcing that, on February 18, 2024, the cancellation of the registration of the American Depositary Shares (“ADS”) issued by the Bank with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States of America (“SEC”) has become effective, and the reporting obligations of the Bank before said entity were terminated.

Positive The acquisition of Discover by Capital One is valued at $35.3 billion, with Discover shareholders receiving 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a 26.6% premium based on Discover's closing price on February 16, 2024. The combined company will have a global payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points in over 200 countries, positioning it to compete with major payments companies and deliver enhanced value to over 100 million customers. The transaction is expected to generate $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies and be more than 15% accretive to adjusted non-GAAP EPS in 2027, with a return on invested capital of 16% and an internal rate of return exceeding 20%. Capital One's acquisition of Discover aims to leverage technology, data ecosystem, and customer base to drive sales for merchants and offer great deals for consumers and small businesses, building a globally competitive payments network. Both companies have a strong track record of financial performance, customer experiences, innovation, and inclusion, with a focus on delivering value to consumers, small businesses, merchants, and shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, with three Discover Board members joining the Capital One Board of Directors upon closing. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Discover by Capital One represents a significant consolidation in the financial services industry, particularly within the payments and credit card sectors. The all-stock deal, valued at $35.3 billion, indicates a strategic move by Capital One to enhance its market position against major payments networks. The 26.6% premium paid over Discover's closing price suggests Capital One's confidence in the synergies and future earnings potential of the combined entity.An important aspect to consider is the expected generation of $2.7 billion in pre-tax synergies by 2027. This figure is substantial and indicates operational efficiencies and potential cost savings. The accretive nature of the transaction to the non-GAAP EPS by over 15% in 2027 is a positive signal to shareholders, as it suggests earnings growth post-acquisition. Moreover, the projected ROIC of 16% and IRR exceeding 20% are robust metrics that underscore the financial soundness of the deal.The combined entity's capital position, with a CET1 ratio of approximately 14%, remains strong, providing resilience and potential for further growth. The increase in insured deposits to 84% is also a noteworthy aspect, as it may contribute to the stability of the combined company's funding base. Market Research Analyst The merger between Capital One and Discover creates a payments platform with 70 million merchant acceptance points globally, which is significant in the context of competing with larger payments companies. The scale and reach of this network can be expected to provide competitive advantages in terms of merchant relationships and consumer offerings.Furthermore, the combination of Capital One's 'Digital First' banking strategy with Discover's direct savings bank could accelerate growth in the national banking sector. This is particularly relevant as the banking industry continues to shift towards digital platforms. The customer experience accolades received by Capital One, such as the #1 ranking in U.S. National Banking Overall Customer Satisfaction by J.D. Power, could be further enhanced by Discover's contributions.It is also important to note the implications for market competition. The merger reduces the number of independent credit card networks, potentially altering competitive dynamics. Regulators and industry observers will likely scrutinize the impact on consumers and merchants to ensure that the consolidation does not lead to reduced choices or increased fees. Technology Transformation Expert Capital One's eleven-year technology transformation is a cornerstone of this acquisition. The integration of Discover's businesses into this advanced technological framework is expected to drive innovation and efficiency across the combined enterprise. The emphasis on a 'Digital First' approach aligns with broader industry trends towards real-time marketing, enhanced risk management and improved customer experiences.The ability to scale Capital One's technology across Discover's network could lead to faster product development and more personalized services for consumers. This tech leverage is critical in the financial sector where fintech companies and traditional banks are in a continuous race to provide cutting-edge digital solutions. The success of this technology integration will be a key determinant of the combined company's ability to deliver on the promised synergies and maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. 02/19/2024 - 06:41 PM Under the terms of the agreement, Discover shareholders will receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a premium of 26.6% based on Discover's closing price of $110.49 on February 16, 2024. Transaction is 100% stock consideration.

The transaction brings together two companies with long-standing track records of delivering attractive and resilient financial results, award-winning customer experiences, breakthrough innovation, and financial inclusion. Under the terms of the agreement, Discover shareholders will receive 1.0192 Capital One shares for each Discover share, representing a premium of 26.6% based on Discover's closing price of $110.49 on February 16, 2024. At close, Capital One shareholders will own approximately 60% and Discover shareholders will own approximately 40% of the combined company. ""From Capital One's founding days, we set out to build a payments and banking company powered by modern technology. Our acquisition of Discover is a singular opportunity to bring together two very successful companies with complementary capabilities and franchises, and to build a payments network that can compete with the largest payments networks and payments companies,"" said Richard Fairbank, founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Capital One. ""Through this combination, we're creating a company that is exceptionally well-positioned to create significant value for consumers, small businesses, merchants, and shareholders as technology continues to transform the payments and banking marketplace."" ""The transaction with Capital One brings together two strong brands with enhanced ability to accelerate growth and maximizes value for our shareholders, enabling them to participate in the tremendous upside of the combined company,"" said Michael Rhodes, CEO and President of Discover. ""This agreement underscores the strength of our business and is a testament to the hard work of Discover employees. We look forward to a bright future as part of the Capital One family and to providing expanded opportunities for our loyal customers."" Powerful Strategic Rationale: Positioned to Deliver for Consumers, Small Businesses, and Merchants Building a Globally Competitive Payments Network Discover has built a rare and valuable global payments network with 70 million merchant acceptance points in more than 200 countries and territories. Even so, it is the smallest of the four US-based global payments networks. This acquisition adds scale and investment, enabling the Discover network to be more competitive with the largest payments networks and payments companies. This is a key foundation in Capital One's quest to build a global payments company. It will accelerate the company's long-standing journey to work directly with merchants to leverage its customer base, technology, and data ecosystem to drive more sales for the merchant and great deals for consumers and small businesses.Combining Complementary Card Businesses Capital One and Discover are proven credit card franchises with complementary strategies and a shared focus on the customer. Both companies have developed compelling flagship products, award-winning customer experiences, and powerful brands. They have also both delivered attractive and resilient growth and returns through economic cycles. The combined credit card business will be in an even stronger position to deliver industry-leading products and experiences that span the credit card marketplace across consumers, small businesses, and merchants.Scaling our ""Digital First"" National Bank Capital One Bank is propelled by an iconic customer experience and a strikingly simple value proposition. It is the only major bank with no fees, no minimums, and no overdraft fees. According to J.D. Power, customers have rated Capital One Bank #1 in U.S. National Banking Overall Customer Satisfaction for four consecutive years. Customers can enjoy an entirely digital, full-service banking experience, or visit one of 259 branches, more than 80,000 fee-free ATMs, more than 16,000 cash deposit locations, and 55 iconic Capital One Cafes in 21 of the country's 25 largest metro areas. Adding Discover's fast-growing national direct savings bank will increase the combined company's scale to compete with the nation's largest banks, and the Discover Global Network brings a significant opportunity to accelerate national banking growth.Leveraging our Technology Transformation Capital One will scale and leverage the benefits of an eleven-year technology transformation across all of Discover's businesses and the network. Capital One's technology transformation is powering innovation, much faster speed to market, breakthrough products and experiences, real-time customized marketing, faster growth, better underwriting, enhanced efficiency, and better risk management and compliance.Compelling Financial Results Creating Significant Synergies The transaction is expected to generate expense synergies of $1.5 billion in 2027 (26% of Discover operating expenses, plus 10% of Discover marketing expenses), driven by common business functions partially offset by targeted investments in the Discover network. The acquisition is expected to generate network synergies of $1.2 billion in 2027, driven by adding Capital One debit purchase volume and selected credit card purchase volume to the Discover network.Delivering Attractive Accretion and Returns The deal is expected to be more than 15% accretive to adjusted non-GAAP EPS in 2027. The transaction is expected to deliver return on invested capital of 16% in 2027, with an internal rate of return in excess of 20%.Strengthening a Strong Balance Sheet The transaction will further strengthen Capital One's balance sheet. On a pro forma basis, the combined company would have a CET1 ratio of approximately 14% at closing, and 84% of company deposits would be insured as of year-end 2023.Making a Positive Difference in our Communities Both Capital One and Discover have proud histories of commitments to their communities. Capital One has a long-standing track record of ""Outstanding"" Community Reinvestment Act performance since 2001, and has ranked first or second in community development lending among all banks since 2015, with over $59 billion in CRA-qualified loans over that period. Capital One is in the fourth year of its 5-year, $200 million Impact Initiative, supporting non-profit organizations seeking innovative solutions to address Affordable Housing, Workforce Development, Small Business Creation, Financial Well-being and Digital Access. Capital One appreciates the importance of Chicagoland and remains committed to maintaining a strong presence in that market, as well as maintaining service excellence across the U.S.Building One of America's Great Places to Work Both Capital One and Discover have been recognized as great places to work on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For® list. This year was Capital One's 12th consecutive year on the prestigious list.Timing and Approvals The transaction is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of each company. Governance Upon closing, three Discover Board members, to be named at a later date, will join the Capital One Board of Directors.

The site's yearly consumption of 36,000 megawatt hours is equivalent to powering nearly 5,000 homes, marking one of RTX's largest renewable energy projects. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Analyst Transitioning to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step for any manufacturing operation, particularly in the aerospace industry where the environmental impact is a growing concern. The move by Collins Aerospace's facility in Tanauan City to source its energy from a geothermal power plant demonstrates a commitment to sustainability that could have a ripple effect throughout the supply chain. This shift not only reduces the site's carbon footprint by an estimated 25,000 metric tons annually but also aligns with global trends of increased environmental responsibility.From an investor's perspective, this proactive approach to sustainability may enhance the company's reputation and potentially lead to increased market share as customers and partners increasingly favor environmentally conscious suppliers. Additionally, the long-term cost savings from renewable energy sources can improve financial performance by reducing energy expenses over time. However, the initial investment and transition costs must be considered, as they could impact short-term financials. Energy Sector Analyst The adoption of renewable energy, particularly geothermal, by a significant player in the aerospace sector like Collins Aerospace, is indicative of broader shifts in the energy market. Geothermal energy is reliable and less variable than other renewable sources such as wind or solar, offering a consistent power supply crucial for manufacturing operations. This strategic choice may position RTX as a leader in industrial renewable energy adoption, potentially influencing competitors and partners to follow suit.For stakeholders, the emphasis on renewable energy can be seen as a mitigation strategy against volatile fossil fuel prices and potential regulation risks associated with carbon emissions. It's important to note that geothermal energy's availability is geographically dependent, which may limit replication of this specific strategy across all RTX facilities. The impact on the stock market could be positive if investors view this as a sign of the company's resilience and adaptability to future energy landscapes. Market Research Analyst Collins Aerospace's shift to renewable energy in its Tanauan City facility aligns with increasing consumer and investor demand for corporate sustainability practices. This trend is reflected in the growing market for sustainable investments and the positive reception of green initiatives by the public. The announcement could influence the perception of Collins Aerospace and RTX in the eyes of environmentally-conscious investors and consumers, potentially affecting brand loyalty and investment interest.It is essential to monitor how this transition influences the company's operational efficiency and whether it leads to a competitive advantage. If successful, RTX may set a precedent for environmental leadership in the aerospace sector, which could translate into market growth and enhanced shareholder value. However, it remains to be seen how effectively the company can communicate this initiative's benefits to stakeholders and whether it can maintain operational excellence while pursuing its sustainability goals. 02/19/2024 - 05:00 PM Site is one of more than 20 RTX facilities that purchase 100% of their electricity from renewable resources SINGAPORE, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- (SINGAPORE AIRSHOW) -- Collins Aerospace, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, today announced its facility in Tanauan City, Philippines is now operating on 100% renewable electricity.

Whirlpool Corporation Declares Quarterly Dividend,2024-02-20T00:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Whirlpool Corporation announces a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share on common stock, payable on March 15, 2024.","Whirlpool Corporation Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Whirlpool Corporation announces a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share on common stock, payable on March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Whirlpool Corporation's quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share represents a significant return to shareholders and warrants an examination of the company's dividend policy and its sustainability. This payout ratio, in comparison to the company's net income and free cash flow, can provide insights into whether the dividend is supported by the firm's earnings or if it might be drawing on reserves or debt. Analyzing the trends in dividend payouts over time and the company's financial health, particularly its balance sheet and cash flow statements, is crucial in assessing the risk of future dividend cuts.Furthermore, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock's price, is a critical metric for investors. It offers a comparative measure against industry benchmarks and fixed-income alternatives, which may influence investment decisions in the context of the broader market. The declaration can also signal management's confidence in the company's financial stability and future earnings potential. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the dividend declaration by Whirlpool may affect investor sentiment and stock performance. Dividends are often seen as a sign of a company's maturity and stability, which can attract income-focused investors and potentially increase demand for the stock. The timing and size of the dividend could also reflect the company's competitive position within the home appliance industry, indicating how it is managing cash flows in relation to its capital expenditure, research and development and any potential mergers or acquisitions.It's important to consider the impact of this dividend on the company's stock liquidity and volatility. A stable or increasing dividend can lead to a more liquid market for the shares and potentially lower volatility, as it may be perceived as a sign of financial health and predictability. Conversely, changes in dividend policy can cause fluctuations in stock price as market perceptions adjust. Economist Examining the broader economic context in which Whirlpool's dividend declaration occurs is essential. Factors such as inflation rates, interest rates and economic growth can influence the real return of dividends to investors. In a high inflation environment, for instance, the purchasing power of dividend payouts may be eroded, prompting investors to seek higher yields to compensate for the loss in value. Conversely, in a low-interest-rate environment, dividends can become more attractive relative to bond yields, potentially increasing the stock's appeal to yield-seeking investors.It's also pertinent to analyze the potential impact of such dividend declarations on consumer behavior. If a large number of companies within the economy are increasing dividends, this could signal overall corporate confidence and potentially lead to increased consumer spending. However, if dividend increases are not widespread, the implications for consumer confidence and spending may be more muted. 02/19/2024 - 07:01 PM BENTON HARBOR, Mich., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the board of directors of Whirlpool Corporation (the ""Company"") declared a quarterly dividend of $1.75 per share on the Company's common stock.

(BGS) has provided details on the tax treatment for dividends paid in 2023 on the Company’s common stock. The company distributed $0.76000 per share, all treated as a return of capital, with no taxable dividends. Shareholders are advised to review their tax statements and consult tax advisors for individual tax treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Tax Advisor The classification of B&G Foods' distributions as a return of capital rather than taxable dividends has significant implications for investors. Primarily, a return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the stock, which could defer taxes until the stock is sold. This is in contrast to dividends, which are typically taxed in the year they are received. The deferral of tax liability may be advantageous for investors seeking to optimize their tax positions. However, once the adjusted basis of the stock reaches zero, any further return of capital distributions would be taxed as capital gains.Investors need to be aware that the reclassification can affect their investment strategy, particularly if they rely on dividend income for cash flow. In such cases, the lack of taxable dividends might necessitate a reassessment of portfolio yields and cash flow expectations. Moreover, this treatment underscores the importance of accurate record-keeping for tax purposes, as it directly impacts capital gains calculations upon the sale of the stock. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the shift to return of capital indicates that B&G Foods is not generating enough taxable income to cover its dividend payments. This could be a red flag for the company's financial health and sustainability of its dividend policy. Investors and analysts should closely examine the company's earnings and cash flow statements to assess the underlying reasons for this tax treatment.Furthermore, the market's reaction to such news can be mixed. While some investors may appreciate the tax-efficient nature of return of capital, others may be concerned about the company's long-term profitability and ability to generate income. It is essential to monitor the stock's performance and investor sentiment following the announcement, as it may provide insights into market perceptions of the company's financial trajectory. Market Research Analyst In the context of the broader food industry, companies often strive for a balance between returning value to shareholders and reinvesting in the business for growth. The announcement by B&G Foods should be analyzed against industry benchmarks and peer performance. If B&G Foods' approach deviates significantly from its peers, it could suggest strategic differences or signal a unique financial situation.It is also critical to understand the competitive landscape and how B&G Foods' financial strategies might affect its market position. For instance, if the return of capital is a result of strategic asset sales or cost-cutting measures, it could have implications for the company's long-term competitive advantages and operational capabilities. 02/19/2024 - 04:55 PM PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- B&G Foods, Inc.

(OTC: FUNN) published financials results for the quarter ending December 31, 2023. The following update provides a brief summary to shareholders and the investment community. FUNN Q2 FY 2024 Report Business Highlights (All numbers in USD): Gross Revenue of $2,293,505 USD (Slight increase YoY Quarterly)Gross Profit of $1,740,957 USD (Slight increase YoY Quarterly)FY2024 cumulative revenue $4,309,325 (Slight increase YoY cumulative)Common Stock Outstanding of 795,493,000 (unchanged)COGS are on target hitting just below 25%. The Company wants to maintain this as this is appreciable given COGS are decreasing while revenues are increasingAccount Receivable grew from ~$113,000 to ~$132,000 reflecting healthy activity of Corporate Events over the holidays (B to B activity)The Company beat the previous FY Q2 by 15% on Hospitality revenues (location growth)Cash on hand at the end of the quarter slightly decreased to $64,432 with total assets of $3,716,681.No convertible debt instruments into future equity of the company were issued.Tradeable public float is 527,923,441, as of December 31st, 2023. (This is cumulative throughout the entire trading history dating back to 1985 with no recapitalizations or reverse splits throughout the entire, going on 39-year history of the Company.) The Company is pleased with the growing revenue trend, and are on track for the company objective of $10 M+ USD in revenues for FY 2024 as we continue to strengthen our corporate level fiscal position. Hospitality revenue alone has been on a solid overall positive growth trend for the last 10 quarters since emerging from the pandemic. Over the past year, the Company has removed over $2 million in debt / liabilities from the books resulting in 5 convertible notes remaining. These remaining notes are all associated with the acquisition and renovation of the Snakes & Lattes Inc. Tucson location. All notes are at a fixed price much higher than current market trading prices. The oldest of those remaining notes was recently repurchased by the Company to avoid conversion and any dilution to shareholders. (Note: The note holders are friendly and supporters of the Company) Dilution for any company is a concern, but the potential conversion rate had a significantly higher fixed conversion rate. This helps confirm to shareholders the stock is not seeing high dilution. There were no stock issuances in the quarter, or any convertible notes written to assure stockholders that preservation of shareholder value, combined with the growth of the underlying business is of utmost importance to the Company. The Company has mostly used traditional financing to expand operations over the years. The most recent brick and mortar location, now known as Snakes & Lattes Inc., Virginia Beach was an almost all cash acquisition. The previous quarter Q1 FY 24 was our best Q1 of all time (excluding logistics activities 2018-2019) with hospitality up 14% FY Q over Q. COGS went down 12% overall with the last rolling 4 quarters being our top 4 quarters for revenues. Looking forward: The Company looks forward to announcing future updates to the shareholders and investment community at large throughout calendar 2024 as we strive to capitalize on what we have built over the past years. The Company continues to grow revenues over time, and the trend is now years long. All key business indicators are positive growth oriented. The Company hopes to capitalize on a number of growth initiatives in 2024 and beyond and will be excited to share news with everyone as milestones are crossed or pertinent information becomes available. There are always new avenues being explored and look forward to making some of them a reality. As always, a big thanks to all our shareholders, supporters, loyal guests, and staff.

Q4 2023 revenues increased by 3% to $70.6 million compared to Q4 2022. Operating income for Q4 2023 was $4.3 million, up 38% from Q4 2022. Net income in Q4 2023 rose by 87% to $4.6 million.

Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2023 increased by 15% to $61.3 million. A 12% increase in quarterly cash dividend declared by the Board of Directors. 2024 outlook projects revenue between $292.0 - $296.0 million and adjusted EBITDA between $64.5 - $67.5 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial results of HealthStream, Inc. indicate a positive trend in the company's performance, with a 3% increase in fourth quarter revenues and a 5% increase in full-year revenues. Notably, the 38% rise in operating income and 87% surge in net income for Q4, along with a 29% and 26% increase respectively for the full year, demonstrate a robust improvement in profitability. The growth in net income is particularly impressive, nearly doubling from the previous year's quarter, which may reflect operational efficiencies and successful strategic initiatives.From a financial analysis perspective, the company's capitalization of labor for software development suggests a strategic investment in technology to drive future growth, although it's important to note that this also leads to higher amortization expenses. The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend, with a 12% increase, could be seen as a signal of confidence in HealthStream's financial health and a commitment to delivering shareholder value.Looking ahead, the company's 2024 guidance indicates a continued positive trajectory. However, investors should consider the potential impact of external economic factors, such as inflationary pressures and the fact that the guidance does not account for possible acquisitions or changes in the value of minority investments. These factors could introduce variability to the forecasted outcomes. Market Research Analyst HealthStream's performance can be partially attributed to its strategic focus on the healthcare technology sector, which is experiencing growth due to increasing demand for digital solutions. The expansion into the nursing education market and the development of the hStream platform are strategic moves that broaden the company's addressable market and enhance its product ecosystem.The Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model adopted by HealthStream is becoming increasingly popular in the healthcare industry, as it allows for scalability and interoperability between different applications and services. The reported 5.79 million contracted subscriptions to hStream highlight the platform's adoption and potential for recurring revenue streams. The introduction of e-commerce capabilities, targeting direct sales to healthcare professionals, represents a diversification of sales channels, which could further drive revenue growth.It's important to monitor the competitive landscape and the adoption rates of new products and services. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of healthcare providers will be critical for maintaining its growth momentum. Legal Expert The financial report includes a discussion on non-GAAP financial measures, specifically adjusted EBITDA. It is crucial for stakeholders to understand that these measures exclude certain expenses and income that are included in the most comparable GAAP measures. While management believes that adjusted EBITDA provides a more reflective measure of the company's operating performance, it is essential to recognize that these are not standardized measures and may not be directly comparable to similar metrics reported by other companies.The company's early adoption of ASU 2021-08 has implications for how contracts acquired in acquisitions are treated. This accounting update allows the company to avoid write-downs of deferred revenue to fair value, which historically has impacted reported revenue and net income. By adjusting for these write-downs in their adjusted EBITDA, HealthStream aims to provide a clearer picture of the underlying performance post-acquisition. Stakeholders should be aware of these accounting practices when evaluating the company's financial health and future prospects. 02/19/2024 - 04:30 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HealthStream, Inc. (the ""Company"") (Nasdaq: HSTM), a leading healthcare technology platform for workforce solutions, announced today results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenues of $70.6 million, up 3% from $68.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Operating income of $4.3 million, up 38% from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Net income of $4.6 million, up 87% from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.15 per share (diluted), up from $0.08 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2022 Adjusted EBITDA1 of $16.0 million, up 17% from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.028 per share, an increase of 12% over the previous quarter’s dividend of $0.025 per share Full-Year 2023 Revenues of $279.1 million, up 5% from $266.8 million in 2022 Operating income of $16.0 million, up 29% from $12.4 million in 2022 Net income of $15.2 million, up 26% from $12.1 million in 2022 Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.50 per share (diluted) in 2023, compared to $0.39 per share (diluted) in 2022 Adjusted EBITDA of $61.3 million, up 15% from $53.4 million in 2022 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income and disclosure regarding why we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors is included later in this release. Financial Results: Fourth Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by $2.1 million, or three percent, to $70.6 million, compared to $68.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Subscription revenues increased $2.6 million, or four percent, and professional services revenues declined by $0.5 million. Operating income was $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, up 38% from $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to the growth in revenues, a reduction in labor costs, and an increase in labor capitalized for software development activities. Partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs for software, cloud hosting, sales commissions, and bad debt, and an increase in amortization associated with capitalized software. Other income during the fourth quarter of 2023 included a $0.4 million gain associated with the sale of a company in which we owned a minority equity interest. Net income was $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 87% from $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and EPS was $0.15 per share (diluted) in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from $0.08 per share (diluted) for the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $16.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, up 17 percent from $13.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. At December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of $71.1 million. Capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter of 2023 were $7.2 million. Full-Year 2023 Compared to Full-Year 2022 For 2023, revenues were $279.1 million, an increase of five percent from revenues of $266.8 million for 2022. Operating income for 2023 increased by 29 percent to $16.0 million, compared to $12.4 million for 2022. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to higher revenues and an increase in capitalized labor associated with software development activities. Operating income was also impacted by higher amortization, software, cloud hosting, commissions, royalties, travel, and bad debt expenses, as well as severance charges incurred during 2023 in connection with the Company’s restructuring under a single platform strategy. Net income for 2023 was $15.2 million, compared to $12.1 million for 2022. Earnings per share were $0.50 per share (diluted) for 2023, compared to $0.39 per share (diluted) for 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 15 percent to $61.3 million for 2023, compared to $53.4 million for 2022. Other Business Updates As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 5.79 million contracted subscriptions to hStream, our Platform-as-a-Service technology, which characterizes our single platform approach. By establishing interoperability, the hStream platform enables healthcare organizations and their respective workforces to easily connect to and gain value from the growing HealthStream ecosystem of applications, tools, and content. On September 13, 2023, the Company announced a share repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors under which the Company is authorized to repurchase of up to $10.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. Pursuant to this authorization, the Company has repurchased shares valued at $8.9 million through December 31, 2023, with $6.8 million repurchased during the fourth quarter. The share repurchase program is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of March 31, 2024 or when the maximum dollar amount has been expended. The share repurchase program does not require the Company to acquire any amount of shares and may be suspended, discontinued, or terminated at any time. On February 19, 2024, the Board approved a quarterly cash dividend under the Company's dividend policy of $0.028 per share, reflecting an increase of 12% over the previous quarter’s dividend of $0.025 per share. The dividend is payable on March 22, 2024 to holders of record on March 11, 2024. Financial Outlook for 2024 The Company is providing guidance for 2024 for the measures set forth below, including adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined later in this release. For a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) for 2024, see the table included on page nine of this release. Full-Year 2024 Guidance Low High Revenue $ 292.0 - $ 296.0 million Adjusted EBITDA1 $ 64.5 - $ 67.5 million Capital Expenditures $ 28.0 - $ 30.0 million 1 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA to projected net income (the most comparable GAAP measure) is included later in this release. The Company’s guidance for 2024 as set forth above reflects the Company’s assumptions regarding, among other things, expectations for new sales and renewals, and assumes that general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, do not deteriorate. This consolidated guidance does not include the impact of any acquisitions that we may complete during 2024, gains or losses from changes in the fair value of minority investments, or impairment of long-lived assets. Commenting on fourth quarter & full-year 2023 results, Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, HealthStream, said, “Our financial performance for full-year 2023 was strong. Compared to the prior year, in 2023 our revenues were up five percent, adjusted EBITDA was up 15 percent, operating income was up 29 percent, and net income was up 26 percent. Based on our projections and guidance, I believe we will set new records again in 2024.” “In 2023, we expanded our addressable market to include the nation’s nursing schools and their one million nursing students. Powered by advances in our hStream platform, we also launched new e-commerce capabilities, enabling us to make direct sales to physicians, nurses, and nursing students—where we saw early positive results. These exciting developments attest to the unique value proposition that HealthStream is delivering to customers.” A conference call with Robert A. Frist, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Scott A. Roberts, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President, and Mollie Condra, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, will be held on Tuesday, February 20, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. (ET).

A replay of the conference call and webcast will be archived on the Company’s website in the Investor Relations section under “Events & Presentations.” Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release presents adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by management in analyzing the Company’s financial results and ongoing operational performance. In order to better assess the Company’s financial results, management believes that net income excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses (as discussed in greater detail below) and before interest, income taxes, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and changes in fair value of, including gains (losses) on the sale of, non-marketable equity investments (“adjusted EBITDA”) is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because adjusted EBITDA reflects net income adjusted for certain GAAP accounting, non-cash and/or non-operating items which we believe, in any such case, are not fully reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. We also believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to assess the Company’s ongoing operating performance and to compare the Company's operating performance between periods. In addition, short-term cash incentive bonuses and certain performance-based equity awards are based on the achievement of adjusted EBITDA (as defined in applicable bonus and equity grant documentation) targets. As noted above, the definition of adjusted EBITDA includes an adjustment for the impact of the deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for acquired businesses. Prior to the Company early adopting ASU 2021-08 effective January 1, 2022, following the completion of any acquisition by the Company, the Company was required to record the acquired deferred revenue at fair value as defined in GAAP, which typically resulted in a write-down of the acquired deferred revenue. When the Company was required to record a write-down of deferred revenue, it resulted in lower recognized revenue, operating income, and net income in subsequent periods. Revenue for any such acquired business was deferred and was typically recognized over a one-to-two-year period following the completion of any particular acquisition, so our GAAP revenues for this one-to-two-year period would not reflect the full amount of revenues that would have been reported if the acquired deferred revenue was not written down to fair value. Management believes that including an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of the deferred write-downs associated with fair value accounting for businesses acquired prior to the January 1, 2022 effective date of the Company's adoption of ASU 2021-08 provides useful information to investors because the deferred revenue write-down recognized in periods after an acquisition may, given the nature of this non-cash accounting impact, cause our GAAP financial results during such periods to not fully reflect our underlying operating performance and thus adjusting for this amount may assist in comparing the Company’s results of operations between periods. Following the adoption of ASU 2021-08, contracts acquired in an acquisition completed on or after January 1, 2022 are measured as if the Company had originated the contract (rather than the contract being measured at fair value) such that, for such acquisitions, the Company no longer records deferred revenue write-downs associated with acquired businesses (for acquisitions completed prior to January 1, 2022, the Company continues to record deferred revenue write-downs associated with fair value accounting for periods on and after January 1, 2022 consistent with this prior standard). Through December 31, 2023, the Company continued to include an adjustment in the definition of adjusted EBITDA for the impact of deferred revenue write-downs from business acquired prior to January 1, 2022, given the impact of such deferred revenue on our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted EBITDA is susceptible to varying calculations. Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and has limitations as an analytical tool. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to net income (the most comparable GAAP measure), which is set forth below in this release.

Negative None. 02/19/2024 - 07:21 PM ROCKVILLIE, MD. and SUZHOU, China, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the primary endpoint has been achieved in the Phase 3 registrational study (RESTORE-1) of IBI311, a recombinant anti-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) antibody in Chinese subjects with Thyroid Eye Disease (TED). Innovent plans to submit the new drug application (NDA) for IBI311 in the treatment of TED to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) of the National Drug Administration (NMPA). RESTORE-1 (CTR20223393) is a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IBI311 in subjects with TED. The Phase 3 results of RESTORE-1 showed that the primary endpoint was successfully met: at Week 24, the proptosis responder rate in the study eye (the percentage of subjects with a reduction in proptosis of ≥2 mm from baseline in the study eye without deterioration ≥ 2 mm increase of proptosis in the fellow eye) was significantly higher in subjects treated with IBI311 than in subjects treated with placebo: 85.8% vs. 3.8%, with a difference of 81.9% (95% CI: 69.8% to 93.9%, P < 0.0001). In addition, the key secondary endpoints of the study such as overall response rate(the percentage of subjects with a reduction in proptosis of ≥2 mm from baseline and improvement in clinical activity score ≥2 in the study eye), percentage of subjects with a clinical activity score (CAS) of 0 or 1, and mean change in proptosis from baseline in the study eye were successfully met: IBI311 significantly improved all the above parameters as compared to the placebo. The overall safety profile of IBI311 was favorable throughout the study with no serious adverse events occurred. The efficacy and safety profiles in the Phase 3 part of the RESTORE-1 study were consistent with its Phase 2 results. Detailed results from the study will be released in medical conferences or journals in the future. As an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues, the annual incidence of TED is estimated to be 16/100,000 in women and 2.9/100,000 in men1，and the estimated prevalence of clinically relevant TED ranges from 0.1% to 0.3%2. At present, there is no targeted drug approved for the treatment of TED in China, while multiple clinical guidelines recommend the use of IGF-IR targeted antibody in the treatment of TED3,4,5. Particularly, IGF-IR targeted antibody is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with clinically significant proptosis. Professor Xianqun Fan, the leading principal investigator of the study, the Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and professor of ophthalmology at the Ninth People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, stated, "" As an organ-specific autoimmune disease closely related to thyroid disease, TED is one of the most common orbital diseases in adults, and seriously affects the visual function and appearance of patients. At present, there is no targeted drug approved for the treatment of TED in China, and the therapeutic approaches are limited. As the principal investigator of the RESTORE-1 study, I am very pleased to see that IBI311 achieved the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 study and showed a favorable safety profile, which again demonstrates the excellent efficacy of IBI311. I look forward to sharing the detailed results of this high-quality study in the near future, and wish its successful NDA submission so as to bring benefits to Chinese TED patients as soon as possible."" Dr. Lei Qian, Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated, ""There are no targeted drugs approved in the field of TED in China so far, while the treatment costs of overseas targeted drugs are beyond many patients' reach. Driven by the focus of addressing patients' unmet medical needs, we advanced the development of IBI311 rapidly. IBI311 has demonstrated significant efficacy and favorable safety in the treatment of TED in the RESTORE-1 study. We plan to submit its NDA as soon as possible, and bring high-quality, effective and safe biological drugs to Chinese patients with TED. At the same time, with the approval of SINTBILO ® (anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody), the NDA acceptance of Mazdutide (GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist), and the endpoints met in phase 3 study of IBI311, Innovent is strategically establishing its innovative commercial and late-stage portfolio in the fields of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (CVM), endocrinology and ophthalmology. We will continue to work hard to help people pursue a healthy life."" About Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) TED is an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues and is usually associated with Graves' disease (GD) and is the most common orbit-related disease in adults. TED occurs in approximately 25 to 50% of GD patients and can also be seen in other thyroid diseases, even in euthyroidism6. The annual incidence of TED is estimated to be 16/100,000 in women and 2.9/100,000 in men1，and the estimated prevalence of clinically relevant TED ranges from 0.1% to 0.3%2. According to disease severity, it can be divided into mild, moderate and severe. Although TED appears to affect women more often, severe cases occur more frequently in men. Patients aged 30 to 50 years are most commonly affected, and severe cases occur more frequently in patients over 50 years7. At present, the pathogenesis of TED is not fully understood, but several studies have shown that orbital fibrous present in muscle fibers, orbital fibrous connective tissue space are key factors leading to orbital soft tissue enlargement in TED8. The natural history of TED is divided into active and inactive phases9. The most common symptoms are dry eye, ocular gritty, photophobia, lacrimation, diplopia, and pressure behind the eye, while typical signs include upper eyelid retraction, eyelid edema, periorbital and conjunctival edema, and proptosis. TED is usually mild to moderate, and about 3–5% of patients with TED are severe, manifesting as severe pain, vision-threatening corneal ulcers, or compressive optic neuropathy10. In addition to potentially affecting vision, TED can have an extremely severe impact on the patient's appearance and social functioning and quality of life. Currently, the first-line treatment option for moderately severe active TED is intravenous glucocorticoid therapy, which suffers from unsatisfactory improvement of proptosis and systemic side effects, and second-line treatment includes other immunomodulators, which also have risks related to unclear improvement of proptosis and treatment. Teprotumumab, Tocilizumab and Rituximab are recommended by the Chinese Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for Thyroid Eye Disease (2022)3, the European Group on Graves' orbitopathy (EUGOGO)4 and the consensus on thyroid eye disease of the American Thyroid Society and the European Thyroid Society5 as the second-line treatment options for moderate to severe active TED. Teprotumumab targeting IGF-1R is recommended as first-line therapy for patients with clinically significant proptosis. About IBI311 IBI311 is a recombinant anti-IGF-1R antibody developed by Innovent for the treatment of TED. IGF-1R is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in the development, metabolism, and immune regulation, and is overexpressed in OFs, B, and T cells of TED patients11. IBI311 can bind IGF-1R, block IGF-1R signaling pathway activation mediated by IGF-1 and other related ligands or agonistic antibodies, reduce the expression of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycan caused by OFs activation, as well as related inflammatory reactions including tissue congestion and edema; inhibit adipocyte cellularization of OFs, thereby reducing the disease activity of patients with TED and improving proptosis, diplopia, ocular congestion and edema and other symptoms and signs.

IZERVAY™ is a trademark of IVERIC bio, Inc., An Astellas Company Inherent risks of Investment in Biotechnology Companies There are a number of inherent risks associated with the development of pharmaceutical products to a marketable stage. The lengthy clinical trial process is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug prior to commercialization and a significant proportion of drugs fail one or both of these criteria. Other risks include uncertainty of patent protection and proprietary rights, whether patent applications and issued patents will offer adequate protection to enable product development, the obtaining of necessary drug regulatory authority approvals and difficulties caused by the rapid advancements in technology. Companies such as Opthea are dependent on the success of their research and development projects and on the ability to attract funding to support these activities. Investment in research and development projects cannot be assessed on the same fundamentals as trading and manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, investment in companies specializing in drug development must be regarded as highly speculative. Opthea strongly recommends that professional investment advice be sought prior to such investments.

The company aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 and has become a leader in green bond issuance in the U.S. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Verizon's commitment to green financing through its fifth green bond issuance is a strategic move that aligns with the growing trend of sustainable investing. The full allocation of nearly $1 billion towards Renewable Energy Purchase Agreements (REPAs) indicates a robust approach to achieving their net-zero emissions goal by 2035. This initiative can potentially enhance Verizon's reputation as a socially responsible investment, which may attract ESG-focused investors and possibly lead to a more favorable cost of capital over time.From a financial perspective, the investment in renewable energy projects could lead to operational cost savings in the long run due to lower energy prices compared to traditional sources. However, investors should be aware that the upfront capital expenditure for these projects may impact Verizon's short-term financials. The focus on renewable energy also positions Verizon to take advantage of potential tax credits and incentives, which could improve their financial performance in the coming years. Sustainability Expert The issuance of green bonds by corporations like Verizon is a critical step in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy. By allocating these funds to REPAs, Verizon is not only contributing to the development of approximately 0.9 GW of new renewable energy capacity but also influencing the wider market. The company's actions encourage the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure, which is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Verizon's leadership in this area, being one of the largest green bond issuers in the U.S., sets a benchmark for other companies in the telecom sector and beyond. It demonstrates the feasibility and business case for large-scale investment in sustainability, which is crucial for catalyzing industry-wide change. The impact of these investments extends beyond environmental benefits, as they can also lead to job creation in the renewable energy sector and support local economies where the projects are located. Energy Sector Analyst The allocation of funds from Verizon's green bond to REPAs is a significant development for the energy sector. Renewable energy projects in the states of Illinois, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio and West Virginia are set to receive a substantial influx of capital, which is likely to accelerate the growth of renewable energy infrastructure in these regions. The nearly 0.9 GW of new generating capacity represents a meaningful addition to the United States' renewable energy portfolio.For the energy market, this move by Verizon could drive down costs for renewable energy technologies due to increased scale and potentially lead to more competitive pricing for end-users. It is also indicative of a broader shift among corporations towards long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), which provide stability for renewable energy producers and secure low, fixed-rate energy costs for corporate buyers. As more companies follow Verizon's lead, the demand for renewable energy could significantly reshape the energy market's supply and demand dynamics. 02/19/2024 - 12:06 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) issued its Green Bond Impact Report, outlining the full allocation of the nearly $1 billion of net proceeds from its fifth green bond, which was issued in May 2023. In February 2019, Verizon became the first U.S. telecom company to issue a green bond and remains a leader in the industry with the allocation of five green bonds. “The $5 billion of green bonds that we have issued to date are instrumental to our efforts to achieve our goal of net zero emissions in our operations by 2035,” said Tony Skiadas, Verizon’s executive vice president and chief financial officer. “As one of the leading corporate buyers of renewable energy and one of the largest green bond issuers in the U.S., we are proud to help accelerate the greening of the U.S. electrical grid as we work to meet our goals around climate protection.” As of February 16, 2024, Verizon has fully allocated the $994.1 million of net proceeds of our fifth green bond entirely to REPAs for renewable energy projects. The REPAs, including amendments to prior REPAs to make additional investments, were executed between February 2023 and January 2024. The REPAs support renewable energy projects that are under development in five states – Illinois, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio and West Virginia. The REPAs cover nearly 0.9 GW of new renewable energy generating capacity, of which about 53% is solar energy generating capacity and about 47% is wind energy generating capacity. As part of our renewable energy purchase program, Verizon has entered into 27 REPAs for a total of approximately 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of anticipated renewable energy generating capacity. These REPAs position us to exceed our target to source the equivalent of 50% of our total annual electricity consumption with renewable energy by 2025. We will continue to identify new renewable energy projects under development as we work toward our 2030 renewable energy target of 100%. Verizon’s renewable energy purchase program supports Citizen Verizon, the company’s responsible business plan for economic, environmental and social advancement. The Green Bond Impact Report can be found on the company’s investor relations site at https://www.verizon.com/about/investors/green-bond-reports. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed in 2000 and is one of the world’s leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $134.0 billion in 2023. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, and security.

The company will pay $1,018.97 per $1,000 principal amount of the notes accepted for purchase. CNX also issued a conditional notice to redeem all notes not purchased in the offer. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer and subsequent redemption of CNX Resources Corporation's 7.250% Senior Notes due 2027 represent a strategic financial move that can have significant implications for the company's capital structure and interest expense. By repurchasing a majority of these high-interest notes before their maturity, CNX is likely aiming to reduce its long-term debt obligations and associated interest costs. This could improve the company's net interest margin by decreasing the amount of income that is used to service debt. The purchase price of $1,018.97 per $1,000 principal amount indicates a premium over par value, which is a common occurrence in tender offers intended to incentivize holders to sell back their securities.Additionally, the conditional redemption of remaining notes not purchased in the tender offer suggests that CNX is confident in the success of its new notes offering, which is expected to provide the necessary funds to complete the redemption. The redemption price of 101.813% also represents a premium, which could be viewed as an effort to manage the company's debt profile efficiently. If the new notes offering is at a lower interest rate, it would further indicate a refinancing strategy to take advantage of current market conditions, potentially lowering the cost of capital and enhancing shareholder value in the long term.Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the completion of the tender offer and the new notes offering, as they could affect CNX's leverage ratios and overall financial health. A successful refinancing at lower interest rates could be a positive signal to the market, potentially impacting the company's stock price and credit rating. Market Research Analyst The strategic financial activities of CNX Resources Corporation, specifically in the context of their tender offer and planned redemption, can be seen as a proactive approach to capital management in the energy sector. The energy market, particularly for natural gas, is subject to volatility due to factors such as fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory changes and shifts in supply and demand dynamics. CNX's decision to manage its debt in this manner could be perceived as an effort to strengthen its financial position against such market uncertainties.By retiring the 7.250% Senior Notes, CNX may also be signaling to the market its commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet, which is often a key factor in investor confidence. The ability to execute such financial maneuvers can be indicative of a company's operational efficiency and financial agility, which are critical competencies in the competitive energy industry. The repurchase and retirement of debt at a premium could reflect positively on the company's creditworthiness and may lead to more favorable borrowing terms in the future.Moreover, CNX's description as an 'ultra-low carbon intensive natural gas development' company aligns with the growing investor interest in environmentally responsible energy production. This focus on sustainability could attract ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investors, potentially broadening the company's investor base and supporting its stock valuation. Legal Expert In the context of the tender offer and the conditional redemption, it is important to consider the legal implications and adherence to regulatory requirements. The cautionary statement provided by CNX Resources Corporation highlights the regulatory framework in which such financial transactions take place. The company's careful wording to clarify that the press release does not constitute an offer to purchase or sell securities is a standard practice to comply with securities laws and avoid the dissemination of misleading information.The conditional nature of the redemption is also noteworthy from a legal perspective. It is contingent upon the successful closing of the new notes offering and the receipt of net proceeds, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. The possibility of rescinding the redemption notice if conditions are not met underscores the importance of the terms outlined in the indenture governing the 2027 Notes. Such conditions are designed to protect both the company and the note holders, ensuring that the redemption is executed only if it aligns with the company's financial strategy and capabilities.Legal experts would also consider the implications of the new notes offering and its compliance with securities regulations. Ensuring that the offering is conducted in accordance with the laws of relevant jurisdictions is critical to avoid regulatory sanctions and maintain the company's reputation in the financial markets. 02/19/2024 - 04:15 PM PITTSBURGH, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) (""CNX"") today announced the final results and expiration of its previously announced cash tender offer (the ""Tender Offer"") to purchase any and all of the $350 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of its 7.250% Senior Notes due 2027 (the ""2027 Notes"").

Concurrently with the commencement of the Tender Offer, CNX issued a conditional notice, pursuant to the indenture governing the 2027 Notes, to redeem (the ""Redemption"") all 2027 Notes not purchased in the Tender Offer, at a redemption price of 101.813% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date of March 14, 2024 (the ""redemption date""). The Redemption is conditioned on the closing of CNX's contemporaneous offering of new senior notes (the ""new notes offering"") and its receipt of net proceeds from such offering, and there can be no assurance the Redemption will be completed. The Redemption may be terminated and the redemption notice may be rescinded in the event such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date. CNX retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC to serve as the Lead Dealer Manager and TD Securities (USA) LLC to serve as the Dealer Manager for the Tender Offer. Global Bondholder Services Corporation served as the tender agent and information agent for the Tender Offer. CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE: CNX) is a premier, ultra-low carbon intensive natural gas development, production, midstream, and technology company centered in Appalachia, one of the most energy abundant regions in the world. With the benefit of a 160-year regional legacy, substantial asset base, leading core operational competencies, technology development and innovation, and astute capital allocation methodologies, we responsibly develop our resources and deploy free cash flow to create long-term per share value for our shareholders, employees, and the communities where we operate. As of December 31, 2023, CNX had 8.74 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves.

Evolv Technology Provides Regulatory Update,2024-02-19T21:01:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Evolv Technology (NASDAQ: EVLV) updates on SEC investigation, emphasizing cooperation and transparency. The Company's AI-based weapons detection technology deployed at over 650 customers across various sectors, identifying hundreds of firearms daily.","Evolv Technology Provides Regulatory Update Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Evolv Technology (NASDAQ: EVLV) updates on SEC investigation, emphasizing cooperation and transparency. The Company's AI-based weapons detection technology deployed at over 650 customers across various sectors, identifying hundreds of firearms daily. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The initiation of an investigation by the SEC into Evolv Technology is a significant development that could have material implications for the company's operations and its investors. From a legal standpoint, the nature of these inquiries is to gather information and determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws. The SEC's statement that the investigation should not be construed as an indication of any wrongdoing is standard, yet the market often reacts negatively to such announcements due to the uncertainty they introduce.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include potential volatility in the company's stock price as investors digest the news and consider the possible outcomes. In the long-term, should the investigation uncover any legal issues, the company may face penalties, which could include fines or more stringent regulatory oversight, potentially affecting its financial health and market reputation. Moreover, the company's proactive approach to transparency and its decision to publicly disclose the investigation might be seen as a positive step in managing its public relations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement of an SEC investigation into Evolv Technology can impact investor sentiment and the company's market value. The company's emphasis on the robustness of its customer base and the widespread adoption of its technology is an attempt to mitigate market concerns and reassure stakeholders of its operational solidity. The detail that Evolv's technology has been used to screen over 1 billion visitors and identifies hundreds of firearms daily underscores the company's market penetration and operational efficacy.However, the investigation could potentially deter new customers or partnerships, especially in sectors like education and healthcare that are sensitive to regulatory compliance and public perception. The company's stock price may reflect the increased risk profile until the investigation's findings are made public and any uncertainties are resolved. The mention of the company's experienced team is intended to reassure investors of the company's competence in navigating this challenge. Financial Analyst Financially, the SEC's investigation into Evolv Technology presents a risk that must be carefully monitored by current and potential investors. The company's financial performance could be indirectly affected if the investigation leads to a loss of customer confidence or disruptions in operations. It is crucial to evaluate the company's financial resilience and the robustness of its balance sheet to withstand any potential legal or regulatory costs that may arise.Investors will also be attentive to the company's forthcoming financial disclosures to assess any material changes in its financial condition that may be attributable to the SEC's investigation. The ability of the company to continue its growth trajectory in light of these events will be a key factor for long-term financial performance. It's important to analyze the company's historical financials, cash flow and any contingencies it may have in place for legal proceedings to understand its capacity to navigate through this period. 02/19/2024 - 04:01 PM WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Evolv Technology (NASDAQ: EVLV), the leading security technology company pioneering AI-based weapons detection to create safer experiences, today provided an update on a request received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, on Friday, February 16, 2024 the SEC notified the Company it was initiating an investigation that was described as a confidential “non-public, fact finding inquiry.” The Company notes the SEC’s explicit guidance that the investigation “should neither be construed as an indication by the Commission or its staff that any violation of law has occurred, nor as a reflection upon any person, entity, or security.” The Company is eager to cooperate with the SEC as it is with any regulatory body. The Company was contacted by a representative of the media within hours of receiving the SEC’s confidential notice seeking comment on an SEC matter. In the interest of transparency, the Company has decided to disclose the matter publicly considering attempts by certain media outlets to discredit the Company and manipulate the customer markets the Company serves. Evolv stands behind its technology and is proud to partner with hundreds of security professionals to add a layer of advanced technology to their safety plan. The Company’s technology is deployed at over 650 customers across many markets including education, healthcare, professional sports, industrial workplaces, houses of worship and tourist attractions. Prior to purchasing Evolv products, key customer decision makers – many whom often have years of security and technology expertise – typically conduct their own extensive testing in their actual operating environment. Based on these successful testing and validation outcomes, Evolv Express has now been used to screen over 1 billion visitors and is used to identify hundreds of firearms every day across the Company’s rapidly growing customer base. The Company’s team includes security professionals who have served in leadership positions in the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, New York Police Department, Office of National Intelligence, Transportation Security Administration, and United States Secret Service.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Dividend payments are a significant indicator of a company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Pentair plc's announcement of a regular quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.23 per share is a testament to the company's consistent performance and stable cash flow. The fact that 2024 marks the 48th consecutive year of dividend increases speaks volumes about Pentair's financial discipline and long-term strategy. Such a track record can be a strong signal to investors about the reliability of the company as an income-generating investment.Moreover, consistent dividend growth can potentially attract a certain class of income-seeking investors, particularly those who are retirees or conservative investors looking for steady income streams. It's imperative to analyze the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share, to understand the attractiveness of the dividend in relation to the current stock price. Investors should also consider the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, to assess the sustainability of the dividend payments. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Pentair's dividend increase can be seen as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable perception among analysts and investors. It suggests that the company is confident in its future earnings and cash flow, enough to share profits with its shareholders regularly. The psychological impact of a rising dividend can also contribute to investor confidence, as it may be perceived as a sign of a company's resilience and optimistic outlook.However, it's important to contextualize this dividend announcement within the broader industry and economic environment. Factors such as interest rate trends, inflation and overall market conditions can influence the attractiveness of dividend stocks. In a low-interest-rate environment, for instance, dividend stocks can become more appealing as they offer better returns than many fixed-income alternatives. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding dividend stocks increases, which could impact their demand. 02/19/2024 - 04:19 PM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pentair plc (NYSE: PNR) announced today that it will pay a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share on May 3, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 19, 2024. 2024 marks the 48th consecutive year that Pentair has increased its dividend.

(CVR) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on March 20, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2024.","CHICAGO RIVET & MACHINE CO. DECLARES DIVIDEND Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. (CVR) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share, payable on March 20, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly dividend by Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. indicates a stable financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Dividends are often a sign of a company's confidence in its current profitability and future earnings potential. The specified dividend of ten cents per share may seem nominal, but it is essential to look at the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. This metric helps investors understand the return on investment from dividends alone.Investors typically view regular dividends as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a more favorable view of the company's stock. However, it is also crucial to assess the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio that is too high can be unsustainable in the long term, whereas a lower payout ratio may indicate that the company is reinvesting more of its profits into growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the dividend declaration by Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. should be evaluated in the context of the industry average and the company's historical dividend patterns. If the dividend amount represents an increase, decrease, or a consistent trend, this can signal the company's operational health and strategic priorities to the market.Additionally, the market's reaction to such news can be influenced by broader economic conditions. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, dividend-paying stocks can become more attractive to income-seeking investors. Conversely, during periods of high-interest rates, investors may favor growth stocks or other income-generating assets. Thus, the timing and size of dividend payments can impact investor sentiment and the stock's performance. 02/19/2024 - 01:41 PM NAPERVILLE, Ill., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On February 19, 2024 the Board of Directors of Chicago Rivet & Machine Co.

Estimated proved reserves at year-end 2023 were 64.5 MMBoe, with a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at $1,019.5 million. Black Stone had 63 rigs operating across its acreage position as of December 31, 2023, a decrease from the previous quarter. Expect royalty production to increase by 4% in 2024, offset by a decline in working interest production due to farming out opportunities. Hedge positions for oil and natural gas in place for 2024 and 2025 to cover anticipated production. Management remains positive about long-term prospects despite challenges in the natural gas market. Negative Distributable cash flow decreased by 4% in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter. Adjusted EBITDA slightly decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter. Working interest production declined by 4% in Q4 2023 compared to the previous quarter. General and administrative expenses expected to be slightly higher in 2024. Expected moderation of activity in Louisiana Haynesville due to lower commodity prices in 2024. Financial Analyst Black Stone Minerals' financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 indicates a robust financial position, with a noteworthy elimination of debt and a consistent distributable cash flow above $100 million for seven consecutive quarters. The company's decision to maintain a high distribution rate, in spite of a challenging natural gas market, underscores a strong cash flow generation capacity. However, the decrease in production and the anticipated headwinds due to depressed natural gas prices in 2024 are concerning. The zero debt level enhances financial flexibility, but the company's future growth prospects hinge on how it navigates the volatile energy market and capitalizes on LNG export growth opportunities.From a valuation perspective, the reported net income and Adjusted EBITDA figures are substantial, but the 31% decrease in average realized price per Boe year-over-year is a red flag. This could potentially affect the company's revenue streams if not offset by increased production or higher commodity prices in the future. The company's hedging positions for 2024 and 2025 provide some revenue predictability, which is favorable for financial planning and risk management. Energy Market Analyst The energy sector is currently experiencing significant volatility, particularly in the natural gas market. Black Stone Minerals' emphasis on natural gas (approximately 74% of total production) makes it susceptible to fluctuations in natural gas prices. The company's guidance for increased natural gas production in 2024, despite the current price depression, suggests a strategic focus on volume growth to mitigate revenue impacts. However, the reliance on LNG export growth as a long-term strategy must be weighed against geopolitical factors and global energy demand trends. Additionally, the company's proactive hedging strategy is a prudent approach to managing commodity price risks, but it is essential to monitor the effectiveness of these hedges against actual price movements and production levels.The temporary suspension of drilling obligations by Aethon Energy in the Shelby Trough could impact near-term production volumes, although Black Stone appears to have a diversified asset base to cushion the effect. Moreover, the company's strategic acquisitions and partnerships in the Gulf Coast region and Austin Chalk play could bolster its position if these areas yield successful development outcomes. Market Research Analyst Black Stone Minerals' operational strategy, including the farm-out of working interest participation and targeted acquisitions, reflects a cautious approach to capital deployment. This is particularly relevant in an environment where energy companies are pressured to balance growth with capital discipline. The company's focus on royalty interests, which are expected to increase from 94% to 96%, aligns with industry trends favoring less capital-intensive and lower-risk revenue streams.The absence of impairments in the reported quarters is a positive indicator of asset quality and management's effective valuation of its portfolio. However, the anticipated decline in working interest production may affect total output and thus, the company's ability to fully leverage potential upswings in commodity prices. Investors should consider the company's ability to manage its lease operating expenses and ad valorem taxes, which are significant contributors to the overall cost structure. 02/19/2024 - 07:26 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Black Stone Minerals, L.P. (NYSE: BSM) (“Black Stone Minerals,” “Black Stone,” or “the Company”) today announces its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 and provides guidance for 2024. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Mineral and royalty production for the fourth quarter of 2023 equaled 38.9 MBoe/d, a decrease of 3% over the prior quarter; total production, including working interest volumes, was 41.1 MBoe/d for the quarter Net income for the quarter was $147.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $125.5 million Distributable cash flow was $119.1 million for the fourth quarter, which represents a 4% decrease relative to the third quarter of 2023, making the seventh consecutive quarter above $100 million Black Stone announced a distribution of $0.475 per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2023. Distribution coverage for all units was 1.19x Total debt at the end of the quarter was zero; as of February 16, 2024, total debt remained at zero with $102.9 million of cash Full Year Financial and Operational Highlights Mineral and royalty volumes in 2023 increased 9% over the prior year to average 37.4 MBoe/d; average full year 2023 production was 39.8 MBoe/d Reported 2023 net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $422.5 million and $474.7 million, respectively Increased cash distributions by 9% from $1.745 per unit attributable to the full year 2022 to $1.90 per unit attributable to the full year 2023 Eliminated outstanding debt during 2023 Management Commentary Thomas L. Carter, Jr., Black Stone Minerals’ Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, commented, “We finished the year with a strong quarter. We were able to maintain our highest distribution without any outstanding debt despite a challenging natural gas market. We expect headwinds in 2024 as natural gas prices remain depressed, but we remain encouraged by the long-term prospects for liquefied natural gas export growth and an asset base with significant inventory life that will benefit unitholders through the next decade.” Quarterly Financial and Operating Results Production Black Stone Minerals reported mineral and royalty volumes of 38.9 MBoe/d (95% natural gas) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 40.3 MBoe/d for the third quarter of 2023. Mineral and royalty production was 40.0 MBoe/d for the fourth quarter of 2022. Mineral and royalty production in the fourth quarter of 2023 benefited from new wells coming online in the Permian and Shelby Trough. Working interest production for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2.2 MBoe/d, a decrease of 4% from the 2.3 MBoe/d for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, and an increase of 5% from the 2.1 MBoe/d for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. The continued overall decline in working interest production volumes is consistent with the Company's decision to farm out its working-interest participation to third-party capital providers. Total reported production averaged 41.1 MBoe/d (95% mineral and royalty, 73% natural gas) for the fourth quarter of 2023. Average total production was 42.6 MBoe/d and 42.1 MBoe/d for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Realized Prices, Revenues, and Net Income The Company’s average realized price per Boe, excluding the effect of derivative settlements, was $35.03 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This is an increase of 2% from $34.30 per Boe for the third quarter of 2023 and a 31% decrease compared to $50.67 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Black Stone reported oil and gas revenue of $132.6 million (60% oil and condensate) for the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1% from $134.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Oil and gas revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $196.2 million. The Company reported a gain on commodity derivative instruments of $54.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, composed of a $17.1 million gain from realized settlements and a non-cash $37.4 million unrealized gain due to the change in value of Black Stone’s derivative positions during the quarter. Black Stone reported a loss on commodity derivative instruments of $26.9 million and a gain of $31.4 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Lease bonus and other income was $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily related to leasing activity in the Granite Wash, Gulf Coast, and Haynesville plays. Lease bonus and other income for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively. There was no impairment for the quarters ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Company reported net income of $147.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to net income of $62.1 million in the preceding quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, net income was $183.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $125.5 million, which compares to $130.0 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $131.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Distributable cash flow for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $119.1 million. For the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Distributable cash flow was $124.4 million and $125.3 million, respectively. 2023 Proved Reserves Estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end 2023 were 64.5 MMBoe, an increase of 1% from 64.1 MMBoe at year-end 2022, and were approximately 70% natural gas and 89% proved developed producing. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows was $1,019.5 million at the end of 2023, as compared to $1,665.0 million at year-end 2022. Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc., an independent, third-party petroleum engineering firm, evaluated Black Stone Minerals’ estimate of its proved reserves and PV-10 at December 31, 2023. These estimates were prepared using reference prices of $78.21 per barrel of oil and $2.64 per MMBTU of natural gas in accordance with the applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (as compared to prompt month prices of $76.81 per barrel of oil and $1.61 per MMBTU of natural gas as of February 16, 2024). These prices were adjusted for quality and market differentials, transportation fees, and, in the case of natural gas, the value of natural gas liquids. A reconciliation of proved reserves is presented in the summary financial tables following this press release. Financial Position and Activities As of December 31, 2023, Black Stone Minerals had $70.3 million in cash, with nothing drawn under its credit facility. The Company’s borrowing base at December 31, 2023 was $580 million, and total commitments under the credit facility were $375 million. The Company's next regularly scheduled borrowing base redetermination is set for April 2024. Black Stone is in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its credit facility. As of February 16, 2024, no debt was outstanding under the credit facility and the Company had $102.9 million in cash. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company made no repurchases of units under the Board-approved $150 million unit repurchase program. Fourth Quarter 2023 Distributions As previously announced, the Board approved a cash distribution of $0.475 for each common unit attributable to the fourth quarter of 2023. The quarterly distribution coverage ratio attributable to the fourth quarter of 2023 was approximately 1.19x. These distributions will be paid on February 23, 2024 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on February 16, 2024. Activity Update Rig Activity As of December 31, 2023, Black Stone had 63 rigs operating across its acreage position, a 17% decrease from rig activity on the Company's acreage as of September 30, 2023 and 42% lower as compared to the 108 rigs operating on the Company's acreage as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is primarily driven by reduced rig activity in the Haynesville and Permian. Shelby Trough Development Update A significant portion of Shelby Trough development in recent years has been performed by Aethon Energy (“Aethon”) under the Company’s two Joint Exploration Agreements (“JEA” or “JEAs”) with Aethon, one JEA each covering development in San Augustine County, Texas, and the other in Angelina County, Texas. As announced on December 22, 2023, BSM received notice that Aethon was exercising the “time-out” provisions under its joint exploration agreements with the Company in Angelina and San Augustine counties in East Texas. When natural-gas prices fall below specified thresholds, Aethon may elect to temporarily suspend its drilling obligations for up to nine consecutive months and a maximum of 18 total months in any 48-month period. Aethon has not previously invoked the time-out provisions under the agreements. The time-out provisions apply only to drilling obligations and associated development activity occurring after December 2023. Based on ongoing discussions with Aethon, we do not expect material changes for wells on which drilling operations had begun prior to the invocation of the time-out in December 2023. We continue working closely with Aethon to finalize development plans going forward and assess the effect of the temporary suspension of drilling obligations and any potential longer-term impacts. Austin Chalk Update The Company owns a large mineral position in the Brookeland Austin Chalk play in East Texas. Black Stone has entered into agreements with multiple operators to drill wells in the areas of the Austin Chalk in East Texas, where the Company has significant acreage positions. The results of the test program in the Brookeland Field demonstrated that modern completion technology has the potential to improve production rates and increase reserves when compared to the vintage, unstimulated wells in the Austin Chalk formation. To date, 29 wells with modern completions are now producing in the field. Acquisition Activity Black Stone’s commercial strategy since 2021 has been focused on attracting capital and securing drilling commitments on minerals already owned by the Company. Management made the decision to expand this growth strategy by adding to the Company’s mineral portfolio through strategic, targeted efforts primarily in the Gulf Coast region. To that end, in 2023 Black Stone acquired additional, non-producing mineral and royalty interests totaling $14.6 million. Black Stone’s commercial strategy going forward includes the continuation of meaningful, targeted mineral and royalty acquisitions to complement our existing positions. Summary 2024 Guidance Following are the key assumptions in Black Stone Minerals’ 2024 guidance, as well as comparable results for 2023: FY 2023 Actual FY 2024 Est. Mineral and royalty production (MBoe/d) 37.4 39 – 40 Working interest production (MBoe/d) 2.4 1 – 2 Total production (MBoe/d) 39.8 40 – 42 Percentage natural gas 74% 76% Percentage royalty interest 94% 96% Lease bonus and other income ($MM) $12.5 $10 - $15 Lease operating expense ($MM) $11.4 $10 - $12 Production costs and ad valorem taxes (as % of total pre-derivative O&G revenue) 12% 11% - 13% G&A - cash ($MM) $40.6 $44 - $45 G&A - non-cash ($MM) $10.9 $10 - $12 G&A - TOTAL ($MM) $51.5 $54 - $57 DD&A ($/Boe) $3.14 $3.00 - $3.25 Black Stone expects royalty production to increase by approximately 4% in 2024 relative to full year 2023 levels, primarily due to Aethon turning on-line the 24 wells in various stages of development in the Shelby Trough and continued development in the Austin Chalk. This is partially offset by an expected moderation of activity in Louisiana Haynesville due to lower commodity prices. Working interest production is expected to decline in 2024 as a result of Black Stone's decision in 2017 to farm out participation in its working interest opportunities. The Partnership expects general and administrative expenses to be slightly higher in 2024 as a result of inflationary costs and selective hires made to support Black Stone’s ability to evaluate, market and manage its undeveloped acreage positions to potential operators. Hedge Position Black Stone has commodity derivative contracts in place covering portions of its anticipated production for 2024 and 2025, including derivative contracts put in place after the end of the year. The Company's hedge position as of February 16, 2024, is summarized in the following tables: Oil Hedge Position Oil Swap Volume Oil Swap Price MBbl $/Bbl 1Q24 570 $71.45 2Q24 570 $71.45 3Q24 570 $71.45 4Q24 570 $71.45 1Q25 210 $70.50 2Q25 210 $70.50 3Q25 210 $70.50 4Q25 210 $70.50 Natural Gas Hedge Position Gas Swap Volume Gas Swap Price BBtu $/MMbtu 1Q24 10,310 $3.56 2Q24 10,465 $3.55 3Q24 10,580 $3.55 4Q24 10,580 $3.55 1Q25 900 $3.65 2Q25 910 $3.65 3Q25 920 $3.65 4Q25 920 $3.65 More detailed information about the Company's existing hedging program can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is expected to be filed on or around February 20, 2024.

As a result, the Company is unable to reliably determine the total volumes of NGLs associated with the production of natural gas on its acreage. Accordingly, no NGL volumes are included in our reported production; however, revenue attributable to NGLs is included in natural gas revenue and the calculation of realized prices for natural gas. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by Black Stone's management and external users of the Company's financial statements such as investors, research analysts, and others, to assess the financial performance of its assets and its ability to sustain distributions over the long term without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation, depletion, and amortization adjusted for impairment of oil and natural gas properties, if any, accretion of asset retirement obligations, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, non-cash equity-based compensation, and gains and losses on sales of assets, if any. Black Stone defines Distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA plus or minus amounts for certain non-cash operating activities, cash interest expense, distributions to preferred unitholders, and restructuring charges, if any. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") in the United States as measures of the Company's financial performance.

(NYSE: JELD) reported fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results, highlighting a decrease in net revenues but an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The company also provided guidance for 2024, expecting flat to a 7% decline in Core Revenues. Despite challenges, JELD-WEN aims to enhance financial results through productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives. Positive Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $31.6 million to $380.4 million in full year 2023, with a margin increase of 110 basis points to 8.8%. Net revenues from continuing operations decreased by 5.3% in 2023 to $4,304.3 million, driven by a 5% decline in Core Revenue. JELD-WEN reported a net loss from continuing operations of $(22.6) million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net income of $25.9 million in the same period last year. The company expects 2024 net revenues of $4.0 to $4.3 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $370 to $420 million, anticipating potential volume declines in the coming year. JELD-WEN plans to increase capital expenditures to approximately 4% of sales in 2024 and incur non-recurring cash expenses of around $100 million to improve financial performance. Negative - Despite an increase in Adjusted EBITDA, JELD-WEN experienced a decrease in net revenues for both the fourth quarter and full year 2023. - The company's Core Revenue declined due to lower volume/mix, impacting overall financial results. - JELD-WEN anticipates uncertain market conditions in 2024, posing challenges for revenue generation and profitability. Financial Analyst The reported net loss from continuing operations and the decline in core revenue for JELD-WEN in Q4 2023 are notable indicators of the company's performance challenges in a tough macroeconomic landscape. The decreased net revenues and lower volume/mix suggest a contraction in demand or possible loss of market share. However, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin signifies effective cost management and pricing strategies that have helped in improving profitability despite revenue headwinds.For investors, the full-year guidance for 2024 presents a cautious outlook, reflecting flat to potentially declining core revenues. This could signal to the market that the company does not anticipate a quick recovery in demand or market conditions. The commitment to invest in capital expenditures and non-recurring cash expenses indicates a strategic move to enhance long-term financial health, but it may also imply near-term cash flow pressures. Market Research Analyst The performance of JELD-WEN must be contextualized within the broader building products industry, which has been experiencing fluctuations due to shifts in construction trends and the economic cycle. The company's price realization gains suggest a competitive pricing power, which can be critical for maintaining margins in an industry characterized by commoditized products. However, the significant volume/mix decline raises questions about the company's market positioning and its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences or construction activity levels.Looking ahead, the company's focus on productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives will be essential in maintaining its competitive edge, especially in the face of continued market uncertainty. The planned increase in capital expenditures to 4% of sales is an indication of JELD-WEN's investment in future growth, possibly through technological advancements or expansion of product lines. Economist The financial results of JELD-WEN can be seen as a microcosm of the economic headwinds that have been affecting the manufacturing sector, including rising input costs and supply chain disruptions. The company's ability to improve its Adjusted EBITDA Margin in spite of these challenges is a testament to its operational efficiency and cost control measures. However, the lower volume/mix could be indicative of broader economic slowdowns affecting consumer spending and investment in housing and infrastructure.The full-year 2024 guidance suggests a conservative approach, likely factoring in ongoing economic uncertainties such as interest rate hikes, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. The company's strategic investments and cost management efforts are crucial in navigating these macroeconomic challenges while preparing for eventual market recovery. 02/19/2024 - 04:30 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

Although the Company believes the assumptions reflected in the range of its 2024 guidance are reasonable, actual results could vary substantially given the uncertainty regarding the future performance of the global economy, ongoing geopolitical conflicts, disruptions in supply chains, and changes in raw material prices and other costs as well as other risks and uncertainties, including those described below. In addition, the guidance ranges provided for 2024 do not include the impact of potential acquisitions or divestitures. The variability of these items may have a significant impact on our future GAAP results. Other companies may compute these measures differently. The non-U.S. GAAP information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP information. It does not purport to represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and is not an indicator of our performance under U.S. GAAP. We present several financial metrics in ""Core"" terms, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last twelve months. We define Core Revenue as net revenue excluding the impact of foreign exchange, and acquisitions and divestitures completed in the last twelve months. The use of ""Core"" metrics assists management, investors, and analysts in understanding the organic performance of the operations. We use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations, Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations, and Adjusted EPS because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations are helpful in highlighting trends because they exclude certain items outside the control of management, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and capital investments. We use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations to measure our financial performance in reporting our results to our Board of Directors. Further, our executive incentive compensation is based in part on Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or to cash flows from operations as a liquidity measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax, adjusted for the following items: income tax expense (benefit); depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; and certain special items consisting of non-recurring net legal and professional expenses and settlements; goodwill impairment; restructuring and asset related charges; other facility closure, consolidation, and related costs and adjustments; M&A related costs; net (gain) loss on sale of property and equipment; loss on extinguishment of debt; share-based compensation expense; pension settlement charges; non-cash foreign exchange transaction/translation (income) loss; and other special items. Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations represents net income from continuing operations adjusted for the after-tax impact of certain special items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as described above. Where applicable, the specifically identified items are tax effected at the applicable jurisdictional tax rate and tax expense is adjusted to remove the effect of discrete tax items. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations represents net income from continuing operations per diluted share adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate Adjusted Net Income from continuing operations as described above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin from continuing operations represents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as a percentage of net revenues. We present Free Cash Flow because we believe this metric assists investors and analysts in determining the quality of our earnings. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash (used in) provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (including purchases of intangible assets). Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities as a liquidity measure. We also present Net Debt Leverage because it is a key financial metric that is used by management to assess the balance sheet risk of the Company. We define Net Debt Leverage as Net Debt (total principal debt outstanding less unrestricted cash) divided by Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the last twelve month period. Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout this release may not sum precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

They achieved full year adjusted EBITDA of $419 million and a record high $408 million operating cash flow. Masonite enhanced its product portfolio through acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023. Subsequently, they announced a definitive agreement with Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) for acquisition at $133.00 per share in cash. Positive Masonite reported a 2% decrease in net sales for the full year 2023 compared to 2022. The company's net income attributable to Masonite declined by 45% year over year. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 decreased by 6% compared to the previous year. Masonite's diluted earnings per share dropped by 44% in 2023 compared to 2022. The company made significant acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023 to enhance its product solutions. Masonite announced an agreement with Owens Corning for acquisition at $133.00 per share in cash. The company's gross profit margin increased by 170 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023. Masonite's SG&A expenses increased by 27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to various factors. Net loss attributable to Masonite in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10 million, primarily driven by charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Masonite's cash flow from operations significantly increased to $408 million in 2023 from $189 million in the previous year. Negative Masonite reported a decrease in net income and adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023 compared to 2022. The company's diluted earnings per share and net sales experienced declines in 2023. Masonite incurred charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2023, leading to a net loss. The cancellation of the live conference call to discuss fourth quarter results due to the pending acquisition by Owens Corning might limit shareholder communication. The increase in SG&A expenses by 27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 could impact the company's profitability. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Masonite by Owens Corning for $133.00 per share represents a significant premium over the average repurchase price of $89.96 per share, indicating a favorable exit for current shareholders. The reported net sales decline of 2% and a 45% decrease in net income attribute to Masonite year-over-year reflect market challenges, yet the record high operating cash flow of $408 million showcases strong cash-generating capabilities. The SG&A increase of 19% suggests rising operational costs that could impact future profitability margins if not managed post-acquisition.Adjusted EBITDA margin contraction by 60 basis points indicates margin pressures, yet the company's ability to maintain a gross profit margin increase of 20 basis points year-over-year despite lower volumes and inflationary pressures demonstrates effective cost management strategies. The balance sheet shows robust liquidity, which, combined with the cash flow performance, positions Masonite favorably for the acquisition by Owens Corning, potentially allowing for smooth integration and investment in strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in organic volume and average unit price (AUP) in both North American Residential and Europe segments could reflect a cooling demand in the construction and home improvement markets. The 19% decrease in Architectural net sales volume could be a result of project delays or budget cuts in commercial construction. However, the strategic acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood have partially offset these declines, indicating Masonite's agility in diversifying its product offerings and revenue streams.The goodwill impairment charge in the Europe segment is a notable event, suggesting a reassessment of the value of the acquired business and its future profitability prospects. This could signal underlying challenges in the European market that Owens Corning will need to address post-acquisition. Investors and stakeholders should monitor how the integration of Masonite into Owens Corning's portfolio will leverage Masonite's existing product solutions and drive innovation in the building materials sector. Legal Expert The pending acquisition of Masonite by Owens Corning is subject to shareholder approval, regulatory clearances and other customary closing conditions, which introduces a degree of uncertainty until the transaction is finalized. The unanimous approval by both companies' Boards of Directors is a positive sign, but investors should be aware of potential regulatory hurdles that could delay or impact the terms of the deal.Additionally, the cancellation of the live conference call in light of the pending transaction limits the immediate availability of further management insights into the quarterly results and future strategies. This could result in a temporary information vacuum for investors until the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Stakeholders should closely review this report for any additional details on the company's financial health and the implications of the acquisition. 02/19/2024 - 04:44 PM Reported full year 2023 net sales of $2.8 billion and net income attributable to Masonite of $118 million Delivered full year adjusted EBITDA* of $419 million and a record high $408 million of operating cash flow Enhanced portfolio of product solutions with acquisitions of Endura Products and Fleetwood during 2023 Subsequent to year end, announced definitive agreement under which Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) will acquire all outstanding shares of Masonite for $133.00 per share in cash TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Masonite International Corporation (""Masonite"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: DOOR) today announced results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Discussion (All references to percent increase or decrease in the discussion below compare current fourth quarter 2023 results to those realized in the fourth quarter of 2022 unless otherwise noted.) Consolidated net sales were $661 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a 2% decrease resulting from an 11% decrease in organic volume and a 2% decrease in average unit price (AUP), partially offset by a 10% increase from acquisitions and a 1% increase from favorable foreign exchange. North American Residential net sales were $538 million, a 2% increase, driven by a 13% increase from acquisitions, partially offset by a 9% decrease in organic volume and 2% lower AUP. Europe net sales were $53 million, a 13% decrease, driven by a 14% decrease in volume and a 4% decrease in AUP, partially offset by a 5% increase due to favorable foreign exchange. Architectural net sales were $67 million, a 19% decrease, driven by a 24% decrease in volume and component sales, partially offset by a 5% increase in AUP. Total Company gross profit was $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6%. Gross profit margin increased 170 basis points year over year to 22.9%, due to effective price-cost management, which was enough to offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation on wages, benefits and overhead. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses were $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 27%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by the addition of SG&A from acquisitions as well as year-over-year differences in the timing of adjustments to variable compensation expense. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 17.0%. Net loss attributable to Masonite was $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to net income of $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by $33 million in charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Adjusted EBITDA* of $87 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 5% from $91 million. Diluted loss per share was $0.46 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to earnings of $1.38 in the comparable 2022 period. Adjusted EPS* was $1.29 in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.72 in the comparable 2022 period. Full Year 2023 Discussion (All references to percent increase or decrease in the discussion below compare current full year 2023 results to those realized in full year 2022 unless otherwise noted.) Consolidated net sales were $2,831 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a 2% decrease resulting from a 14% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease in component sales, partially offset by a 9% increase from acquisitions and a 4% increase in AUP. North American Residential net sales were $2,245 million, a 2% decrease, driven by a 15% decrease in organic volume and a 1% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by an 11% increase from acquisitions and a 3% increase in AUP. Europe net sales were $247 million, a 12% decrease, driven by an 11% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in component sales. AUP was flat year over year. Architectural net sales were $323 million, a 5% increase, driven by an 18% increase in AUP, partially offset by a 9% decrease in volume, a 3% decrease in the sale of components and a 1% decrease due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Total company gross profit was $666 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 1%. Gross profit margin increased 20 basis points to 23.5%, as higher AUP and cost savings initiatives were enough to offset the impact of lower volumes and inflation on wages, benefits and overhead. SG&A expenses were $412 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 19% due largely to the year-over-year addition of SG&A from acquisitions, as well as wage and benefits inflation, higher professional fees, information technology costs and additional investments in strategic initiatives. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 14.5%. Net income attributable to Masonite was $118 million in 2023 compared to $214 million in 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by higher SG&A expenses and $33 million in charges related to goodwill impairment in the Europe reporting unit. Adjusted EBITDA* of $419 million in 2023 decreased 6% from $446 million in 2022. Diluted earnings per share were $5.29 in the 2023 fiscal year compared to $9.41 in the comparable 2022 period. Adjusted EPS* was $7.53 in the 2023 fiscal year compared to $9.73 in the comparable 2022 period. Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Capital Allocation At the end of the fourth quarter, total available liquidity was $437 million, inclusive of $300 million of availability under our ABL Facility and AR Sales Program and $137 million in unrestricted cash. Cash flow from operations was $408 million in 2023, up from $189 million in the comparable period of 2022. Capital expenditures were $113 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, down from $114 million in the comparable period of 2022. During the fourth quarter, Masonite repurchased approximately 84 thousand shares of stock for $7 million, at an average price of $88.88. In fiscal 2023, the Company repurchased approximately 518 thousand shares of stock for $47 million, at an average price of $89.96 per share. Acquisition by Owens Corning On February 8, 2024, Masonite and Owens Corning entered into a definitive agreement under which Owens Corning will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Masonite for $133.00 per share in cash. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both companies' Board of Directors and is subject to Masonite shareholders' approval, as well as various regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is anticipated to close by the middle of 2024. In light of this pending transaction, Masonite has cancelled plans to hold a live conference call to discuss fourth quarter results.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning under GAAP and is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to either net income or operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to Masonite adjusted to exclude the following items: depreciation; amortization; share based compensation expense; loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment; registration and listing fees; restructuring costs; asset impairment; loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries; interest expense (income), net; loss on extinguishment of debt; other (income) expense, net; income tax expense (benefit); other items; loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of tax; and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest. This definition of adjusted EBITDA differs from the definitions of EBITDA contained in the indentures governing the 2028 and 2030 Notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility. Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated under our ABL Facility or senior notes would also include, among other things, additional add-backs for amounts related to: cost savings projected by us in good faith to be realized as a result of actions taken or expected to be taken prior to or during the relevant period; fees and expenses in connection with certain plant closures and layoffs; and the amount of any restructuring charges, integration costs or other business optimization expenses or reserve deducted in the relevant period in computing consolidated net income, including any one-time costs incurred in connection with acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. Intersegment sales are recorded using market prices. We believe that adjusted EBITDA, from an operations standpoint, provides an appropriate way to measure and assess segment performance. Our management team has established the practice of reviewing the performance of each segment based on the measures of net sales and adjusted EBITDA. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is useful to users of the consolidated financial statements because it provides the same information that we use internally to evaluate and compare the performance of the segments and it is one of the primary measures used to determine employee incentive compensation. The tables below set forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to Masonite to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Sales. Management believes this measure provides supplemental information on how successfully we operate our business. Adjusted EPS is diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Masonite (EPS) less restructuring costs, asset impairment charges, loss (gain) on disposal of subsidiaries, loss on extinguishment of debt and other items, if any, that do not relate to Masonite’s underlying business performance (each net of related tax expense (benefit)). Management uses this measure to evaluate the overall performance of the Company and believes this measure provides investors with helpful supplemental information regarding the underlying performance of the Company from period to period. This measure may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to help evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow is not a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to our mandatory debt service requirements. As a conversion ratio, free cash flow is compared to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Masonite. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are used internally by the Company for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors of the Company and analysis of performance. Management believes that these measures provide a useful representation of our operational performance and liquidity; however, the measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities or net income attributable to Masonite as prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain amounts in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and associated tables may not foot due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts.

So, any help in cutting energy costs-and saving time on maintaining equipment-can go a long way toward helping the hotel run more smoothly and profitably. That is where our Small Business program comes in.Owner Ramesh Patel decided to upgrade the hotel's interior and exterior lighting to LED bulbs, both to save energy and to take advantage of rebates that we offer. Because of that success, additional projects followed soon after. Those projects involved adding three, 100-gallon hot water boilers and replacing the existing room HVAC units with more efficient packaged terminal air conditioners (PTAC). They also replaced older, inefficient refrigerators, freezers, and ice machines-and they have definitely noticed the savings that came with those energy-efficient additions, as well as the environmental benefits.With these upgrades, the Best Western Kent Narrows Inn is estimated to save more than 200,000 kWh of energy and more than $31,000 on their energy bill each year.They worried getting the rebates for their energy efficiency projects would require too much paperwork. But we were there to help. Our Service Providers met with Patel and Lacoste, handling the paperwork for them to make the projects turnkey.

Expected to open in late 2024, the resort will offer modern luxury with personalized amenities, dynamic culinary options, and a range of activities. It will feature contemporary suites, engaging nightlife programming, curated dining options, and exclusive amenities like an Olympic-sized swimming pool and luxurious spa. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of the Destination by Hyatt brand to the Caribbean, specifically with the Cas en Bas Beach Resort in St. Lucia, represents a strategic expansion in a leisure market with significant growth potential. The resort's positioning between two award-winning golf courses and a white sand beach, coupled with its range of high-end amenities, targets affluent global travelers seeking luxury combined with unique experiences. The resort's offerings, such as personalized excursions and vibe-led fitness programs, are designed to differentiate it from traditional hotel experiences in the region.From a market perspective, the development of Cas en Bas Beach Resort aligns with the broader trend of experiential travel, where guests are looking for more than just accommodation; they seek immersive, culturally rich experiences. This trend has been driving the luxury segment of the hospitality industry and Hyatt's investment in such a property indicates a response to consumer demand. The resort's planned opening in late 2024 also suggests confidence in the post-pandemic recovery of the travel sector, particularly in high-end leisure destinations. Financial Analyst Hyatt's expansion into the Caribbean with a new luxury resort is a move that could potentially enhance the company's revenue streams and diversify its portfolio geographically. The luxury travel market is known for its higher margins and the introduction of a new property in a desirable location like St. Lucia could attract a segment of travelers willing to spend more on premium experiences. This can lead to increased average daily rates and occupancy levels, positively impacting Hyatt's bottom line.The announcement may also have implications for Hyatt's stock (NYSE: H), as investors often react to growth initiatives, particularly in emerging or underserved markets. However, the actual impact on the stock will depend on the execution of the resort's launch, its operational performance and how it contributes to Hyatt's overall financial health. It's important for investors to monitor the progress of the resort's development and the company's performance in the leisure segment over time. Travel Industry Expert The debut of Cas en Bas Beach Resort in St. Lucia signifies an important milestone for Hyatt, marking its first Destination by Hyatt brand in the Caribbean. This expansion taps into the growing demand for personalized and authentic travel experiences. The resort's strategic location and the range of amenities, including an Olympic-sized swimming pool, fitness center and luxurious spa, are tailored to enhance the guest experience and cater to both leisure and wellness tourism trends.St. Lucia's accessibility via direct flights from major cities increases the resort's potential to attract international visitors. The island's reputation as a tropical paradise, combined with Hyatt's brand recognition and loyalty program, could make Cas en Bas Beach Resort a competitive player in the Caribbean luxury resort market.

TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares,2024-02-19T17:00:00.000Z,Low,Very Negative,"TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,798,275 shares at an average price of 59.95 EUR, amounting to 167,765,858.77 EUR, from February 12 to February 16, 2024.","TotalEnergies SE: Disclosure of Transactions in Own Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary TotalEnergies SE (TTE) announces share repurchase transactions totaling 2,798,275 shares at an average price of 59.95 EUR, amounting to 167,765,858.77 EUR, from February 12 to February 16, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A share repurchase program can be a significant indicator of a company's financial health and management's confidence in the business. TotalEnergies SE's recent buyback transaction, involving the repurchase of 2,798,275 shares at an average price of approximately 59.95 EUR per share, represents a substantial investment back into the company. This action suggests that the management believes the shares are undervalued and that investing in their own stock is a good use of capital.From a financial perspective, these buybacks can be accretive to earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which in turn can increase the stock price if the market perceives the buyback as a positive signal. It also reflects a return of capital to shareholders, as it may indicate that the company did not find more attractive investment opportunities to grow the business or that it is generating more cash than needed for operations and growth.However, the timing and price of the buyback are crucial. If the company repurchases shares at a price higher than their intrinsic value, it could result in a destruction of shareholder value. Additionally, investors should consider the opportunity cost of the buyback, as the funds used could have been allocated to other value-creating opportunities. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs are often well-received in the market as they can indicate a bullish outlook by the company's management. In the case of TotalEnergies SE, the repurchase of shares from various markets (XPAR, CEUX, TQEX, AQEU) could be interpreted as a strong signal of confidence to the market. The repurchase activity spread over multiple days and across different exchanges demonstrates a strategic approach to the buyback, possibly aimed at minimizing the impact on the share price.It is important to analyze the broader industry context to understand the potential impact of such a buyback. In the energy sector, where TotalEnergies operates, factors such as oil prices, regulatory changes and shifts towards renewable energy sources can significantly impact company valuations. The repurchase might be a move to capitalize on temporary market mispricings due to these external factors.Investors and stakeholders should monitor the company's subsequent financial statements to assess the impact of the buyback on key financial metrics and to understand how the reduction in equity affects the company's leverage and overall financial stability. Economist Share buybacks can have broader economic implications, particularly for a company the size of TotalEnergies SE. When a company of this magnitude engages in repurchasing its own shares, it can influence market liquidity and capital allocation within the economy. By reducing the number of shares available in the market, the company can potentially increase the stock's demand and price, which may have a positive feedback effect on market sentiment.However, it is essential to consider the economic context in which these buybacks occur. For instance, in a low-interest-rate environment, companies might be more inclined to finance share repurchases through debt, which could increase their financial risk. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of not investing in yield-generating assets becomes more significant.The effect of such buybacks on the company's financial flexibility should also be considered. While buybacks can signal strength, they can also reduce the cash reserves that might be necessary for navigating economic downturns or for seizing strategic investment opportunities that may arise. 02/19/2024 - 12:00 PM PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: In accordance with the authorization given by the ordinary shareholders’ general meeting on May 26, 2023, to trade on its shares and pursuant to applicable law on share repurchase, TotalEnergies SE (LEI: 529900S21EQ1BO4ESM68) (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) declares the following purchases of its own shares (FR0000120271) from February 12 to February 16, 2024: Transaction Date Total daily volume (number of shares) Daily weighted average purchase price of shares (EUR/share) Amount of transactions (EUR) Market (MIC Code) 12/02/2024 352,890 59.848778 21,120,035.27 XPAR 12/02/2024 144,870 59.847035 8,670,039.96 CEUX 12/02/2024 28,080 59.846908 1,680,501.18 TQEX 12/02/2024 24,000 59.846419 1,436,314.06 AQEU 13/02/2024 349,867 60.283606 21,091,244.38 XPAR 13/02/2024 144,842 60.283218 8,731,541.86 CEUX 13/02/2024 27,976 60.284350 1,686,514.98 TQEX 13/02/2024 23,670 60.284767 1,426,940.43 AQEU 14/02/2024 349,419 60.383027 21,098,976.91 XPAR 14/02/2024 144,087 60.383452 8,700,470.45 CEUX 14/02/2024 28,633 60.383746 1,728,967.80 TQEX 14/02/2024 23,813 60.384632 1,437,939.24 AQEU 15/02/2024 366,159 59.364623 21,736,890.99 XPAR 15/02/2024 150,833 59.363176 8,953,925.93 CEUX 15/02/2024 30,272 59.362574 1,797,023.84 TQEX 15/02/2024 25,074 59.366310 1,488,550.86 AQEU 16/02/2024 376,488 59.918167 22,558,470.86 XPAR 16/02/2024 152,714 59.920267 9,150,663.65 CEUX 16/02/2024 29,652 59.917625 1,776,677.42 TQEX 16/02/2024 24,936 59.920144 1,494,168.71 AQEU Total 2,798,275 59.953314 167,765,858.77 Transaction details In accordance with Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 (the Market Abuse Regulation) a full breakdown of the individual trades are disclosed on the TotalEnergies website: https://totalenergies.com/investors/shares-and-dividends/total-shares/info/company-share-transactions About TotalEnergies TotalEnergies is a global multi-energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas and green gases, renewables and electricity.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Transocean Ltd. (RIG) reported a net loss of $104 million for Q4 2023, with adjusted net loss of $74 million. Contract drilling revenues increased to $741 million due to higher fleet revenue efficiency. Full year net loss was $954 million, with adjusted net loss of $739 million. The company added $3.2 billion of backlog in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported sequential increase in contract drilling revenues is a positive indicator of growing operational activity, likely driven by improved market conditions in the offshore drilling sector. The improvement in revenue efficiency from 95.4% to 97.0% suggests the company is optimizing its operations, which is crucial for profitability, especially in capital-intensive industries. However, the adjusted EBITDA margin decrease from 22.5% to 16.3% raises concerns about the company's ability to translate revenue growth into bottom-line results. This margin compression could be indicative of rising operational costs or other inefficiencies that are not fully offset by the revenue increase.Investors should also consider the significant capital expenditures associated with the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship, which reflects the company's growth strategy but also adds to the financial burden in the short term. The substantial backlog of $9.01 billion provides a degree of revenue visibility, which is critical for future cash flow projections. However, the net loss figures, both quarterly and annually, highlight ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. The Effective Tax Rate fluctuations and the impact of discrete tax items should be analyzed for their potential influence on net loss figures. Market Research Analyst The offshore drilling industry is known for its cyclical nature and the CEO's statement about a multi-year upcycle suggests optimism for the sector's future. The addition of $3.2 billion to the backlog is significant as it represents future revenues that can provide stability to the company's financials. The mention of eighth-generation drillships indicates the company's investment in high-specification assets that are expected to be in demand as the industry moves towards more complex and challenging drilling environments. This strategic positioning could potentially offer a competitive advantage and attract premium contracts.Moreover, the company's focus on safety and performance, achieving a 97.6% uptime, is also noteworthy as operational excellence is a key differentiator in the industry. The emphasis on delivering value to shareholders in the context of market tightness suggests that the company is confident about its pricing power and the ability to secure profitable contracts. This could be a positive sign for investors looking at the long-term prospects of the company. Energy Sector Analyst The reported figures provide insight into the operational health of Transocean Ltd. within the energy sector, particularly offshore drilling. The increased average daily revenue and higher fleet revenue efficiency are indicative of strong operational performance and potentially higher day rates, which are vital metrics in the drilling industry. The strategic focus on ultra-deepwater assets reflects the industry trend towards deepwater and ultra-deepwater exploration and production, which is driven by the depletion of easier-to-reach oil reserves.The 20K BOP (blowout preventer) on the Deepwater Atlas represents an advancement in drilling technology, catering to high-pressure reservoirs and underscoring the company's investment in safety and innovation. The financial commitment to newbuild drillships like the Deepwater Aquila, despite the reported net losses, suggests a long-term outlook that anticipates a rebound in offshore drilling activity, aligning with the CEO's comments on market tightness and a multi-year upcycle. Stakeholders should assess the company's financial resilience and ability to manage debt levels in the context of these capital-intensive investments. 02/19/2024 - 05:21 PM Three months ended December 31, September 30, Sequential 2023 2023 change(In millions, except per share amounts and backlog) Contract drilling revenues$741 $713 $28 Adjusted contract drilling revenues$748 $721 $27 Revenue efficiency 97.0 % 95.4 % 1.6 %Operating and maintenance expense$569 $524 $45 Net loss attributable to controlling interest$(104) $(220) $116 Diluted loss per share$(0.13) $(0.28) $0.15 Adjusted EBITDA$122 $162 $(40) Adjusted EBITDA margin 16.3 % 22.5 % (6.2)%Adjusted net loss$(74) $(280) $206 Adjusted diluted loss per share$(0.09) $(0.36) $0.27 Backlog as of the February 2024 Fleet Status Report$9.01 billion STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Feb. 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) today reported a net loss attributable to controlling interest of $104 million, $0.13 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Fourth quarter results included net unfavorable items of $30 million, $0.04 per diluted share as follows: $24 million, $0.03 per diluted share, loss on conversion of debt to equity;$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, loss on impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate; and$3 million, discrete tax items, net. These unfavorable items were partially offset by: $1 million gain on early retirement of debt;$1 million of other net favorable items. After consideration of these net unfavorable items, fourth quarter 2023 adjusted net loss was $74 million, $0.09 per diluted share. Contract drilling revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased sequentially by $28 million to $741 million due to increased average daily revenue and higher fleet revenue efficiency, as well as increased utilization on four rigs that were undergoing contract preparation and one rig that underwent a special periodic survey in the third quarter. This was partially offset by lower revenue generated by two rigs that were idle and two rigs that were undergoing contract preparation during the fourth quarter. Contract intangible amortization represented a non-cash revenue reduction of $7 million, compared to $8 million in the prior quarter. Operating and maintenance expense was $569 million, compared with $524 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to rigs returning to work after undergoing contract preparation in the prior quarter and higher in-service maintenance costs across our fleet, partially offset by lower activity for two rigs that were idle in the fourth quarter. After consideration of the fair value adjustment of the bifurcated exchange feature embedded in our 4.625% exchangeable bonds, which was favorable $145 million in the fourth quarter and unfavorable $93 million in the third quarter, interest expense net of amounts capitalized was $142 million, compared with $139 million in the prior period. Interest income was $10 million, compared with $12 million in the previous quarter. The Effective Tax Rate(2) was (25.0)%, down from 16.3% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to reduced losses in the current quarter. The Effective Tax Rate excluding discrete items was (30.0)% compared to (8.7)% in the previous quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $98 million during the fourth quarter of 2023, representing an increase of $142 million compared to the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to timing of interest payments and increased collections from customers partially offset by decreased cash collected from, and increased payments to, our unconsolidated affiliates. Fourth quarter 2023 capital expenditures of $220 million were primarily associated with the newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship Deepwater Aquila. This compares with $50 million in the prior quarter. “We are very proud of our performance in 2023,” said Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen. “We added $3.2 billion of backlog in the calendar year, providing additional visibility to future cash flows. In addition to delivering standout personal and process safety results, we finished the year with a company-best 97.6% uptime performance. Notably, we generated these results in a year that included eight large-scale projects, including installation of the 20K BOP on the Deepwater Atlas, the industry’s first eighth-generation drillship, and the timely delivery and commissioning of the Deepwater Titan, our second eighth-generation drillship. Finally, we took delivery of our eighth 1,400 short ton drillship, the Deepwater Aquila.” Thigpen concluded: “We remain encouraged by the continued tightness in the market and remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders as we progress through what we expect to be a multi-year upcycle.” Full Year 2023 For the year ended December 31, 2023, net loss attributable to controlling interest totaled $954 million, $1.24 per diluted share. Full year results included $215 million, $0.28 per diluted share, net unfavorable items listed as follows: $169 million, $0.22 per diluted share, loss on disposal of assets;$57 million, $0.07 per diluted share, loss on impairment of assets;$31 million, $0.04 per diluted share, loss on retirement of debt;$27 million, $0.04 per diluted share, loss on conversion of debt to equity; and$5 million, $0.01 per diluted share, loss on impairment of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate; partially offset by,$74 million, $0.10 per diluted share, related to favorable discrete tax items. After consideration of these net unfavorable items, adjusted net loss for 2023 was $739 million, $0.96 per diluted share. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present our operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). We believe certain financial measures, such as Adjusted Contract Drilling Revenues, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which are non-GAAP measures, provide users of our financial statements with supplemental information that may be useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under U.S. GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure. Such non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All non-GAAP measure reconciliations to the most comparative U.S. GAAP measures are displayed in quantitative schedules on the company’s website at: www.deepwater.com.

Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) for DEXTENZA by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority is a significant regulatory milestone for AffaMed Therapeutics. This development can potentially expedite the drug's entry into the ASEAN market, which may result in increased revenue streams for the company. Given that DEXTENZA offers a more convenient treatment option with its sustained-release mechanism, it is poised to capture market share from traditional eye-drop treatments that require more frequent administration.From an industry perspective, the adoption of novel drug delivery systems like DEXTENZA's intracanalicular insert is indicative of a broader trend towards patient-centric solutions that enhance compliance and outcomes. AffaMed's strategic partnership with Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. for DEXTENZA's development and commercialization in key Asian markets also suggests potential for expanded market penetration and diversified risk. Market Research Analyst The ophthalmology sector in Asia is rapidly growing due to increasing prevalence of eye-related diseases and a growing middle class able to afford advanced treatments. AffaMed's NDA acceptance in Singapore positions the company advantageously in this expanding market. The company's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape in multiple Asian jurisdictions will be crucial in determining the speed and success of DEXTENZA's market adoption.Moreover, the initiation of a registrational trial in Mainland China is a strategic move, considering China's large patient population and increasing healthcare expenditure. The outcome of this trial and subsequent topline data release in Q3 2024 will be critical in influencing investor sentiment and could impact AffaMed's stock valuation, depending on the trial's success or failure. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of introducing a drug like DEXTENZA to the ASEAN and Greater China markets are multifaceted. On one hand, the reduction in the frequency of administration compared to traditional eye drops could lead to lower overall healthcare costs due to improved patient adherence and potentially fewer complications. On the other hand, the pricing strategy for DEXTENZA will be an important factor in determining its affordability and adoption rate, especially in price-sensitive markets.It is also noteworthy that the collaboration with Ocular Therapeutix may lead to shared development costs and resources, which could improve the financial efficiency of bringing DEXTENZA to market. The economic impact of this drug will ultimately depend on its market uptake, competitive pricing and the ability to displace existing treatments. 02/19/2024 - 09:00 AM SHANGHAI, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AffaMed Therapeutics (""AffaMed""), a biotechnology company dedicated to developing and commercializing transformative pharmaceutical, and surgical products that address critical unmet medical needs in ophthalmology, today announced that the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for DEXTENZA® (0.4 mg dexamethasone ophthalmic insert) for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ophthalmic surgery, and ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

Vistra Receives Approval from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Energy Harbor Acquisition,2024-02-19T16:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Vistra (VST) receives final regulatory approval from FERC to acquire Energy Harbor, marking a significant step towards accelerating the growth of Vistra's zero-carbon generation portfolio.","Vistra Receives Approval from Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Energy Harbor Acquisition Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Vistra (VST) receives final regulatory approval from FERC to acquire Energy Harbor, marking a significant step towards accelerating the growth of Vistra's zero-carbon generation portfolio. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for Vistra's acquisition of Energy Harbor is a significant milestone in the energy sector. The acquisition, which includes a substantial 4,000-megawatt nuclear generation fleet and a retail business serving approximately 1 million customers, is poised to reshape Vistra's market position. The incorporation of zero-carbon nuclear assets aligns with broader industry trends towards decarbonization and enhances Vistra's competitive edge in a market increasingly driven by sustainability concerns.From an energy market perspective, the addition of nuclear generation capabilities is particularly notable. Nuclear power plants are capable of providing baseload power, which is critical for grid stability and reliability. The retail customer base expansion also indicates potential growth in Vistra's market share and revenue streams. This strategic move may prompt a reevaluation of Vistra's stock by market analysts, factoring in the anticipated increase in long-term value and the potential for economies of scale. Financial Analyst The transaction's closure following FERC approval is likely to have immediate financial implications for Vistra. The acquisition's scale suggests a considerable capital outlay and the financial structure of the deal will be critical in determining its impact on Vistra's balance sheet. Investors will be keen on understanding the financing mechanisms, whether through debt or equity and the implications for Vistra's financial leverage and credit ratings.Furthermore, the market will closely monitor the integration process for signs of operational efficiency and synergy realization. The acquisition's success will hinge on Vistra's ability to seamlessly integrate Energy Harbor's assets and customer base, which can lead to cost savings and improved profit margins. Analysts will also scrutinize the effect on Vistra's earnings per share (EPS) and whether the acquisition is accretive to shareholder value in the short to medium term. Environmental Policy Expert The acquisition's environmental implications are noteworthy. Vistra's expansion of its zero-carbon generation portfolio through the integration of nuclear assets is a strategic response to the growing regulatory and societal pressures for clean energy. Nuclear energy is a low-carbon power source that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil fuel-based power generation. This move may position Vistra favorably in the context of potential future regulations aimed at carbon reduction and climate change mitigation.However, the environmental benefits must be weighed against the challenges associated with nuclear energy, such as waste management and safety concerns. Stakeholders will be interested in Vistra's approach to addressing these issues, as well as their plans for community engagement and regulatory compliance. The company's ability to effectively manage these aspects can influence public perception and regulatory outcomes, which are critical for long-term operational sustainability. 02/19/2024 - 11:00 AM This marks the final regulatory approval needed in the acquisition process IRVING, Texas, Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra (NYSE: VST) has now received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to acquire Energy Harbor. Vistra announced last March that the purchase of Energy Harbor, which includes a 4,000-megawatt nuclear generation fleet and retail business of ~1 million customers, presents a unique opportunity to accelerate the growth of Vistra's zero-carbon generation portfolio. FERC's approval, which was received Friday afternoon, was the last regulatory approval needed for the companies to close the transaction. Vistra anticipates closing in the coming weeks.

Diluted EPS saw a significant increase, along with positive leadership insights and segment performance. The company outlines a strategic direction for 2024, focusing on growth and operational efficiency. Positive Record revenue and earnings reported for both Q4 and full year 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 226% y-o-y for the full year. Adjusted diluted EPS rose by 13% for the full year. Net revenue reached a record $1.9 billion for the full year, up by 10%. Positive leadership reflections on revenue growth and strategic efforts. Segment performance highlights growth in options, futures, and FX trading revenue. Strategic direction for 2024 includes organic revenue growth and operational efficiency. Projected capital expenditures for growth and development in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report by Cboe Global Markets Inc. indicates a robust financial performance, with a particularly noteworthy 226% year-on-year increase in diluted EPS for the full year of 2023. Such a surge in profitability often reflects effective cost management and potentially expanding margins, which could be indicative of a strong competitive position within the financial exchange industry. The reported 10% growth in annual net revenue, while substantial, aligns with industry growth trends, suggesting that Cboe is maintaining pace with market expansion.Investors may find the 33% increase in quarterly diluted EPS reassuring, as it implies that Cboe's profitability is not solely reliant on cyclical or one-off events but is sustained across financial periods. The record high market share in Global FX and the increase in options trading revenue by 15% highlight Cboe's strong positioning in these segments, which could be attributed to the company's strategic focus on derivatives and data and access solutions. However, the slight decrease in market share for Options exchanges may require attention to ensure long-term dominance in this core area. Market Research Analyst Analyzing Cboe's segment performance reveals nuanced dynamics within their business model. The 15% increase in revenue from options trading, driven by a 24% rise in index options trading, underscores a growing investor interest in derivative instruments, possibly linked to market volatility or the search for alternative investment strategies. Conversely, the 10% decrease in North American Equities revenue, attributed to lower transaction fees and market data revenue, could signal a competitive challenge or a shift in trading patterns. It is essential to monitor how these trends evolve, as they may impact Cboe's market positioning and revenue streams.The company's strategic direction for 2024, with an emphasis on organic net revenue growth and operational efficiency, suggests a proactive approach to scaling operations while managing costs. The projected increase in revenue from data and access solutions aligns with the industry's broader shift towards data monetization, which is becoming an increasingly critical component of exchange revenue models. Economist From an economic standpoint, Cboe's financial results and forward-looking statements provide insight into the broader financial markets' health. The company's performance, particularly in derivatives and foreign exchange, may reflect underlying economic trends such as increased market volatility, international trade flows and the global diversification of assets. The positive outlook for 2024, with anticipated organic revenue growth, suggests confidence in the continued demand for Cboe's offerings, which may be seen as a positive indicator for economic activity and liquidity in the financial markets.However, it is important to consider macroeconomic factors such as interest rate changes, regulatory developments and geopolitical events that could influence trading volumes and revenue. The effective tax rate estimation between 28.5% and 30.5% will also play a role in net earnings, as changes in tax policy can have a significant impact on financial institutions like Cboe. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 19, 2024 / Cboe Global Markets Inc. (NYSE:CBOE) reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023, showcasing significant growth in several key financial metrics. Some of the standout figures from the report include a substantial increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted diluted EPS and net revenue for both the quarter and the full year.

Tomczyk highlighted the company's revenue growth, particularly from its derivatives and data and access solutions, largely attributing success to market trends and strategic efforts. He also outlined ambitions to leverage Cboe's technological and global strengths for further growth in 2024.""This year we plan to unlock additional value from our global derivatives and securities network by leveraging our core strengths - our global footprint, superior technology and product innovation - to help drive continued strong revenue growth and financial results."" Tomczyk said.Overall, both leaders expressed optimism for sustaining shareholder returns into the next year.Segment PerformanceHere's an overview of Cboe's financial performance y-o-y across its various business segments:Options: The revenue from options trading increased by 15% to $314.5 million, mainly due to a 24% rise in the trading of index options. Meanwhile, the market share for Cboe's Options exchanges slightly decreased from 34.1% to 33.5%.North American Equities: Revenue in this segment dropped by 10% to $86.3 million. This decrease was largely because of lower transaction fees and market data revenue. The market share in U.S. Equities remained stable, while Canadian Equities saw an increase in market share due to more clients.Europe and Asia Pacific: This area saw a 9% increase in revenue to $48 million, with gains across non-transaction revenue like market data fees.

Regarding taxes, the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings is estimated to be between 28.5% and 30.5%. Lastly, Cboe plans to allocate $51 million to $57 million toward capital expenditures, investing in the company's growth and development.Cboe's 2023 Journey And BeyondOverall, Cboe Global Markets' financial achievements in 2023 underscore a year of significant growth, with record highs in earnings per share and net revenue, demonstrating the company's robust market position and operational success. Leadership's optimistic outlook and strategic plans for leveraging strengths in technology and innovation signal a continued trajectory of growth for 2024.

Negative None. 02/19/2024 - 09:00 AM Ranking in the top 5% of 23,000+ participating companies, the organization has earned an A- for disclosing its best practice environmental strategy and actions. GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Steelcase (NYSE: SCS), a global design and thought leader in the world of work, is the only organization in its industry to earn a top score of A- from CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project, a global nonprofit that runs the world's leading environmental disclosure platform, for its continual commitment to best practices in environmental strategy and action. In 2023, 23,000+ companies disclosed through CDP. The A- places Steelcase within the top level ""leadership"" band of scoring, with only 5% of companies achieving this rank. Steelcase has disclosed through CDP since 2011, and despite increasingly stringent criteria, has continually improved its score, most recently advancing from a B in 2022. Achieving the A- score, which not only recognizes transparency, but also the adoption of processes designed to improve the wellbeing of the planet, requires broad collaboration across all of Steelcase, including the leadership of President and CEO, Sara Armbruster, and the Board of Directors.

Key presentations include comparisons of risankizumab and ustekinumab in Crohn's disease, risankizumab maintenance therapy in ulcerative colitis, and long-term safety data on upadacitinib in Crohn's disease. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst Examining the data from AbbVie's presentations at the ECCO congress provides critical insights into the development and effectiveness of treatments for inflammatory bowel diseases. The focus on risankizumab and upadacitinib, particularly in the context of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, highlights the potential for these drugs to alter the current treatment landscape. The use of endoscopic outcomes as key trial endpoints is significant, as mucosal healing is increasingly recognized as an important goal in IBD management, correlating with better long-term patient outcomes.Post-hoc analyses, such as those presented from the SEQUENCE trial, are instrumental in understanding the nuances of drug efficacy and can guide more personalized treatment strategies. The COMMAND and U-ENDURE trial results further illuminate the safety and maintenance potential of these therapies, which is crucial for chronic conditions like IBD. The economic impact of achieving mucosal healing is another vital aspect, as it can influence healthcare costs and patient quality of life. Health Economist The post-hoc analysis of the economic impact of achieving mucosal healing on ulcerative colitis-related hospitalizations and work productivity presents a compelling angle for stakeholders. By quantifying the potential reduction in healthcare resource utilization and improvement in work productivity, this data can justify the investment in newer therapies from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. It's essential to consider the broader economic implications of these treatments beyond direct medical costs, including the potential for reducing long-term disability and associated societal costs. Pharmaceutical Market Research Analyst The competitive landscape of IBD treatments is evolving with the introduction of new biologics and JAK inhibitors like risankizumab and upadacitinib. The detailed long-term efficacy and safety data presented can be a differentiating factor for AbbVie's portfolio in a crowded market. By showcasing the effectiveness of these drugs in patients with different baseline characteristics and prior treatment failures, AbbVie is positioning its products to meet the needs of a diverse patient population. Understanding these dynamics is essential for forecasting market trends and anticipating the impact on AbbVie's market share and revenue growth. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM – A total of 17 accepted abstracts, including nine oral presentations and eight posters, reinforce AbbVie's commitment to produce a portfolio of products that aim to improve the lives of patients living with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)– Oral data presentations include a new post-hoc analysis of clinical and endoscopic outcomes from the SEQUENCE trial comparing risankizumab (SKYRIZI®) versus ustekinumab, results from the COMMAND Phase 3 study of risankizumab as a maintenance therapy in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), and long-term safety results from the U-ENDURE trial of upadacitinib (RINVOQ®) in adult patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD)– Research accepted for presentation reiterates AbbVie's commitment to understanding the needs of the gastroenterology community and advance standards of care in IBD NORTH CHICAGO, Ill., Feb. 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) announced that 17 AbbVie-sponsored abstracts, including new data from its inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) portfolio, have been accepted for presentation at the 19th Congress of European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) taking place in Stockholm, Sweden from February 21-24. Among the accepted research are nine oral presentations and eight posters. The research spans risankizumab (SKYRIZI®) and upadacitinib (RINVOQ®) in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

""Research in IBD has resulted in new efficacious treatment options over the past couple of years. However, we are still seeing patients with uncontrolled disease,"" said Remo Panaccione, M.D., professor of medicine and director of the IBD unit, University of Calgary. ""It is critically important that as the treatment paradigm shifts, the gastroenterology community shifts with it.

In both CD and UC, the immune system causes inflammation and damage to the mucosa – or lining – of the gut.1-3 Specifically, CD manifests as inflammation within the GI tract, most commonly in the area between the small intestine (ileum) and the colon, causing persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain.1,4 UC is a chronic, idiopathic, immune-mediated IBD of the large intestine that causes continuous mucosal inflammation extending, to a variable extent, from the rectum to the more proximal colon.3,5 The hallmark signs and symptoms of UC include rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus (a sense of pressure), urgency and fecal incontinence.3,5 CD and UC are progressive diseases, meaning they get worse over time and may lead to life-threatening complications or surgery.6,7 Because the signs and symptoms of CD and UC are unpredictable, they cause a significant burden on people living with the disease—not only physically, but also emotionally and economically.7,8 About Risankizumab (SKYRIZI®)SKYRIZI is an interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor that selectively blocks IL-23 by binding to its p19 subunit. IL-23, a cytokine involved in inflammatory processes, is thought to be linked to a number of chronic immune-mediated diseases.9-12 SKYRIZI is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease.9,10 About RINVOQ® (upadacitinib)Discovered and developed by AbbVie scientists, RINVOQ is a selective JAK inhibitor that is being studied in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Based on enzymatic and cellular assays, RINVOQ demonstrated greater inhibitory potency for JAK-1 and JAK-2 relative to JAK-3, and TYK-2. The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness and safety is not currently known.13-14 Phase 3 trials of RINVOQ in rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis are ongoing.12 U.S. Indications and Important Safety Information about SKYRIZI® (risankizumab-rzaa)9SKYRIZI is a prescription medicine used to treat adults with: moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who may benefit from taking injections or pills (systemic therapy) or treatment using ultraviolet or UV light (phototherapy).active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).moderate to severe Crohn's disease.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about SKYRIZI® (risankizumab-rzaa)?

Announcement Regarding Possible Offer,2024-02-19T13:00:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"MariaDB plc (MRDB) received an unsolicited proposal from K1 Investment Management LLC to acquire the company, leading to a possible offer. The board is reviewing the offer, which may or may not result in a firm offer being made. K1 has until March 29, 2024, to announce its intentions under the Irish Takeover Rules.","Announcement Regarding Possible Offer Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary MariaDB plc (MRDB) received an unsolicited proposal from K1 Investment Management LLC to acquire the company, leading to a possible offer. The board is reviewing the offer, which may or may not result in a firm offer being made. K1 has until March 29, 2024, to announce its intentions under the Irish Takeover Rules. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The unsolicited non-binding indicative proposal from K1 Investment Management to acquire MariaDB represents a significant potential shift in ownership that could have material implications for the company's stock valuation and strategic direction. The nature of the proposal, being non-binding, indicates that negotiations are at a preliminary stage and the lack of commitment suggests there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the outcome. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as an acquisition can lead to a re-rating of the company's shares. The premium offered over the current share price, if any, will be a critical factor in determining the short-term stock price movement.Furthermore, the involvement of K1 and its fund K5 Private Investors suggests a strategic interest in MariaDB's business, which could result in operational changes post-acquisition. The long-term impact on the company's performance will depend on the strategic fit between MariaDB and K1's portfolio, as well as the execution of post-acquisition integration. Shareholders should consider the track record of K1 in managing acquired companies and the potential synergies that could be realized. Mergers & Acquisitions Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the announcement triggers certain regulatory mechanisms under the Irish Takeover Rules. The timeline set forth by Rule 2.6 of the Irish Takeover Rules imposes a definitive deadline for K1 to declare its intentions, ensuring that MariaDB's shareholders are not left in a prolonged state of uncertainty. This deadline also serves to protect the company's business operations from being disrupted by speculative market activity.Should K1 proceed with a formal offer, the terms of the acquisition will be scrutinized under the Irish Takeover Rules to ensure fairness to all shareholders. It is essential for shareholders to understand that until a firm intention to make an offer is announced, there is no guarantee of a transaction. The potential impact on shareholder value is contingent upon the specifics of any formal offer, including the offer price and conditions. Market Research Analyst An acquisition proposal such as this is indicative of underlying value within MariaDB that may have been recognized by K1 Investment Management. MariaDB's positioning in the database management systems market and its competitive advantages should be examined to assess the strategic rationale behind the Possible Offer. The broader industry trends, including the shift towards cloud-based database solutions and the increasing importance of big data analytics, likely factor into K1's interest.It's crucial to evaluate MariaDB's market share, growth prospects and technological capabilities relative to its peers to understand why it stands out as an acquisition target. Such an analysis can provide insights into the long-term benefits and risks associated with the acquisition, including potential market consolidation or expansion opportunities that could arise from the integration of MariaDB's technology and customer base with K1's existing investments. 02/19/2024 - 08:00 AM NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER RULES Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Irish Takeover Rules, any person who is 'interested' in 1% or more of any class of 'relevant securities' of the Company or a securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror which has announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an 'opening position disclosure' following the commencement of the 'offer period' and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An 'opening position disclosure' must contain, among other things, details of the person's 'interests' and 'short positions' in any 'relevant securities' of each of (i) the Company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An 'opening position disclosure' by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3:30 pm (New York time) on the day that is ten 'business days' following the commencement of the ‘offer period’ and, if appropriate, by no later than 3:30 pm (New York time) on the day that is ten 'business days' following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

Bestway's digital transformation strategy focuses on providing premier customer experiences and staying ahead of competition.","Bestway Europe Unlocks New Market Potential and Accelerates Business Growth with BigCommerce Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary BigCommerce (BIGC) partners with Bestway Europe to launch Bestway Italy and Bestway France on its platform, aiming to enhance user experiences and expand its business in Europe. Bestway's digital transformation strategy focuses on providing premier customer experiences and staying ahead of competition. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by Bestway Europe to adopt a headless, composable front-end for their ecommerce platform signifies a significant shift towards a more agile and customer-centric approach in the retail sector. This transition allows for a more personalized shopping experience, responsive to the nuanced preferences of consumers in different European markets. By leveraging BigCommerce's Open SaaS platform, Bestway aims to gain a competitive advantage through enhanced performance, security and scalability, which are critical factors in retaining customer loyalty and driving sales growth.From a market research perspective, the adoption of a modular system that adheres to the MACH principle (Microservices-based, API-first, Cloud-native and Headless) is a forward-thinking decision. It reflects a broader industry trend where retailers prioritize flexibility and speed to market over the traditional, more rigid systems. This approach can potentially lead to increased market penetration and customer retention rates, as it allows Bestway to rapidly adapt to market trends and consumer demands. Financial Analyst The announcement of Bestway Europe's expansion into Italy and France through BigCommerce's platform could have important financial implications for both companies. For Bestway, the shift to a composable commerce architecture is likely to result in an initial increase in capital expenditure to cover the costs of digital transformation. However, this investment is expected to lead to long-term cost savings due to lower total cost of ownership and increased operational efficiencies.From an investor's standpoint, BigCommerce's partnership with Bestway Europe and other major brands showcases its capability to support enterprise-level clients, which could positively impact BigCommerce's (Nasdaq: BIGC) stock performance. The market will be watching closely for the success of these implementations, which may serve as a bellwether for future adoption by other large enterprises, potentially driving up BigCommerce's market share and revenue. Ecommerce Technology Expert The transition to headless commerce is a response to the limitations of monolithic systems, which are often inflexible and costly to scale. In contrast, a headless architecture separates the front-end and back-end, enabling companies like Bestway to independently update the user experience without overhauling the entire system. The technical agility offered by a headless approach is particularly beneficial for businesses operating in diverse international markets, where localization and customization are key to success.Furthermore, the partnership with Adiacent for the design of the composable site reflects the importance of choosing technology partners with domain expertise.

Alight study reveals half of companies committed payroll errors during the last five years,2024-02-19T13:30:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Alight, Inc.

Despite media focus on AI, only 8% plan to integrate AI in the next two years.","Alight study reveals half of companies committed payroll errors during the last five years Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Alight, Inc. (NYSE: ALIT) released its 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report highlighting payroll penalties for non-compliance. The report shows 53% of companies faced penalties in the last five years, with many still using spreadsheets and outdated processes. Despite media focus on AI, only 8% plan to integrate AI in the next two years. Positive None. Negative - Low adoption of AI in payroll processes despite industry trends and media attention. - Significant percentage of companies still using spreadsheets and outdated manual processes. - Only 26% reported employing fully cloud-based strategies, indicating a need for more streamlined processes. Financial Analyst The revelation that over half of the companies surveyed have incurred payroll penalties due to non-compliance is a significant indicator of operational inefficiency and potential financial risk. From a financial standpoint, these penalties can directly affect a company's bottom line, potentially leading to an increase in operational costs and a decrease in net income. Additionally, the use of spreadsheets and manual processes by a considerable percentage of companies suggests a lag in the adoption of more efficient and cost-effective payroll systems, which could impede the ability to scale operations effectively.Investors should monitor the extent to which companies in their portfolios are addressing these inefficiencies, as it could be indicative of management's ability to implement necessary technological advancements and control costs. The shift towards streamlined processes and cloud-based strategies, while currently at a modest 26%, is a positive trend that could result in cost savings and improved compliance over the long term. However, the slow adoption rate of AI within payroll processes might signal a reluctance to invest in emerging technologies, which could be a competitive disadvantage. Market Research Analyst The report's findings highlight a broader industry trend towards digital transformation in payroll operations. The market for cloud-based human capital management solutions is growing as businesses seek to modernize their operations. Companies that successfully migrate to cloud-based payroll systems may gain a competitive edge through increased efficiency, reduced risk of non-compliance and improved data management capabilities.It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the market dynamics at play. As companies continue to prioritize the integration of payroll and benefits into unified platforms, there may be increased demand for providers offering comprehensive solutions. This could impact the competitive landscape, with potential benefits for innovators and market leaders in cloud-based human capital technology. The emphasis on employee data analysis and automatic reporting mechanisms reflects a growing need for data-driven decision-making capabilities in human resources management. Legal Expert Payroll compliance is a complex legal area, varying significantly across different jurisdictions. The report underscores the legal implications of outdated payroll practices, with more than half of the surveyed companies facing penalties. This not only suggests a widespread issue with keeping up with regulatory requirements but also indicates potential legal exposure. Companies operating across multiple countries must navigate a myriad of tax laws and employment regulations, which can be particularly challenging with outdated or manual systems.For businesses, the legal risks associated with non-compliance can extend beyond financial penalties to include reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny. The focus on integrating payroll and benefits platforms is likely a response to these challenges, aiming to ensure greater compliance and reduce the risk of legal issues. However, the slow adoption of new technologies like AI in payroll processes could be a missed opportunity to leverage advanced tools for compliance monitoring and risk management. 02/19/2024 - 08:30 AM Outdated payroll practices are penalizing organizations and emphasize the urgent need to make transformative changes in payroll management LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alight, Inc. (NYSE: ALIT), a leading cloud-based human capital technology and services provider, today released the findings of its 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report, which revealed that over half (53%) of surveyed companies have incurred payroll penalties in the last five years for non-compliance. Building on the data from the 2023 Alight Global Payroll Complexity Index, this new report surveyed nearly 300 payroll professionals and stakeholders to understand key aspects of payroll operations, including the number of countries that each company processes payroll in, as well as the types of processes and technology they used to execute payroll. In addition to penalties, the report found 51% of those surveyed still use spreadsheets, and 19% use outdated manual or paper processes within their payroll departments. The survey also reveals that many companies are shifting towards more streamlined processes and migrating more of their payroll operations to the cloud. Currently, only 26% reported employing fully cloud-based strategies. Despite significant media attention around AI and a continued industry trend to migrate to digital solutions, only 8% of respondents expressed intentions to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) to their payroll processes within the next two years. Organizations surveyed also placed integrating payroll and benefits into a unified platform as their number one priority, followed by employee data analysis and implementing automatic reporting mechanisms. As well, payroll challenges are magnified for companies operating in the top 10 most complex payroll processing countries where there is an increased likelihood of receiving a penalty for payroll non-compliance. The report underscores a direct correlation between the number of countries an organization operates in and the likelihood of receiving fines. Notably, 24% of organizations operating in a single country received fines. However, this percentage sharply rises to 67% for organizations expanding their operations into two-to-five countries, marking the highest prevalence of fines within this range. “Payroll is an integral part of any business and can damage an organization’s reputation if something goes wrong,” said Luca Saracino, executive vice president of payroll and professional services at Alight. “These mistakes can be mitigated with a well-integrated, single platform that combines all-important HR functions such as payroll and benefits into a one-stop shop. Streamlining such processes not only saves time and minimizes risks of human errors, but also goes a long way in safeguarding both the company and promoting employee wellbeing.” To learn more about Alight’s Company Payroll Complexity Report, download the 2024 report here. Research methodology The 2024 Company Payroll Complexity Report is the result of a survey completed by nearly 300 payroll professionals between July and September 2023. The survey targeted payroll professionals as well as key stakeholders with a vested interest in payroll operations in their respective companies including the number of countries companies processed payroll in, to the number of fines and penalties received for non-compliance. This report builds on and uses the data from the 2023 Global Payroll Complexity Index to create a holistic picture of the current payroll technology landscape, including what options companies have in terms of technology, functionality and processes to optimize their payroll operations.

The move leverages the NYSE's trading model for tighter spreads and increased liquidity, benefiting investors.","IronHorse Capital Transfers Listing of Conductor Global Equity Value ETF (Ticker: CGV) to New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Floor Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary IronHorse Capital announced the transfer of the Conductor Global Equity Value ETF (Ticker: CGV) listing from NYSE ARCA to the NYSE Floor, aiming to enhance liquidity and accessibility. The move leverages the NYSE's trading model for tighter spreads and increased liquidity, benefiting investors. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The transfer of the Conductor Global Equity Value ETF from NYSE ARCA to the New York Stock Exchange Floor is a strategic move that can be expected to influence the ETF's visibility and potentially its trading volume. The NYSE Floor is known for its hybrid market model that combines human trading floor presence with electronic trading. This model can lead to tighter bid-ask spreads, which are the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a stock and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept. Tighter spreads generally improve market liquidity, which is a measure of how easily investors can buy or sell an asset without affecting its price.Increased liquidity and the prestige of the NYSE may attract more institutional investors, who often prefer trading on platforms where they can execute large orders efficiently. For retail investors, improved liquidity can mean better pricing and the ability to execute trades more quickly. However, it is important to monitor the ETF's performance following the move to ensure that these theoretical benefits are being realized in practice. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, the listing transfer of the Conductor Global Equity Value ETF to the NYSE Floor is not expected to have a direct impact on the ETF's intrinsic value or the value of its underlying assets. However, the move could have indirect financial implications. For instance, a potential increase in trading activity and liquidity could make the ETF more attractive to a broader range of investors, potentially leading to an increase in the ETF's assets under management (AUM).Furthermore, the association with the NYSE, which is one of the world's most recognized stock exchanges, may enhance the ETF's brand image and credibility among investors. This could be particularly beneficial for IronHorse Capital's reputation and its product offerings. Nonetheless, it's crucial for investors to assess whether the anticipated benefits are reflected in the ETF's performance metrics, such as trading volume and AUM, post-transfer. 02/20/2024 - 05:11 PM NEW YORK, Feb. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- IronHorse Capital, a leading provider of innovative investment solutions, today announced its decision to transfer the listing of the Conductor Global Equity Value ETF (Ticker: CGV) from NYSE ARCA to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Floor, effective February 23, 2024.

""This decision reflects our commitment to enhancing liquidity and accessibility for our investors while leveraging the benefits of the NYSE's robust trading platform."" By listing on the NYSE Floor, the Conductor Global Equity Value ETF (Ticker: CGV) will benefit from the exchange's floor-based trading model, which combines advanced technology with human oversight to ensure efficient and orderly trading.

The company repurchased 135,318 ordinary shares at a weighted average purchase price of EUR 42.2351, totaling EUR 5,715,173.62. The purpose of the transactions was to meet obligations from debt financial instruments exchangeable into equity instruments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst STMicroelectronics' recent share repurchase activity represents a strategic financial decision, often interpreted as a signal of self-assurance in the company's valuation. By buying back shares at a weighted average price of EUR 42.2351, the company is effectively reducing its shares outstanding, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially boost investor sentiment.From a financial perspective, the repurchase of 135,318 ordinary shares, though a modest 0.01% of the issued share capital, still accounts for a considerable expenditure of EUR 5,715,173.62. This action may reflect the company's liquidity and cash flow management strategies. Investors should monitor the treasury shares' role in fulfilling obligations of debt instruments exchangeable into equity, as this could influence the company's leverage and capital structure.Moreover, the retention of repurchased shares in treasury provides STMicroelectronics with flexibility for future corporate actions, including employee compensation plans or further share buybacks. The impact on the stock market could be positive if the market views these repurchases as a sign of a undervalued stock or strong future prospects. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is characterized by cyclical demand and rapid technological advancements. STMicroelectronics' share repurchase may be interpreted as a strategic move to optimize capital allocation amidst industry-specific challenges such as fluctuating demand, supply chain constraints and intense competition.Investors should consider the broader industry context, including the current semiconductor market trends and the company's competitive positioning. The repurchase program could be a proactive measure to manage capital in anticipation of industry headwinds or to prepare for strategic investments and acquisitions.Additionally, the share repurchase's timing and scale might reflect the company's confidence in its operational performance and future growth prospects. Analysts should compare these repurchases with industry peers to gauge STMicroelectronics' financial health relative to the competition.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN. Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement published earlier today on 20 February 2024 by Ensurge Micropower ASA (""Ensurge"" or the ""Company"") regarding a contemplated private placement (the ""Private Placement"") of new shares in the Company (the ""Offer Shares""), where Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) has acted as financial advisor and bookrunner (the ""Manager""). Ensurge is pleased to announce that the Private Placement has been successfully placed through an allocation of 233,468,885 Offer Shares at a subscription price of NOK 0.25 per Offer Share (the ""Subscription Price"") for total gross proceeds of NOK 58,367,221.25. The final number of Offer Shares and the Subscription Price was determined by the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"") following an accelerated bookbuilding process. The net proceeds from the Private Placement will be used fund the Company’s operations, with focus on Go-To- Market activities and production ramp up. Over the next 6-9 months Ensurge expects significant funding from customers and technology partners to complement this equity funding. The share issue and associated share capital increase in the Private Placement has been resolved by the Board pursuant to an authorization to issue new shares granted by the extraordinary general meeting of the Company on 10 November 2023 (the “Authorization”). Following completion of the Private Placement, the Company’s share capital will be NOK 269,315,774.30 divided into 2,693,157,743 shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10. Completion of the Private Placement is subject to (i) all necessary corporate resolutions for consummating the Private Placement being validly made by the Company, including without limitation relevant approvals and resolutions by the Board, as applicable, and (ii) the Offer Shares having been validly issued (by registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the issuance of the Offer Shares in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (""NRBE"")) and delivered in the VPS. Settlement of the Offer Shares is expected to take place on or about 23 February 2024 on a delivery versus payment basis by delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed on Oslo Børs, pursuant to a share lending agreement (the ""Share Lending Agreement"") entered into between the Company, Robert Keith and the Manager. The Offer Shares issued pursuant to the Authorisation will be used to settle the share borrowing from Robert Keith and will be tradable after the share capital increase relating to the Offer Shares has been registered by the NRBE, which is expected on or about 26 February 2024. Equal treatment considerationsThe Board has considered the contemplated Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and Oslo Børs' Circular no. 2/2014 and deems that the Private Placement is in compliance with these requirements. The Board holds the view that it is in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity through a private placement, in view of the current market conditions and the growth opportunities currently available to the Company. A private placement has enabled the Company to raise capital in an efficient manner and the Private Placement was structured to ensure that a market-based subscription price was achieved. Taking into consideration that the Subscription Price represents a limited discount compared to the current trading price and a premium to the trading price of the Company over the past months, the Board has concluded to not carry out a subsequent offering.

ASML Holding N.V. repurchased a total of 54,284 shares at an average price ranging from €842.35 to €868.96. The total repurchased value amounted to approximately €46,503,215. The buyback program was initiated on November 10, 2022, and aims to enhance shareholder value. For more details, visit ASML's website. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Share buyback programs are a significant market activity, as they can indicate a company's perspective on its own valuation. By repurchasing its shares, a company like ASML can potentially signal to the market that it believes its stock is undervalued. This activity can also improve financial metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares outstanding, which may make the stock more attractive to investors.Looking at ASML's recent transactions, the company has been consistent in its buyback approach, suggesting a strategic effort to manage its capital structure. While the repurchase values differ each day, reflecting the market's fluctuating prices, the overall commitment to the program remains evident. It's important for stakeholders to monitor such buybacks as they may reflect management's confidence in the company's future performance and strategic direction. Financial Analyst When analyzing the financial implications of ASML's share buyback, it's crucial to consider the impact on the company's cash reserves. The total repurchase value over the reported days amounts to a substantial investment. This could indicate strong cash flow generation by ASML, which allows for such capital return activities without compromising operational funding.Investors often view share buybacks as a positive move, as it can lead to a short-term increase in share price. However, it is also essential to assess whether these buybacks are being financed by debt, which could lead to a different evaluation of the company's financial health. In the long term, the effectiveness of buybacks in delivering shareholder value must be weighed against other potential uses of capital, such as investment in R&D or strategic acquisitions. Economist From an economic perspective, ASML's buyback program must be contextualized within the broader semiconductor industry and macroeconomic environment. The semiconductor sector is known for its cyclical nature and buybacks may serve as a counter-cyclical measure to stabilize stock prices during periods of volatility. Additionally, in a low-interest-rate environment, companies may favor buybacks over other investments due to the relatively lower cost of capital.However, it's important to consider that buybacks can also be a response to a lack of viable investment opportunities, which could be a sign of maturation in the semiconductor industry or a cautious stance due to macroeconomic uncertainties. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain issues are factors that can influence a company's decision-making process regarding capital allocation. 02/19/2024 - 08:00 AM ASML reports transactions under its current share buyback program VELDHOVEN, the Netherlands – ASML Holding N.V.

EnLink Midstream Exploring Additional Carbon Transportation Opportunities with ExxonMobil to Reduce Emissions in the Gulf Coast,2024-02-20T22:05:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"EnLink Midstream, LLC (ENLC) partners with ExxonMobil to expand carbon capture and sequestration efforts in Gulf Coast areas, aiming to provide cost-effective solutions for industrial CO2 emitters.","EnLink Midstream Exploring Additional Carbon Transportation Opportunities with ExxonMobil to Reduce Emissions in the Gulf Coast Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary EnLink Midstream, LLC (ENLC) partners with ExxonMobil to expand carbon capture and sequestration efforts in Gulf Coast areas, aiming to provide cost-effective solutions for industrial CO2 emitters. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The collaboration between EnLink Midstream, LLC and ExxonMobil to explore additional carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) opportunities represents a strategic move within the energy sector, particularly in the context of the growing importance of environmental sustainability and the transition to low-carbon energy sources. The Gulf Coast's high concentration of industrial CO2 emissions makes it a critical area for CCS deployment. The initiative could potentially lead to significant operational synergies, given EnLink's expertise in midstream asset management and ExxonMobil's focus on low-carbon solutions.From an investment perspective, the expansion of this partnership could enhance EnLink's competitive positioning in the CO2 transportation service market, which is likely to experience increased demand as companies seek to reduce their carbon footprint in response to regulatory pressures and stakeholder expectations. Additionally, ExxonMobil's acquisition of Denbury and the reevaluation of the Pecan Island Area project suggest a dynamic approach to optimizing CCS investments, which could impact the long-term profitability and sustainability of both companies. Environmental Policy Expert The joint effort by EnLink and ExxonMobil aligns with the broader policy push for carbon reduction initiatives, particularly in regions with substantial emissions such as the Gulf Coast. The Environmental Protection Agency's data on the region's industrial CO2 emissions underscores the significance of these efforts. As governments continue to incentivize carbon reduction through various mechanisms, including tax credits and grants, companies that proactively invest in CCS can benefit from both regulatory support and improved public perception.Furthermore, the collaboration could serve as a model for public-private partnerships aimed at addressing climate change. It is essential to monitor how this partnership aligns with national and international environmental goals and whether it sets a precedent for future CCS projects. The effectiveness and scalability of the solutions proposed by EnLink and ExxonMobil could influence environmental policy and the pace at which the energy industry transitions towards sustainable practices. Market Research Analyst The announcement hints at a growing market for CCS solutions, particularly in areas with a high density of industrial emissions. By prioritizing cost-effective and efficient CCS solutions, EnLink and ExxonMobil are not only addressing an environmental need but also tapping into a market with significant growth potential. The reassessment of the Pecan Island Area project in favor of potentially more lucrative opportunities indicates a strategic market-driven approach.For stakeholders, the key consideration will be the balance between upfront investment in CCS infrastructure and the long-term financial benefits derived from operational cost savings, enhanced reputation and potential revenue streams from carbon credits. The market response to this announcement may vary, with investors considering the implications for future earnings, market share and the companies' positions in an evolving energy landscape. The ability of EnLink and ExxonMobil to deliver on their CCS promises could become a critical factor in investor confidence and stock valuation. 02/20/2024 - 05:05 PM DALLAS, Feb. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC) (EnLink) announced today that ExxonMobil and EnLink are exploring opportunities for EnLink to support ExxonMobil's carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) efforts beyond the southeast Louisiana Mississippi River Corridor into several additional Gulf Coast areas. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Gulf Coast contains one of the highest concentrations of industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the United States, with over 215 million metric tonnes per year (Mtpa) generated today in and around the Houston Ship Channel, the Mississippi River Corridor, Lake Charles and southwest Louisiana, and the Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas, areas combined. EnLink and ExxonMobil are committed to providing cost-effective and efficient CCS solutions to CO2 emitting companies and industries in each of these areas, and the two companies continue to develop a strategic relationship to serve these customers. ""EnLink and ExxonMobil are actively pursuing opportunities to develop safe, reliable, and cost-efficient CCS solutions,"" said Jesse Arenivas, EnLink Chief Executive Officer. ""EnLink brings to the table decades of expertise building, owning, and operating midstream assets with a customer-focused mindset, which gives ExxonMobil greater flexibility and more options to meet the needs of industrial CO2 emitters. EnLink is fast becoming a leader in providing safe, low-cost CO2 pipeline transportation services, and we're excited to expand the discussion with ExxonMobil to additional high-emitting Gulf Coast areas."" ""We continue to build on our industry-leading CCS solutions to help customers reduce their current emissions and see EnLink as a key part of providing the most efficient CO2 transportation,"" said Dan Ammann, President of ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions. ""We've worked closely on CCS transportation solutions since our initial agreement in 2022 and look forward to continuing our collaboration with EnLink to help reduce carbon emissions across the Gulf Coast."" With its acquisition of Denbury, ExxonMobil is evaluating the most market-competitive CCS solutions across the Gulf Coast. During that evaluation, EnLink and ExxonMobil have agreed to reassess the Pecan Island Area project's near-term role, with the expectation that other joint opportunities may be prioritized ahead of the Pecan Island project.

Positive CVR Partners declared a cash distribution of $1.68 per common unit for Q4 2023. The company achieved a combined ammonia utilization rate of 100% for the full-year 2023. Net income for Q4 2023 was $10 million, with net sales of $142 million, compared to $95 million and $212 million in Q4 2022. EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $38 million, down from $122 million in Q4 2022. Full-year 2023 net income was $172 million on net sales of $681 million, compared to $287 million and $836 million in 2022. EBITDA for full-year 2023 was $281 million, down from $403 million in 2022. CVR Partners' average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia declined in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. The company's fertilizer facilities produced a combined 205,000 tons of ammonia in Q4 2023, with 306,000 tons of UAN. CVR Partners' average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia declined in full-year 2023 compared to 2022. The company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement on September 26, 2023, increasing the aggregate principal amount available under the ABL Credit Facility. The Board declared a Q4 2023 cash distribution of $1.68 per common unit. CVR Partners will host its Q4 and full-year 2023 Earnings Conference Call on February 21, 2024. Negative Net income and EBITDA declined in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia decreased in Q4 2023 and full-year 2023 compared to the previous year. The company's fertilizer facilities produced less ammonia in Q4 2023 and full-year 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022. EBITDA for full-year 2023 decreased from 2022. The average realized gate price for UAN and ammonia declined in full-year 2023 compared to 2022. Financial Analyst The disclosed financial results and cash distribution by CVR Partners, LP highlight several critical elements of their recent performance that are of interest to investors and market analysts. The reduction in net income from $95 million in Q4 2022 to $10 million in Q4 2023 is a significant decline, as is the drop in EBITDA from $122 million to $38 million for the same quarters. These figures suggest a substantial decrease in profitability year-over-year, which could be attributed to various factors such as price fluctuations for UAN and ammonia, operational costs, or changes in demand.Additionally, the increase in the credit facility and extension of its maturity date may indicate a strategic move to bolster liquidity and fund future operations or capital expenditures. However, it also raises the debt profile of the company, which could be a concern if not managed alongside a robust plan for revenue generation and cost control. The average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia show a marked decrease, which could reflect broader market trends or specific challenges faced by CVR Partners in the fertilizer industry. Such price reductions could impact margins and profitability if not offset by volume growth or cost reductions. Market Research Analyst The reported 100 percent ammonia utilization rate for 2023 indicates that CVR Partners is operating at full capacity, which is generally a positive sign of operational efficiency and could be a response to the strong demand for fall application ammonia. However, the effectiveness of this operational capacity must be weighed against the backdrop of declining prices for their key products. The market for nitrogen fertilizers, which include ammonia and UAN, is influenced by factors such as agricultural demand, input costs (natural gas, in particular) and international trade dynamics. The expectation of strong demand for the upcoming spring planting season may provide some optimism for revenue prospects, but it is essential to monitor how price trends and input costs will affect the bottom line.The declared cumulative cash distributions of $17.80 per common unit for 2023 reflect the company's commitment to returning value to unitholders. This figure is substantial and suggests that despite reduced profitability, the company is prioritizing shareholder returns. However, investors should consider the sustainability of such distributions, especially if profitability continues to be pressured. Economist From an economic perspective, the performance of CVR Partners can be seen as a microcosm of the broader agricultural inputs sector, which is sensitive to cyclical factors such as commodity prices, global supply and demand and macroeconomic conditions. The decline in gate prices for ammonia and UAN could be reflective of global oversupply, reduced demand, or both. It's also worth considering the impact of international events on the fertilizer market, as disruptions in supply chains or trade policies can lead to volatility in prices.The company's financial results must be contextualized within these broader economic trends to fully understand the potential trajectory going forward. The interplay between the agricultural sector's health, which drives fertilizer demand and the broader economic conditions will be critical in assessing the future performance of CVR Partners. Investors should watch for shifts in economic indicators that could signal changes in the demand for agricultural inputs. 02/20/2024 - 05:06 PM Declared a fourth quarter 2023 cash distribution of $1.68 per common unit, bringing the cumulative cash distributions declared for 2023 to $17.80 per common unit.Achieved a combined ammonia utilization rate of 100 percent for the full-year 2023.

The legislation as currently proposed includes changes in tax law which would be applied retroactively to the 2023 tax year. As currently written, certain provisions in H.R. 7024 would lower CVR Partners’ taxable income for 2023, compared to existing tax law. Barring any changes in tax law, CVR Partners’ K-1 tax packages, including all information to fiduciaries for common units owned in tax exempt accounts, could be made available online through https://www.taxpackagesupport.com/cvrpartners on or before March 8, 2024, and the mailing of the tax packages would be completed shortly thereafter. Should Congress and the Biden administration’s consideration of H.R. 7024 materially impact this timeline, we expect to issue a press release to update our investors on the timing of the availability of the K-1 tax packages.

These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below. The following are non-GAAP measures we present for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: EBITDA - Net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA adjusted for certain significant non-cash items and items that management believes are not attributable to or indicative of our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and trends. Available Cash for Distribution - EBITDA for the quarter excluding non-cash income or expense items (if any), for which adjustment is deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board in its sole discretion, less (i) reserves for maintenance capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and (ii) reserves for future operating or capital needs (if any), in each case, that the Board deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the Board. We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders, and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our GAAP results, including, but not limited to, our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the fertilizer industry, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods, and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document. Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results Major Scheduled Turnaround Activities Our results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future due to expenses incurred as part of planned turnarounds. We incurred turnaround expenses of $2 million and $33 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The next planned turnarounds are currently scheduled to take place in 2025 at the Coffeyville Facility and in 2026 at the East Dubuque Facility.

Utilization is an important measure used by management to assess operational output at each of the Partnership’s facilities. Utilization is calculated as actual tons produced divided by capacity. We present our utilization for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and take into account the impact of our current turnaround cycles on any specific period. Additionally, we present utilization solely on ammonia production rather than each nitrogen product as it provides a comparative baseline against industry peers and eliminates the disparity of plant configurations for upgrade of ammonia into other nitrogen products. With our efforts being primarily focused on ammonia upgrade capabilities, this measure provides a meaningful view of how well we operate.

Adjusted EBITDA reached $1.35 billion in 2023, representing a 5% growth over the prior year. Quarterly distribution raised by 6% and $250 million in common units repurchased in 2023. 2024 guidance includes adjusted EBITDA growth of 4% and FCFAD of $290 million. EnLink plans to repurchase at least $200 million in units in 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst EnLink Midstream's reported financial results indicate a solid operational performance, with a net income of $350 million for the full year and a 5% growth in adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year. The reported net cash provided by operations stands at $1.22 billion for the full year, which is a robust indicator of the company's cash-generating ability. The increase in distributions and the continuation of the unit repurchase program reflect a strong commitment to returning capital to unitholders, which is often well-received by the market and can be a positive driver for stock performance.However, the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.3x should be closely monitored. While it is within a reasonable range for the industry, it is crucial for the company to maintain a manageable debt level to sustain its growth and distribution strategies. The guidance for 2024 suggests a continued growth trajectory, albeit at a modest rate of 4%, which may be considered conservative by some investors. The projected increase in free cash flow after distributions is a positive sign, indicating potential for further capital returns or reinvestment in growth opportunities.From an investment perspective, the focus on high-return, capital-efficient projects and the expected segment profit growth in the Permian and Louisiana are promising. However, investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with the legacy contract resets and the divestiture of non-core assets, which could impact the financials. Overall, the company's financial health appears stable, supporting a positive outlook for its operational and financial performance. Market Research Analyst EnLink Midstream's strategic focus on its core segments, particularly the Permian and Louisiana, aligns with current industry trends of optimizing operations in key regions. The growth in natural gas and crude oil gathering volumes in the Permian is indicative of the strong drilling activity and the company's ability to capitalize on it. The launch of the North Texas carbon capture and sequestration project also positions EnLink at the forefront of emerging environmental initiatives, potentially opening new revenue streams and partnerships.The divestiture of non-core assets, such as the Ohio River Valley assets, suggests a strategic shift towards streamlining operations and focusing on high-growth areas. This could lead to improved operational efficiencies and cost savings in the long term. However, the expected decline in segment profit for Oklahoma and North Texas due to one-time rate resets on legacy contracts may raise concerns about the sustainability of profits in these segments.The energy midstream sector is highly competitive and sensitive to commodity price fluctuations, regulatory changes and macroeconomic factors. EnLink's performance must be evaluated in the context of these variables. Investors should consider the company's ability to adapt to changes and maintain its competitive edge in a dynamic market environment. Energy Sector Legal Expert The legal and regulatory environment for midstream energy companies like EnLink Midstream is complex, with implications for operational costs, compliance and strategic planning. The company's involvement in carbon capture and sequestration projects is particularly noteworthy, as these initiatives are increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and may benefit from government incentives aimed at reducing carbon emissions.Investors should be aware of the potential legal challenges and opportunities associated with environmental regulations. EnLink's proactive approach in this area could provide a competitive advantage and align with investor interest in environmentally responsible operations. Additionally, the company's management of its contractual obligations, as evidenced by the legacy contract resets, is crucial in maintaining financial stability and avoiding disputes that can lead to litigation or financial losses.It is also important to consider the legal aspects of asset divestitures and acquisitions, as these transactions can have significant tax implications and require careful navigation of antitrust laws. EnLink's successful divestiture of the Ohio River Valley assets suggests effective legal and financial due diligence, which is essential for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. 02/20/2024 - 05:03 PM DALLAS, Feb. 20, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EnLink Midstream, LLC (NYSE: ENLC) (EnLink) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 and provided 2024 financial guidance.

The company also highlights key financial figures, new transactions, executive appointments, and dividend declarations. Guidance for 2024 and a 5-year outlook are provided, with expectations of GEOs earned and portfolio growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd's announcement of record annual revenues and operating cash flows signifies a robust financial performance, with a notable increase from the previous year's figures. Despite the reported net loss due to non-cash impairment charges, the adjusted earnings per share show a positive trend, increasing from the prior year. This suggests operational efficiency and a strong underlying business model that could potentially reassure investors about the company's profitability and financial health.The company's strategic capital deployment in new transactions indicates an aggressive growth strategy, which could enhance future cash flows and diversify revenue sources. The focus on precious metals and Tier 1 mining jurisdictions may appeal to investors seeking exposure to stable geopolitical environments and commodities with historically resilient value.However, the guidance for 2024 indicates a potential decrease in gold equivalent ounces earned, which could imply a cautious outlook or operational challenges. Investors should consider the company's long-term growth prospects, as highlighted by the 5-year outlook, while also being aware of the inherent volatility in commodity markets and mining operations. Mining Industry Analyst The increase in gold equivalent ounces earned year-over-year reflects Osisko's ability to leverage its royalty and streaming agreements effectively. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as the silver and copper streams and various NSR royalties, position it to benefit from the production and success of its partners' mining projects without bearing the direct operational risks.The reference to Tier 1 mining jurisdictions in the CEO's commentary underscores Osisko's focus on politically stable and mining-friendly regions, which can mitigate geopolitical risks and ensure more predictable regulatory frameworks. This strategic positioning could be an attractive factor for investors concerned with the risks associated with mining investments in less stable regions.Osisko's asset base and organic growth outlook, as described by the CEO, suggests a strong pipeline of projects that could drive future performance. The mention of assets not included in the 5-year outlook due to unclear timelines highlights the potential for additional upside, although it also introduces an element of uncertainty regarding the timing and realization of these projects. Economist The financial results of Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd need to be contextualized within the broader economic environment, particularly the performance of gold and other precious metals. The demand for these commodities often correlates with economic cycles and investor sentiment towards safe-haven assets. The company's performance, therefore, could be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as inflation rates, currency fluctuations and global economic stability.The sale of equity investments and the reduction of credit facility balances reflect prudent financial management and a strengthened balance sheet. This could provide the company with greater financial flexibility to navigate economic uncertainties and capitalize on growth opportunities.Investors should also consider the impact of royalty and streaming companies on the broader mining sector. By providing capital to mining companies, firms like Osisko can facilitate the development of new projects and expansions, potentially leading to increased supply and economic activity in the sector. However, the cyclical nature of the industry means that these investments carry risks associated with commodity price fluctuations and operational execution. 02/20/2024 - 05:15 PM Record annual revenues of $247.3 million and record operating cash flows of $187.0 millionMONTRÉAL, Feb. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (the “Corporation” or “Osisko”) (OR: TSX & NYSE) is pleased to announce its consolidated financial results for the year-end 2023.

Subsequent to December 31, 2023 Additional repayments of $30.2 million on the revolving credit facility to a drawn balance of approximately $164.5 million;Declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per common share payable on April 15, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2024; andAnnouncement of Mr. David Smith joining the Corporation’s Board of Directors as an Independent Director. Guidance for 2024 and 5-Year Outlook 2024 Guidance3 Osisko expects GEOs earned to range between 82,000 to 92,000 in 2024 at an average cash margin of 97%. The 2024 guidance assumes the commencement of GEOs earned from the CSA Copper Stream from June 15, as well as the commencement of production from G Mining Ventures Corp.’s Tocantinzinho project and Cardinal Namdini Mining Limited’s project later in the year. Osisko’s 2024 guidance on royalty and stream interests is largely based on publicly available forecasts from our operating partners. When publicly available forecasts on properties are not available, Osisko obtains internal forecasts from the producers or uses management’s best estimate. 5-Year Outlook3 Osisko expects its portfolio to generate between 120,000 and 135,000 GEOs in 2028. The outlook assumes the commencement of production at The Windfall Mining Group’s Windfall and South32 Ltd’s Hermosa, amongst others. It also assumes that Capstone Copper Corp’s Mantos Blancos will have reached its nameplate capacity following the recent expansion of its activities, as well as increased production from certain other operators that have announced planned expansions, including Alamos Gold Inc.’s Phase 3+ Expansion at Island Gold. Beyond this growth profile, Osisko owns several other growth assets, which have not been factored in the 5-year outlook, as their timelines are either later, or less clear. As the operators provide further clarity on these assets, Osisko will seek to include them in its long-term outlook. This 5-year outlook is based on internal judgements of publicly available forecasts and other disclosures by the third-party owners and operators of the Corporation’s assets and could differ materially from actual results. When publicly available forecasts on properties are not available, Osisko obtains internal forecasts from the producers or uses management’s best estimate. This 5-year outlook replaces the 5-year outlook previously released in 2023, which should be considered withdrawn. Investors should not use this 5-year outlook to extrapolate forecast results to any year within the 5-year period (2024-2028). Management Commentary Jason Attew, President & CEO of Osisko commented: “2023 was a banner year for Osisko marked by new annual records achieved with respect to GEOs earned, revenues, cash flows and margins, in addition to the closing of several key transactions which will positively contribute to Osisko’s cash flow and GEOs earned. The Corporation is now well-positioned with a materially improved balance sheet, and also with having completed recent changes as it relates to both management and the Board. After working through a full portfolio review as it relates to Osisko’s growth trajectory and associated timelines, the Corporation’s 2024 guidance and updated 5-year outlook together provide what management believes to be achievable ranges. Concerning the 2024 guidance, it is worth noting that the lack of GEO deliveries resulting from the stoppage of operations at the Renard diamond mine will be partially offset by expected improvements at certain other operating assets within our portfolio, in addition to some new assets moving out of development and into production throughout the year. Furthermore, the Corporation’s expected growth trajectory over the next five years remains very much intact as mine expansions and new projects are completed by our partners between now and 2028. Osisko enters 2024 with a continued focus on simplifying its story to further re-establish itself as a ‘pure-play’ precious metals royalty and streaming company. We possess an unmatched asset base as defined by exposure to Tier 1 mining jurisdictions and this unique aspect of our portfolio, when combined with our robust organic growth outlook, results in the Corporation being well-positioned to deliver long-term value to our current and future shareholders.” Q4 AND YEAR-END 2023 RESULTS CONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST DETAILS Conference Call:Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 at 10:00 am ET Dial-in Numbers:(Option 1)North American Toll-Free: 1 (888) 886 7786Local and International: 1 (416) 764 8658Conference ID: 57708068 Webcast link:(Option 2)https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1650912&tp_key=a14693e644 Replay (available until Thursday, March 21st at 11:59 PM ET):North American Toll-Free: 1 (877) 674 7070Local and International: 1 (416) 764 8692Playback Passcode: 708068# Replay is also available on our website at www.osiskogr.com Qualified Person The scientific and technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Guy Desharnais, Ph.D., P.Geo., Vice President, Project Evaluation at Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd, who is a “qualified person” as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”).

(3) For the 2024 guidance, deliveries of silver, copper, and cash royalties have been converted to GEOs using commodity prices based on consensus prices and a gold/silver price ratio of 83:1. The commodity price assumptions that were used in the 5-year outlook are based on current long-term consensus and a gold/silver price ratio of 76:1. (4) Non-IFRS Measures The Corporation has included certain performance measures in this press release and in the annual Management and Discussion Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS Accounting Standards including (i) cash margin (in dollars and in percentage of revenues), (ii) adjusted earnings and (iii) adjusted earnings per basic share. The presentation of these non-IFRS measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS Accounting Standards. As Osisko’s operations are primarily focused on precious metals, the Corporation presents cash margins and adjusted earnings as it believes that certain investors use this information, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, to evaluate the Corporation’s performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. However, other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently. In 2023, the following changes were made to the composition of adjusted earnings: (i)total gains and losses on investments on the statement of income (loss) are now excluded from net earnings (loss) from continuing operations; prior to this change, only the unrealized gains and losses on investments were excluded from net earnings (loss) from continuing operations; (ii)total foreign exchange gains and losses on the statement of income (loss) are now excluded from net earnings (loss) from continuing operations; prior to this change, only the foreign exchange gains and losses adjustments from operation activities on the statement of cash flows were excluded from net earnings (loss) from continuing operations; (iii)the tax impact of all adjustments in the calculation of adjusted earnings is now considered; prior to this change, the total deferred income taxes on the statement of earnings (loss) was excluded from net earnings (loss) from continuing operations. These changes in the manner in which the Corporation calculates adjusted earnings were made to align the calculations with its peers and facilitate the comparison with these companies. These changes also affect indirectly adjusted earnings per basic share, because they are calculated from adjusted earnings. Comparative figures for 2022 have been restated to reflect the current composition of adjusted earnings. Cash Margin (in dollars and in percentage of revenues) Cash margin (in dollars) represents revenues less cost of sales (excluding depletion). Cash margin (in percentage of revenues) represents the cash margin (in dollars) divided by revenues.

Outlined corporate and other financial information, including income tax expenses and renewable diesel production. Discussed cash, debt, and dividend details, including the issuance of $600 million in Senior Notes and the redemption of 2025 Notes. Announced a fourth quarter 2023 cash dividend of 50 cents per share for CVR Energy and a cash distribution of $1.68 per common unit for CVR Partners. Negative Decrease in net income and EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Decline in average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 compared to 2022. Unfavorable inventory valuation impacts and decline in refining margin for the Petroleum Segment in the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating income decrease for the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023 compared to 2022. Increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 2022. Financial Analyst The reported full-year net income and EBITDA for CVR Energy indicate a significant increase in profitability compared to the previous year. This performance, coupled with a robust dividend payout, reflects a strong free cash flow generation, which is a key metric for investors assessing the health and sustainability of a company's dividend policy. The payout ratio of 64 percent of free cash flow is within a reasonable range, suggesting a balance between rewarding shareholders and retaining earnings for future growth.However, the decrease in net income and EBITDA in the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period in the previous year, might raise concerns about potential headwinds or operational challenges. The reduced refining margins due to a tighter distillate crack spread and unfavorable inventory valuations are noteworthy, as they could signal industry-wide pricing pressures or inventory management issues that may persist into future quarters. Market Research Analyst The strategic focus on high utilization of assets and improved capture rates, as noted by the CEO, is indicative of CVR Energy's operational efficiency. The record production of premium gasoline and crude oil gathering volumes suggests a competitive edge in product differentiation and supply chain optimization. These factors are likely to contribute positively to the company's market position and investor confidence.Additionally, the nitrogen fertilizer segment's performance, with strong production rates and elevated prices, highlights the demand dynamics in the agricultural sector. While the decrease in average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia could be a concern for future revenue streams, the overall strong performance in this segment underscores the diversification of CVR Energy's portfolio, which could mitigate risks associated with volatility in the petroleum market. Energy Sector Analyst The reported increase in renewable diesel production at the Wynnewood refinery is an important development, reflecting the company's strategic investments in renewable energy sources. This diversification into renewable diesel aligns with industry trends towards cleaner energy solutions and may provide a hedge against regulatory risks associated with traditional fossil fuels.The issuance of the 8.50% Senior Notes due 2029 and the subsequent redemption of the 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 illustrate active debt management. The higher interest rate on the new notes, however, will increase the interest burden, which investors should monitor for its impact on future net income. The proactive approach to managing long-term debt obligations is a positive sign of financial stewardship, but it is essential to assess whether the refinancing will lead to cost savings over the longer term. 02/20/2024 - 05:06 PM Reported full-year 2023 net income attributable to CVR Energy stockholders of $769 million and EBITDA of $1.4 billion.

Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2023 was $1.2 billion, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion for full-year 2022. “CVR Energy reported record EBITDA for 2023 driven by high utilization of our assets, improved capture rates, record premium gasoline production, record crude oil gathering volumes and our continued peer-leading distillate yield,” said Dave Lamp, CVR Energy’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are pleased that our results for the year enabled our Board of Directors to authorize regular and special dividends for 2023 totaling $4.50 per share, representing a payout ratio of 64 percent of free cash flow generation for the year. “CVR Partners also had a strong 2023, achieving a combined ammonia production rate of 100 percent and setting multiple production records at both facilities,” Lamp said. “Nitrogen fertilizer prices remained elevated throughout the year, supporting declared distributions to unitholders for 2023 of $17.80 per common unit.” Petroleum Segment Fourth Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 The Petroleum Segment reported fourth quarter 2023 operating income of $144 million, on net sales of $2.0 billion, compared to fourth quarter 2022 operating income of $155 million, on net sales of $2.4 billion. Fourth quarter 2023 combined total throughput was approximately 223,000 barrels per day (“bpd”), compared to approximately 221,000 bpd of combined total throughput for the fourth quarter 2022. Refining margin was $307 million, or $15.01 per total throughput barrel, in the fourth quarter 2023, compared to $348 million, or $17.14 per total throughput barrel, during the same period in 2022. The primary factors contributing to the $41 million decrease in refining margin were: A decrease in the Group 3 2-1-1 crack spread of $13.76 per barrel, driven by a tightening distillate crack spread primarily due to strong utilization of the U.S. refining fleet during the winter and slowing demand trends;Unfavorable inventory valuation impacts of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to unfavorable inventory valuation impacts of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to decreased crude oil prices in the current period;Favorable derivative impacts of $78 million from gains on open crack spread swap positions in the current period and wider margins on Canadian crude oil forward purchases and sales compared to the prior period; andA decline in Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) related expense of $134 million, which includes a reduction in RINs revaluation impact of $83 million. Full-Year 2023 Compared to Full-Year 2022 Full-year 2023 operating income was $982 million, on net sales of $8.3 billion, compared to full-year 2022 operating income of $719 million, on net sales of $9.9 billion. Combined total throughput for full-year 2023 was approximately 208,000 bpd, compared to approximately 205,000 bpd for full-year 2022. Refining margin was $1.7 billion, or $21.82 per total throughput barrel, for full-year 2023, compared to $1.4 billion, or $19.09 per total throughput barrel, for full-year 2022. The primary factors contributing to the $227 million increase in refining margin were: A decline in RFS-related expense of $483 million, which includes a reduction in RINs revaluation impact of $419 million;Favorable derivative impacts of $61 million from gains on open crack spread swap positions in the current period and wider margins on Canadian crude oil forward purchases and sales compared to the prior period;A decrease in the Group 3 2-1-1 crack spread of $5.91 per barrel, driven by a tightening distillate crack spread primarily due to strong utilization of the U.S. refining fleet during the winter and slowing demand trends; andUnfavorable inventory valuation impacts of $32 million in 2023 compared to favorable inventory valuation impacts of $22 million in 2022, primarily due to decreased crude oil prices in the current period. Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment Fourth Quarter 2023 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2022 The Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment reported operating income of $17 million on net sales of $142 million for the fourth quarter 2023, compared to operating income of $102 million on net sales of $212 million for the fourth quarter 2022. CVR Partners’ fertilizer facilities produced a combined 205,000 tons of ammonia during the fourth quarter 2023, of which 75,000 net tons were available for sale, while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 306,000 tons of urea ammonia nitrate (“UAN”). During the fourth quarter 2022, the fertilizer facilities produced 210,000 tons of ammonia, of which 75,000 net tons were available for sale, while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 308,000 tons of UAN. Fourth quarter 2023 average realized gate prices for UAN declined by 47 percent to $241 per ton and ammonia declined by 52 percent to $461 per ton when compared to the fourth quarter 2022. Average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $455 per ton and $967 per ton, respectively, for the fourth quarter 2022. Full-Year 2023 Compared to Full-Year 2022 Full-year 2023 operating income was $201 million on net sales of $681 million, compared to operating income of $320 million on net sales of $836 million for full-year 2022. For full-year 2023, our fertilizer facilities produced a combined 864,000 tons of ammonia, of which 270,000 net tons were available for sale, while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 1,369,000 tons of UAN. For full-year 2022, the fertilizer facilities produced 703,000 tons of ammonia, of which 213,000 net tons were available for sale, while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 1,140,000 tons of UAN. The average realized gate prices for full-year 2023 for UAN declined by 36 percent to $309 per ton and ammonia declined by 44 percent to $573 per ton when compared to the full-year 2022. Average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $486 per ton and $1,024 per ton, respectively, for full-year 2022. Corporate and Other The Company reported income tax expense of $207 million, or 19.1 percent of income before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to an income tax expense of $157 million, or 19.6 percent of income before income taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in income tax expense was due primarily to an increase in overall pretax earnings, partially offset by decreases in state tax rates and an increase in tax credits and incentives generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, the change in the effective tax rate was due primarily to changes in pretax earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, decreases in state tax rates and an increase in tax credits and incentives generated for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The renewable diesel unit at the Wynnewood refinery continued to increase production, with total vegetable oil throughputs for the year ended December 31, 2023 of approximately 82.5 million gallons, up from 42.5 million gallons for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the renewable diesel unit being fully operational for all of 2023 compared to the prior year when the unit was only operational for a portion of the year after being completed in April 2022. Cash, Debt and Dividend Consolidated cash and cash equivalents was $581 million at December 31, 2023. Consolidated total debt and finance lease obligations was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023, including $547 million held by the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment. On December 21, 2023, CVR Energy completed the issuance of $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes mature on January 15, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or purchased. The 2029 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by the wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Energy, with the exception of CVR Partners and its subsidiaries and certain immaterial wholly-owned subsidiaries of CVR Energy. The net proceeds of the offering were reserved to fund the redemption of CVR Energy’s 5.25% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). On February 15, 2024, CVR Energy redeemed all of the outstanding 2025 Notes, at par, and settled accrued interest of approximately $16 million through the date of redemption. As a result of this transaction, the Company will recognize a $1 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the first quarter of 2024, which consists of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. CVR Energy announced a fourth quarter 2023 cash dividend of 50 cents per share. The quarterly dividend, as declared by CVR Energy’s Board of Directors, will be paid on March 11, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 4, 2024. CVR Partners announced that the Board of Directors of its general partner declared a fourth quarter 2023 cash distribution of $1.68 per common unit, which will be paid on March 11, 2024, to common unitholders of record as of March 4, 2024.

These non-GAAP financial measures are important factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the performance and liquidity measures defined below. The following are non-GAAP measures we present for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: EBITDA - Consolidated net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit) and (iii) depreciation and amortization expense. Petroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA - Segment net income (loss) before segment (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Refining Margin - The difference between our Petroleum Segment net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining Margin, adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts - Refining Margin adjusted to exclude the impact of current period market price and volume fluctuations on crude oil and refined product inventories purchased in prior periods and lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments, if applicable. We record our commodity inventories on the first-in-first-out basis. As a result, significant current period fluctuations in market prices and the volumes we hold in inventory can have favorable or unfavorable impacts on our refining margins as compared to similar metrics used by other publicly-traded companies in the refining industry. Refining Margin and Refining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts, per Throughput Barrel - Refining Margin and Refining Margin adjusted for Inventory Valuation Impacts divided by the total throughput barrels during the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period. Direct Operating Expenses per Throughput Barrel - Direct operating expenses for our Petroleum Segment divided by total throughput barrels for the period, which is calculated as total throughput barrels per day times the number of days in the period. Adjusted EBITDA, Petroleum Adjusted EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer Adjusted EBITDA - EBITDA, Petroleum EBITDA and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA adjusted for certain significant non-cash items and items that management believes are not attributable to or indicative of our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and trends. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share - Earnings (loss) per share adjusted for certain significant non-cash items and items that management believes are not attributable to or indicative of our on-going operations or that may obscure our underlying results and trends. Free Cash Flow - Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and capitalized turnaround expenditures. We present these measures because we believe they may help investors, analysts, lenders and ratings agencies analyze our results of operations and liquidity in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, including but not limited to our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded companies in the refining and fertilizer industries, without regard to historical cost basis or financing methods and our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Non-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” included herein for reconciliation of these amounts. Due to rounding, numbers presented within this section may not add or equal to numbers or totals presented elsewhere within this document. Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Financial Results Petroleum Segment Our results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future due to capitalized expenditures as part of planned turnarounds. Total capitalized expenditures were $60 million and $81 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The next planned turnarounds are currently scheduled to take place in the spring of 2024 at the Wynnewood Refinery at an estimated cost of $44 million and in 2025 at the Coffeyville Refinery. Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment Our results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future due to expenses incurred as part of planned turnarounds. We incurred turnaround expenses of $2 million and $33 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The next planned turnarounds are currently scheduled to take place in 2025 at the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility and in 2026 at the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility.

Changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable inventory valuation impact when crude oil prices decrease. The inventory valuation impact is calculated based upon inventory values at the beginning of the accounting period and at the end of the accounting period. In order to derive the inventory valuation impact per total throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for the inventory valuation impact and divide by the number of total throughput barrels for the period.

Negative Park Holidays business and associated goodwill impairment led to a non-cash goodwill impairment of $369.9 million in 2023. The company incurred a net loss of $213.3 million for the full year 2023, compared to net income of $242.0 million in 2022. The company's UK note receivable was further collateralized, resulting in an unfavorable adjustment of $102.9 million. The sale of operating communities in Florida and Arizona is expected to result in a total estimated gain of approximately $7.0 million. Financial Analyst An analysis of Sun Communities, Inc.'s financial results reveals a mixed performance. The increase in total revenue by 7.8% for the quarter and 8.6% for the full year indicates a growing top-line, which is typically a positive sign for investors. However, the reported net loss per diluted share of $0.65 for the quarter and $1.72 for the full year compared to net income in the previous year raises concerns about the company's profitability. The transition from a net income position to a net loss could reflect underlying challenges in operations or one-time charges that have impacted the bottom line.Core FFO (Funds from Operations) per Share figures are critical in evaluating REIT performance, as they exclude the effects of depreciation and amortization, providing a clearer picture of operating performance. The reported Core FFO of $1.34 and $7.10 per Share for the quarter and full year, respectively, suggests a stable income stream from the company's operations. The increase in Same Property NOI (Net Operating Income) by 9.6% for the quarter and 7.3% for the year is a robust indicator of operational efficiency and the ability to grow income from existing properties.The company's guidance for 2024, with expected Total Same Property NOI Growth of 4.8% - 6.0% and Core FFO per Share of $7.04 to $7.24, provides a forward-looking perspective, which is essential for investors to assess future performance. The planned increase in annual distribution by 1.1% signals confidence in the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to support higher payouts to shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the strategic actions taken by Sun Communities, including the sale of assets and debt restructuring, are noteworthy. The sale of the Ingenia Communities Group share position and the simplification of the Sun NG structure could be interpreted as a move to streamline operations and focus on core assets. This may be appealing to investors who prefer companies with a clear strategic direction.The reported occupancy gains in manufactured housing (MH) and recreational vehicle (RV) sites, along with the conversion of transient to annual RV sites, demonstrate the company's ability to capitalize on market demand. This is particularly relevant in the context of the limited supply of such properties, which can drive rental rates and occupancy levels higher. The expansion of existing communities and the acquisition of a land parcel for MH development suggest a proactive approach to growth, potentially leading to increased revenue streams in the future.However, the goodwill impairment related to the Park Holidays business and the restatement of interim financial statements raise questions about internal controls and valuation processes. This could potentially impact investor confidence and warrants close monitoring. The UK real estate assets' administration process and subsequent credit bid acquisition indicate a complex situation that may have both risks and opportunities for the company. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst For investors in REITs, the reported net debt to trailing twelve-month Recurring EBITDA ratio of 6.1 times is an important leverage metric. While this ratio provides an indication of the company's debt levels in relation to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, it is higher than the industry average of around 5 to 6 times for REITs. This could suggest a higher risk profile from a debt standpoint.The issuance of new mortgage term loans at a fixed interest rate of 6.49% reflects the current interest rate environment and the company's efforts to manage interest rate risk. The use of proceeds from various transactions to pay down the senior credit facility is a strategic move to reduce floating-rate debt, which is beneficial in a rising interest rate environment.Overall, the financial and operational strategies implemented by Sun Communities, including occupancy improvements, portfolio optimization and debt management, are critical for maintaining stability and growth potential in the REIT sector. However, the goodwill impairment and the need to restate interim financial statements are areas of concern that require further scrutiny. 02/20/2024 - 05:22 PM Total Revenue Increased 7.8% and 8.6% for the Quarter and Full Year Net Loss per Diluted Share of $0.65 and $1.72 for the Quarter and Full Year Core FFO per Share of $1.34 and $7.10 for the Quarter and Full Year Total Same Property NOI Increased by 9.6% and 7.3% for the Quarter and Full Year Same Property Adjusted Occupancy for MH and RV Increased by 230 Basis Points, Year-over-Year Revenue Producing Site Gains of 3,268 for the Year, Including 2,111 Transient-to-Annual RV Site Conversions Establishing Guidance for 2024 Expecting Total Same Property NOI Growth of 4.8% - 6.0% Expecting Core FFO per Share of $7.04 to $7.24 Increasing Annual Distribution by 1.1% in 2024, to $3.76 per share Southfield, MI, Feb. 20, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sun Communities, Inc.

The proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under the Company's senior credit facility. Simplified the structure of certain of its consolidated variable interest entities, Sun NG Whitewater RV Resorts LLC, Sun NG Beaver Brook LLC, Sun NG RV Resorts and four standalone affiliates (collectively ""Sun NG"") in a transaction with the Company's joint venture partner in Sun NG: Sold the Company's majority equity interests in three properties for proceeds of $166.1 million, which resulted in a gain on disposition of $13.2 million;Acquired all of the joint venture partner's noncontrolling equity interests in 14 properties and a significant portion of the noncontrolling equity interests in five stand-alone joint venture properties, for $149.5 million; andSettled a total of $39.2 million of preferred equity interests, including $35.2 million of mandatorily redeemable equity interests classified as Unsecured debt, and issued Series L preferred OP units valued at $2.0 million. Sold its investment in Rezplot Systems LLC (""Rezplot""), a nonconsolidated affiliate. Rezplot is an RV reservation software technology company operating under the Campspot brand. Total proceeds of $27.5 million included the settlement of notes receivable from Rezplot with a recorded balance of $12.2 million and resulted in a gain on sale of $15.3 million. Subsequent to the quarter, the Company: Issued $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes with an interest rate of 5.5% and a five-year term, due January 15, 2029, and received net proceeds of $495.4 million, after deducting underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The majority of the net proceeds were used to pay down borrowings outstanding under the Company's senior credit facility, reducing its floating-rate debt to total debt to approximately 10%.Reached an agreement to sell two operating communities located in Florida and Arizona with 533 aggregated developed sites for total cash consideration of approximately $53.0 million. The sale is expected to close during the quarter ending March 31, 2024, with a total estimated gain of approximately $7.0 million. UK Note Receivable As previously announced, the Company completed an administration process related to three real estate assets that collateralized the majority of a note receivable extended to Royale Holdings Group HoldCo Limited (""Royale Life""). On December 28, 2023, the Company acquired the assets through a credit bid, a potential outcome that management had previously discussed. During the quarter, the Company engaged third party valuation specialists to appraise the assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 – Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and recognized such assets at fair value totaling $263.8 million, as Investment Property on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. There was no resulting remeasurement adjustment. The Company also previously announced that the note receivable was further collateralized by a first priority security interest in three MH manufacturers in the UK and that it was continuing to work through courses of action in connection with such collateral. These assets were remeasured during the fourth quarter which resulted in an unfavorable adjustment of $102.9 million. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed a receivership process related to the manufacturers. The receivers sold such assets for total consideration of $10.7 million, resulting in cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $7.0 million, net of non-cash consideration and fees. The sale of these assets resulted in an incremental fair value remeasurement adjustment of $0.8 million. Sandy Bay Update As previously disclosed, the Company had agreed to sell Sandy Bay, an MH operating community in the UK. The property had been classified as held for sale on its Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the asset was reclassified as held for use and the Company is now operating the property. Park Holidays Goodwill Impairment During year end audit procedures, the Company reviewed controls relating to the valuation of its Park Holidays business and associated goodwill. In connection with the review, the Company concluded that changes in certain triggering factors relevant to the valuation of the Park Holidays business, including financial projections and increased interest rates, should have been taken into account when preparing the Company’s interim financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023, and September 30, 2023. The total non-cash goodwill impairment recognized during 2023 was $369.9 million. The Company intends to restate such interim financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 2024 Distributions The Company's Board of Directors has approved setting the 2024 annual distribution rate at $3.76 per common share and unit, an increase of $0.04, or 1.1%, over the current annual dividend rate of $3.72 per common share and unit for 2023. This increase will begin with the first quarter distribution to be paid in April 2024. While the Board of Directors has adopted the new annual distribution policy, the amount of each quarterly distribution on the Company's common stock will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors. New Directors On February 15, 2024, the Company added Jerry Ehlinger and Craig A. Leupold to its Board of Directors as independent directors. Mr. Ehlinger and Mr. Leupold bring new and thoughtful real estate industry perspectives to the Company. 2024 GUIDANCE The Company is establishing full year and first quarter 2024 guidance for diluted EPS and Core FFO per Share as follows: First Quarter Ending March 31, 2024 Full Year Ending December 31, 2024 Low High Low HighDiluted EPS $ (0.08) $ (0.03) $ 2.08 $ 2.28 Depreciation and amortization 1.32 1.32 5.35 5.35 Gain on sale of assets (0.05) (0.05) (0.30) (0.30)Distributions on preferred OP units 0.02 0.02 0.10 0.10 Noncontrolling interest — — 0.10 0.10 Transaction costs and other non-recurring G&A expenses 0.02 0.02 0.07 0.07 Deferred tax benefit (0.02) (0.02) (0.18) (0.18)Difference in weighted average share count attributed to dilutive convertible securities — — (0.11) (0.11)Other adjustments(b) (0.07) (0.07) (0.07) (0.07)Core FFO(c) per Share $ 1.14 $ 1.19 $ 7.04 $ 7.24 (a) The diluted share counts for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 and the year ending December 31, 2024 are 129.7 million and 129.8 million, respectively.

Other lot modification expenditures include land improvements added to annual RV sites to aid in the conversion of transient RV guests to annual contracts. See page 12 for move-out rates.Growth Projects - Growth projects consist of revenue-generating or expense-reducing activities at the properties.

The Company believes that NOI, EBITDA and FFO are appropriate measures given their wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts. Additionally, NOI, EBITDA and FFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples, yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value. NOI provides a measure of rental operations that does not factor in depreciation, amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses. EBITDA provides a further measure to evaluate ability to incur and service debt; EBITDA also provides further measures to evaluate the Company's ability to fund dividends and other cash needs. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. Net Operating Income (""NOI"") Total Portfolio NOI - The Company calculates NOI by subtracting property operating expenses and real estate taxes from operating property revenues. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company believes is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. The Company uses NOI as a key measure when evaluating performance and growth of particular properties and / or groups of properties. The principal limitation of NOI is that it excludes depreciation, amortization, interest expense and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses, all of which are significant costs. Therefore, NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the properties of the Company rather than of the Company overall. The Company believes that NOI provides enhanced comparability for investor evaluation of properties performance and growth over time. The Company believes that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to NOI. NOI should not be considered to be an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of the Company's financial performance or GAAP cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity; nor is it indicative of funds available for the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Because of the inclusion of items such as interest, depreciation and amortization, the use of GAAP net income (loss) as a performance measure is limited as these items may not accurately reflect the actual change in market value of a property, in the case of depreciation and in the case of interest, may not necessarily be linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset, as it is often incurred at a parent company level and not at a property level. Same Property NOI - This is a key management tool used when evaluating performance and growth of the Company's Same Property portfolio. The Company believes that Same Property NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental comparative performance measure of the income generated from the Same property portfolio from one period to the next. Same Property NOI does not include the revenues and expenses related to home sales, service, retail, dining and entertainment activities at the properties. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") EBITDAre - NAREIT refers to EBITDA as ""EBITDAre"" and calculates it as GAAP net income (loss), plus interest expense, plus income tax expense, plus depreciation and amortization, plus or minus losses or gains on the disposition of depreciated property (including losses or gains on change of control), plus impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in nonconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDAre of nonconsolidated affiliates. EBITDAre is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company uses to evaluate its ability to incur and service debt, fund dividends and other cash needs and cover fixed costs. Investors utilize EBITDAre as a supplemental measure to evaluate and compare investment quality and enterprise value of REITs. Investors utilize EBITDAre as a supplemental measure to evaluate and compare investment quality and enterprise value of REITs.Recurring EBITDA - The Company also uses EBITDAre excluding certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to measurement of the Company's performance on a basis that is independent of capital structure (""Recurring EBITDA""). The Company believes that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to EBITDAre. EBITDAre is not intended to be used as a measure of the Company's cash generated by operations or its dividend-paying capacity, and should therefore not replace GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of the Company's financial performance or GAAP cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as measures of liquidity. Funds from Operations (""FFO"") FFO - NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income (loss), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, real estate related impairments, and after adjustments for nonconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is a useful supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance. By excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, real estate related impairment and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared period-over-period, reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not readily apparent from GAAP net income (loss). Management believes the use of FFO has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and making comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful.Core FFO - In addition to FFO, the Company uses FFO excluding certain gain and loss items that management considers unrelated to the operational and financial performance of the Company's core business (""Core FFO""). The Company believes that Core FFO provides enhanced comparability for investor evaluations of period-over-period results. The Company believes that GAAP net income (loss) is the most directly comparable measure to FFO. The principal limitation of FFO is that it does not replace GAAP net income (loss) as a financial performance measure or GAAP cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. Because FFO excludes significant economic components of GAAP net income (loss) including depreciation and amortization, FFO should be used as a supplement to GAAP net income (loss) and not as an alternative to it. Furthermore, FFO is not intended as a measure of a REIT's ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements, nor as a measure of working capital. FFO is calculated in accordance with the Company's interpretation of standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that interpret the NAREIT definition differently.
