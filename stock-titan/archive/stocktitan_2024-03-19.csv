(“JFrog”) (NASDAQ: FROG), the Liquid Software company and creators of the JFrog Software Supply Chain Platform, today released the findings of its annual Software Supply Chain State of the Union report 2024, which identifies emerging development trends, risks and best practices for securing enterprise software supply chains. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240319775900/en/JFrog Software Supply Chain State of the Union Report 2024 (Graphic: JFrog) “DevSecOps teams worldwide are navigating a volatile field of software security, where innovation frequently meets demand in an age of rapid AI adoption,” said Yoav Landman, CTO and Co-Founder, JFrog. “Our data provides security and development organizations with a comprehensive snapshot of the rapidly evolving software ecosystem, including notable CVE scoring errors, perspectives on the security implications of using GenAI to code, the most risky packages to allow your organization to use for development, and more, so they can make more informed decisions.” Key Findings JFrog’s Software Supply Chain State of the Union report combines JFrog Artifactory developer usage data amongst 7K+ organizations, original CVE analysis by the JFrog Security Research team, and commissioned third-party survey data of 1,200 technology professionals worldwide to provide context into the broad, rapidly evolving software supply chain landscape. Key findings include: Not all CVEs are what they seem — Traditional CVSS ratings look purely at the severity of the exploit as opposed to the likelihood it will be exploited, which requires context to make an effective assessment. The JFrog Security Research team downgraded the severity of 85% of Critical CVEs and 73% of High CVEs on average after analyzing 212 different high-profile CVEs discovered in 2023. Additionally, JFrog found that 74% of the reported common CVEs with High and Critical CVSS scores on the top 100 Docker Hub community images weren’t exploitable. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks reign — Of the 212 high-profile CVEs analyzed by the JFrog Security Research team, 44% of them held the potential for a DoS attack vs. 17% with the potential to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is good news for security organizations in the sense that RCE has a far more detrimental impact vs. DoS attacks due to their ability to offer full access to backend systems. Security taking a toll on productivity — Forty percent of survey respondents said it typically takes a week or longer to get approval to use a new package/library, extending time to market for new apps and software updates. Additionally, approximately 25% of security teams’ time is spent remediating vulnerabilities, even when those vulnerabilities may be overrated or even non-exploitable given their current context. Applying security checks is inconsistent across the software development lifecycle (SLDC) — The industry seems to be split pretty evenly down the middle when it comes to deciding where to apply application security testing across the software development lifecycle, underscoring the importance of shifting left and right simultaneously. Forty-two percent of developers claim it’s best to perform security scans during code writing while 41% say it’s best to perform scans on new software packages before bringing them into your organization from an Open-Source Software (OSS) repository. Security tool sprawl continues — Nearly half of IT professionals (47%) say they use between four and nine application security solutions. However, a third of survey respondents and security professionals (33%) say they’re using 10 or more application security solutions. This supports a market-wide trend of needing security tooling consolidation with a movement away from point solutions. Disproportionate use of AI/ML tools for security — While 90% of survey respondents indicate their organization currently uses AI/ML-powered tools in some capacity to assist in security scanning and remediation efforts, only one in three professionals (32%) claim their organization uses AI/ML-powered tools to write code, indicating the majority are still wary of the potential vulnerabilities GenAI-developed code can introduce to enterprise software. “Vulnerabilities are growing in number year over year, but that does not necessarily mean they are growing in severity. It’s clear that IT teams are willing to invest in new tools to bolster their security, but knowing where to put those tools, use their team’s time, and streamline processes is critical to keeping their SDLC secure,” said Shachar Menashe, Sr. Director, JFrog Security Research. “We designed this report to go beyond trend analysis, providing both counsel and clarity on the technology business leaders use to make decisions, whether it’s on AI navigation, malicious code, or security solutions.” For deeper insights from the JFrog Software Supply Chain State of the Union 2024 download the full report.

SolGold holds a 100% interest in the Project through its Ecuadorian subsidiary, Carnegie Ridge Resources S.A.Exploration identified a significant porphyry target at El Cielto Norte covering approximately 2.5 x 2.5 km and is greater in extent than the Alpala system to the south at the Cascabel ProjectAt Florida, new assays from channel samples of gold-bearing epithermal quartz vein outcrops with up to 6.15m true thickness, returned results of 6.15m @ 7.46 g/t Au, including 2.2m @ 21.1 g/t AuAdvancing new target areas towards drill-ready statusPotential for future integration of Blanca-Nieves with the Tier 1 Cascabel Project, due to the proximity of approximately 8 kmSantiago Vaca, SolGold's Chief Geologist, commented:""Our team is excited about the overall prospect of the Blanca-Nieves Project, including the potential for future integration with the Cascabel Project. The district scale opportunity reinforces our view that mining has the potential to be a significant, multi-generational sector in Ecuador.""Further InformationThe Blanca-Nieves Project is situated approximately 8 km north of the Company's Tier 1 Cascabel Project in northern Ecuador, which holds 3.7 Bt of ore, 12.4 Mt of copper and 31.3 Moz of gold in the measured plus indicated category, and 854 Mt of ore, 2.0 Mt of copper and 5.3 Moz of gold in the inferred category. The Cascabel Project is the largest undeveloped copper-gold resource in South America and one of the largest in the world; with its recently published pre-feasibility study indicating an initial capex of $1.55B and the initial block cave yielding a peak annual production of 216 kt of copper, 734 koz of gold and 1.16 Moz of silver. The Project is situated in the Northern Andean Copper-Gold Belt, a region that promises to deliver a significant proportion of the copper and gold necessary to meet the growing global demand over the coming decades.High-grade ""bonanza-style"" gold and silver mineralisation with visible gold has been discovered outcropping at numerous locations within the Blanca-Nieves Project area. This includes the previously reported presence of epithermal quartz veins with over 100 g/t gold grades at Cielito and Florida. The ongoing exploration efforts at the Blanca-Nieves epithermal gold-silver vein field continue to demonstrate significant potential for complex high-grade epithermal vein systems, and recent work has also identified the potential for a parent mineralised porphyry body beneath the outcropping gold system.SolGold is advancing new target areas towards drill-ready status as exploration continues with both epithermal vein and porphyry gold-copper as objectives. SolGold intends ultimately to extend the definition of the gold-bearing epithermal veins at Cielito and Quiroz beyond the range of previous historical artisanal mining and drilling to date and to extend the size of the discovery at Florida, further demonstrating the Company's commitment to realising the full potential of the Blanca-Nieves Project with a view to integration with Cascabel.Recent and historic exploration at the Blanca-Nieves Project, immediately north of the Company's Cascabel Project, has identified a widespread epithermal gold and silver precious metal field which covers more than 80 square kilometres.New assays of channel samples from gold-bearing epithermal quartz vein outcrops, with up to 6.15m true thickness, returned 6.15m @ 7.46 g/t Au at Florida, including 2.2m @ 21.1 g/t Au ( Figure 1 ). A significant thickening of quartz veins is observed along with an increase in clay alteration at Florida, and more recent fieldwork has identified a significant porphyry target at El Cielito Norte, immediately west of Florida.El Cielito Norte lies central to peripheral high-grade gold-silver and base metal vein occurrences at Cielito, Florida, Quiroz and Las Chorreras. The El Cielito Norte porphyry target is characterised by a central magnetic high anomaly, surrounded by an annular magnetic low, typical of the inner potassic and outer hydrothermal alteration zones observed in many large porphyry deposits around the globe ( Figure 2 ).High-grade quartz-gold-silver epithermal vein systems at Cielito, Florida, Quiroz, and Las Chorreras occur peripheral to the El Cielito Norte porphyry target defined by a central diorite porphyry intrusion coincident with a kilometre scale RTP magnetic high with annular magnetic low. Zones of argillic clay alteration lie coincident with the magnetic low ( Figure 2 ).Additional porphyry-style magnetic signatures are evident, overlapping on the northern edge of the main anomaly ( Figure 2 ).The porphyry target alteration footprint at El Cielito Norte covers approximately 2.5 x 2.5 km and is greater in extent than the Alpala system to the south.Ongoing surface rock chip float and channel and soil sampling programs are in preparation to map extensions of this exciting discovery and outline drill targets.Figure 1 : High-grade quartz-gold-silver epithermal vein systems at Cielito, Florida, Quiroz, and Las Chorreras are peripheral to the El Cielito Norte porphyry target which is defined by a central diorite porphyry intrusion coincident with a kilometre-scale magnetic high anomaly with annular magnetic low.

The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.The Company and its officers do not endorse, or reject or otherwise comment on the conclusions, interpretations or views expressed in press articles or third-party analysis.The Company recognises that the term World Class is subjective and for the purpose of the Company's projects the Company considers the drilling results at the Alpala porphyry copper-gold deposit at its Cascabel project to represent intersections of a World Class deposit on the basis of comparisons with other drilling intersections from World Class deposits, some of which have become, or are becoming, producing mines and on the basis of available independent opinions which may be referenced to define the term ""World Class"" (or ""Tier 1"").The Company considers that World Class deposits are rare, very large, long life, low cost, and are responsible for approximately half of total global metals production. World Class deposits are generally accepted as deposits of a size and quality that create multiple expansion opportunities and have or are likely to demonstrate robust economics that ensure development irrespective of position within the global commodity cycles, or whether or not the deposit has been fully drilled out, or a feasibility study completed.Standards drawn from industry experts (1Singer and Menzie, 2010; 2Schodde, 2006; 3Schodde and Hronsky, 2006; 4Singer, 1995; 5Laznicka, 2010) have characterised World Class deposits at prevailing commodity prices. The relevant criteria for World Class deposits, adjusted to current long run commodity prices, are considered to be those holding or likely to hold more than 5 million tonnes of copper and/or more than 6 million ounces of gold with a modelled net present value of greater than US$1billion.The Company cautions that the Cascabel Project remains an early-stage project at this time and there is inherent uncertainty relating to any project at prior to the determination of pre-feasibility study and/or defined feasibility study.On this basis, reference to the Cascabel Project as ""World Class"" (or ""Tier 1"") is considered to be appropriate.Quality Assurance / Quality Control on Sample Collection, Security and AssayingSolGold operates according to its rigorous Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol, which is consistent with industry best practices.Primary sample collection involves secure transport from SolGold's concessions in Ecuador, to the ALS certified sample preparation facility in Quito, Ecuador.

(Nasdaq: FUSN) to be acquired by AstraZeneca in a $2.4 billion transaction. Fusion's radioconjugate targeting PSMA for prostate cancer and R&D capabilities key in the acquisition.,"Fusion Pharmaceuticals to be Acquired by AstraZeneca, Accelerating Development of Next-Generation Radioconjugates to Treat Cancer Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: FUSN) to be acquired by AstraZeneca in a $2.4 billion transaction. Fusion's radioconjugate targeting PSMA for prostate cancer and R&D capabilities key in the acquisition. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals by AstraZeneca represents a significant move in the field of oncology, particularly in the advancement of radioconjugate (RC) therapies. RCs offer a more targeted approach to cancer treatment by delivering radiation directly to cancer cells, which can potentially reduce the side effects associated with traditional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The focus on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is noteworthy, as PSMA is a well-established target in advanced prostate cancer and therapies targeting PSMA have shown promise in clinical trials.The acquisition could enhance patient outcomes by accelerating the development of these advanced treatments. With the integration of Fusion's RC programs and AstraZeneca's resources, there's potential for rapid progress in this therapeutic area. However, the success of these treatments is contingent upon the results of ongoing clinical trials, regulatory approvals and the ability to effectively scale manufacturing and distribution. Financial Analyst The financial terms of the acquisition, with an upfront payment of $21.00 per share and an additional contingent value right (CVR) of $3.00 per share, suggest a strong confidence in the potential of Fusion's pipeline. The premium paid over Fusion's market price prior to the announcement indicates AstraZeneca's valuation of Fusion's technology and market potential. Investors should note that the CVR is tied to specific regulatory milestones, which introduces an element of risk and uncertainty. However, the acquisition could potentially offer significant returns if these milestones are achieved and the treatments gain market approval.Looking at the broader implications, this deal could signal a consolidation trend in the biopharmaceutical industry, where larger companies acquire smaller, specialized firms to bolster their pipelines with innovative therapies. Such acquisitions can lead to increased competitiveness and may drive further M&A activity within the sector. Market Research Analyst The strategic rationale behind AstraZeneca's acquisition of Fusion Pharmaceuticals is to strengthen its oncology portfolio and expand its capabilities in the emerging field of radioconjugates. The market for cancer treatments is highly competitive and constantly evolving with new scientific breakthroughs. By acquiring Fusion, AstraZeneca not only gains access to a promising pipeline but also to specialized R&D and manufacturing capabilities, which could provide it with a competitive edge in the oncology market.It's important to consider the growing interest in precision medicine and how RCs fit into this trend. As the demand for treatments that offer greater efficacy and fewer side effects continues to rise, companies with innovative platforms like Fusion's are likely to attract attention from larger pharmaceutical companies looking to diversify their portfolios and invest in next-generation therapies. 03/19/2024 - 03:00 AM Transaction includes actinium-based clinical-stage radioconjugate targeting PSMA for prostate cancer, pipeline of radioconjugates and state-of-the-art R&D and manufacturing facilities Fusion shareholders to receive $21.00 per share in cash at closing plus a non-transferrable contingent value right (CVR) of $3.00 per share, representing a total transaction value of approximately $2.4 billion including the CVR HAMILTON, ON and BOSTON, March 19, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: FUSN), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing next-generation radioconjugates (RCs) as precision medicines, today announced the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by AstraZeneca. The acquisition marks a major step forward in AstraZeneca delivering on its ambition to transform cancer treatment and outcomes for patients by replacing traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments. RCs have emerged as a promising modality in cancer treatment over recent years. These medicines deliver a radioactive isotope directly to cancer cells through precise targeting using molecules such as antibodies, peptides or small molecules. This approach has many potential advantages compared to traditional radiotherapy, including minimizing damage to healthy cells and enabling access to tumors not reachable through external beam radiation. This acquisition complements AstraZeneca's leading oncology portfolio with the addition of the Fusion pipeline of RCs, including the Company's most advanced program, FPI-2265, a potential new treatment for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). FPI-2265 targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein that is highly expressed in mCRPC, and is currently in a Phase 2 trial. The acquisition brings new expertise and pioneering R&D, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities in actinium-based RCs to AstraZeneca. It also strengthens their presence in and commitment to Canada. Fusion Chief Executive Officer John Valliant, Ph.D., said: ""This acquisition combines Fusion's expertise and capabilities in radioconjugates, including our industry-leading radiopharmaceutical R&D, pipeline, manufacturing and actinium-225 supply chain, with AstraZeneca's leadership in small molecules and biologics engineering to develop novel radioconjugates. Expanding on our existing collaboration with AstraZeneca where we have advanced FPI-2068, an EGFR-cMET targeted radioconjugate into Phase I clinical trials, gives us a unique opportunity to accelerate the development of next-generation radioconjugates with the aim of transforming patient outcomes."" Susan Galbraith, Executive Vice President, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, said: ""Between thirty and fifty per cent of patients with cancer today receive radiotherapy at some point during treatment, and the acquisition of Fusion furthers our ambition to transform this aspect of care with next-generation radioconjugates. Together with Fusion, we have an opportunity to accelerate the development of FPI-2265 as a potential new treatment for prostate cancer, and to harness their innovative actinium-based platform to develop radioconjugates as foundational regimens."" Fusion President and Chief Business Officer Mohit Rawat, said: ""Fusion has differentiated itself in the growing radioconjugate space by assembling an industry-leading team with deep expertise and infrastructure to support bringing these much-needed therapies to cancer patients. Together we look forward to building upon our work to impact the landscape of cancer therapy. Deepening our collaboration with AstraZeneca presents an exciting opportunity for the Fusion team."" Fusion will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, with operations continuing in Canada and the US. Financial Considerations Under the terms of the definitive agreement, AstraZeneca, through a subsidiary, will acquire all of Fusion's outstanding shares pursuant to a plan of arrangement for a price of $21.00 per share in cash at closing plus a non-transferable contingent value right (CVR) of $3.00 per share in cash payable upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone. The upfront cash portion of the consideration represents a transaction value of approximately $2 billion, a 97% premium to Fusion's closing market price of $10.64 on March 18, 2024, and an 85% premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of $11.37 before this announcement. Combined, the upfront and maximum potential contingent value payments represent, if achieved, a transaction value of approximately $2.4 billion, a 126% premium to Fusion's closing market price on March 18, 2024, and a 111% premium to the 30-day VWAP. As part of the transaction, AstraZeneca will acquire the cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on Fusion's balance sheet, which totaled $234 million as of December 31, 2023. The proposed acquisition of Fusion is to be completed by way of a statutory plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of (i) 66⅔% of the votes cast by Fusion shareholders and (ii) a simple majority of the votes cast by Fusion shareholders (excluding certain persons required to be excluded in accordance with Multilateral Instrument 61-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators), in each case, at a special meeting of Fusion shareholders. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of Fusion shareholders and regulatory clearances, as noted above. Centerview Partners LLC is serving as exclusive financial advisor to Fusion and Goodwin Procter LLP is serving as legal counsel, with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP serving as Canadian legal counsel. Radioconjugates in oncologyRCs combine the precise targeting of antibodies, small molecules or peptides with potent medical radioisotopes to deliver radiation directly to cancer cells. By seeking out cancer cells, RCs provide a more precise mechanism of cancer cell killing compared with traditional radiation therapy, with the goal of improving efficacy while minimizing toxicity on healthy cells. RCs are administered via systemic delivery, which enables their use in tumor types not accessible to external beam radiation and the targeting of cancer cells that have spread from the main tumor to other sites in the body. About FPI-2265FPI-2265 is an actinium-225 based PSMA targeting RC, for mCRPC, currently in a Phase II trial. Actinium-225 emits alpha particles and holds the promise of being a next-generation radioisotope in cancer treatment. By delivering a greater radiation dose over a shorter distance, alpha particles such as actinium-225 have the potential for more potent cancer cell killing, and targeted delivery, thereby minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. About Fusion Fusion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing next-generation RCs. Fusion connects alpha particle emitting isotopes to various targeting molecules in order to selectively deliver the alpha emitting payloads to tumors. Fusion's clinical-stage development portfolio includes lead program, FPI-2265, targeting PSMA for mCRPC and novel RCs targeting solid tumors.

This follows the completion of Karuna Therapeutics' $14 billion acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb. The Tender Offer, subject to shareholder approval, will be launched after the Company's Full Year Results in April 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposed capital return of $100 million by PureTech through a tender offer is a significant financial move, representing 14% of the company's market capitalization. This strategic decision comes on the heels of a lucrative exit from Karuna Therapeutics, which was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb for $14 billion. PureTech's receipt of approximately $293 million from the sale of its stake in Karuna has bolstered its balance sheet, enabling the capital return without diluting shareholder value.The tender offer, priced at a 25% premium, is likely to be well-received by investors seeking liquidity, especially given the company's non-dilutive stance over the past six years. This move could potentially increase the stock's attractiveness by signaling management's confidence in the inherent value of the shares. The decision to return capital through a tender offer, followed by a potential special dividend if the full amount is not tendered, demonstrates a commitment to shareholder returns and could impact the stock's performance in the short term.Long-term implications for investors include the management's forward-looking statements on maintaining a strong cash runway and continuous evaluation of capital allocation. This suggests a prudent approach to financial management, which is important for sustaining the development of PureTech's pipeline and future innovative medicines. However, investors should also consider the opportunity cost of the capital return, as these funds could otherwise be invested in accelerating the company's pipeline development. Market Research Analyst The tender offer announcement by PureTech must be contextualized within the broader biotech industry, where capital allocation decisions are closely watched. A return of capital following a successful exit, as seen here, could set a precedent and raise expectations for similar biotech firms with stakes in high-value entities. It's also indicative of the current market conditions where companies may opt for shareholder returns over M&A activities or internal reinvestment due to the complex valuation environment.From a market sentiment perspective, the premium attached to the tender offer could be seen as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable reaction in the stock market. If the stock is perceived as undervalued, such a move may also attract new investors or encourage current shareholders to retain their stakes, anticipating future growth and additional returns. The announcement's timing, following a share buyback program, could reinforce investor perception of a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.Investors should be mindful of the industry's dynamic nature, where the allocation of capital towards innovative drug development can be a double-edged sword. While returns are welcomed, the balance between rewarding shareholders and funding future growth is delicate. Excessive focus on immediate returns could be detrimental if it compromises long-term innovation and value creation. Biotech Industry Expert The biotech sector operates on the edge of innovation and risk, with companies like PureTech navigating through complex R&D processes, regulatory hurdles and market dynamics. The successful development and subsequent sale of their stake in Karuna Therapeutics reflects PureTech's ability to not only foster innovation but also to monetize it effectively, a key success factor in this industry.For stakeholders, the capital return through a tender offer is a tangible outcome of the company's strategic investments and risk management. It underscores the potential for significant returns in the biotech industry, contingent on successful product development and commercialization. The fact that PureTech has managed to avoid shareholder dilution for an extended period is noteworthy, as it is common for companies in this sector to raise funds through equity offerings, which can dilute existing shareholders.However, the reallocation of capital from the proceeds of the Karuna sale towards shareholder returns rather than reinvestment into the pipeline might raise questions about the company's future growth prospects. Investors should consider the pipeline's maturity and the potential for upcoming catalysts that could drive future value. PureTech's confidence in its existing pipeline and its ability to support ongoing development with a robust cash runway is a critical factor for long-term investment considerations. 03/19/2024 - 03:00 AM Proposed capital return of $100 million by way of a Tender Offer at 250 pence per Ordinary Share Premium of 25% to PureTech’s trailing three-day VWAP Proposed Tender Offer follows completion of Karuna Therapeutics' $14 billion acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb. The Tender Offer will be launched following publication of the Company’s Full Year Results in April 2024 BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PureTech Health plc (Nasdaq: PRTC, LSE: PRTC) (“PureTech” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to changing the lives of patients with devastating diseases, today announces a proposed capital return of $100 million to its shareholders by way of a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”). The capital return of $100 million represents approximately 14% of PureTech’s market capitalization based on yesterday’s closing price. This follows the Company’s announcement that it will receive approximately $293 million gross proceeds from its remaining stake in Karuna. The Tender Offer will be launched after the publication of the Company’s Full Year Results in April 2024, subject to market conditions, and will require shareholder approval. A circular setting out the full terms of the Tender Offer and a timetable will be published upon launch. If the full $100 million is not returned, then the Company intends to return any remainder following the completion of the Tender Offer, by way of a special dividend. Daphne Zohar, PureTech Founder and Chief Executive Officer commented: “PureTech’s mission is to generate value both for patients and shareholders, and Bristol Myers Squibb’s acquisition of our Founded Entity Karuna Therapeutics for $14 billion is a testament to our execution on both fronts. We directed $18.5 million to the founding and development of Karuna, and not only have we created a potential breakthrough treatment that may change the lives of millions of people living with schizophrenia, but we have also been able to generate $1.1 billion in cash for PureTech, with potentially more to come. These resources enabled us to create an exciting crop of new medicines that position us to repeat and scale this type of outcome - and we have done so without diluting our shareholders in over six years. We are delighted to be able to purchase shares of PureTech at this valuation and to concurrently provide some liquidity to our shareholders and additional capital returns beyond the recently completed $50 million share buyback. Following this proposed tender offer, we are confident that our strong balance sheet will continue to support the development of our existing pipeline – as well as the next wave of innovative medicines. Looking forward, the board will continue to assess ongoing opportunities to improve shareholder returns.” As noted on 8 February 2024, the Company recently completed a $50 million Share Buyback Program, which – together with the proposed Tender Offer – would constitute $150 million of capital returned to shareholders, which is approximately 21% of the Company’s market capitalization as of 18 March 2024. The Board determined the amount of the Tender Offer after considering feedback from a number of shareholders, tax implications, and the continued support of the Company’s existing and future Programs, including the recently announced Founded Entities. PureTech aims to maintain at least three year’s cash runway, and the Board intends to evaluate its capital allocation policy regularly to assess opportunities for additional capital returns to shareholders, subject to the Company’s operational needs. About PureTech Health PureTech is a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to giving life to new classes of medicine to change the lives of patients with devastating diseases. The Company has created a broad and deep pipeline through its experienced research and development team and its extensive network of scientists, clinicians and industry leaders that is being advanced both internally and through its Founded Entities. PureTech's R&D engine has resulted in the development of 28 therapeutics and therapeutic candidates, including two that have received both US FDA clearance and European marketing authorization and a third (KarXT) that has been filed for FDA approval. A number of these programs are being advanced by PureTech or its Founded Entities in various indications and stages of clinical development, including registration enabling studies. All of the underlying programs and platforms that resulted in this pipeline of therapeutic candidates were initially identified or discovered and then advanced by the PureTech team through key validation points.

Negative None. 03/19/2024 - 02:40 AM Dublin, Ireland--(Newsfile Corp. - March 19, 2024) - Cosmo Pharmaceuticals N.V. (SIX: COPN) (FSE: C43) (“Cosmo”) reported today that its partner Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (Reuters: SUN.BO) (Bloomberg: SUNP IN), (NSE: SUNPHARMA) (BSE: 524715) (“Sun Pharma”) has announced that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has granted regulatory approval for Winlevi® (clascoterone cream 1%). Winlevi® is indicated for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. Diana Harbort, President of the Dermatology Division of Cosmo, said: “We are very pleased that Winlevi® will soon be available to patients in Australia. This is another achievement in the mission of Cosmo and Sun Pharma to improve the lives of patients affected by skin conditions”. As stated by Hellen de Kloet, Business Head – Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Sun Pharma: “Winlevi® is an exciting addition to our expanding dermatology portfolio of innovative medicines in Australia. Winlevi®’s novel mechanism of action will be a welcome addition to the physician’s toolkit while treating acne”. Please see here Sun Pharma’s full media release. Winlevi® will be available in Australia as of June 2024. For more information, visit https://sunpharma.com/australia. About Winlevi® Winlevi® is approved for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in people 12 years of age and older. Although the exact mechanism of action for Winlevi® is unknown, laboratory studies suggest the active ingredient, clascoterone, competes with androgens, specifically dihydrotestosterone (DHT), for binding to the androgen receptors within the sebaceous gland and hair follicles1. Androgens are widely recognized as the most important of all hormones in terms of regulating sebum production2. Within the skin, androgens bind to androgen receptors, causing increased sebum production and inflammation3. In particular, the skin of patients with acne vulgaris produces higher levels of the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) than the skin of healthy individuals4. Winlevi® binds to the androgen receptor competing with androgens such as DHT on cells within the sebaceous gland. Although its precise mechanism of action is unknown, studies suggest Winlevi® inhibits androgen receptors5 in the skin and reduces production of sebum and inflammation. Additionally, Winlevi® is rapidly metabolized in the skin, limiting systemic absorption6,7. Sun Pharma has received from Cosmo the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Winlevi® in US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico and Russia. About Cosmo Cosmo is a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercialising products to treat selected gastrointestinal disorders, to improve endoscopy quality measures through aiding the detection of colonic lesions and to treat selected dermatological conditions. Cosmo develops and manufactures products which are distributed globally by selected partners including Lialda®/Mezavant®/Mesavancol®, Uceris®/Cortiment®, Aemcolo®/ Relafalk® and Winlevi®.

This enables less frequent battery replacements, minimizes the impact of discarded batteries, and allows more designs to go battery free running solely from an energy-harvesting system such as a small photovoltaic cell. In the global pursuit of sustainability, technologies deployed in smart buildings and Internet of Things (IoT) applications are critical tools for managing energy and resources efficiently. At the heart of the smart sensors and actuators making them possible, ST’s microcontrollers manage the processes that collect, filter, analyze, and act, communicating with high-level applications in the cloud. There are billions of these MCUs in action already and the expansion of smart living and working will demand billions more. “It’s vital that these pervasive devices consume as little energy as possible as they help to minimize waste elsewhere. The new STM32U0 microcontroller series we are introducing today takes this notion to a new level, building on our proven ultra-low-power technologies,” explained Patrick Aidoune, General Purpose MCU Division General Manager, STMicroelectronics. “In fact, our new MCUs consume so little power that small devices in some dedicated applications like industrial sensor management can run for twice as long from the same size battery. This comes with the opportunity to add more advanced features and deliver cost-effective solutions for a variety of industrial, medical and consumer devices.” The new STM32U0 MCUs enable this great leap in energy efficiency through a combination of their state-of-the-art design techniques and advanced manufacturing process. These include extremely low static power consumption in standby mode and superior wake-up performance, enabling the MCU to spend more time in power-saving sleep modes to minimize average energy demand. One lead customer, in the security-systems market, is using the STM32U0 in security cameras to wake the device when motion is detected and thus enhance surveillance while saving energy. Another has created ultra-long-lasting smoke detectors, while a further application, by Ascoel, is using the STM32U0 to manage power-conscious functions of a water meter. “Ascoel builds a wide range of innovative electronic devices with a focus on IoT technologies. We are working to design an ultrasonic water meter, with battery lasting for more than 10 years, integrating an LCD screen for real-time data, as well as the necessary security,” said Francesco Cerretani, Senior Software Developer, Ascoel. “We found that the STM32U0 was the perfect solution, supporting our goal to create a low-cost, ultra-low-power, easy-to-install, zero maintenance, precise water meter. When deployed at scale in the customer’s grid, it will improve control over water leakage and contribute to reducing the environmental impact.” The STM32U0 enhances cost-effectiveness by providing an LCD segment display controller. Devices with an LCD, like Ascoel’s water meter as well as thermostats, smart retail labels, access-control panels, and factory automation can take advantage of this to reduce the cost of their PCB. Additional value-added features of STM32U0 MCUs include numerous analog peripherals like analog-to-digital converters (ADC), digital-to-analog converters (DAC), operational amplifiers, and comparators. There is also an on-chip system oscillator that helps cut the bill of materials to save costs and PCB space. STM32U0 devices are the first MCUs running on Arm® Cortex®-M0+ targeting SESIP Level 3 and PSA level 1 focusing on firmware code protection. Certification provides an independent assurance of the STM32U0 security capabilities that product manufacturers can leverage to comply with the coming voluntary US Cyber Trust Mark and mandatory EU Radio Equipment Directive (RED). Developers can also take advantage of up to 256KB of Flash, package options up to 81 pins, and 56MHz core speed, which are generous specifications for this class of device. The STM32U0 series is in production now and ST is making the new devices available at an attractive price point starting at $0.68 for 1,000 units.

(“LIFT” or the “Company”) (TSXV: LIFT) (OTCQX: LIFFF) (Frankfurt: WS0) is pleased to report assays from 8 drill holes completed at the Echo, Fi Main, Fi Southwest & Nite pegmatites within the Yellowknife Lithium Project (“YLP”) located outside the city of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories (Figure 1). Drilling intersected significant intervals of spodumene mineralization, with the following highlights: Highlights: YLP-0223: 14 m at 1.55% Li2O, (Echo)YLP-0226: 13 m at 1.45% Li2O, (Echo)YLP-0217: 10 m at 0.93% Li2O, (Echo)and: 2 m at 0.63% Li2OYLP-0219: 9 m at 0.97% Li2O, (Fi Main) Discussion of Results This news release provides results for eight drill holes (1,916 m), six of which are from ongoing 2024 winter drilling and two from the 2023 program. Three holes are reported from the Echo pegmatite, two each on Fi Southwest and Nite, and one from Fi Main. A table of composite calculations, general comments related to this discussion, and a table of collar headers are provided towards the end of this section. Dave Smithson, SVP, Geology of LIFT comments, “We are pleased to see the first results from the southeast end of the Echo pegmatite system where holes 223 and 226 intercepted strong shallow spodumene mineralization averaging 1.55% Li2O over 14 m and 1.45% Li2O over 13 m, respectively. Geological mapping at this portion of the Echo pegmatite system in 2023 reveals that there is still an additional 500 m of strike-length of spodumene-bearing pegmatite that remains untested for follow-up drilling, and so we are very excited to build these initial results by testing the remainder of the dyke to the southeast, to a depth of 250 m from surface.” Figure 1 – Location of LIFT’s Yellowknife Lithium Project. Drilling has been thus far mainly focused on the Near Field Group of pegmatites which are located to the east of the city of Yellowknife along a government-maintained paved highway, and more recently advancing to the Echo target, the first drilling in the Further Afield Group. Echo Pegmatite System The Echo pegmatite complex comprises a fanning splay of moderate to gently dipping dykes for 0.5 km to the northwest (“Echo splay”), apparently sourced from a steeply dipping, northwest-trending, feeder dyke (“Echo feeder”). The dyke complex has a total strike length of over 1.0 km. The feeder dyke is 10-15 m wide whereas the gently dipping dykes in the splay are thicker, ranging from 10-25 m wide. The holes in this news release were drilled into both the Echo splay and Echo feeder dyke. YLP-0223 is the first hole reported from the Echo feeder dyke and was drilled to test 250 m from its northern mapped extent and 25 m below the surface. Drilling intersected a single 15 m wide pegmatite dyke that returned an assay composite of 1.55% Li2O over 14 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 3). Figure 2 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Echo pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 3 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0223 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 14 m interval of 1.55% Li2O. YLP-0226 was collared 50 m south of YLP-0223 to test the Echo feeder 300 m from its northern mapped extent and 25 m below the surface. Drilling intersected a 41 m corridor with 32 m of pegmatite that includes a 19 m wide dyke that yielded a composite of 1.45% Li2O over 13 m (Table 1 & 2, Figures 2 & 4). Figure 4 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0226 with results as shown in the Echo pegmatite dyke with a 13 m interval of 1.45% Li2O. YLP-0217 was collared 100 m northwest of the Echo feeder to test the Echo splay about 400 m from its northwest mapped extent, <25 to 100 m below the surface, and on section with previously released YLP-0124 (1.52% Li2O over 12 m). Drilling intersected a shallow dipping, 79 m wide, interval with 29 m of pegmatite spread over a 14 m wide dyke and five others between 1-7 m in width. Two of these dykes, spaced 25-30 m apart, combine to form a composite of 0.88% Li2O over 12 m (Table 1 & 2, Figure 2). Fi Main Pegmatite The Fi Main pegmatite complex crops out over at least 1.5 km of strike length within a north-south striking corridor that dips between 70°-85° to the west. The central stretch of the complex consists of a 25-30 m thick dyke that is flanked by one or more <5 m wide dykes within a 25-75 m wide corridor. This thick dyke splits to the north and south to form a wider corridor (75-150 m) that hosts a similar volume of pegmatite spread over more and generally narrower dykes. YLP-0219 was drilled to test the southern part of the Fi Main pegmatite at 150-250 m below the surface. Previously released drill holes that returned on-section intersections of upper pegmatite include YLP-0008 (0.89% Li2O over 20 m, 25 m depth) and YLP-0014 (0.74% Li2O over 23 m, 50 m). New drilling that targeted 150 m beneath the surface intersected a 23 m upper corridor with 17 m of pegmatite grading 0.97% Li2O over 9 m. Previous on-section intersections of lower pegmatite include 0.91% Li2O over 15 m at 75 m depth (YLP-0008) and negligible grade at 100 m depth. (YLP-0014) New drilling intersected a 20 m wide lower corridor with 13 m of pegmatite that returned negligible grade (Table 1 & 2, Figures 5 & 6). Figure 5 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Main pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Figure 6 – Cross-section illustrating YLP-0219 with results as shown in the Fi Main pegmatite dyke with a 9 m interval of 0.97% Li2O. Fi Southwest Pegmatite The Fi Southwest (Fi-SW) pegmatite complex is exposed over at least 1.1 km on surface and occurs within a broader corridor that is 50-100 m wide and dips between 60°-80° to the east. The complex is cored by a 20-40 m wide main dyke that is continuous for at least 800 m along strike, with numerous sub-parallel subsidiary dykes between 1-5 m in width. At its northern and southern ends, the main dyke splays out into a broader corridor with more dykes that have narrower widths. YLP-0201 and YLP-0206 both tested the northern splay. YLP-0201 was drilled on a section 150 m beyond the mapped northern extent of the main dyke to test at 50 m below the surface. Drilling intersected a 63 m wide corridor with 7 m of pegmatite spread over two dykes, neither of which returned significant grade. YLP-0206 was collared on a section 100 m south of YLP-0201 to test at 250 m below the surface and just beyond the mapped northern tip of the main dyke. Previously released drilling on this section returned 1.03% Li2O over 24 m from 50-100 m depth (YLP-0051), 1.32% Li2O over 14 m from 125-150 m (YLP-0075), and 1.06% Li2O over 16 m from 150-175 m depth (YLP-0081). New drilling intersected a 24 m wide corridor with 19 m of pegmatite that assayed negligible grade (Table 1 & 2, Figure 7). Figure 7 – Plan view showing the surface expression of the Fi Southwest pegmatite with diamond drill holes reported in this press release. Nite Pegmatite The Nite pegmatite complex is exposed along 1.4 km of strike length as a swarm of parallel-trending dykes that occur within a north-northeast striking corridor dipping ~50°-70° degrees to the east. The northern part of this complex consists of a 5-15 m thick dyke flanked by one or more 1-5 m dykes whereas the southern part comprises a fanning splay of 5-10 thin dykes within a 200 m wide corridor. YLP-0194 was drilled to test the main pegmatite at 400 m from its northern mapped extent and 200-225 m below the surface. Previous drilling on the same section returned 1.24% Li2O over 5 m from 50 m depth (YLP-0152) and 0.87% Li2O over 6 m from 150 m (YLP-0192). New drilling intersected a 20 m wide corridor with 13 m of pegmatite that returned negligible grade. YLP-0197 was collared on a section 200 m south of YLP-0194 to test the Nite main pegmatite at 250 m below the surface. Previously released drilling on the same section returned 0.58% Li2O over 17 m from 50 m depth (YLP-0196) and 0.81% Li2O over 13 m from 150 m (YLP-0198). New drilling intersected a 44 m wide corridor with 22 m of pegmatite that returned negligible grade (Table 1 & 2, Figure 8).

Drill core was transported from the drill platform to the core processing facility where it was logged, photographed, and split by diamond saw prior to being sampled. Samples were then bagged, and blanks and certified reference materials were inserted at regular intervals. Field duplicates consisting of quarter-cut core samples were also included in the sample runs. Groups of samples were placed in large bags, sealed with numbered tags in order to maintain a chain-of-custody, and transported from LIFT’s core logging facility to ALS Labs (“ALS”) laboratory in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. Sample preparation and analytical work for this drill program were carried out by ALS. Samples were prepared for analysis according to ALS method CRU31: individual samples were crushed to 70% passing through 2 mm (10 mesh) screen; a 1,000-gram sub-sample was riffle split (SPL-21) and then pulverized (PUL-32) such that 85% passed through 75 micron (200 mesh) screen. A 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was then dissolved in a sodium peroxide solution and analysed for lithium according to ALS method ME-ICP82b. Another 0.2-gram sub-sample of the pulverized material was analysed for 53 elements according to ALS method ME-MS89L. All results passed the QA/QC screening at the lab, all inserted standards and blanks returned results that were within acceptable limits.

Furthermore, the emphasis on security through multi-org deployment and HIPAA compliance readiness may address the growing concerns regarding data privacy and regulatory standards.From a technological standpoint, the use of natural language for smart workflows and reporting indicates an advancement in user interface design, which could improve user adoption rates. The deployment of sandboxes for testing AI features reflects a cautious approach to innovation, allowing organizations to adapt to new technologies without disrupting existing operations. These enhancements are poised to provide IT leaders with the tools necessary to leverage AI effectively, potentially leading to a competitive edge in the market. Data Security Analyst Asana's announcement underscores the importance of data security in the age of AI-driven transformations. The integration of Microsoft Intune MDM for the management of Asana's iOS app demonstrates a commitment to securing mobile access to corporate data. This could be particularly appealing to enterprises with a mobile workforce, as it aligns with the broader trend towards mobile device management in IT security strategies.The provision of sandboxes for testing AI features prior to full deployment is a prudent measure that mitigates the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into the system. By enabling IT leaders to test AI functionalities within a controlled environment, Asana is facilitating a more secure and stable adoption of AI technologies. The multi-org deployment feature, which allows separation of data by subsidiary, is a strategic response to the complex requirements of global data residency and privacy regulations. This could be a significant value proposition for multinational corporations looking to maintain compliance while deploying AI solutions. Financial Analyst Asana's foray into AI-enhanced capabilities could have a tangible impact on its financial performance. By offering advanced features such as AI-powered reporting and smart workflows, Asana is likely to attract and retain customers who are seeking to maximize their return on investment in digital work management tools. The ability to generate executive-level reports and insights could appeal to a segment of the market focused on strategic planning and data-driven decision-making.The timing of these releases, staggered across various quarters, suggests a strategic roadmap that may generate recurring interest and engagement from current and prospective clients. The integration with widely-used platforms like Microsoft 365 can potentially expand Asana's user base, which in turn could lead to increased revenue streams. However, the costs associated with the development and implementation of these AI capabilities, as well as the competitive response from other players in the market, will be important factors in determining the overall financial impact of this initiative. 03/19/2024 - 04:00 AM Asana’s State of IT research reveals 77% of IT leaders feel responsible for leading AI transformation within their organization Deeper integrations with Microsoft 365, AI-powered reporting, and enhanced workflow capabilities, all with safeguards and controls, help CIOs build the right foundation for AI to drive greater ROI SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Asana, Inc., a leading enterprise work management platform, announced new AI capabilities that empower IT leaders to drive intelligent transformation with the right data foundation, safeguards, and controls.

As the oldest and leading bank in Israel, Leumi has operated exceptionally well since the outbreak of the war, standing by its customers while maintaining optimal business continuity and meticulous risk management. In this context, we offered extensive relief programs and services adapted to our customers' needs and took groundbreaking measures in the social responsibility domain. Our extensive activity in this area during the war is part of the Bank's decision to place environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects at the core of our strategic achievements. The impressive financial results we have achieved in 2023 illustrate the Bank's ability to support Israel's economy and society also in difficult times and during a period of recovery and growth"". Bank Leumi's President & CEO, Hanan Friedman: ""The financial statements for 2023 published today reflect, more than ever, the Bank's resilience. Our superb loan portfolio indicators, solid capital base and efficiency ratio - which is not only one of the best locally, but also globally - reflect Leumi's strength and our ability to continue to support our responsible growth strategy, which we have been implementing in recent years. Our ability to do more for our customers with higher efficiency is achieved by the groundbreaking technological developments we have implemented - and continue to implement. This way, we can continue to be the leading and most innovative financial institution in Israel, while providing the most convenient service. In light of this complex period, I would like to end with a prayer in the name of the entire Leumi family, for the swift return of all of our hostages, for the safe return home of our soldiers from the battlefield, and for the full recovery of all those injured. We commemorate the fallen and look forward to better and safer days"".

(""Asep Inc."" or the ""Company"") (CSE: ASEP) (OTCQB: SEPSF) (FSE: JJ8) is pleased to announce that it is holding an online webinar on March 22, 2024, at 4:00 pm EST to provide significant updates on the company's latest milestones. Investors, potential investors, analysts, and members of the medical community are invited to register for the webinar to review Asep Inc.'s groundbreaking diagnostic and therapeutic technologies and learn first-hand about the status of the Company's plans to list on the Nasdaq Exchange. Members of Asep Inc.'s executive team will present the company's latest corporate presentation as well as update attendees on the status of our global partnerships and joint ventures. ABOUT ASEP MEDICAL HOLDINGS INC. Asep Medical Holdings Inc. (asepmedical.com) is dedicated to addressing the global issue of antibiotic failure by developing novel solutions for significant unmet medical needs in human medicine. The Company is a consolidation of three existing private companies, all with technology in advanced development — Sepset Biosciences Inc. (proprietary diagnostic tools to enable the early and timely identification of sepsis), ABT Innovations Inc. (broad-spectrum therapeutic agents to address multi-drug resistant biofilm infections), and SafeCoat Medical Inc. (an antimicrobial peptide, anti-fouling medical device coating technology). Sepset Biosciences Inc. (sepset.ca) is developing a diagnostic technology that involves a patient gene expression signature that predicts the development of severe sepsis, one of the significant diseases leading to antibiotic failure, since antibiotics are the primary treatment for sepsis. Sepsis was responsible for nearly 20% of all deaths on the planet in 2017 and essentially all deaths due to COVID-19 and other pandemics. The SepsetER test is a blood-based gene expression assay that is straightforward to implement, and results are obtained in about an hour after taking a blood sample in the emergency room or intensive care unit. This proprietary diagnostic technology differs from current diagnostic tests in enabling the diagnosis of severe sepsis within 60 minutes of initiating the test. Bacterial culture, the gold standard, provides a diagnosis after ~15 hours but can be as long as three days. Asep Inc. believes its test will enable physicians to make critical early decisions regarding appropriate therapies and thus reduce overall morbidity and mortality due to sepsis. ABT Innovations Inc.'s (abtinnovations.ca) peptide technology covers a broad range of therapeutic applications, including bacterial biofilm infections (medical device infections, chronic infections, lung, bladder, wound, dental, skin, ear-nose and throat, sinusitis, orthopaedic, etc.), anti-inflammatories, anti-infective immune-modulators and vaccine adjuvants. The company is in the pre-clinical development phase with promising data. SafeCoat Medical Inc.'s (safecoatmedical.com) technology incorporates self-assembling biocompatible polymers that can be combined with conjugated antimicrobial peptides and applied to virtually any surface as stable antimicrobial and/or anti-fouling coatings. Of particular interest is the application of this versatile antimicrobial coating to various medical devices and implants that often become contaminated with biofilm infections. SafeCoat is optimizing methods to manufacture and apply these anti-bacterial coatings to a host of surfaces and can tailor the composition of the coating and associated peptide sequences for any desired application.

The company plans to use the net proceeds for commercial activities related to the launch of Rezdiffra™ (resmetirom) in the U.S. and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' recent public offering announcement is a significant event with potential implications for the company's financial health and future growth. The decision to increase the offering size by $100 million indicates strong investor interest, which could be a positive signal for the stock's performance. The substantial gross proceeds of approximately $600 million give Madrigal a considerable cash influx, which is pivotal for a biopharmaceutical firm with its sights set on commercializing a new drug.The allocation of these funds towards the launch of Rezdiffra™ in the U.S. market is a strategic move that could see the company transitioning from a development phase to a commercial phase, which is often a transformative period for biotech companies. However, investors should monitor the burn rate closely as commercial launches can be expensive and outcomes uncertain. The involvement of top-tier banks as joint bookrunners may also lend credibility to the offering, but investors should remain cautious and evaluate the company's valuation in the context of its growth prospects and the competitive landscape of NASH treatments. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing health concern with a large unmet medical need and Madrigal's focus on this area could position it advantageously in a market with high growth potential. The launch of Rezdiffra™ represents a key milestone for Madrigal and if successful, could capture significant market share. However, the NASH market is competitive, with multiple players working on innovative treatments.Investors should consider the efficacy, safety profile and pricing strategy of Rezdiffra™ relative to competing therapies. Additionally, the company's plans for potential ex-U.S. commercialization or partnering opportunities could expand its market reach but also introduce regulatory and market entry risks. The impact of this capital raise on Madrigal's stock will depend on the execution of its commercialization strategy and its ability to manage the increased expectations that come with a successful offering. 03/18/2024 - 11:58 PM CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The size of the offering was increased by $100 million subsequent to the initial announcement of the offering. The gross proceeds to Madrigal from the offering, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, are expected to be approximately $600 million.

JOYY's strategy for 2024 focuses on globalization through localization to drive sustainable growth. Negative None. Market Research Analyst JOYY Inc.'s reported financials for Q4 and the full year of 2023 reflect a stable growth trajectory, particularly in its core business segment, BIGO. The increase in revenue by 3.1% year over year is modest yet consistent, suggesting that the company's offerings remain competitive in the social app market. The fact that BIGO's operating profit margins have increased indicates an effective cost management strategy, which is pivotal for technology companies in a market that often demands continuous investment in innovation.The company's strategy of 'globalization through localization' is a nuanced approach to international expansion, acknowledging the importance of tailored experiences for different markets. This is a key factor for social platforms, as user engagement and monetization strategies can vary significantly across regions. The reported growth in MAUs and paying users, especially in Europe and the Middle East, underscores the success of this strategy. Moreover, the high ratio of capital returns to non-GAAP net profit signals a strong commitment to shareholder value, which can be attractive to investors looking for companies with a track record of profitability and shareholder-focused policies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, JOYY's significant increase in net profit and non-GAAP net profit for the full year of 2023, compared to 2022, indicates a robust performance that outpaces the previous year's. The non-GAAP net margin improvement from 8.3% to 12.9% is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that JOYY is not only increasing its revenue but also becoming more efficient in its operations. This is further evidenced by the operational efficiencies mentioned, leading to sustained profitability for the third consecutive year.The decision to repurchase shares and distribute cash dividends totaling US$355 million, which is a substantial 121.5% of its annual non-GAAP net profit, could be seen as a confident move by management to return value to shareholders. However, it also raises questions about the company's long-term investment strategy and whether this level of capital return is sustainable without compromising future growth opportunities. Technology Industry Analyst JOYY's performance in the technology and social app industry is significant, particularly when considering the competitive landscape. Being ranked as the World's #2 Social App by consumer spend is an impressive feat, reinforcing the company's market presence. The emphasis on a diversified content ecosystem and evolving social interaction features aligns with broader industry trends where platforms seek to increase user engagement and retention.The introduction of new features and monetization options on Likee, alongside the positive operating cash inflow for Hago, highlight the company's ability to innovate and adapt to market demands. These developments are important for maintaining a competitive edge in an industry where user preferences and technologies are constantly evolving. Furthermore, the focus on content creation and community building is in line with the industry's shift towards more interactive and creator-centric platforms. 03/18/2024 - 11:11 PM SINGAPORE, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JOYY Inc.

Bigo Live also unveiled a brand-new creator incentive program across major regions around the world. While Bigo Live continued to support experienced professional streamers and PUGC, this program placed a stronger emphasis on new amateur streamers and UGC. As well as generous economic rewards, Bigo Live provided comprehensive training courses for amateur streamers, helping newcomers to develop their skills and learn the ropes of successful streaming. The UGC incentive program has already attracted over 300,000 amateur streamers as of the end of 2023. In January, BIGO successfully held its annual flagship event, the BIGO Awards Gala, in Las Vegas.

In 2023, Likee maintained its strategic focus on its core Middle East and Europe markets and implemented a series of targeted operational and product optimizations to drive user recovery and stimulate monetization growth. The number of Likee's paying users grew for four consecutive quarters during 2023. In terms of monetization, Likee's revenue for the full year was up year over year in 2023. Additionally, the recovery of DAUs in the Developed Countries Region (especially Europe), an evolving creator services ecosystem, and a more established business and creator marketplace, all contributed to Likee's advertising revenues growing by nearly 2.5 times for the full year of 2023.

Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 08:34 PM Scottsdale, Arizona--(Newsfile Corp. - March 18, 2024) - Greenbriar Sustainable Living Inc. (TSXV: GRB) (OTC Pink: GEBRF) (""Greenbriar"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the schedule to break ground on Sage Ranch will be within the month of April, 2024. The ongoing drama between the TCCWD and the city does not affect our schedule. The company owns and has access to all of the deeded water rights, and any additional sources. The WSA was accurate and complete. The city council was correct in its approval of the WSA. The TCCWD wants to be a land planning agency, and the law does not permit this role. The city was correct in its full approval of the project. During all of the settlement negotiations with the TCCWD, and in front of eight lawyers and the company, the TCCWD emphatically stated they had no issue with Sage Ranch alone. The TCCWD stated during multiple settlement talks that their issue was what the city additionally permits after Sage Ranch. That is not the business of the TCCWD to hold permitting authority over the city. The city has lots entitled since 1898. Those lots are not being permitted and therefore was not part of the WSA's correct analysis. The TCCWD is desperate for some technical victory on a limited re-write of the WSA so they can make a claim to retrieve their legal fees. This has no impact on the schedule of building Sage Ranch nor stopping its progress. The TCCWD uses deeded water rights of all owners who do not use those rights in any given year, and sells them on a yearly basis to ag companies who lease the land from certain TCCWD directors. The TCCWD is in a full conflict of interest. In addition, the president of the TCCWD board tried to buy a portion of the original Sage Ranch from Greenbriar in 2017. Greenbriar said no, and the current TCCWD president was denied owning a piece of Sage Ranch. About Greenbriar Capital Corp: Greenbriar is a leading developer of sustainable real estate and renewable energy. With long-term, high impact projects and led by a successful industry-recognized operating and development team, Greenbriar targets deep valued sustainable assets directed at accretive shareholder value.

(or ""the company"", www.skhynix.com) announced today that it has begun volume production of HBM3E*, the newest AI memory product with ultra-high performance, for supply to a customer from late March. The company made public its success with the HBM3E development just seven months ago. * HBM (High Bandwidth Memory): A high-value, high-performance memory that vertically interconnects multiple DRAM chips and dramatically increases data processing speed in comparison to conventional DRAM products. HBM3E, the extended version of HBM3, is the fifth generation of HBM following HBM, HBM2, HBM2E and HBM3 SK hynix being the first provider of HBM3E, a product with the best performing DRAM chips, extends its earlier success with HBM3. The company expects a successful volume production of HBM3E, along with its experiences also as the industry's first provider of HBM3, to help cement its leadership in the AI memory space. In order to build a successful AI system that processes a huge amount of data quickly, a semiconductor package should be composed in a way that numerous AI processors and memories are multi-connected. Global big tech companies have been increasingly requiring stronger performance of AI semiconductor and SK hynix expects its HBM3E to be their optimal choice that meets such growing expectations. The latest product is the industry's best in all the aspects required for an AI memory including speed and heat control. It processes up to 1.18TB of data per second, equivalent to processing more than 230 full-HD movies (5GB each), in a second. As AI memory operates at an extremely high speed, controlling heat is another key qualification required for AI memories. SK hynix's HBM3E also comes with a 10% improvement in heat-dissipation performance, compared with the previous generation, following application of the advanced MR-MUF** process. ** MR-MUF (Mass Reflow Molded Underfill): The process of stacking semiconductor chips, injecting liquid protective materials between them to protect the circuit between chips, and hardening them. The process has proved to be more efficient and effective for heat dissipation, compared with the method of laying film-type materials for each chip stack. SK hynix's advanced MR-MUF technology is critical to securing a stable mass production on the supply side of the HBM ecosystem as pressure on the chips being stacked can be reduced, while warpage control is also improved with adoption of this process. Sungsoo Ryu, Head of HBM Business at SK hynix, said that mass production of HBM3E has completed the company's lineup of industry-leading AI memory products. ""With the success story of the HBM business and the strong partnership with customers that it has built for years, SK hynix will cement its position as the total AI memory provider."" About SK hynix Inc. SK hynix Inc., headquartered in Korea, is the world's top tier semiconductor supplier offering Dynamic Random Access Memory chips (""DRAM""), flash memory chips (""NAND flash"") and CMOS Image Sensors (""CIS"") for a wide range of distinguished customers globally.

Stockholders Approve Proposed Merger with MITER Brands Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary PGT Innovations, Inc. announces stockholder approval for merger agreement with MITER Brands, with MITER Brands acquiring all outstanding shares for $42.00 per share in cash. The transaction will make PGTI a privately held company. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of PGT Innovations, Inc. by MITER Brands at a price of $42.00 per share represents a significant event for the stakeholders of both entities. This price point needs to be evaluated against the historical stock performance, including the premium paid over the current trading price and the industry average multiples. The involvement of Koch Equity Development suggests confidence in the strategic value of the merger, as KED's investment decisions are typically underpinned by thorough financial analysis.It's also important to consider the liquidity event for shareholders. The transition from public to private ownership will alter the investment thesis for current shareholders and could potentially offer a lucrative exit point. However, this change in ownership structure will also mean the loss of public market liquidity and the transparency that comes with public reporting requirements.Finally, the financing structure of the deal, particularly the equity investment from KED, indicates a leveraged buyout scenario which could impact the capital structure of the resulting entity. This could have implications for the financial stability and strategic direction of the merged company. Market Research Analyst The merger between PGT Innovations and MITER Brands could have broader implications for the market segment both companies operate within. A combined entity may result in increased market share and potentially greater pricing power. It would be prudent to analyze the competitive landscape to understand how this consolidation might affect industry dynamics.Furthermore, the removal of PGTI's stock from public trading will affect the investment landscape within this industry. For investors focusing on building and construction supplies, the pool of investable public companies is reduced, which could shift the balance of supply and demand for remaining stocks in this sector. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the approval of the merger by PGTI's stockholders and the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are key steps in ensuring regulatory compliance. The transaction's closing later in the month will be contingent upon meeting any remaining regulatory requirements and customary closing conditions.As part of the due diligence, it's essential to review the terms of the merger agreement for any clauses that could affect the rights of shareholders and any potential impact on the employees and existing contracts. The change from a public to a private entity will also bring about significant changes in corporate governance and reporting obligations. 03/18/2024 - 06:35 PM VENICE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PGT Innovations, Inc.

The program is funded by an eight-million-dollar grant from Gilead Sciences (Nasdaq: GILD) as part of Gilead’s Relink grant program. In this first round, CDA Foundation distributed a total of 2.1 million dollars to the following 14 grantees: Organization Organization Type State AIDS Leadership Foothills-area Alliance Non-profit NC Arizona Department of Health Services State Health Agency AZ Asian Health Services Healthcare Institution CA Denver Health and Hospital Authority Healthcare Institution CO Family Health Centers of San Diego Non-profit CA Hepatitis B Initiative of D.C.

This opportunity allows us to re-engage about 1,000 of our clients who have tested positive for HBV and/or HCV; the majority need more assistance with finding care for their hepatitis treatment. HBI believes this project will make a meaningful impact on the under-served community we screen, as we assist with patient navigation services to help clients overcome barriers for linkage to care.” Bridging the gap between the almost 3.3 million diagnosed but untreated Hepatitis B and C infected individuals in the United States and necessary care remains an important endeavor given the link between chronic viral hepatitis infection and increasing rates of cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure and premature deaths, as well as a constellation of associated illnesses. The effort rises in urgency considering the World Health Organization’s global target to eliminate viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030 amidst persistent misunderstandings about the severity of disease, lack of follow up and delayed treatment commencement. “CDA Foundation is very proud to have been selected to distribute these grants,” commented Homie Razavi, the Managing Director of CDA Foundation. “Loss of diagnosed but untreated patients is a major barrier for countries trying to achieve the viral hepatitis elimination targets. Our grantees will work with pregnant women, women of child-bearing age, low-income people, people in the inner-cities, Medicaid patients, homeless, former incarcerated, limited English proficient individuals, HIV+, LGBQIA, immigrants, refugees, sex workers, and people who inject drugs to link an estimated 14,000 diagnosed but untreated HCV and HBV infected individuals back into a physician's care. We are fortunate to have a knowledgeable independent advisory committee with representation from the medical community, major universities, and patient advocacy, to review and select the grantees. We are grateful for all 35 applicants who took the time to submit a grant and will work with the organizations who were not funded to update their proposals for the next round of funding.” CDA Foundation will distribute three more rounds of Relink grants. The submission window for the second round of proposals opened in February 2024 for programs with a duration of no more than 18 months. Submission for the third round will open in August 2024 for programs with a duration of no more than 12 months, and February 2025 for programs with a duration of no more than six months.

MTL positioned Carlisle as an industry leader in the $4B architectural metal segment. Strong management team and premium portfolio from MTL. Acquisition aligns with Vision 2030 strategy of Carlisle Companies Incorporated. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of MTL by Carlisle Companies Incorporated represents a strategic move that aligns with the company's Vision 2030 strategy, which focuses on becoming a pure-play building products company. The purchase price of $410 million, at 8.7x MTL’s adjusted EBITDA, is within the norms for acquisitions in this sector, indicating a fair valuation based on current market trends. The expected cost synergies of $13 million within the first three years suggest a well-planned integration that could lead to operational efficiencies and enhanced profitability.The addition of MTL's product offerings, including pre-fabricated edge metal and architectural wall panels, positions Carlisle as a more comprehensive provider in the $4 billion architectural metal segment. This move could potentially increase Carlisle's market share and strengthen its competitive edge. The anticipated accretion to EPS of approximately $0.60 in 2025 indicates a positive financial outlook post-acquisition, which is promising for investors and stakeholders. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's impact on Carlisle's earnings per share (EPS) is significant. An increase of $0.60 to adjusted EPS is a strong indicator of the acquisition's potential to enhance shareholder value. The transaction is also structured to capitalize on a $43 million tax step-up benefit, demonstrating strategic financial planning that could improve Carlisle's tax efficiency. Investors should note that while the acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, the realization of these financial benefits will depend on the successful integration of MTL into Carlisle's operations and the actualization of the projected cost synergies.It is important to monitor how Carlisle will leverage the Carlisle Operating System across MTL's business to drive growth and create value. The focus on innovation and sustainability commitments as part of the acquisition strategy also reflects an understanding of the evolving industry dynamics and consumer expectations, which could lead to long-term competitive advantages. Sustainability Expert The acquisition's emphasis on fulfilling sustainability commitments is noteworthy. As businesses increasingly prioritize sustainable practices, Carlisle's intent to invest in innovation within this space could lead to the development of more environmentally friendly products and solutions. This forward-thinking approach not only aligns with global sustainability trends but also resonates with a growing segment of consumers and investors who value corporate responsibility. The integration of MTL's offerings with Carlisle's existing products could result in a more comprehensive 'roof-to-grass' solution that meets both performance and sustainability criteria, potentially setting a new industry standard.The strategic pivot towards sustainability could also open up new markets and opportunities for Carlisle, as regulations and building codes continue to evolve in favor of green building practices. This could provide Carlisle with a competitive edge in bidding for projects with sustainability requirements and attract investors who are looking to support companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) profiles. 03/18/2024 - 06:47 PM Acquisition is consistent with Vision 2030 strategy to acquire superior building envelope products and solutions within Carlisle’s existing core MTL’s track record of above market growth for pre-fabricated edge metal driven by the same strong trends seen in Carlisle’s existing core businesses, and an unwavering commitment to the same superior customer focus as found in the Carlisle Experience Meaningful cost synergies of $13 million expected within the first three years A strong management team in place ready to continue MTL’s momentum and help to drive future growth of Carlisle’s architectural metals business Establishes Carlisle as an industry leader in the $4B architectural metal segment, adding approximately $0.60 of adjusted EPS in 2025 SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Carlisle Companies Incorporated (NYSE:CSL) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MTL Holdings (“MTL”) from GreyLion Partners, a leading U.S. private equity firm. MTL is a leading provider of pre-fabricated edge metal for commercial roofing systems. Under the terms of the agreement, Carlisle will purchase MTL for $410 million in cash. The purchase price represents 8.7x on MTL’s adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ending February 29, 2024, inclusive of run-rate cost synergies and net of the $43 million tax step up benefit provided by the transaction. MTL is widely recognized as a best-in-class provider of high-performance, pre-fabricated perimeter edge metal systems and non-insulated architectural metal wall systems for commercial, institutional, and industrial buildings. Its premium portfolio is comprised of a well-balanced assortment of complementary pre-fabricated edge metal products under the flagship brands of Metal-Era and Hickman. MTL’s portfolio includes non-insulated aluminum composite material (ACM) architectural wall panels under the Citadel brand. MTL establishes Carlisle as one of the industry’s most comprehensive providers of architectural metal products, including “roof-to-grass” color coordinated metal building envelope solutions. MTL generated revenue of $132 million for the twelve months ended February 29, 2024. Chris Koch, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The acquisition of MTL is consistent with Vision 2030 and our intent to build on our strategic pivot to a pure-play building products company with increased investment in innovation, a continued emphasis on synergistic M&A, attracting and retaining top talent, and fulfilling our sustainability commitments. By acquiring MTL and leveraging the Carlisle Operating System across the business, I am confident that we will create significant value for all our stakeholders. We look forward to welcoming Tony Mallinger and MTL’s talented team to Carlisle.” The acquisition is expected to generate cost synergies of approximately $13 million within the first three years, and be approximately $0.60 accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full fiscal year. The acquisition, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024. Dorsey & Whitney LLP served as legal counsel to Carlisle. William Blair & Company LLC served as exclusive financial advisor and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to MTL. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements, including those with respect to the acquisition of MTL, our ability to achieve expected cost synergies from the acquisition, our ability to realize transaction tax benefits, our ability to integrate MTL after the closing, and the anticipated timing of the closing of the transaction. These statements represent only Carlisle’s current belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of Carlisle’s control. Actual results could differ materially from those reflected in this press release for various reasons, including the failure of the parties to meet or waive closing conditions and the failure to receive required regulatory approvals. Carlisle disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements except as required by law. Non-GAAP Measures This press release also contains references to adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA, neither of which are recognized under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Carlisle believes that adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they allow for comparison to prior periods without the effect of items that, by their nature, tend to obscure core operating results due to potential variability across periods based on the timing, frequency and magnitude of such items. As a result, the Company believes that these measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze trends in business and evaluate performance relative to peer companies. The Company is not providing reconciliations for these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of adjusted items without unreasonable efforts. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could be material to financial results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Chevron and JX Sign MOU for Collaboration on Development of CCS Value Chain,2024-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration  and Chevron New Energies have signed a Memorandum Of Understanding to evaluate the export of Carbon Dioxide from Japan to Carbon Capture and Storage projects in Australia and the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to assess the feasibility of the CCS value chain and develop large-scale CCS hubs to advance lower carbon aspirations in the region.,"Chevron and JX Sign MOU for Collaboration on Development of CCS Value Chain Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration and Chevron New Energies have signed a Memorandum Of Understanding to evaluate the export of Carbon Dioxide from Japan to Carbon Capture and Storage projects in Australia and the Asia Pacific region. The collaboration aims to assess the feasibility of the CCS value chain and develop large-scale CCS hubs to advance lower carbon aspirations in the region. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Policy Analyst The signed MOU between JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corporation and Chevron New Energies signals a strategic move that aligns with global energy transition trends. The collaboration's focus on evaluating the feasibility of a CCS value chain is a proactive approach to address carbon emissions from industrial activities. The potential export of CO₂ from Japan to storage sites in Australia and the Asia Pacific region could create a new market dynamic, where carbon becomes a commodity that is captured, transported and stored, effectively creating a transnational carbon management system.While the immediate financial implications may not be clear, the long-term investment in CCS technology could position both companies as pioneers in the carbon management industry. This could lead to a competitive advantage as regulations on carbon emissions tighten globally. However, it's important to monitor the development of transboundary policies, as they will play a important role in the operationalization of such projects and may impact the speed and scale at which this market develops. Environmental Economist From an economic standpoint, the MOU presents a nuanced perspective on the emerging 'carbon economy'. The feasibility study into the CCS value chain suggests a market approach to environmental challenges, potentially transforming the cost of carbon emissions into a line item that can be traded, stored and possibly even securitized. This could incentivize industries to reduce their carbon footprint more aggressively if there is a financial gain associated with such reductions.However, the capital-intensive nature of CCS technology and infrastructure raises questions about the return on investment and the price of carbon that would make such ventures profitable. The economic viability will largely depend on the policy environment, carbon pricing mechanisms and the willingness of industries to participate in this system. A key consideration for stakeholders is the balance between environmental benefits and the economic costs of implementing and scaling CCS technologies. Sustainability Consultant The strategic partnership between JX and Chevron, through their focus on CCS, highlights the increasing importance of sustainability in corporate strategy. By positioning CCS as a central pillar of their decarbonization efforts, JX is signaling to shareholders and customers their commitment to environmental stewardship. This could enhance their corporate reputation and align them with investor and consumer preferences that are increasingly valuing sustainability.However, the long-term success of such initiatives will depend on technological advancements and cost reductions in CCS processes. Stakeholders should also consider the potential risks associated with CCS, such as the long-term integrity of storage sites and the energy required to capture and transport CO₂. The success of these projects will also hinge on public acceptance and the regulatory framework that governs such cross-border environmental efforts. 03/18/2024 - 08:00 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corporation (“JX”; President & CEO: Toshiya Nakahara) and Chevron New Energies (“Chevron”), a division of Chevron U.S.A.

The collaboration will also explore the opportunity to develop suitable transboundary policies and the potential development of CO₂ storage sites in other countries in the Asia Pacific region. “We look forward to building off our long-standing relationship with JX and ENEOS Group, the largest Japanese global petroleum and metals conglomerate, and hope that this joint study ultimately contributes to the further development of large-scale CCS hubs throughout the Asia Pacific region,” said Chris Powers, Vice President of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) at Chevron. “We believe large-scale CCS value chain projects will play a key role in advancing Asia Pacific’s lower carbon aspirations, and that long-term collaborations are necessary to meet these aspirations.” “This MOU is achieved thanks to the significant oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) relationship with Chevron that we have had over seven decades, and further demonstrates the commitment and dedication of the companies in helping advance lower carbon solutions,” said Tetsuo Yamada, Executive Vice President of JX. “JX has positioned CCS as an important initiative in its business strategy under its 'Two-Pronged' approach, in which, in addition to the conventional oil and natural gas development business, decarbonization initiatives centered on CCS/CCUS are another prong of the company's operations such as the Petra Nova CCUS project in Texas, USA. JX will contribute to the realization of a carbon-neutral society by leveraging the knowledge we have accumulated through our various CCS/CCUS-related businesses,” Yamada added.

Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 07:13 PM CERRITOS, Calif. , March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Korea Ginseng Corp. US (KGCUS) aka JungKwanJang launched their global representative ginseng product EVERYTIME in a new grapefruit flavor, promoted the Food as Medicine initiative, and introduced their new 2024 marketing slogan ""Rev Your Life"" at NPEW this year. This launch was an aim to encourage everyone to adopt a healthier lifestyle through optimized circulation as a means to address rising wellness trends. At the 2024 Natural Products Expo West, JungKwanJang, the world's number one ginseng brand, unveiled a new grapefruit flavor for the global representative ginseng product EVERYTIME to redefine industry standards. Ginseng, a revered medicinal ingredient, has a rich history spanning over 2,000 years and is celebrated for its disease-prevention and health-boosting properties. It is often known for its benefits in supporting healthy blood circulation, but more specifically in four ways: lowering cholesterol, dissolving blood clots, vasodilation, and strengthening blood vessels. Optimized circulation, in turn, boosts natural energy levels, improves cognitive functions, and strengthens immunity. Rooted in the age-old concept that food can enhance medical treatment, ginseng emerged as a key ingredient in culinary practices, notably in traditional dishes such as Samgyetang (Korean chicken soup) and in a plethora of beverages and snacks. This use of ginseng stems from its health benefits, which align with the principles of utilizing food to support well-being and treat ailments. Due to the repopularizing of holistic health trends, ginseng has become a leading ingredient in the worldwide Food as Medicine initiative. This movement positions food at the intersection of nutrition and healthcare, advocating for dietary choices that nourish the body. At the forefront of this movement is JungKwanJang's EVERYTIME, which offers the powerful advantages of Korean red ginseng in a format that is both modern and convenient. EVERYTIME now comes in a deliciously tart and sweet grapefruit flavor, combining Korean red ginseng extract with purified water in a portable stick pack for easy consumption on the go. Pioneering the stick pack format, EVERYTIME's name itself suggests its convenience, allowing for consumption anywhere, anytime. EVERYTIME grapefruit is not just a new flavor; it's a testament to JungKwanJang's commitment to innovation. It continues to dominate in six Asian nations and regions, owing to its ability to adapt to contemporary tastes while maintaining the integrity of traditional Korean red ginseng. The introduction of grapefruit as a new flavor is a response to a growing consumer demand for natural fruit flavors, contributing to people's well-being without compromising on taste. Moreover, EVERYTIME has established itself as the emblematic Korean red ginseng product internationally, thanks to the exceptional quality of JungKwanJang's Korean red ginseng. This global recognition is further boosted as people worldwide observe numerous Korean celebrities using EVERYTIME in various dramas and shows, enhancing its appeal and acceptance beyond Asia. Along with the new EVERYTIME grapefruit flavor, JungKwanJang introduced their 2024 marketing slogan 'Rev Your Life' at NPEW. The slogan 'Rev Your Life' encapsulates the essence of accelerating one's life towards better health through enhanced blood circulation. Research by Dr. Chul Min Ahn Et Al indicates that patients who consumed Korean red ginseng for eight months experienced a notable increase in blood flow within the coronary arteries and the major vessels that supply the heart, compared to those who were given a placebo. This improvement in blood circulation, clinically verified to increase energy levels and cognitive function, accentuates the significant health benefits of red ginseng in improving overall well-being. These benefits perfectly align with the 'Rev Your Life' initiative dedicated to encouraging individuals to adopt a healthier lifestyle. The Natural Products Expo West was an exciting and successful showcase for JungKwanJang's latest product this year. About Korea Ginseng Corp. Korea Ginseng Corp.

Positive None. Negative Potential delays in filing financial statements Working capital deficit due to delayed interest payments Possible need for Management Cease Trade Order if filings are delayed 03/18/2024 - 07:05 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EV Technology Group Ltd. (“EVTG” or the “Company”) (NEO: EVTG; OTC: EVTGF) announces today that it anticipates that it may be delayed in filing its audited annual financial statements (the “Statements”) for its financial year ended December 31, 2023 and the related Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Certifications by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (collectively the “Required Filings”). Under National Instrument 51-102 of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Required Filings are required to be made not later than April 1, 2024 (the “Deadline”). While every effort is being made to make the Required Filings as soon as possible, the Issuer is concerned that the Required Filings may not be made by the Deadline. Out of an abundance of caution in the event that the Company is unable to make the Required Filings by the Deadline, the Company applied to the Ontario Securities Commission (the “Principal Regulator”), British Columbia Securities Commission and Alberta Securities Commission pursuant to Part 3 of National Policy 12-203 (“NP 12-203”) for a Management Cease Trade Order (“MCTO”) as an alternative to a general Cease Trade Order in connection with the possible late filing (the “Default”) of the Required Filings. In the event that the MCTO is granted, it will remain in effect until the Default is remedied. The issuance of a management cease trade order generally does not affect the ability of persons who have not been directors, officers or insiders of the Company to trade in their securities. The delays are a direct consequence of delays in payment of interest receivable, due and payable quarterly, from Moke International Limited (“MIL”) pursuant to a US$5 million loan outstanding, which has resulted in a working capital deficit, leaving the Issuer unable to pay its auditors, McGovern Hurley LLP (the “Auditors”). Consequently, the Company requires additional time for its Auditors to complete the audit and release its audit report on the Statements. The Company is working on all alternatives to improve its working capital position, including raising external capital, debt financing and pursuing debt collection efforts against MIL. The Company anticipates that the Auditors will be able to complete the audit and the Company will be able to complete the Required Filings within the next ninety (90) calendar days. The Company confirms that it will satisfy the provisions of the alternative information guidelines under NP 12-203 by issuing bi-weekly default status reports in the form of news releases for so long as it remains in default of the filing requirements described above. The Company has not taken any steps towards any insolvency proceeding and the Company confirms that there is no material information relating to its affairs that has not been generally disclosed. The MCTO prohibits trading in securities of the Company, whether direct or indirect, by: (a) the Company’s Chief Executive Officer; (b) the Company’s Chief Financial Officer; and (c) the members of the board of directors of the Company or other persons or companies who had, or may have had, access directly or indirectly to any material fact or material change with respect to the Company that has not been generally disclosed. Should the Company fail to make its Required Filings on or before April 1, 2024, the Principal Regulator can impose a cease trade order that all trading in securities of the Company cease for such period of time as the Principal Regulator may deem appropriate. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information This press release contains ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking information includes, without limitation, statements regarding the potential Default, including the Company’s ability to make the Required Filings prior to April 1, 2024.

The correction also includes accurate gas volume reporting and pricing adjustments for both oil and gas. Positive None. Negative The cash distribution for unit holders decreased due to lower gas production and increased capital costs, impacting overall revenue negatively. There was a decrease in oil volumes produced on the Texas Royalty Properties, along with a decrease in the price of oil, affecting the Trust's financial performance. The correction in gas volume reporting highlights previous inaccuracies in the Trust's financial disclosures, potentially impacting investor trust. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Permian Basin Royalty Trust (PBT) regarding corrections to their previous distribution figures is a noteworthy event for investors. The corrected decrease in the cash distribution from the previous month suggests a potential concern regarding the Trust's production efficiency and capital cost management. The Trust's financial health is closely linked to the performance of its underlying properties and any fluctuation in production or commodity prices directly impacts the cash distributions to unit holders.Investors should note the decrease in production of gas and the increase in capital costs, which are critical factors that could signal operational challenges or increased investment in infrastructure. However, the increase in oil production and pricing on the Waddell Ranch Properties may provide a buffer to these challenges. The decrease in oil volumes and price on the Texas Royalty Properties, on the other hand, could be a red flag that warrants close monitoring.The corrections to the gas volume reporting, while technical, are significant as they reflect on the transparency and accuracy of the Trust's financial reporting. It is essential for investors to have reliable data to make informed decisions and discrepancies like these could affect investor confidence. The revised figures also provide a more accurate picture of the Trust's performance and may impact the valuation of PBT's units. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the update from Permian Basin Royalty Trust provides valuable information that could influence market sentiment towards PBT's stock. The distribution correction might be perceived negatively, as it indicates a downward revision, which could lead to bearish behavior among investors. Moreover, the detailed breakdown of production and price adjustments for oil and gas offers insights into the commodity market's influence on royalty trusts.Understanding the nuances of the energy sector's pricing dynamics, such as the disparity between oil and gas prices on different properties, can aid investors in assessing the risk profile of energy-related investments. The increased gas prices on the Texas Royalty Properties, for instance, may be viewed as a positive sign amid the overall decrease in distribution, suggesting a potential area of resilience within the Trust's portfolio.Market participants should also consider the long-term implications of the Trust's ability to manage its properties efficiently. The correction of previously unreported plant product volumes into the gas volume number could indicate an improvement in reporting standards, which might restore trust among investors over time. Energy Sector Analyst Examining the corrections issued by Permian Basin Royalty Trust, one must consider the operational aspects that led to the revised distribution figures. The decrease in gas production and the consequent decrease in cash distribution point to underlying operational issues that may affect future performance. The energy sector is highly sensitive to such operational metrics and stakeholders typically scrutinize production volumes and capital expenditures for signs of efficiency and growth potential.The increase in capital costs is particularly noteworthy as it suggests that the Trust is investing in its assets, which could lead to improved production capabilities or resource recovery in the future. However, such investments often come with upfront costs that can impact short-term cash flows. Investors should weigh these capital expenditures against potential long-term benefits.Additionally, the adjustments to gas volume reporting to include plant product volumes align with industry standards and improve the accuracy of the Trust's disclosures. These corrections are essential for analysts and investors who rely on precise data to evaluate the Trust's asset performance and project future cash flows. The corrected gas pricing also reflects a more accurate market value, which is important for assessing the Trust's profitability and competitive position within the energy sector. 03/18/2024 - 06:43 PM DALLAS, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Argent Trust Company, as Trustee of the Permian Basin Royalty Trust (NYSE: PBT) (""Permian"" or the ""Trust"") today announced corrections to its press release from earlier today that declared a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.041340 per unit, payable on April 12, 2024, to unit holders of record on March 28, 2024. The per unit distribution amount was not changed due to the reporting errors listed below. The original release contained two errors that the Trustee would like to correct. Those items are outlined as follows. This month's distribution was a decrease from the previous month as opposed to the stated increase. The cash distribution in February was $0.045460 compared to the previously reported $.041340, a decrease of $0.00412 per unit. This was due to a decrease in the production of gas and an increase in capital costs, offset by an increase in production of oil and increases in the pricing of both oil and gas on the Waddell Ranch Properties. There was a decrease in oil volumes produced on the Texas Royalty Properties, along with a decrease in the price of oil. The gas pricing for the Texas Royalty Properties increased, partially offset by a decrease in gas volume for the month. A correction is being made to the reporting of the gas volume amount for the Waddell Ranch properties. Plant product volumes have not previously been added to the gas volume number. This is being corrected for this month and the prior month's reported volumes in the tables below. In addition, the gas price reported last month for the Waddell Ranch is also updated below to reflect the new calculation, which is a standard calculation, used for this month's reporting.

Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 08:00 PM ROCKVILLIE, Md. and SUZHOU, China, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Innovent Biologics, Inc. (""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of cancer, metabolic, autoimmune and other major diseases, today announced that the primary endpoint has been met in the second Phase 2 clinical study of efdamrofusp alfa high-dose, a recombinant human VEGFR-Fc-Human CR1 fusion protein injection (R&D code: IBI302), in Chinese subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). According to the results of the two Phase 2 clinical studies conducted in more than 360 subjects of nAMD, compared with Aflibercept, IBI302 can be administrated in long-interval (every 12 weeks), while providing a stable and robust visual benefit and anatomic improvements, as well as potential inhibition effect in macular atrophy. Based on those results, Innovent advanced IBI302 8mg into a Phase 3 clinical study STAR in October 2023. This was a randomized, double-masked, active-controlled Phase 2 clinical study (NCT05403749), evaluating the longer interval of intravitreal injection of high-dose IBI302 in subjects with nAMD. A total of 132 subjects were randomized 1: 1: 1 to IBI302 6.4 mg group, IBI302 8.0 mg group, or Aflibercept 2.0 mg group. After the loading therapy, subjects in IBI302 6.4 mg group and 8.0 mg group were dosed with adjusted intervals of every 8 weeks (Q8W) or every 12 weeks (Q12W), depending on response to loading therapy. Subjects in Aflibercept 2.0 mg group were dosed Q8W after the loading therapy. The primary endpoint was the change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye from baseline to week 40. The study lasted for 52 weeks. The results showed that the primary endpoint was successfully met: at week 40, the IBI302 6.4 mg and 8.0 mg groups showed non-inferior BCVA gains to the Aflibercept 2.0 mg group. The mean BCVA improvement from baseline was 10.5 ETDRS letters for the IBI302 6.4 mg group, 11.0 ETDRS letters for the IBI302 8.0 mg group, and 9.8 ETDRS letters for the Aflibercept 2.0 mg group at week 40. The mean change from baseline in central subfield thickness (CST) was -163.19 μm for the IBI302 6.4 mg group, -184.46 μm for the IBI302 8.0 mg group, and -108.23 μm for the Aflibercept 2.0 mg group at week 40. In addition, approximately 81%, 88% of subjects in 6.4 mg IBI302 groups and 8.0mg IBI302 groups respectively were able to extend dosing interval to Q12W, similar to that in the proportion of subjects dosed Q12W or longer with Aflibercept 8.0 mg (83% in PULSAR trial)1 or Faricimab (TENAYA & LUCERNE trial, with 79.7% and 77.8% respectively)2 by indirect comparison. Based on the excellent long-interval dosing performance in the Phase 2 studies, the Phase 3 study STAR added Q16W dosing interval regimen for IBI302. The overall safety profile of IBI302 was favorable, comparable to Aflibercept 2.0 mg, and consistent with previous studies. No new safety signals were identified. Detailed study data will be further analyzed and published in the near future. Professor Xiaodong Sun, Principal Investigator of the Study, Head of National Center for Clinical Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, stated: ""Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs is currently the first-line treatment for nAMD, but there are still unmet clinical needs given their frequent intravitreal injection and gradual loss of visual benefits. Exploring longer interval dosing and anti-macular atrophy are necessary and urgent. IBI302 is a global first-in-class anti-VEGF-anti-complement bispecific molecule. As the principal investigator for IBI302 trials, I am very pleased to see that this Phase 2 study met the primary endpoint and demonstrated the potential for long-interval dosing. These results will be further validated in the pivotal trial of IBI302. I look forward to providing a new treatment option for nAMD patients."" Dr. Lei Qian, Vice President of Clinical Development of Innovent, stated: ""There are two major trends in drug development for nAMD: extending dosing intervals and reducing the occurrence of macular atrophy. In the results of two Phase 2 studies, which enrolled over 360 subjects, IBI302 improved BCVA and macular edema in patients with nAMD significantly, extended dosing intervals, and had the potential to prevent the development of macular atrophy. Next, we will further investigate the long-interval dosing efficacy and safety of high-dose IBI302 in the Phase 3 STAR trial, hoping to bring a new generation of anti-VEGF agents to patients with nAMD."" About neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive ocular disease involving the macular retina, leading to central visual impairment, the incidence of which increases with age. Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is one of the major forms of AMD, accounting for 15% to 20% of all AMD patients and is the leading cause of central vision loss in AMD patients over 65 years3. The incidence of AMD is increasing year by year in China, and it has become the third leading cause of blindness in China. The pathogenesis of nAMD has not been fully elucidated. It is generally accepted that angiogenesis induced by increased expression of VEGF is the main cause of nAMD, and inflammatory reaction mediated by abnormal activation of complement is also considered to be an important cause of AMD. Ocular anti-VEGF agents have led to significant visual benefits and changed the course of nAMD, but the frequent dosing (every 4 or 8 weeks) currently places a heavy burden on patients, families and society. In addition, the visual benefits of anti-VEGF drug therapy are gradually diminished year by year. In approximately two thirds of nAMD patients with a follow-up for over 7 years, the visual gains from anti-VEGF treatment significantly diminish4. Macular atrophy or retinal fibrosis are important causes of vision loss after long-term anti-VEGF therapy. Currently, drug development for nAMD is mainly focusing on extending the dosing intervals, and there are few drugs under investigation for macular atrophy or retinal fibrosis. Two drugs targeting complement have been approved by the US FDA in 20235,6 for the treatment of geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD. About Efdamrofusp Alfa (IBI302) IBI302 is a recombinant fully human bispecific fusion protein of Innovent Biologics with global proprietary rights. The N-terminus is a VEGF domain that can bind to the VEGF family, block VEGF-mediated signaling pathway, inhibit vascular epithelium proliferation and angiogenesis, and improve vasopermeability and reduce leakage. The C-terminus of IBI302 is the complement binding domain that can inhibit the activation of the classic pathway and alternative pathway of complement through the specific binding of C3b and C4b, and reduce the inflammatory response mediated by the complement. IBI302 may exert its therapeutic effect by inhibiting both VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and complement activation pathways.

Financial services revenue saw a substantial 24.4% growth, fueled by MSMB clients. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 20% growth in TPV for MSMB clients is a significant indicator of StoneCo's market penetration and operational efficiency. This figure surpasses the industry average, suggesting a competitive advantage and potential market share gains. The substantial increase in adjusted EBT of 131.6% compared to the previous quarter underlines a robust profitability trajectory. Such a performance could signal strong financial health and may result in positive investor sentiment, potentially influencing StoneCo's stock valuation positively.Moreover, the expansion of the MSMB customer base by 37.4% year-over-year is not only indicative of StoneCo's aggressive customer acquisition strategy but also reflects the scalability of its business model. The growth in deposits on the banking platform by 52.1% year-over-year further demonstrates the increasing trust and reliance of StoneCo's customers on its financial ecosystem. These trends are likely to contribute to the stability and growth of recurring revenue streams. Market Research Analyst StoneCo's strategic focus on integrating software business across key sectors such as Retail, Gas Stations, Food and Pharmacies, is a move towards diversification and capturing a larger slice of the payment processing market. The 19% increase in payment volumes within these verticals is a testament to the effectiveness of this strategy. However, the slight reduction in adjusted Software EBITDA margin, albeit accompanied by restructuring costs, warrants attention to ensure that profitability is not being sacrificed for growth.Investments in the credit portfolio and share buybacks reflect a proactive approach to capital allocation, which may enhance shareholder value in the long term. The company's strong cash position provides it with the flexibility to navigate market conditions and invest in growth opportunities. The change in board composition, while not directly impacting financial metrics, could bring fresh perspectives to the company's strategic direction. Risk Management Analyst The growth in StoneCo's credit portfolio to R$309 million, while relatively modest, indicates the company's cautious yet expanding foothold in the credit market. The emphasis on risk management practices in this announcement suggests a prudent approach to credit expansion, which is important in maintaining financial stability and minimizing defaults. The ability to manage risk effectively in this segment will be key to sustaining growth without incurring significant credit losses, especially in an environment where economic conditions can change rapidly. 03/18/2024 - 06:42 PM 20% Growth in the MSMB total payment volume (TPV), double the industry average, according to ABECS Adjusted EBT of R$638 million, a 131.6% increase compared to 4T22 The MSMB customer base grew by 37.4% year-over-year, reaching nearly 3.5 million active customersSÃO PAULO, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- StoneCo Ltd.

Adjusted Software EBITDA reached R$58.7 million in 4Q23, with a margin of 16.2%, compared to R$59.6 million and a margin of 15.8% in 4Q22.

The company reports strong financial results for the fourth quarter, despite some challenges. Positive Record-high Total Transaction Volume of RMB194.3 billion in 2023, up 10.8% from 2022. Net Revenues reached RMB12.5 billion in 2023, up 12.7% from 2022. International Transaction Volume increased by 84.7% in 2023, contributing 17.0% of total net revenues. International Revenues increased by 85.9% in 2023, reaching RMB2.1 billion. Cumulative registered users in China reached 155.6 million, with 25.2 million borrowers. Average loan size in China was RMB9,044, and the average loan tenure was 8.2 months. International market saw significant growth with 24.6 million registered users and 4.8 million borrowers. Net revenue for Q4 2023 was RMB3,223.6 million, up 5.7% from the same period in 2022. Net profit for Q4 2023 was RMB528.8 million, a decrease of 4.9% from Q4 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income for Q4 2023 was RMB547.0 million, down 14.2% from Q4 2022. Cash and cash equivalents stood at RMB4,969.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The company deployed approximately US$160.0 million in dividend distributions and share repurchases in 2023. Negative Net profit decreased by 4.9% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased by 14.2% in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The reported increase in Total Transaction Volume and Net Revenues for FinVolution Group indicates a robust financial performance in the fiscal year 2023. The significant growth in the International Transaction Volume and corresponding revenues suggests a successful expansion strategy. However, the decline in net profit for the fourth quarter, despite revenue growth, raises questions about the company's cost management and margin pressures.Investors should note the increase in the 90 day+ delinquency ratio, which could indicate potential risks in loan quality. The company's liquidity position and commitment to shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases reflect a solid balance sheet and confidence in ongoing operations. Yet, the effectiveness of these capital allocation strategies should be continually assessed against the backdrop of evolving market conditions. Market Research Analyst FinVolution's performance highlights the growing fintech market's potential, especially in international expansion. The 85.9% growth in international revenues underscores the demand for digital financial services globally. This trend aligns with the increasing digitalization of financial transactions and the opening of new markets for fintech services. However, competition is likely to intensify as more players enter this space.The company's user and borrower growth metrics offer valuable insights into market penetration and customer acquisition effectiveness. Nonetheless, the drop in the number of unique borrowers in the China market and the increased delinquency rates could signal market saturation or increased credit risk, which may affect future growth trajectories and profitability. Economist FinVolution's results reflect broader economic trends, such as increased digital consumption and cross-border financial integration. The strong performance in international markets may be partly attributed to the global economic recovery post-pandemic. However, the reported 4.9% decrease in net profit for Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, despite revenue growth, suggests that macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate fluctuations, or increased default rates could be impacting margins.From an economic standpoint, the company's strategic focus on international markets could be a hedge against domestic economic downturns. However, this also exposes the company to foreign exchange risk and regulatory challenges in different jurisdictions. The capital return program indicates a potentially positive economic outlook from the company's management, but it should be evaluated in the context of the overall economic environment and investment opportunities. 03/18/2024 - 06:30 PM -2023 Full Year Total Transaction Volume reached new record high of RMB194.3 billion, up 10.8% compared to Fiscal Year 2022- -2023 Full Year Net Revenues reached new record high to RMB12.5 billion, up 12.7% compared to Fiscal Year 2022- -2023 Full Year International Transaction Volume increased to RMB7.85 billion, up 84.7% compared to Fiscal Year 2022- -2023 Full Year International Revenues increased to RMB2.1 billion, up 85.9% compared to Fiscal Year 2022 and contributing 17.0% of total net revenues- SHANGHAI, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- FinVolution Group (""FinVolution"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: FINV), a leading fintech platform, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

Mr. Jiayuan Xu, FinVolution's Chief Financial Officer, continued, ""Our strong full-year financial results speak for our outstanding strategic execution throughout 2023.

Loan facilitation service fees decreased by 8.4% to RMB1,107.4 million (US$156.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB1,208.6 million for the same period of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in service fee rates, partially offset by the increase in transaction volume. Post-facilitation service fees maintained relatively stable at RMB495.4 million (US$69.8 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB496.4 million for the same period of 2022, as the result of the increase in outstanding loans served by the Company and the rolling impact of deferred transaction fees. Guarantee income increased by 37.7% to RMB1,267.5 million (US$178.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB920.6 million for the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the increased outstanding loan balance of off-balance sheet loans, higher guarantee rates and the rolling impact of deferred guarantee income. The fair value of quality assurance commitment upon loan origination is released as guarantee income systematically over the term of the loans subject to quality assurance commitment. Net interest income decreased by 22.3% to RMB227.4 million (US$32.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, from RMB292.5 million for the same period of 2022, due to the decrease in loan volume and outstanding loan balances of on-balance sheet loans. Other revenue decreased by 4.6% to RMB125.8 million (US$17.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB131.8 million for the same period of 2022, primarily due to the disposal of a pilot-run business. Origination, servicing expenses and other costs of revenue increased by 9.1% to RMB563.1 million (US$79.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB516.2 million for the same period of 2022, primarily due to the increase in facilitation costs and loan collection expenses as a result of higher transaction volume. Sales and marketing expenses remained relatively stable at RMB491.4 million (US$69.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB490.7 million for the same period of 2022, as we maintained our proactive efforts in acquiring better quality borrowers in both China and the international markets. Research and development expenses decreased by 7.2% to RMB127.6 million (US$18.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB137.5 million for the same period of 2022, due to the increase in efficiency for technology development.

Provision for accounts receivable and contract assets decreased by 67.6% to RMB36.4 million (US$5.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB112.5 million for the same period of 2022, due to the decrease in provision from other third-party platforms. Provision for loans receivable decreased by 14.6% to RMB107.6 million (US$15.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, from RMB126.0 million for the same period of 2022, primarily due to the decrease in loan volume and outstanding loan balances of on-balance sheet loans, partially offset by the rise in delinquency rate. Credit losses for quality assurance commitment increased by 35.6% to RMB1,269.5 million (US$178.8 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with RMB935.9 million for the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increases in loan volume and outstanding loan balances in both China and the international markets. Operating profit decreased by 16.9% to RMB512.8 million (US$72.2 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023 from RMB616.8 million for the same period of 2022.

Income tax expense was RMB51.6 million (US$7.3 million) for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with RMB125.0 million for the same period of 2022.

Post-facilitation service fees increased by 2.1% to RMB1,969.7 million (US$277.4 million) for 2023 from RMB1,929.9 million in 2022, primarily due to the increase in outstanding loans served by the Company and the rolling impact of deferred transaction fees, partially offset by the decrease in the average rate of transaction fees. Guarantee income increased by 46.2% to RMB4,479.0 million (US$630.9 million) for 2023 from RMB3,064.4 million in 2022.

Net interest income for 2023 decreased by 10.6% to RMB1,049.4 million (US$147.8 million) compared with RMB1,174.2 million in 2022, due to the decrease in loan volume and outstanding loan balances of on-balance sheet loans.

Business Outlook While the macroeconomic recovery continued to gain traction with pockets of improvement in the beginning of 2024, uncertainties persist in the markets in which we operate. The Company has observed encouraging signs of recovery and will continue to closely monitor macro conditions across our pan-Asian markets and remain prudent in our business operations. Given this backdrop, the Company currently expects its full-year 2024 transaction volume for the China market to be in the range of RMB195.7 billion to RMB205.0 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 5.0% to 10.0%. At the same time, the Company expects full-year 2024 transaction volume for its international markets to be in the range of RMB9.4 billion to RMB11.0 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 20.0% to 40.0%. The above forecast is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company's current preliminary views and expectations on market and operational conditions and the regulatory and operating environment, as well as customer and institutional partners' demands, all of which are subject to change.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results of JOYY Inc. for Q4 and the full year of 2023 indicate a mixed performance, with a notable recovery in net income despite a decrease in net revenues year-over-year. The increase in net income, from a net loss in the previous year, is particularly significant as it suggests successful cost optimization and operational efficiency improvements. Additionally, the company's strategy of reducing spending on user acquisition seems to have contributed positively to the bottom line, although it has resulted in a decline in average mobile MAUs for some platforms.From an investment perspective, the growth in the number of paying users and a slight increase in gross margin are positive signals. However, investors should be cautious about the decline in total net revenues and the potential impact of macroeconomic uncertainties on the company's outlook for Q1 2024. The share repurchase program indicates confidence by the management in the company's value, which might be seen as a positive sign for shareholder value. The legal dispute with Baidu over the termination of the YY Live sale agreement introduces an element of risk and uncertainty that requires close monitoring. Market Research Analyst The social media and live streaming industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. JOYY Inc.'s operational highlights, such as the increase in global average mobile MAUs and the rise in the total number of paying users, suggest resilience in user engagement and monetization in a challenging environment. The company's focus on globalization through localization indicates an understanding of the need for tailored content to different regions, which could be a key driver for future growth.However, the decline in average mobile MAUs for Likee and Hago due to reduced advertising spend could signal a strategic shift or a response to increased customer acquisition costs. This trend, if not managed carefully, could affect the company's long-term user base and revenue potential. The slight decrease in average revenue per paying user may also warrant attention as it could indicate increased competition or market saturation. Legal Expert The termination notice from Baidu regarding the sale of YY Live introduces a potential legal dispute that could have financial and operational repercussions for JOYY Inc. The outcome of this matter could involve significant financial adjustments and may affect investor confidence. It is essential for investors to understand the implications of this development, as it could involve lengthy legal proceedings and potential financial settlements.The company's decision to seek legal advice and consider all options is a prudent step, but stakeholders should be prepared for possible outcomes that could impact the company's financials and strategic direction. The lack of control over YY Live and the non-consolidation of its financials post-termination notice is a critical factor that could alter the company's reported earnings and valuation metrics going forward. 03/18/2024 - 07:00 PM SINGAPORE, March 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JOYY Inc.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). JOYY uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating (loss) margin, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest of JOYY, non-GAAP net income (loss) margin attributable to controlling interest of JOYY, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of JOYY, and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) per ADS, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures adjusted from the most comparable U.S. GAAP results. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) is operating income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, and gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and business. Non-GAAP operating (loss) margin is non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income (loss) is net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain (loss) on disposal and deemed disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments (referring to share of income (loss) from equity method investments resulting from non-recurring or non-cash items of the equity method investments), gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and derivative, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value, and income tax effects of the above non-GAAP reconciling items. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest of JOYY is net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest of JOYY excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain (loss) on disposal and deemed disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and derivative, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value, income tax effects of the above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. Non-GAAP net income (loss) margin is non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to controlling interest of JOYY as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of JOYY is net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of JOYY excluding share-based compensation expenses, impairment of goodwill and investments, amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain (loss) on disposal and deemed disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and derivative, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value, accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries’ preferred shareholders, gain on repurchase of redeemable convertible preferred shares of a subsidiary and income tax effects of above non-GAAP reconciling items and adjustments for non-GAAP reconciling items for the net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders. After the non-GAAP adjustment, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to controlling interests of JOYY is equal to the non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of JOYY. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income (loss) per ADS is non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders of JOYY divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per ADS. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of above reconciling items adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measure for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the non-cash effect of (i) share-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and derivative, interest expenses related to the convertible bonds’ amortization to face value, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business, (ii) impairment of goodwill and investments, gain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries and business, gain (loss) on disposal and deemed disposal of investments, gain (loss) on fair value change of investments, reconciling items on the share of equity method investments, accretion, cumulative dividend and deemed dividend to subsidiaries’ preferred shareholders and gain on repurchase of redeemable convertible preferred shares of a subsidiary which may not be recurring in its business, and (iii) income tax expenses and non-GAAP adjustments for net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest shareholders, which are affected by the above non-GAAP reconciling items. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company’s net income (loss) for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “JOYY Inc. Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” near the end of this press release.

The Company has been considering and evaluating various strategic funding and financing alternatives in order to raise capital. Possible funding alternatives considered have included a variety of sources, including but not limited to litigation funding agreements, offerings of equity or debt securities, loans, or any combination thereof with third parties, existing shareholders of the Company and/or Company management. Equity Offering; Commencement and Summary of Terms In order to provide the necessary cash resources to continue operations and continue the litigation related to the 111 West 57th Property, and repay amounts currently owed, on February 28, 2024, the Company has commenced a private placement offering (the ""Equity Offering"") of 44,200,460 shares (the ""Shares"") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""Common Stock""). The following is a description of the principal terms of, and the means by which interested and qualified stockholders of the Company may participate in, the Equity Offering. The purchase price for one share of Common Stock in the Equity Offering is $0.20. The Company expects to receive gross proceeds of approximately $8.8 million in connection with the Equity Offering before deducting offering expenses. There are no limitations on the Company's use of such proceeds when received, although it is anticipated that a substantial part of the proceeds will be applied to repayment of existing Company obligations. The Shares are not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), and are being offered pursuant to the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, and Rule 506(c) promulgated thereunder. As such, the Shares will be ""restricted securities"" under the Securities Act and will generally be subject to a minimum holding period of six months under Rule 144 before the Shares may be resold. The Shares will be offered and sold only to existing stockholders of record of the Company as of February 28, 2024 (the ""Record Date""). Each qualifying stockholder will be permitted to purchase up to his, her or its pro rata share of the Shares in the Equity Offering, based on the amount of shares of Common Stock owned by such stockholder as of the Record Date, in an amount equal to up to one hundred and eight and one-half percent (108.5%) of the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such stockholder as of the Record Date. For example, a qualifying stockholder who owned 10,000 shares as of the Record Date would be eligible to purchase up to 10,850 Shares. Only those stockholders who qualify as accredited investors under Rule 501(a) of Regulation D of the Securities Act may purchase Shares in the Equity Offering, and each such stockholder will be required to provide documentary evidence that he, she or it qualifies as an accredited investor. The Equity Offering commenced on or about February 28, 2024, and will remain open for a period of thirty (30) calendar days ending on March 29, 2024 (the ""Subscription Deadline""). The Shares will be offered and sold pursuant to a Subscription Agreement (the ""Subscription Agreement"") to be entered into by and between the Company and each subscribing stockholder (each, a ""Purchaser"" and collectively, the ""Purchasers""). The Subscription Agreement provides for a disclosure package consisting solely of the Company's current Exchange Act filings, includes a required investor questionnaire, a required confirmation of record or beneficial ownership, and contains customary representations and warranties and agreements of the Company and the Purchasers and customary indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. The foregoing summary of the Subscription Agreement is qualified entirely by reference the Form of Subscription Agreement that is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. Interested prospective Purchasers may download or reproduce a copy of the Subscription Agreement, complete it and the accompanying investor questionnaire and confirmation, and follow the instructions contained therein for delivery of the documentation and the applicable purchase price to the Company. The Subscription Agreement will be available for download from the following link: http://amstock.mobular.net/amstock/ABCP. In connection with the Equity Offering, the Company also entered into a standby purchase agreement (the ""Standby Purchase Agreement"") with BARC Investments, LLC (""BARC""), an affiliate of the Company owned and controlled by Company directors Alessandra F. Bianco and Richard A. Bianco, Jr. and their sibling Christina Bianco. Under the terms of the Standby Purchase Agreement: BARC has subscribed to purchase its pro rata share of Shares in the Equity Offering at $0.20 per Share;BARC has agreed to act as a standby purchaser and shall subscribe to purchase all of the Shares that are not otherwise validly subscribed for by other stockholders by the Subscription Deadline at $0.20 per Share; andBARC was granted a contractual preemptive right to participate in future equity offerings by the Company to maintain its percentage ownership in the Company as measured following the completion of the Equity Offering.The Standby Purchase Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and agreements of the Company and BARC and customary indemnification rights and obligations of the parties, in each case substantially the same as contained in the Subscription Agreement.The foregoing description of the Standby Purchase Agreement is qualified entirely by reference to that agreement. The form of Standby Purchase Agreement filed as an exhibit to filings by the Company under the Exchange Act. The Equity Offering is expected to be completed promptly within five business days following the Subscription Deadline. However, there can be no assurance that the Equity Offering will be completed within the timeframe contemplated or at all, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure any such funding and/or financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the net proceeds of the Equity Offering, when it is completed, will be sufficient to meet all of the Company's future funding requirements. Other Related Matters The Company will continue to consider and explore other litigation funding agreements with third party litigation funders that it could enter into for portions of the litigation costs for up to $5 million of funding, at market terms to be agreed upon at such times. In general litigation funding agreements are structured so that the litigation funder would receive back their initial funding amount first (i.e. before any recovery is received by the Company), plus an additional multiple of 1.0 times to 3.5 times the amount funded (depending on various factors), plus depending on the funder, additional fees, expenses, interest and potentially an additional percentage of the total recovery received. The Board of Directors of the Company also anticipates that at the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ""Annual Meeting""), anticipated to be held in June 2024, the Company's stockholders will be asked to consider and authorize an Amendment to the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue. The details of matters to be voted on by stockholders will be included in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting.

Strategic priorities for 2024 focus on expanding the mining fleet, growing Bit Digital AI revenue, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 39% increase in total revenue and 21% increase in bitcoin production for Bit Digital, Inc. indicates a strong financial performance in the digital asset sector. The company's strategic expansion into AI infrastructure and diversification of its mining operations across geographies, particularly in areas with access to clean energy, reflect a proactive approach to managing the volatility associated with digital assets. Their focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with zero debt ahead of the anticipated bitcoin 'halving' event demonstrates prudent financial management. This could potentially buffer the company against revenue fluctuations that may arise from changes in bitcoin mining rewards.Moreover, the company's strong liquidity position, with total liquidity of approximately $81.2 million, suggests that it has sufficient resources to fund its growth initiatives and withstand short-term market pressures. The sale-leaseback agreement for AI servers also indicates a strategic use of capital to finance growth while preserving liquidity. Investors should note that while the company's growth in revenue and expansion into AI are positive signs, the volatile nature of digital asset prices could impact future financial stability and should be monitored closely. Market Research Analyst Bit Digital's operational expansion into Iceland and strategic partnerships for increased hosting capacity, such as the agreements with Soluna Computing and Dory Creek, underline the company's commitment to geographic and operational diversification. The shift towards sustainable practices with 93% of the fleet's electricity consumption being carbon-free is a significant step that aligns with the growing investor interest in environmentally responsible mining practices. This could enhance the company's reputation and appeal to a broader investor base concerned with ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) factors.The launch of Bit Digital AI and the service agreement to provide computational power from GPUs are indicative of the company's efforts to capitalize on the burgeoning AI industry. The initial contribution of approximately $4 million in revenue from the AI business line in February 2024 suggests that this new venture could become a substantial revenue stream, diversifying the company's income sources beyond bitcoin mining. It is essential to track the adoption rate and market demand for AI infrastructure services, as these will be key determinants of the new business line's success. Cryptocurrency Expert The increase in Bit Digital's bitcoin and ethereum production, coupled with the expansion of their mining fleet and the active hash rate, suggests a strategic positioning to capitalize on the potential increase in digital asset prices. The company's treasury holdings of BTC and ETH, valued at approximately $27.2 million and $34.5 million respectively, represent a significant asset that could provide substantial gains if the market continues its upward trend.However, the write-off of a considerable number of bitcoin and ethereum miners raises questions about the efficiency and obsolescence of mining equipment, which is a critical aspect in the mining industry. The upcoming bitcoin 'halving' event, which will reduce the reward for mining new blocks, could also affect the company's profitability. This event emphasizes the importance of fleet efficiency and low production costs, as highlighted by management. Investors should be aware of the potential impact of these industry-specific factors on Bit Digital's performance. 03/18/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Digital, Inc.

The year began with the price of bitcoin near cyclical lows and ended on a trajectory that would propel the asset to new all-time highs in 2024. Despite the improvement in the price of bitcoin, our core mission remains unchanged; to build a company that can successfully endure all phases of the bitcoin price cycle. We enacted numerous changes to our bitcoin mining hosting portfolio during 2023, ending the year with six hosting partners and seven operating sites across three countries. Notably, we expanded our operations into Iceland during 2023, providing Bit Digital with geographic diversification outside of North America and into a region with an abundance of clean energy and supportive government policies. We will continue to focus our expansion areas in areas that provide cost-effective, carbon-free energy sources. As we consider our growth targets for 2024, our focus is on improving our overall fleet efficiency and lowering our production cost. Bit Digital enacted a growth strategy in 2023 which prioritized maintaining a formidable balance sheet ahead of the 'halving' which is expected to occur during April 2024. We ended 2023 with a strong liquidity position and zero debt, and our liquidity position has improved materially since year-end in sympathy with rising digital asset prices. We also managed to more than double our active hash rate compared to the end of 2022, leading to a 21% increase in total bitcoin production. We announced the launch of a new business line, Bit Digital AI, during the fall of 2023. This business aims to provide AI-focused clients with digital infrastructure services, including GPU rental services. It was important to us that we didn't merely announce an ambition, but a real business, and this business line has already begun to contribute meaningful revenue to Bit Digital (approximately $4 million during February 2024). This enterprise draws on our core competencies as a bitcoin miner, and we believe we are on a credible path to materially expanding the scope of this business line. We look forward to demonstrating the earnings power from this business as the year progresses.""

(Nasdaq: ARVN), a clinical-stage biotechnology company creating a new class of drugs based on targeted protein degradation, today announced the appointment of Noah Berkowitz, M.D., Ph.D., to the role of Chief Medical Officer and a member of the Executive Committee reporting to President and Chief Executive Officer John Houston, Ph.D. Effective today, Dr. Berkowitz will lead the ongoing clinical development of Arvinas’ PROTAC® protein degrader programs in oncology and neuroscience. “We are thrilled to have Dr. Berkowitz join Arvinas as we continue advancing multiple programs with the goal of improving the lives of patients with serious diseases,” said John Houston, Ph.D., Chairperson, President and Chief Executive Officer at Arvinas. “Noah’s vision, expertise, and proven track record in designing and launching successful clinical programs across all stages of clinical development complement our rapidly advancing portfolio of novel PROTAC protein degraders. His leadership and experience will be invaluable as we approach our first Phase 3 data readout and continue progressing multiple ongoing and planned clinical-stage programs.” Dr. Berkowitz has more than 20 years of experience in advancing programs through early and late stages of development, with proven ability in leading clinical development, regulatory, and medical affairs. He has led multidisciplinary teams and has extensive knowledge of clinical trial design and execution. Dr. Berkowitz joins Arvinas from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), where he was Senior Vice President, Development Unit Head, Hematology. While at BMS, Dr. Berkowitz’s teams achieved initial or subsequent global indications for Abecma®, Breyanzi®, Reblozyl®, Onureg®, and Inrebic®, managed development life cycles for Revlimid®, Pomalyst®, and Sprycel®, and initiated and/or designed registration trials for iberdomide, mezigdomide, and alnuctamab. Prior to BMS, Dr. Berkowitz held roles of increasing responsibility in the areas of oncology, rare diseases, and hematology at Novartis, most recently as Vice President and Clinical Development Head for Hematology. Dr. Berkowitz earned his M.D. and Ph.D. from Columbia University and trained in medical oncology at the National Cancer Institute. “Arvinas is the leader in targeted protein degradation and is on the cusp of its first pivotal data, an important step in potentially bringing an innovative therapeutic approach to patients with serious diseases,” said Dr. Berkowitz. “Arvinas’ progress over the last several years is impressive and I look forward to working with my colleagues, including the strong leadership team at Arvinas, as we prepare for many important upcoming clinical milestones ahead.” The Company also announced that Ron Peck, M.D., who was Chief Medical Officer since joining Arvinas in mid-2019, will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. “In less than five years, Ron built robust clinical development and medical affairs organizations, enabling the planning and initiation of multiple clinical trials across our oncology and neuroscience portfolios,” continued Dr. Houston. “Under Ron’s leadership and in partnership with Pfizer, vepdegestrant has advanced from the start of Phase 1 to multiple ongoing and planned Phase 3 studies in advanced breast cancer. Ron’s teams also progressed our androgen receptor programs, with ARV-766 moving towards Phase 3 initiation, and initiated human dosing of ARV-102, our neuroscience program targeting LRRK2,” said Dr. Houston. “We thank Ron for his tremendous efforts and take confidence in knowing that Dr. Berkowitz is inheriting a high-performing organization.” In connection with the commencement of Dr. Berkowitz’s employment, Arvinas granted Dr. Berkowitz an option to purchase 93,879 shares of common stock and a restricted stock unit award with respect to 63,452 shares of common stock on March 18, 2024, as an inducement material to entering into employment with Arvinas. The option and restricted stock units were granted in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4) and not pursuant to Arvinas’ stock incentive plan. The option has a 10-year term and an exercise price of $42.60 per share, which is equal to the closing price per share of Arvinas’ common stock on the grant date. The option vests over four years, with 25% of the original number of shares underlying the option vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and 1/48th of the original number of shares vesting monthly thereafter, and the restricted stock unit award vests in four equal installments on each one-year anniversary of Dr. Berkowitz’s employment start date until the fourth anniversary of Dr. Berkowitz’s start date, subject to his continued service with Arvinas through the applicable vesting dates.

The offering, structured to support inclusion efforts, involved various underrepresented groups in the underwriting syndicate. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $1 billion in senior debt by State Street Corporation is a significant financial move, indicative of the company's strategy to manage its capital structure and fund various corporate activities. Senior debt typically has a higher claim on assets than other forms of debt, which can make it appealing to investors seeking lower-risk fixed income opportunities. The involvement of a diverse group of underrepresented broker-dealers in underwriting 40% of the securities is notable, as it demonstrates State Street’s commitment to social responsibility within its corporate finance operations.From a financial perspective, the transaction could potentially impact State Street's interest expense and debt servicing obligations, depending on the interest rate of the issued debt compared to existing debt. The successful execution of the offering suggests market confidence in State Street's creditworthiness. However, investors should monitor the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios to assess the long-term sustainability of its capital structure. Market Research Analyst State Street's approach to integrating inclusion, diversity and equity into its financial operations could resonate positively with investors and clients who prioritize corporate social responsibility. This move aligns with broader market trends where firms are increasingly evaluated on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. The announcement could enhance State Street's reputation in the market, potentially attracting a more diverse investor base and fostering loyalty among socially conscious clients.Moreover, the partnership with diverse firms might influence other financial institutions to consider similar approaches, potentially leading to a shift in industry practices. While the direct financial impact of these efforts on State Street's stock is not immediately quantifiable, the long-term reputational benefits and alignment with ESG principles could contribute to competitive advantage and brand differentiation. Economist The issuance of senior debt by a major financial institution like State Street can be seen as a reflection of the broader economic environment. In a context where interest rates are potentially rising, the decision to lock in capital through a fixed-rate offering could be a strategic move to manage future interest expense. The successful placement of a large offering suggests that liquidity in the credit markets remains robust, which is a positive indicator of economic health.Additionally, the engagement of underrepresented groups in the underwriting process may have broader economic implications. By fostering diversity in financial services, State Street is contributing to the economic empowerment of these groups. This could lead to increased innovation and competition in the industry, ultimately benefiting the overall economy through more inclusive financial practices. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM This offering reinforces State Street’s commitment to inclusion and diversity in the financial services industry BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- State Street Corporation (“State Street”) (NYSE: STT) announced today that it has issued an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion of senior debt.

"Aeva Technologies, Inc.’s Reverse Stock Split Becomes Effective",2024-03-18T20:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Aeva (AEVA) announces a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effective March 18, 2024, to increase trading price and maintain NYSE listing. Stockholders automatically receive adjusted shares or cash for fractional shares.","Aeva Technologies, Inc.’s Reverse Stock Split Becomes Effective Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Aeva (AEVA) announces a 1-for-5 reverse stock split effective March 18, 2024, to increase trading price and maintain NYSE listing. Stockholders automatically receive adjusted shares or cash for fractional shares. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The reverse stock split by Aeva is a strategic move aimed at boosting the per-share price of its common stock, which is often undertaken by companies to comply with stock exchange listing requirements and to make their stock appear more valuable to potential investors. From a market perspective, such corporate actions can lead to a perception of stability or improvement in the company's financial health, potentially attracting institutional investors who may have minimum price thresholds for their investments. However, it is essential to note that while the nominal share price increases, the intrinsic value of the company remains unchanged.Investors should be aware that reverse stock splits can sometimes be viewed as a red flag, indicating that a company may have been struggling to maintain its share price. It's critical for investors to look beyond the increased share price and assess the company's underlying financial performance and growth prospects. Additionally, the adjustment of the terms of outstanding warrants and equity-based awards could affect the incentives and compensation of stakeholders within the company, potentially impacting employee morale and retention. Financial Analyst In evaluating the financial implications of Aeva's reverse stock split, it is important to consider the liquidity and marketability of the shares post-split. While a higher stock price may reduce liquidity due to a lower number of shares outstanding, it can also decrease volatility and discourage short-term speculative trading. The elimination of fractional shares and the provision of cash payments in lieu may have a negligible financial impact on most shareholders but can be administratively beneficial for the company by simplifying its shareholder structure.From a valuation standpoint, the market capitalization of the company remains the same post-split, as the reverse stock split does not inject any new capital into the business. Shareholders should monitor the stock's performance after the split to gauge market sentiment and the effectiveness of this strategy in maintaining compliance with NYSE listing standards. Long-term value creation will still hinge on Aeva's operational success and growth in its next-generation sensing and perception systems market. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM Aeva Common Stock to Begin Trading on a Split-adjusted Basis on March 19, 2024 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aeva® (NYSE: AEVA), a leader in next-generation sensing and perception systems, today announced that its previously announced a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of common stock became effective as of March 18, 2024 at 4:01 p.m. Eastern Time. Aeva’s common stock will continue trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the existing symbol (AEVA) and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on March 19, 2024, with the new CUSIP number 00835Q202. As a result of the reverse stock split, every five issued and outstanding shares of Aeva’s common stock was automatically reclassified into one issued and outstanding share of Aeva’s common stock. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of common stock are instead entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest) in an amount equal to their respective pro rata share of the total proceeds of the sale of the aggregated fractional shares net of any brokerage and other costs incurred to sell such shares. The reverse stock split will not affect the number of authorized shares of common stock or the par value of the common stock. Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company is acting as the exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of Aeva’s common stock are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares via a broker, bank, trust or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split, subject to such broker’s particular processes, and will not be required to take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding shares of Aeva’s common stock in certificate form will receive a transmittal letter from Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company with instructions as soon as practicable after the effective date. The terms of outstanding warrants and equity-based awards (including exercise price and number of shares issuable thereunder) were proportionately adjusted, in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreement. Specifically, every five shares of common stock that may be purchased pursuant to the exercise of warrants prior to the Effective Time represent one share of Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to such warrants following the Effective Time. The exercise price for each warrant following the Effective Time equals the product of five multiplied by the exercise price prior to the Effective Time. Accordingly, the exercise price for the Company’s public warrants trading under the symbol ""AEVA.WS"" is $57.50. The CUSIP numbers for the Company’s warrants did not change. The reverse stock split is primarily intended to increase the per share trading price of Aeva’s common stock in order to meet the NYSE’s price criteria for continued listing.

Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Comtech regarding their second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results is a key piece of information for investors and market analysts. The publication of financial outcomes is a direct indicator of a company's performance and can influence investor sentiment and stock price movements. Notably, the lack of a Q&A session due to the leadership transition may raise questions about the stability and future direction of the company, potentially impacting investor confidence.From a financial perspective, the second quarter results provide insights into the company's revenue growth, profit margins and cost management. These metrics are essential for evaluating Comtech's financial health and strategic positioning against competitors. Investors will also scrutinize cash flow statements to assess the company's liquidity and its ability to sustain operations or pursue expansion.It's important to consider the broader economic context when analyzing these results. Factors such as market demand for Comtech's products, supply chain efficiencies and R&D investment levels can all influence financial performance.

Allison Transmission Announces Closing of Amend and Extend of its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Debt,2024-03-18T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. (ALSN) announced that its subsidiary entered into a credit agreement amendment, increasing commitments to $750 million, extending maturity dates, refinancing term loan debt, and reducing effective interest rates. The company aims to manage its balance sheet prudently and enhance capital market opportunities.","Allison Transmission Announces Closing of Amend and Extend of its Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Debt Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. (ALSN) announced that its subsidiary entered into a credit agreement amendment, increasing commitments to $750 million, extending maturity dates, refinancing term loan debt, and reducing effective interest rates. The company aims to manage its balance sheet prudently and enhance capital market opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The amendment of Allison Transmission Holdings Inc.'s credit agreement is a strategic financial maneuver that warrants attention from the perspective of a Financial Analyst. By upsizing the revolving credit facility and refinancing term loan debt, Allison has demonstrated a proactive approach in capital management. The increase in the revolving credit facility from $650 million to $750 million enhances the company's liquidity, providing it with more financial flexibility to address operational needs or growth opportunities. The extension of the maturity dates for both the revolving credit facility and term loan debt to 2029 and 2031, respectively, is a prudent move. It reduces the short-term liquidity risk and reflects a strategic deferral of principal repayments, which can be beneficial during periods of market volatility or economic downturn.Moreover, the removal of the 0.10% credit spread adjustment linked to the SOFR benchmark could lead to a modest reduction in interest expenses, improving the company's interest coverage ratio and potentially its credit ratings. This action reflects a favorable lending environment and confidence from creditors in the company's financial health. The extension of maturities and reduction in interest rates should be well-received by investors, as it indicates a lower risk of financial distress and an improved debt profile. However, it is essential to monitor the company's future earnings and cash flow generation to ensure that the increased debt capacity does not lead to complacency in financial discipline. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Allison Transmission's amendment to its credit agreement can be seen as a strategic initiative to optimize its capital structure. The move to secure longer-term debt at potentially lower interest rates aligns with a conservative financial strategy that may be favored by investors seeking stability in uncertain economic times. This decision may signal to the market that Allison is positioning itself to weather potential economic headwinds by locking in favorable borrowing terms well in advance of their original maturity dates.Investors and market participants often view such refinancing activities as an indication of a company's proactive financial management, which can have a positive effect on the company's stock performance. However, the impact on the stock market will also depend on broader industry trends and Allison's operational performance. The transportation sector, where Allison operates, is sensitive to economic cycles and the ability to secure favorable credit terms could provide a competitive edge. The company's focus on maintaining a low-cost debt structure while preserving the ability to prepay may be viewed as a strategic advantage, particularly if interest rates rise in the future. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allison Transmission Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ALSN) (“Allison” or the “Company”) announced today that, on March 13, 2024, its wholly owned subsidiary, Allison Transmission, Inc. (the “Borrower”), entered into a fourth amendment to its credit agreement (the “Amendment”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the Borrower increased its commitments under its revolving credit facility from $650 million to an aggregate principal amount of $750 million, extended the maturity date thereof from 2025 to March 13, 2029, and removed a 0.10% credit spread adjustment to the SOFR benchmark for all available interest periods. Also pursuant to the Amendment, the Borrower refinanced $518 million of term loan debt, paid down approximately $100 million of existing term loan debt, extended the maturity date thereof from 2026 to March 13, 2031, and removed a 0.10% credit spread adjustment to the SOFR benchmark for all available interest periods, while maintaining the SOFR plus 175 interest rate. “The successful closing of this amendment supports our long-standing commitment to prudent balance sheet management and our opportunistic approach to the capital markets with a focus on a low-cost, flexible and pre-payable debt structure with long-date maturities,” said Fred Bohley, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer at Allison. “As a result of this offering, we were able to increase the capacity under our revolving credit facility and reduce the effective interest rate on our term loan debt, while extending out maturities so that our earliest maturity on our long-term debt is now in 2027.” About Allison Transmission Allison Transmission (NYSE: ALSN) is a leading designer and manufacturer of propulsion solutions for commercial and defense vehicles and the largest global manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty fully automatic transmissions that Improve the Way the World Works.

(DRQ) and Innovex Downhole Solutions, Inc. announce a merger in an all-stock transaction to create a unique energy industrial platform. The combined company will have a diverse product portfolio, strong financial profile, and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow. The merger aims to drive value throughout industry cycles, with estimated cost synergies of $30 million per year and a pro forma net cash position of $99 million by year-end 2023. Positive The merger between Dril-Quip and Innovex will create a leading developer and provider of highly engineered equipment and services for the global oil and gas industry. Upon closing, Dril-Quip stockholders will own approximately 52% and Innovex stockholders will own approximately 48% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. The combined company is expected to generate over $1.0 billion in annual revenue and $221 million in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023. The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow, with estimated cost synergies of around $30 million per year. The merger will provide substantial and immediate earnings and free cash flow accretion, with expected adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 20%, including synergies. The combined company will have a strong balance sheet with a pro forma net cash position of $99 million by year-end 2023. Innovex Chief Executive Officer Adam Anderson will become the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company upon closing of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The proposed merger between Dril-Quip, Inc. and Innovex Downhole Solutions, Inc. represents a significant strategic realignment in the oil and gas equipment and services sector. This transaction is expected to yield a combined entity with enhanced scale and a diversified product portfolio, which could potentially strengthen its competitive position in both offshore and onshore markets. The anticipated revenue mix, with a majority deriving from international and offshore markets, suggests a strategic pivot that may mitigate the risks associated with North American market volatility. Furthermore, the projected pro forma EBITDA margins exceeding 20% post-synergies indicate a robust profitability outlook.From a market perspective, the combined entity's increased global footprint, particularly in growth markets like Saudi Arabia and the Asia Pacific region, could offer expanded market access and customer base. This merger could also serve as a bellwether for further consolidation in the industry, as companies seek scale and diversity to navigate cyclical downturns and capitalize on emerging opportunities in energy transition. Investors may view this merger favorably, as the all-stock nature of the transaction allows for participation in potential upside without immediate cash outlay. However, the realization of estimated cost synergies and the successful integration of the two companies' operations will be critical to achieving the forecasted financial metrics and shareholder value proposition. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of the Dril-Quip and Innovex merger, the all-stock nature of the deal preserves capital, which is particularly valuable in capital-intensive industries such as oil and gas. The pro forma net cash position of $99 million at year-end 2023 provides the combined company with a solid liquidity buffer to weather industry downturns or invest in growth initiatives. The immediate accretion to earnings and free cash flow, as well as the expected EBITDA margin improvement, are positive indicators for the financial health of the entity post-merger.Investors should note the potential for enhanced shareholder value through the anticipated cost synergies of $30 million per year. The synergy realization timeline, with 50% expected within the first 12 months, is an aggressive target that, if met, could reflect positively on management's execution capabilities. The earnings per share (EPS) increase from $0.02 for Dril-Quip to a pro forma $1.44 highlights the significant impact of the merger on profitability. However, investors should also consider the dilutive effect of the transaction on current Dril-Quip shareholders, who will own a reduced 52% of the combined entity. Legal Expert From a legal and governance standpoint, the merger between Dril-Quip and Innovex will result in significant changes to the leadership and board composition. The appointment of Innovex's CEO, Adam Anderson, as the CEO of the combined entity and the planned retention of executives from both companies, suggest a merger of equals approach. The balanced board structure, with an equal number of directors from each company plus the CEO, aims to ensure fair representation and governance post-merger.The agreements with Amberjack Capital Partners, which will own approximately 43% of the combined company, introduce additional governance dynamics. The registration rights and stockholder agreement will likely include provisions to manage potential conflicts of interest and ensure Amberjack's influence is aligned with the interests of all shareholders. Investors should closely monitor filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for further details on these agreements, as they will impact shareholder rights and the strategic direction of the combined company. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM Complementary combination creates an innovation leader with increased scale, a diverse product portfolio and geographic footprint with anticipated resilient earnings to drive value throughout industry cycles All-stock transaction allows stockholders to participate in combined company’s future value creation while providing a strong financial profile with a pro forma, year-end 2023 net cash position of $99 million Combination immediately improves pro forma company’s profitability and free cash flow generation including estimated cost synergies of approximately $30 million per year Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow Companies to host conference call tomorrow, March 19th, at 7:00 a.m. CT HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dril-Quip, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM Conference Call and Webcast on Tuesday, March 19 at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss business update and 2023 financial results Highlights Announced $75 million strategic investment from Glencore and amended existing convertible note, with expected closing on or about March 25th, 2024; Continuing to work closely with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on the conditional commitment for a loan of up to $375 million; Executing on Cash Preservation Plan, including further organization right-sizing and right-shaping, as well as streamlining of operations; Delivered 6,825 tonnes of black mass & black mass equivalents, exceeding the top end of the revised annual production guidance; and Conducting an internal technical review to examine scope and cost for the Rochester Hub project and confirmed technical viability to produce lithium carbonate and mixed hydroxide precipitate. TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LICY) (""Li-Cycle"" or the “Company""), a leading global lithium-ion battery resource recovery company, today provided a business update. “Since embarking on our comprehensive review, we are pleased to report significant progress, including improving our current liquidity position and conducting an internal technical review of the Rochester Hub. We recently announced $75 million of strategic financing from Glencore to enhance our liquidity position and further build on our long-term strategic partnership,” said Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “Additionally, as part of our internal technical review of the Rochester Hub project, we confirmed the technical viability of producing lithium carbonate and mixed hydroxide precipitate (“MHP”). We also continue to work closely with the DOE on the conditional commitment for a loan of up to $375 million. We believe the strategic value of the Rochester Hub is underpinned by strong industry fundamentals driving robust demand for domestic sources of critical battery materials.” Financing Following the announcement by the Company in October 2023 of the construction pause for the Rochester Hub project, the Company formed a Special Committee solely composed of independent Board directors (and which excluded Glencore’s Board representative) (the “Special Committee”) and the Special Committee engaged Moelis & Company LLC (“Moelis”) as its financial advisor to explore financing options and to evaluate strategic alternatives. After a robust process conducted by the Special Committee to review and evaluate potential financial and strategic alternatives available to the Company, Li-Cycle entered into an agreement on March 12, 2024 to issue a senior secured convertible note in an aggregate principal amount of $75 million to an affiliate of Glencore plc (LON: GLEN) (“Glencore”), with expected closing on or around March 25, 2024. This demonstrates Glencore’s continued endorsement of Li-Cycle’s Spoke & Hub model, patented recycling technology, and development plans for the Rochester Hub. Glencore’s $75 million investment represents an interim step in Li-Cycle’s funding strategy to support the Company’s future plans. Li-Cycle continues to assess additional financing opportunities, including continuing to work closely with the DOE Loan Programs Office on the conditional commitment for a loan of up to $375 million under the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. Cash Preservation Plan As part of the pause in construction of the Rochester Hub project, on November 1, 2023, Li-Cycle implemented a Cash Preservation Plan (“CPP”) to reduce expenses and slow cash outflows, while exploring both financing options and strategic alternatives to increase liquidity. As a result of the CPP, the Company has taken steps to significantly reduce its workforce and curtail other non-operational spending. Additionally, the Company has slowed operations at its Spoke network, including pausing operations at its Ontario Spoke, slowing operations at its New York, Arizona and Alabama Spokes on an ongoing basis, and is currently re-evaluating the Company’s strategy for its North American Spokes, which may include further pauses or slowdowns. In 2023, Li-Cycle’s Spokes produced 6,825 tonnes of black mass, which exceeded the top end of its revised annual guidance. Based on the go-forward strategic objectives and the CPP, Li-Cycle expects to further right-size and right-shape its organization. The Company will continue to evaluate other measures to reduce costs and expects the results from the CPP to deliver lower cash outflows. As of December 31, 2023 and March 15, 2024, Li-Cycle had cash and cash equivalents on hand of approximately $71 million and approximately $35 million respectively, excluding restricted cash of approximately $10 million. This excludes expected gross proceeds from the Glencore financing of $75 million which is expected to close on or about March 25, 2024. Based on cash on hand as of March 15, 2024 and the expected gross proceeds from the Glencore financing, pro forma cash is estimated to be approximately $110 million, excluding restricted cash of approximately $10 million. Rochester Hub Project On October 23, 2023, the Company announced that it was pausing construction on the Rochester Hub project, pending completion of a comprehensive review of the project’s go-forward strategy. As of December 31, 2023, the Company incurred total costs of approximately $567 million on the project, comprised of total cash spend of approximately $452 million, including $97 million of spend for the construction of process buildings and warehouse and costs incurred but not yet paid of approximately $115 million. The Company has been conducting an internal technical and economic review of the Rochester Hub project in order to assess a possible change in the project development strategy. The internal technical review has focused on constructing, commissioning and operating only those process areas needed to produce two key products: lithium carbonate and MHP, containing nickel, cobalt and manganese. The construction, commissioning and operating costs for process areas associated with production of nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate, as originally planned for the Rochester Hub, have not been included in the internal technical review and there are no current plans that include production of nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate. The internal technical review confirmed the technical viability of the MHP process and allows the project to proceed on a schedule aligned with the Company's current expectations regarding the timing and evolution of the battery recycling and EV markets, subject to obtaining any required permits, regulatory approvals, if needed, and additional financing. As part of the internal technical review, the Company has conducted an engineering study internally and estimates the cost to complete (“CTC”) the Rochester Hub project under the MHP scope at approximately $508 million, including approximately $115 million of costs incurred but not yet paid as of December 31, 2023. Taking into account total cash spend of approximately $452 million as of December 31, 2023, the revised estimated project cost of the Rochester Hub Project is approximately $960 million for the MHP scope. The increase in estimated project cost as compared to the prior range from November 2023 of approximately $850 million to approximately $1 billion, that included the expected production of nickel sulphate and cobalt sulphate, is primarily due to further refinement of the methodology used for estimating the project cost based on an MHP scope and the cost required to complete the MHP project. The CTC estimate for the MHP scope is based solely upon the internal technical review, is subject to a number of assumptions, including refining detailed engineering, procurement, construction activities, including the cost of labor and is likely to change. The Company continues to complete its comprehensive review work, including re-engaging and re-bidding construction subcontracts. In addition to the CTC, the Company will incur costs during the construction pause between October 23, 2023 to the potential project re-start date, which the Company expects to fund with current cash and required additional interim funding. The Company will also incur other costs such as working capital, commissioning and ramp-up costs and financing costs which will be included in the full funding solution. Key Glencore Investment Terms The Glencore $75 million investment is expected to close on or about March 25, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Glencore will purchase from the Company a senior secured convertible note that will mature on the fifth anniversary of closing and will be convertible into common shares of the Company at an initial conversion price of $0.53 per Li-Cycle common share. Li-Cycle will have the option to pay interest on the Note in cash or in-kind (“PIK”). Cash interest payments will be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 5.0% per year, and PIK payments will be based on SOFR plus 6.0% per year. In addition, Li-Cycle and Glencore have agreed to amend and restate the terms of the existing Glencore convertible note, which was issued on May 31, 2022 and has a current aggregate principal amount outstanding of approximately $225 million in two tranches, each of which will include new terms that come into effect upon the occurrence of future events. For more information, refer to our press release and Form 8-K dated March 12, 2024. The issuance and sale of the senior secured convertible note to Glencore is subject to customary closing conditions and the expiration of the ten-day period for required notice to shareholders informing them of the Company’s reliance on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) financial viability exception to the NYSE’s shareholder approval policy and is expected to close on or about March 25, 2024.

Homology Medicines Declares Distribution to Common Stockholders,2024-03-18T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Homology Medicines, Inc. (FIXX) announced a distribution of contingent value rights (CVR) to its common stockholders, with a payment date of March 27, 2024, following the expected merger on March 22, 2024.","Homology Medicines Declares Distribution to Common Stockholders Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Homology Medicines, Inc. (FIXX) announced a distribution of contingent value rights (CVR) to its common stockholders, with a payment date of March 27, 2024, following the expected merger on March 22, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The distribution of contingent value rights (CVRs) by Homology Medicines presents both opportunities and risks for current stockholders. CVRs are financial instruments that entitle holders to future payments based on the achievement of specific milestones, often tied to regulatory approvals or sales targets. These rights can add a layer of potential value to the existing shares, providing an incentive for investors to hold onto their stock post-merger.However, the value of CVRs is highly speculative and contingent upon the merged entity's ability to meet the set milestones. Investors should be aware that the actual financial benefit of CVRs can vary widely and may result in no value if the milestones are not met. The non-transferable nature of these CVRs also limits stockholders' flexibility, as they cannot be sold or traded independently of the underlying stock. This distribution strategy could reflect management's confidence in reaching the merger's success criteria or be a move to retain investor support during the transition period. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by Homology Medicines to issue contingent value rights as part of a merger agreement is indicative of the company's trajectory and the industry's trend towards performance-based earnouts. This approach aligns the interests of shareholders with the company's long-term goals, potentially stabilizing the stock price in the short term due to the anticipated additional value.Market response to such announcements can be mixed, with some investors viewing CVRs as a positive sign of future growth, while others may perceive it as a company hedging against potential merger integration risks. The specifics of the CVR terms, such as the milestones and time periods involved, will be critical for investors to evaluate the likelihood of receiving any contingent payments. This distribution could also influence peer companies considering mergers or acquisitions to adopt similar incentive structures. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the issuance of contingent value rights requires careful scrutiny of the merger agreement and the agreement governing the CVRs. These documents outline the conditions under which payments will be made and it's imperative for stockholders to understand the legal ramifications of these rights. The non-transferable aspect of CVRs means that they are tied to the ownership of the original shares, which could have implications for shareholders' rights and the overall governance structure post-merger.Legal transparency and clear communication to shareholders are essential to ensure compliance with securities regulations and to maintain trust. Any ambiguity in the terms or failure to meet regulatory standards could lead to disputes or legal challenges. Investors should consult legal advice to fully comprehend their rights and the implications of accepting CVRs. 03/18/2024 - 04:30 PM BEDFORD, Mass., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Homology Medicines, Inc.

Energy Efficiency Consultant The environmental and economic implications of replacing 40,000 CPU systems with 350 NVIDIA H100 systems to accelerate chip fabrication are substantial. This transition highlights a growing trend in the semiconductor industry towards more energy-efficient production processes. The reduction in the number of systems not only decreases power consumption but also minimizes the physical footprint required for data centers within semiconductor foundries.From an operational cost perspective, the power savings and space optimization could lead to significant operational expenditure reductions for TSMC. For stakeholders, this development offers a dual benefit of aligning with sustainability goals while potentially improving profit margins through lowered utility costs and infrastructure investments. Artificial Intelligence Research Analyst The introduction of new generative AI algorithms by NVIDIA to further enhance the cuLitho platform is a noteworthy leap in computational lithography. Generative AI's application in creating inverse solutions to account for light diffraction is a cutting-edge approach that could redefine optical proximity correction (OPC) processes. This additional 2x speedup in OPC signifies not just an incremental improvement but a radical enhancement of the design and manufacturing capabilities at the angstrom level.For the semiconductor industry, this advancement may lead to quicker iterations and more innovative patterning technologies, which are critical as the industry pushes towards 2nm technologies and beyond. This could result in shorter time-to-market for new chip designs, potentially giving TSMC and NVIDIA a distinct advantage in a fiercely competitive sector. For investors, these developments could be indicative of NVIDIA's continued innovation leadership and TSMC's foresight in adopting new technologies, possibly leading to long-term growth and profitability. 03/18/2024 - 04:19 PM NVIDIA cuLitho Accelerates Semiconductor Manufacturing’s Most Compute-Intensive Workload by 40-60x, Opens Industry to New Generative AI AlgorithmsSAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced that TSMC and Synopsys are going into production with NVIDIA’s computational lithography platform to accelerate manufacturing and push the limits of physics for the next generation of advanced semiconductor chips. TSMC, the world’s leading foundry, and Synopsys, the leader in silicon to systems design solutions, have integrated NVIDIA cuLitho with their software, manufacturing processes and systems to speed chip fabrication, and in the future support the latest-generation NVIDIA Blackwell architecture GPUs. “Computational lithography is a cornerstone of chip manufacturing,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our work on cuLitho, in partnership with TSMC and Synopsys, applies accelerated computing and generative AI to open new frontiers for semiconductor scaling.” NVIDIA also introduced new generative AI algorithms that enhance cuLitho, a library for GPU-accelerated computational lithography, dramatically improving the semiconductor manufacturing process over current CPU-based methods. Semiconductor Leaders Advance cuLitho PlatformComputational lithography is the most compute-intensive workload in the semiconductor manufacturing process, consuming tens of billions of hours per year on CPUs. A typical mask set for a chip — a key step in its production — could take 30 million or more hours of CPU compute time, necessitating large data centers within semiconductor foundries. With accelerated computing, 350 NVIDIA H100 systems can now replace 40,000 CPU systems, accelerating production time, while reducing costs, space and power. “Our work with NVIDIA to integrate GPU-accelerated computing in the TSMC workflow has resulted in great leaps in performance, dramatic throughput improvement, shortened cycle time and reduced power requirements,” said Dr. C.C. Wei, CEO of TSMC. “We are moving NVIDIA cuLitho into production at TSMC, leveraging this computational lithography technology to drive a critical component of semiconductor scaling.” Since its introduction last year, cuLitho has enabled TSMC to open new opportunities for innovative patterning technologies. In testing cuLitho on shared workflows, the companies jointly realized a 45x speedup of curvilinear flows and a nearly 60x improvement on more traditional Manhattan-style flows. These two types of flows differ — with curvilinear the mask shapes are represented by curves, while Manhattan mask shapes are constrained to be either horizontal or vertical. “For more than two decades Synopsys Proteus mask synthesis software products have been the production-proven choice for accelerating computational lithography — the most demanding workload in semiconductor manufacturing,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. “With the move to advanced nodes, computational lithography has dramatically increased in complexity and compute cost. Our collaboration with TSMC and NVIDIA is critical to enabling angstrom-level scaling as we pioneer advanced technologies to reduce turnaround time by orders of magnitude through the power of accelerated computing.” Synopsys is the pioneer in delivering advanced techniques for accelerating the performance of computational lithography. Synopsys’ Proteus™ optical proximity correction software running on the NVIDIA cuLitho software library significantly speeds computational workloads compared to current CPU-based methods. With Proteus mask synthesis products, manufacturers like TSMC can achieve exceptional precision, efficiency and speed in proximity correction, model building for correction, and analyzing proximity effects on corrected and uncorrected IC layout patterns, revolutionizing the chip fabrication process. Breakthrough Generative AI Support for Computational LithographyNVIDIA has developed algorithms to apply generative AI to further enhance the value of the cuLitho platform. The new generative AI workflow delivers an additional 2x speedup on top of the accelerated processes enabled through cuLitho. The application of generative AI enables creation of a near-perfect inverse mask or inverse solution to account for diffraction of light. The final mask is then derived by traditional and physically rigorous methods, speeding up the overall optical proximity correction (OPC) process by a factor of two. Many changes in the fab process currently necessitate a revision in OPC, driving up the amount of compute required and creating bottlenecks in the fab development cycle. These costs and bottlenecks are alleviated with the accelerated computing cuLitho provides and generative AI, enabling fabs to allocate available compute capacity and engineering bandwidth to design more novel solutions in development of new technologies for 2nm and beyond.

Negative Resignation of Chief Revenue Officer Bob Gruters and departure of COO and CMO Randy Greenberg. Layoffs and furloughs of certain employees as part of operational changes. Potential negative impact on employee morale due to layoffs and salary reductions. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by Loop Media regarding leadership changes, operational reviews and cost-cutting measures indicates a pivotal restructuring phase within the company. This kind of strategic realignment often occurs when a company is seeking to refine its focus, enhance profitability and create value for shareholders. The appointment of an interim CEO suggests a transitional period that may lead to further strategic shifts.From a market perspective, the departure of the Chief Revenue Officer and the COO/CMO could signal internal challenges or a new strategic direction. The implementation of cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and salary reductions, is a clear indicator that the company is aiming to improve its financial health. However, this could have mixed implications for investor confidence, as such austerity measures often raise concerns about the company's current performance and future growth prospects.Furthermore, the intention to explore strategic alternatives and financing opportunities is a common approach to unlock value, which may include partnerships, mergers, or acquisitions. This could potentially lead to increased market speculation about the company's future, impacting its stock volatility in the short term. Investors will be closely monitoring these developments to assess their potential impact on the company's valuation. Financial Analyst Loop Media's announcement of an annual aggregate cash payroll reduction of approximately $2 million through cost-cutting measures is a significant step towards financial efficiency. This move is expected to improve the company's bottom line and could be a positive indicator for investors looking at the company's efforts to reach break-even and operating profitability.However, it's essential to consider the broader implications of such cost reductions. While they may improve short-term financials, they could also impact the company's operational capabilities and morale. Investors should weigh these cost-cutting strategies against the company's ability to maintain competitive services and innovation within the CTV and DOOH (Digital Out-of-Home) industry.Additionally, the announcement to explore potential strategic alternatives and financing opportunities is a proactive approach that could lead to a significant infusion of capital or strategic partnerships. This exploration could result in a revaluation of the company's stock as the market anticipates potential growth opportunities or changes in ownership structure. 03/18/2024 - 04:20 PM Jon Niermann steps down as CEO to focus on Distribution and Revenue – Remains on Board Justis Kao Appointed as Interim CEO Bruce Cassidy to become Executive Chairman of the Board Loop Media to Explore Potential Strategic Alternatives and Financing Opportunities GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Loop Media, Inc. (""Loop Media"", the “Company”) (NYSE American: LPTV), a leading multichannel streaming CTV platform that provides curated music videos, sports, news, premium entertainment channels and digital signage for businesses, announced today that Jon Niermann is stepping down as Chief Executive Officer and the Board has unanimously appointed Justis Kao as Interim CEO, effective immediately. Mr. Kao has served in various roles in the Company, including Chief Communications Officer, Chief of Staff, Investor Relations and, most recently, Chief Content Officer. Mr. Niermann will remain a member of the Board and management team, maintaining a strategic focus on revenue and distribution. In addition, Bruce Cassidy has been appointed Executive Chairman of the Board. “While I have loved leading our team since I co-founded the Company, it’s time for a change of leadership for the Company and shift in focus for my role,” said Mr. Niermann. “Going forward, I feel I can provide more support to Loop in a customer-focused revenue-generating capacity. My main goal has always been to get a return for our shareholders while growing a meaningful media-tech company that will leave a lasting footprint. Justis knows the Company very well and has my and the organization’s full support and confidence. I look forward to driving growth in revenue and distribution.” Bruce Cassidy, Executive Chairman of Loop Media, noted, “I continue to have tremendous confidence in the future opportunities for the Company and believe in its success. We believe that we have been ahead of the curve for this industry and should be well-positioned moving forward to achieve the type of growth that we originally set out to accomplish. We are fortunate to have some very talented members on our team. On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Jon for his visionary leadership and unrelenting dedication to Loop Media. Justis understands the Company, its people and the opportunity. He has been instrumental in leading a number of initiatives over the years and I have the utmost confidence in him to help lead Loop Media into its next phase of growth,” he concluded. “I’m excited to step in as Interim CEO,” said Mr. Kao. “I’ve worked closely with Jon for over a decade now and know that the focus he can bring to revenue and distribution will continue to support us well. The rapport that our entire team and I have built over the last 10 years, since the start of Loop Media, gives me great confidence in leading the next critical stage of the Company’s development.” In addition to Mr. Niermann stepping down from CEO, Mr. Kao being appointed Interim CEO, and Mr. Cassidy being named as Executive Chairman, Loop Media announced today that Bob Gruters, Chief Revenue Officer of the Company, has resigned after three years to pursue another business opportunity outside of the Company. Mr. Gruters has agreed to remain an advisor to the Company. Randy Greenberg, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Marketing Officer, who joined Loop Media in July 2023, will be stepping down from those roles and leaving the Company to pursue other business opportunities. The Board of Directors and senior management team conducted an operational and cost-cutting review across the Company which it believes will provide the framework to making the Company more competitive in the CTV for business/DOOH industry. The Board and management team determined that executing operational changes is prudent to accelerate Loop Media’s potential path to break even and operating profitability. As a result of the review, the Company has laid off and furloughed certain employees and has implemented salary reductions to create efficiencies and lower the Company’s overhead. These cost-cutting measures include senior management salary reductions and are expected to result in an annual aggregate cash payroll reduction of approximately $2 million. Loop Media also intends to explore potential strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, as well as evaluate potential financing opportunities to help advance its business goals.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Cousins Properties regarding a cash dividend of $0.32 per common share is a direct indicator of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to return value to shareholders. Dividends are often seen as a signal of a company's confidence in its future earnings and stability. In this context, the declared dividend could be perceived as a positive sentiment, potentially making the company's stock more attractive to income-focused investors.However, it's essential to analyze the dividend yield, which is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock's price per share. If the yield is significantly higher than what is typical for the sector, it could imply that the stock price is undervalued or that investors require a higher yield due to perceived risk. Conversely, a lower yield might suggest a potentially overvalued stock or a very stable company with less risk. Additionally, the payout ratio, the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, should be sustainable; otherwise, it could strain the company's finances in the long run. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend can influence investor sentiment and market perception of Cousins Properties. Dividends are often factored into stock valuation models and consistent dividend payments can contribute to a stock's desirability among certain investor demographics, particularly those seeking regular income streams, such as retirees. It's important to consider the consistency and growth of Cousins Properties' dividends over time, as this can be a strong indicator of the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders and its long-term strategic planning.Market trends also suggest that real estate investment trusts (REITs), which Cousins Properties is a part of, are typically expected to pay out a majority of their taxable income as dividends. Therefore, the dividend announcement aligns with industry norms, but its impact on the stock will also depend on broader market conditions, interest rate trends and the performance of the real estate sector as a whole. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM ATLANTA, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cousins Properties (NYSE: CUZ) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.32 per common share for the first quarter of 2024.

Company ceases solo-staking operations and closes private placements of $3.7 million. Files Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic pivot by Mega Matrix Corp. from cryptocurrency to short drama streaming services, specifically through the acquisition of a majority stake in Yuder Pte, Ltd, marks a significant shift in the company's business model. The reported 360% increase in FlexTV's unaudited top-up and subscription fees is a strong indicator of the platform's rapid growth and potential market penetration. With the rise in consumer demand for short-form content, this transition could position Mega Matrix Corp. advantageously within the digital entertainment sector.However, the sustainability of this growth trajectory should be scrutinized. The entertainment industry is known for its volatility and the challenges associated with content creation, such as the constant need for innovation and the management of intellectual property rights. The entry into this market places Mega Matrix Corp. in direct competition with established streaming services, which could impact long-term profitability and market share. Financial Analyst The closure of private placements totaling $3.7 million indicates investor confidence in Mega Matrix Corp.'s new direction, providing the company with capital to invest in the development and expansion of FlexTV. The preliminary financial data suggests robust short-term revenue growth, which could positively influence investor sentiment and stock performance in the near term.However, investors should approach these figures with caution due to their unaudited nature and the company's disclaimer regarding the potential for material changes post-financial closing procedures. The final financial statements, to be accessed via the SEC's website, will provide a clearer picture of the company's fiscal health and should be awaited for a comprehensive assessment. Legal Expert The transition away from cryptocurrency-related operations is likely a response to the regulatory uncertainties and market volatility associated with digital currencies. By divesting from its solo-staking business operations, Mega Matrix Corp. may reduce its exposure to potential legal and compliance risks. The strategic focus on content streaming through FlexTV represents a shift to a more regulated and stable industry, which could appeal to risk-averse investors.Additionally, the non-binding letter of intent and subsequent acquisition of Yuder Pte, Ltd's voting capital stock should be executed with diligence to ensure compliance with international business laws and intellectual property regulations, especially considering the multi-national nature of content production and distribution. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mega Matrix Corp.

Healthcare Industry Analyst The sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy to CarelonRx signifies a strategic shift for Kroger, aiming to streamline its operations and focus on its core business segments. This divestiture allows Kroger to allocate resources and capital more efficiently, potentially enhancing its competitive position in the grocery sector. The specialty pharmacy market is highly specialized and the separation from Kroger could provide the unit with a more focused approach under CarelonRx, which specializes in healthcare services.For Elevance Health, the acquisition expands its portfolio in a niche market, potentially increasing its market share in specialty pharmacy services. The deal may lead to improved patient outcomes through more concentrated efforts in managing complex diseases. The transaction's success hinges on seamless transition and integration, which can be challenging but is critical for maintaining service quality for patients with chronic illnesses. Financial Analyst The announcement of the definitive agreement is not expected to impact Kroger's 2024 financial guidance, suggesting that the specialty pharmacy business is a relatively small component of Kroger's overall revenue stream. Investors should note that the deal's closure is contingent on regulatory approvals, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. However, the strategic divestiture could be viewed positively if it leads to improved capital efficiency and a stronger focus on Kroger's main business activities.From a financial perspective, the terms of the deal, which are not disclosed, will be important in assessing its impact on Kroger's balance sheet. The inflow from the sale could be used for various purposes such as debt reduction, reinvestment in core operations, or shareholder returns, each with different implications for the company's financial health and stock performance. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM Specialty pharmacy serves patients with chronic illnesses who require complex care CINCINNATI, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Kroger Co.

Zapata AI, an industrial generative AI company, will trade under the ticker symbols 'ZPTA' and 'ZPTAW'. The move aims to fuel innovation and growth for Zapata AI in the high-growth technology sector. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The transition of Andretti Acquisition Corp. from NYSE to Nasdaq, following its combination with Zapata Computing, reflects a strategic move to align with a marketplace that's perceived to be more tech-centric. Nasdaq's reputation for hosting high-growth tech companies could potentially increase visibility among tech investors and provide a better fit for the combined entity's industry focus. This event could lead to increased trading liquidity and a possible re-rating of the stock, as the market perception of the company may shift positively due to the association with Nasdaq-listed tech innovators.The choice of ticker symbols 'ZPTA' and 'ZPTAW' for the common stock and public warrants, respectively, is a branding exercise that could enhance the company's recognition in the financial markets. It's important to note that while such rebranding and exchange shifts can have marketing benefits, the real value to shareholders will depend on Zapata AI's performance as a public company and its ability to capitalize on the generative AI market, which is still in a nascent but rapidly evolving stage. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Andretti's business combination with Zapata AI and subsequent Nasdaq listing could be multifaceted. For current investors, no immediate action is required, indicating a seamless transition. However, the longer-term financial impact will hinge on the combined entity's operational execution and market adoption of their generative AI applications. Considering Zapata AI's existing clientele, which includes major enterprises and government agencies, there is a foundational customer base that could drive future revenue growth.Investors should monitor the company's subsequent financial disclosures and earnings reports closely to assess the merger's success and the integration of Zapata AI's technology into Andretti's business model. It's also worth noting that the AI industry is subject to rapid changes and intense competition, which could affect the company's market position and financial health over time. Technology Industry Analyst Generative AI is a cutting-edge field with significant potential for disruption across various industries. Zapata AI's focus on solving complex, industrial-scale problems positions it at the forefront of this technological frontier. The mention of enterprise and government customers such as BASF and DARPA suggests that Zapata AI is tackling high-value problems, which could lead to substantial long-term contracts and a strong competitive moat if their solutions are proven effective.However, the AI space is highly competitive, with many players vying for market share. The success of Zapata AI will depend not only on its technological capabilities but also on its ability to continuously innovate and adapt to the needs of its customers in a fast-paced industry. Investors should watch for developments in Zapata AI's product offerings, intellectual property portfolio and any strategic partnerships that could enhance its market position. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM BOSTON & INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Andretti Acquisition Corp.

A shortfall of $1.4 million has led to a suspension of the monthly distribution, which is a significant event for investors who rely on these distributions for income. The cumulative shortfall now totals approximately $2.6 million, which must be eliminated before distributions can resume.The reported decrease in oil and natural gas sales volumes, along with a drop in received wellhead prices, directly impacts the Trust's revenue. The decrease in capital expenditures indicates a reduction in investment towards new projects, which could be viewed as a conservative approach to managing the Trust's finances during a period of lower revenues. However, it's important to note that the Sponsor has communicated the completion of several new drilling projects, which could potentially lead to increased production and revenue in the future.From an investment perspective, the suspension of distributions could negatively affect the Trust's unit price in the short term. However, the long-term outlook may be more positive if the newly completed projects lead to increased production and the Trust is able to resume distributions. Investors should monitor commodity price trends and the Trust's ability to manage its expenses and capital projects efficiently. Energy Market Analyst The dynamics of oil and natural gas markets have a direct impact on the financial health of trusts like Permianville Royalty Trust. The fluctuation in wellhead prices, as indicated by the decrease in oil and natural gas prices, reflects broader market conditions that can be volatile. The Trust's reliance on these commodities means that its financial performance is closely tied to market prices, which are influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical events and technological advancements in energy extraction and production.Looking at the industry, the Trust's operational decisions, such as proceeding with new drilling projects despite the current shortfall, suggest a focus on long-term growth over immediate returns. This aligns with industry practices where energy companies often make capital investments during downturns to position themselves for recovery. The Trust's communication about the completion of these projects and the expected return to positive net profits later in the year provides a forward-looking statement that could influence investor sentiment.For stakeholders, the key takeaway is the importance of understanding the cyclical nature of the energy sector and the impact of external market forces on the Trust's performance. As the Trust navigates through the current shortfall, its ability to adapt to market conditions and manage its project portfolio will be important in determining its future profitability and ability to sustain distributions to unitholders. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Permianville Royalty Trust (NYSE: PVL, the “Trust”) today announced the net profits interest calculation for March 2024. The net profits interest calculation represents reported oil production for the month of December 2023 and reported natural gas production during November 2023. The calculation includes accrued costs incurred in January 2024. As a result of the elevated capital expenditures recorded this month as described below, for which timing is not always ratable month-to-month, direct operating and development expenses exceeded cash receipts, leading to a shortfall of approximately $1.4 million this month. As a result, no monthly distribution will be paid in April 2024 to the Trust’s unitholders of record on March 28, 2024. Distributions to the Trust will resume once the cumulative net profits shortfall, which now totals approximately $2.6 million, is eliminated. The following table displays reported underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month recorded net profits interest calculations. Underlying Sales Volumes Average Price Oil Natural Gas Oil Natural Gas Bbls Bbls/D Mcf Mcf/D (per Bbl) (per Mcf) Current Month 31,680 1,022 201,825 6,728 $ 72.37 $ 2.18 Prior Month 34,461 1,149 240,007 7,742 $ 78.56 $ 2.24 Recorded oil cash receipts from the oil and gas properties underlying the Trust (the “Underlying Properties”) totaled $2.3 million for the current month on realized wellhead prices of $72.37/Bbl, down $0.4 million from the prior month’s oil cash receipts. Recorded natural gas cash receipts from the Underlying Properties totaled $0.4 million for the current month on realized wellhead prices of $2.18/Mcf, down $0.1 million from the prior month. Total accrued operating expenses for the period were $2.5 million, a $0.3 million decrease month-over-month. Capital expenditures decreased $0.1 million from the prior period to $1.9 million. COERT Holdings 1, LLC (the “Sponsor”) has indicated to the Trustee that this month’s capital expenditures were primarily from twelve new drilling projects, six of which were listed in the Trust’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 14, 2023, with the remaining six representing new projects undertaken by an existing, large cap public operator of the Underlying Properties. The Sponsor has informed the Trustee that the majority of these twelve projects have already been completed and are or are expected to be in pay status within the coming months. The cumulative shortfall in net profits for the current month will be deducted from any net profits in next month’s net profits interest calculation. The Trust will not receive proceeds pursuant to its net profits interest until the cumulative net profits shortfall is eliminated. In addition, if the Trust’s cash on hand is not sufficient to pay ordinary course administrative expenses and the Trust borrows funds or draws on the letter of credit that has been provided to the Trust, or if the Sponsor advances funds to the Trust to pay such expenses, no further distributions will be made to Trust unitholders until such amounts borrowed or drawn, or advanced to the Trust, are repaid. At this time based on current commodity prices, the Sponsor anticipates that the Underlying Properties will return to generating positive net profits later in 2024. About Permianville Royalty Trust Permianville Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain, predominantly non-operated, oil and gas properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis. For additional information on the Trust, please visit www.permianvilleroyaltytrust.com. Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution to unitholders and expectations regarding the future generation of net profits from the Underlying Properties. The anticipated distribution is based, in large part, on the amount of cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from the Sponsor with respect to the relevant period. The amount of such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its ability to pay distributions) has been and will continue to be directly affected by the volatility in commodity prices, which can fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors that are beyond the control of the Trust and the Sponsor. Low oil and natural gas prices will reduce profits to which the Trust is entitled, which will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include expenses of the Trust, reserves for anticipated future expenses, and public health concerns, such as the COVID‑19 pandemic. In addition, future monthly capital expenditures may exceed the average levels experienced in 2023 and prior periods, which could reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders and in certain periods could result in no distributions to unitholders. Statements made in this press release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in this press release. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee intends, and neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included in this press release. An investment in units issued by the Trust is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s filings with the SEC, including the risks described in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 23, 2023.

Financial Analyst The reported financial performance of StoneCo Ltd. indicates a robust fiscal health, with a substantial year-over-year increase in both Adjusted EBT and Adjusted Net Income. The growth in MSMB TPV by 20% is a positive signal for investors, as it reflects the company's ability to expand its market share within the merchant segment, which is critical for future revenue streams. The financial metrics presented, especially the 177% increase in Adjusted Net Income, show a trajectory that outpaces average market growth rates, suggesting that StoneCo's strategic initiatives are yielding tangible results. However, it is important for investors to consider the scalability of these results and the potential risks associated with rapid expansion, such as operational inefficiencies and increased competition. Market Research Analyst StoneCo's strategic shift towards diversifying beyond payment processing into banking, credit and software services is a strategic move that aligns with current industry trends. By embedding financial services into their software and focusing on key verticals, StoneCo is attempting to create a more integrated financial ecosystem for its clients. This could potentially increase customer loyalty and lifetime value. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to execute and integrate these services seamlessly. Additionally, the company's focus on operational efficiency and cost management may help improve margins, but it is essential to monitor how these changes impact the company's agility and innovation. Technology Industry Analyst The development of the Stone Platform, with an emphasis on artificial intelligence, suggests that StoneCo is investing in technology to drive future growth. The mention of 'building once, using many' reflects a strategic approach to create reusable and scalable technology solutions, which can reduce long-term costs and improve efficiency. The challenge for StoneCo will be to maintain a balance between rapid technological advancement and the consistency of the service offering. As the company scales, it will be important to ensure that their technology infrastructure can support the increased demand without compromising quality or customer experience. 03/18/2024 - 04:17 PM Strong quarter with Adjusted EBT reaching R$638 million, up 132% year over year, on accelerating MSMB TPV growth of 20%, resulting in Adjusted Net income of R$564 million, up 177% year over year GEORGE TOWN, Grand Cayman, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- StoneCo Ltd. (Nasdaq: STNE, B3: STOC31) (“Stone” or the “Company”) today reports its financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “Dear Fellow Shareholders, I hope this message finds you in high spirits. As we wrap up a successful year, I want to express my profound gratitude for your support and investment in Stone. Reflecting on the past year, it is remarkable how well our company has performed. I am not only referring to our strong financial performance but also acknowledging the strategic milestones that have strengthened our position in the market and paved the way for future growth – as we detailed in our Investor Day. Unlike previous letters, the primary objective of this, and subsequent ones, is to reflect on our strategic progress and the effectiveness of capital allocation throughout the year. My intention is to articulate our ambitions for the coming years. I believe that these letters play a crucial role in offering a qualitative narrative that complements the quantitative results and outlines our prospects. The statements, both in this letter and those we will provide in the future, arise from drivers often challenging to quantify – specifically, the fundamental values that guide our company. This letter might also be longer than what you are used to, as it marks a special occasion. As I wrap up my first year as CEO, which followed a prior year as board member, I am keen to share the insights of this initial journey, delve into the financial results for 2023, outline our strategic vision for the upcoming years, and discuss the transition of our founder, Andre Street, from his role as chairman, as well as additional board changes. This transition is a significant moment for us, representing both a continuation of Andre’s legacy and a step towards new leadership horizons. Rights & Wrongs: The Views from an Outsider As you are aware, I became a part of StoneCo’s Board of Directors approximately two years ago. This initial contact with the company offered me a unique chance to see our operations from a high-level perspective. Now, a year into my role as CEO, I have taken a deeper look at our company, better spotting our strengths and areas of improvement. This journey has been revealing, as it has provided valuable lessons and enhanced my perspective on the opportunities we face. The Pleasant Surprises: One of the most impressive aspects I have encountered is the sheer ""brain power"" within Stone, which is top-notch across all levels. The caliber of our team far exceeds the norm, with a level of insight and commitment that truly sets us apart. This high talent density is a testament to our ability to attract and retain exceptional talents, providing us with a significant edge in a competitive landscape. Equally remarkable to me was to see firsthand our team's execution capacity. Our ability to quickly implement initiatives, always with an eye on the client's best interest, speaks to the strength of our client-centric culture and high level of organizational alignment. This rare agility was particularly evident in how we recovered from 2021, when the company faced a 'perfect storm' of challenges, including failures with the registry system, adverse macroeconomic conditions, and stresses to our credit portfolio, all while absorbing the significant acquisition of Linx. The team's ability to adapt quickly, sustain our growth and rebound our profitability in the face of adversity, was, in my perspective, nothing short of impressive. On the strategic front, I was amazed by the strides the company has taken to diversify beyond payments, which has begun to show results. While this expansion may not yet be fully visible externally, the foundation we have built will allow our company to reap significant benefits from integrating payments, banking, credit, and software in the years ahead. Areas for Enhancement: Despite these evident strengths, I have also realized that several areas require attention and improvement. One prominent issue is that the ambition to chase multiple initiatives diluted our efforts and potentially our impact. You may have even noticed signs of this from an external perspective. While I didn't want to curtail our opportunities, I felt that it was crucial to instill a 'less is more' mentality throughout the organization. Operational efficiency also emerged as an area for improvement. While we excel in certain areas, I became confident that we can still 'unlock' substantial operating leverage, pushing Stone to operate more efficiently and to become more profitable. In response to these insights, we've initiated several strategic adjustments: Organizational Structure Redesign: We have reorganized to deliver our solutions more effectively across different client segments, from Micro to Medium businesses, tailoring our go-to-market approach to meet their unique needs. Our new organizational structure aligns with each client segment, while it also strengthens key capabilities around engineering, product, marketing, and innovation, enhancing our ability to address client needs in a unique way.Sharpen Strategic Focus: As the outcome of a thorough strategic revision and prioritization process, we have set three clear strategic priorities that will enable us to achieve our long-term goals: (i) win in the MSMB segment; (ii) drive engagement; (iii) scale through platforms. These priorities helped us to set key focus areas for the coming years, such as: Software Business Integration: By focusing on four key verticals that represent most of the financial services opportunity within our software installed base (Retail, Gas Stations, Food, and Drugstores), we are embedding financial services into our software and delivering attractive bundles to our clients, increasing our competitive edge and opening a significant growth avenue for the future.Leverage the power of the combination of Payments, Banking and Software: There is a huge opportunity in our installed client base to increase engagement with our solutions. As an example, today only a fraction of our client base can be considered “heavy users” of our solutions and there is a substantial potential to improve our unit economics as we continue to engage the base.Build Once, Use Many - The Creation of the Stone Platform: Our rapid growth initially focused on development speed, sometimes at the expense of consistency and reusability. This resulted in the existence of multiple data platforms. But over the last year and a half, we've made a big change. We've brought our technology teams together, streamlined how we work, and started to build a solid foundation that we all share: the Stone Platform. As we move forward, especially with new tech like artificial intelligence, we're setting ourselves up to generate new synergies and use our insights even more effectively to serve our clients. Cost Management and Spending Controls: Recognizing the potential to unlock substantial operating leverage, we've embarked on initiatives aimed at enhancing profitability even further. Through sustainable cost optimization, we're setting the stage for more efficient, profitable operations. By implementing a shared-services center and zero-based budgeting, we are enhancing our financial discipline across the organization. What We Are Building: Building Our Financial Ecosystem like Lego Bricks After a year in the role, I have also had the opportunity to appreciate what we are building. As we presented at our Investor Day, what began as a focused endeavor to serve SMBs has become a pursuit of an R$ 100bn opportunity, through the addition of new services and segments. This expansion wasn't a product of ambition alone but a series of strategic layers, each adding to our addressable market, much like the stacking of new Lego bricks. Our path wasn't just about growing; it was about understanding and solving the evolving needs of our clients. As we stand today, we still have a small fraction of the R$ 100bn opportunity, so our journey is far from over. But with each new layer, we're not just expanding our reach; we're reinforcing our foundation, ensuring that as we grow, we remain steadfast in our commitment to service, innovation, and simplicity. Why We Believe We Can Win In a time when FinTechs could once thrive on user growth without worrying much about profits, due to low borrowing costs, things have changed. The focus on rapid expansion without solid results is shifting. With capital becoming more expensive, there's a push towards more sustainable business models. This brings up a common question from investors: ""How does your company stand out in this competitive market?"". Here are the three main ways we differentiate ourselves: Tech-Enabled Distribution - Vast Reach, Precision Targeting: Our unique advantage stems from our extensive and tech-powered distribution network. Unlike others, our approach combines a vast reach across Brazil—encompassing 99.7% of the Service GDP and extending into over 5,000 cities—with sophisticated technology that enhances our efficiency and effectiveness. Our technology equips sales agents with the tools to target the right clients, offering them a complete overview of the merchant's profile and the ability to propose the most suitable service bundles. This strategic use of technology ensures that we're not just widespread but also smart in our reach, significantly reducing our Client Acquisition Costs while maintaining high-quality service.Superior Service: Our commitment to delivering unparalleled service is a cornerstone of our competitive edge. We set the industry standard, answering client calls in less than 5 seconds and providing the fastest delivery times through our optimized logistics. This level of service is especially critical in a sector where expectations often go unmet. For SMBs and micro-merchants alike, our ability to rapidly respond to and resolve their needs — not just quickly but efficiently — has solidified our position as the leader in customer satisfaction across Brazil. It's a reminder that exceptional service isn't just a value-add; it's essential.Comprehensive Merchant Platform: Our third distinguishing factor is our all-encompassing merchant platform. Beyond merely processing payments, we offer a deep, data-driven understanding of our clients' needs, which not only addresses current demands but anticipates future ones, providing an unparalleled level of insight. Priorities Going Forward While the opportunity is huge, we will seize it through a targeted approach, ensuring we do not dilute our efforts. With this in mind, we have selected three strategic priorities to progress towards our long-term objectives: 1. Win in the MSMB Segment Our vast distribution footprint will allow us to drive consistent, profitable growth, while we expand the ways in which we help our clients through our multiple solutions. Furthermore, we have an attractive financial services opportunity in our installed Software client base and the right assets and organizational alignment to capture that opportunity. Our unwavering commitment to providing the best service in the market will remain a strong focus and the biggest hurdle to our ability to expand our offerings and solutions. Sustaining our position as the “benchmark” in the industry will serve as a guide to our product development efforts, as we will launch new products and bundles making sure we can continue to delight our clients with the best service in an increasingly multi-product reality. The combination of these elements will be the key driver of our ability to continue to win new clients and grow above the overall market, gaining market share within the MSMB segment. 2. Drive Engagement with Our Clients Beyond winning new clients and growing faster than the market, we believe we will be able to drive engagement because as we evolve our product platforms and our ability to price better bundles to our clients, we expand the breadth of monetization levers. We have a huge opportunity to drive further engagement and monetization if we can scale working capital solutions in the appropriate way, for our clients and for our business. We can use Software as a differentiator to achieve higher monetization and better lifetime values. 3. Scale Through Platforms Lastly, we will be able to increase returns in the future as we generate growth profitably. The intrinsic elements of our business model that will enable us to grow with minimal incremental investments are: (i) our foundational assets around distribution, logistics, client service, which are platforms for future growth, and (ii) our product and technology platforms that will enable us to deliver multiple value propositions through a single technology infrastructure. A Recap of 2023 After reflecting on our achievements, strategic direction, and how we're setting ourselves up for future success, I also wanted to address our 2023 results. Last year was a milestone year for us, marking a complete rebound from the challenges faced in 2021. We closed the year with exceptional results, particularly in the fourth quarter, when we accomplished significant progress in our key strategic initiatives. Our top priority, ""Winning in MSMBs,"" posted remarkable growth. We achieved a notable increase in MSMB TPV both annually and in the fourth quarter, showing an acceleration from the previous period. Our banking services also recorded impressive growth, with deposits reaching R$ 6.1 billion by the end of December, a significant increase from 2022. This growth not only reflects higher engagement but also a better conversion of TPV into deposits. In our second priority - ""Driving Engagement"", we observed monetization improving substantially throughout the year, with MSMB Take-Rates achieving 2.43% (up 22 bps y/y). In the 4Q we saw a slight decline of 6bps compared to the previous quarter, but that was already expected and purely a result of seasonality. More importantly, we continued to advance in our Credit Solution - reaching a working capital portfolio of R$ 309 million by the end of the year, with very encouraging results regarding the health of the portfolio. NPLs over 90d are still at 0.29%, and even our most mature cohorts are still pointing us toward losses under the 10% level. The push to ""Scale Through Platforms"" yielded substantial operational leverage, boosting our EBT to R$ 1,954 million, a 233% increase over the previous year. This leap forward improved our EBT margin by more than 10 percentage points, and our adjusted net income surged to R$ 1,558 million, up 279% from the previous year. Our profitability also translated into cash generation, and we ended the year with an adjusted net cash position of R$ 5,053 million, even after significant investments in our credit portfolio and share buybacks. On a separate note, our Software segment faced challenges in 2023, particularly in non-strategic verticals, where growth was slower. However, our efficiency initiatives started showing results, with EBITDA margins improving by 1.9 percentage points to 16.4%. The fourth quarter recorded a dip due to one-off restructuring costs, but these moves we made to generate savings for us in 2024. Additionally, our integration efforts in the four prioritized verticals have just started to pay dividends, with participation in TPV from these software clients surpassed R$ 20 billion in the year. In summary, 2023 was a year of significant achievements and strategic advancements for us and our 4Q results have positioned us favorably to continue to perform well in 2024 and make progress towards our 2027 goals. Laying the Groundwork for Tomorrow: Creating a Portfolio of Bets When companies chase quick wins under market pressure, they risk their future. Growth isn't just about speed; it's also about sustainability. Fast growth can be tempting, but it's not always right. At Stone, we're playing the long game. We focus on building a solid company, not on boosting our stock price. At Stone’s current scale, planting seeds that will grow into meaningful new businesses takes some discipline, a bit of patience, and a nurturing culture. Our established businesses are well-rooted young trees: they are growing, enjoy high returns on capital, and operate in growing market segments. These characteristics set a high bar for any new business we would start. Before we invest our shareholders’ money in a new business line or initiative, we must convince ourselves that the new opportunity is sizable and can generate the returns on capital our investors expected when they invested in Stone. In nearly every decision we make, there are factors we can control and predict – and others we can't. Whether we realize it or not, we often engage in what Annie Duke, a scholar at the University of Pennsylvania and retired professional poker champion, calls ""thinking in bets""*. By embracing this mindset, we acknowledge uncertainty in our decision-making process, enabling us to better identify mistakes, recognize moments of luck, and become less susceptible to reactive emotions and destructive habits. Understanding this concept is crucial for comprehending how we allocate capital as we build our growth and new venture portfolio. While it is still too early to delve into our portfolio of bets, we will certainly address this topic in subsequent letters. Paving the Way for the Next Chapter: Succession of the Chairman and Founder To wrap it up, today we also announced a pivotal transition in our leadership. André Street, our esteemed founder and Chairman, has chosen to conclude his tenure on the Board, stepping aside from reelection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for April 2024. Similarly, Vice-Chairman Conrado Engel and board member Patricia Verderesi will not seek reelection, honoring their two-year commitment. Despite stepping down, André remains deeply connected to the company as its Reference Shareholder, bolstered by special protections under our Shareholders' Agreement and Articles of Association. This includes the privilege to choose the Chairman of the Board. The transition marks the culmination of a deliberate, multi-year effort led by André to professionalize management and enhance governance standards—a mission that was crystallized by our strong 2023 results and the robust, strategically aligned team now at the helm. The succession process for the Chairman position has been carefully planned by the People Committee of the Board. The candidates recommended for the upcoming AGM will be Mauricio Luchetti as Chairman and Gilberto Caldart as Vice-Charman. Additionally, a new member will be nominated, José Alexandre Scheinkman. We have shared more details about the succession in a separate 6-K filing. We are committed to keeping alive the entrepreneurial spirit created by our founders. Our goal is to maintain high standards of governance as our company grows and continues to be a leader in entrepreneurship and client-centricity. With a committed shareholder like André, a great team, and a strong business, we are well set to continue to advance our mission forward. In conclusion, as we close 2023 and kick off 2024, I am more enthusiastic than ever about our company. We thank you, our shareholders, for your support, your encouragement, and for joining us on this journey.

This was primarily driven by a 24.4% increase in financial services platform revenues, as a result of active client base growth and higher monetization from clients, mainly in our MSMB segment.Adjusted EBITDA in 4Q23 was R$1,618.3 million, up 31.5% year over year and 1.8% quarter over quarter. Adjusted EBITDA Margin slightly decreased sequentially from 50.7% to 49.8%, mainly due to an increase in other expenses, given higher labor contingencies, and administrative expenses excluding D&A, seasonally higher in the last quarter of the year.Adjusted EBT in 4Q23 was R$638.2 million, up 131.6% year over year and 17.2% quarter over quarter, with adjusted EBT margin increasing 2.3 percentage points sequentially to 19.6%. The sequential margin increase is primarily attributed to consolidated revenue growth, as well as lower financial expenses. These effects were partially offset by higher other operating expenses and administrative expenses.Adjusted Net Income in 4Q23 was R$563.8 million, 176.6% higher year over year, with adjusted net margin of 17.4%. This compares with R$435.1 million and a margin of 13.9% in 3Q23. The quarter over quarter margin improvement was driven by the same factors that impacted Adjusted EBT margin combined with a lower effective tax rate.Adjusted Net Cash position was R$5,053.3 million in 4Q23, increasing 44.8% year over year or 4.0% quarter over quarter. The sequential increase of R$195.8 million was mainly driven by (i) R$1,021.6 million of cash net income (net income plus non-cash income and expenses as reported in our statement of cash flows), (ii) plus a R$85.7 million inflow from recoverable taxes and taxes payable. These effects were partially offset by (iii) R$25.4 million from prepaid expenses; (iv) R$285.3 million of capex; (v) R$292.7 million from buyback of shares, and (vi) R$312.8 million from loans disbursements. OUTLOOK Our 2023 trajectory reinforced our commitment to the long-term targets. We continue to believe that StoneCo is uniquely positioned to drive strong return to shareholders.

Financial Services segment Revenue reached R$2,870.6 million in 4Q23, 24.4% higher year over year. Segment growth was driven by the strong performance in our MSMB client segment, attributed mainly to (i) consistently strong TPV growth, increasing 20.2% year over year (24.8% if PIX QR code volumes were included) and more than twice the industry pace, as announced by ABECS, and (ii) a higher take rate of 2.43% in the quarter, up 22 basis points year over year.Financial Services segment Adjusted EBT was R$603.8 million in 4Q23, up 145.4% year over year and 24.4% quarter over quarter. Adjusted EBT margin reached 21.0%, an improvement of 3.3 percentage points from 17.7% in 3Q23. This sequential expansion was driven by an increase in revenues from the segment, combined with lower financial expenses. These effects were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses and administrative expenses.Consolidated TPV grew 13.3% year over year to R$113.5 billion in 4Q23, driven by 20.2% growth in the MSMB segment, partially offset by a 17.6% decrease in Key Accounts’ TPV. In 2023, total TPV reached R$408.3 billion, representing a 11.2% year over year growth, compared with an industry growth of 10.1% in the same period.Total Payments Active Client base reached 3.5 million10 representing a total quarterly net addition of 191,200 active clients. a. MSMB (Micro and SMB clients) MSMB Active Payment Clients reached 3,471,30011, representing a 37.4% year over year growth and a net addition of 192,200 in 4Q23. The quarter over quarter decrease in net adds is mainly explained by fourth-quarter seasonality. Despite this effect, our continued investments in marketing supported the increase in gross adds, with positive trends in all tiers of clients.MSMB TPV was R$98.5 billion, up 20.2% year over year and more than twice compared to the industry growth according to ABECS. This was mainly driven by the continuous expansion in our MSMB active payment client base.MSMB TPV from PIX QR Code was R$7.6 billion in the quarter, increasing 37.5% compared with 3Q23, mainly due to an increase of use in our PIX POS solution. Including this volume in the MSMB TPV, the total year over year growth would have been 24.8%. PIX QR Code MSMB TPV includes transactions from dynamic POS QR Code and static QR Code from Stone and Ton merchants, with both types being possible to monetize. This volume is not included in the take rate calculation.MSMB Average Monthly TPV per client decreased 15.1% year over year. This decrease is in line with the previous quarters and is a result of the Ton representativeness in the client mix, which is mainly used by micro-merchants and have lower average TPV compared to our SMB merchants, which predominantly use our Stone and Pagar.me solutions.MSMB Take Rate was 2.43%, 6bps lower quarter over quarter and up 22bps on a year over year basis. The quarter over quarter variation is mainly attributed to (i) a seasonal increase in debit over credit volumes, and (ii) a lower duration of prepayment.Banking solutions12 Banking client base in 4Q23 reached 2.1 million active clients, increasing 8.5% quarter over quarter. This result was driven by (i) a larger number of Ton clients with our full banking solution, and (ii) the continued activation of new banking accounts within our Stone payments client base. The decrease seen in growth levels compared to previous quarters is mainly due to the end of the migration of Ton clients to our full banking solution.Total deposits were R$6,119.5 million in the quarter, increasing 52.1% year over year and 37.5% quarter over quarter. This strong increase was mainly explained by positive impacts from our combined offer of banking and payments solutions driving higher levels of cash-in and by the seasonal and calendar effects at the end of the quarter.Banking ARPAC (average revenue per active client) was R$28.4 per client per month, decreasing 36.5% year over year. The quarter over quarter evolution of 11.4% was mainly attributed to revenues from the processing of PIX QR Code transactions, which were more than enough to compensate lower yield over deposits following the sequential decline in the overnight rate. Credit Solutions: As of December 31, 2023, we disbursed a total of R$353.6 million of loans reaching 10,752 contracts, with a credit portfolio of R$309.4 million at month-end. Specifically, in 4Q23, we disbursed R$231.7 million to 7,005 contracts. Our focus remains on SMB clients, with an average ticket of R$33,000.Loan loss provision expenses totaled R$39.4 million in the quarter, compared with R$19.0 million in 3Q23. We build provisions equivalent to 20% of the credit portfolio in the period.In the quarter, NPL 15-90 days was 1.96% and NPL over 90 days was 0.29%. Key Accounts Clients Key Accounts TPV was R$15.0 billion, 17.6% lower year over year, as we continue to deprioritize and offboard low margin clients.Key Accounts take rate was 1.28% in 4Q23, up 16 basis points on a quarter over quarter basis and 11 basis points higher than in 4Q22. The year over year variation is attributed to higher prices and a positive mix shift due to the roll-off of lower margin clients. These positive effects were partially offset by lower prepayment volumes in Key Account clients that is in line with our strategy.

Following our Investor Day, we will no longer disclose Core and Digital revenues year over year growth and will rather start offering more data regarding the new division presented in the event, which was composed of our four strategic verticals, enterprise business and other verticals. The year over year decrease in Software revenues was mainly driven by a decrease in Enterprise revenues, which was down 16% year over year, being partially offset by an increase from revenues in other verticals, due to seasonal effects in our customer review platform, and the performance of our four key strategic verticals. Compared with 3Q23, software segment revenue decreased 6.4% sequentially, explained mainly by lower other financial income and enterprise revenues.Software Segment Adjusted EBITDA was R$58.7 million in 4Q23, with a margin of 16.2%. This compares with R$59.6 million and a margin of 15.8% in 4Q22. The year over year decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was mainly due to restructuring costs. In 3Q23, Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.5%, decreasing 4.3 percentage points, as a result of lower revenues ex other financial income, combined with non-recurring restructuring costs in the amount of R$11.5 million. Excluding this effect, adjusted EBITDA margin would have been 19.3% in 4Q23.Software Segment Adjusted EBT was R$33.0 million in 4Q23, up 8.2% year over year. Compared with 3Q23, Adjusted EBT decreased 40.5%, with Adjusted EBT Margin decreasing from 14.3% to 9.1%. The sequential decrease in Adjusted EBT is a result of the factors above mentioned for the quarter over quarter variation for Adjusted EBITDA margin.Cross-sell Evolution: The MSMB TPV overlap between financial services and the four prioritized verticals namely, Gas Stations, Retail, Food and Drugstores, increased 19.3% quarter over quarter, reaching R$5.8 billion in 4Q23. Among the 4 key verticals, Gas Stations is the most advanced initiative and is driving the overlap growth.

This increase can be primarily attributed to (i) a 13.3% year over year consolidated TPV growth; (ii) revenue streams from other solutions, mainly PIX; and (iii) higher revenue from membership fees16, which contributed with R$74.2 million to our transaction activities and other services revenue in the quarter, compared with R$60.8 million in 4Q22. Revenues from TAG, our registry business, contributed with R$27.4 million to our transaction activities and other services revenue in the quarter, compared with R$49.4 million in 4Q22. Net Revenue from Subscription Services and Equipment Rental Net Revenue from Subscription Services and Equipment Rental slightly decreased in the quarter to R$459.1 million, also attributed to lower software revenues. Financial Income Financial Income in 4Q23 was R$1,770.8 million, up 33.0% year over year, explained by higher (i) prepaid volumes; and (ii) floating revenue from our banking solution. Other Financial Income Other Financial Income was R$150.7 million in 4Q23 compared with R$132.1 million in 4Q22 mainly due to a higher average cash balance in the period. On a quarter over quarter basis, Other Financial Income decreased 19.4% mainly explained by a reduction in the base rate in Brazil in the period combined with a lower average cash balance sequentially. Costs and Expenses Cost of Services Cost of Services were R$802.7 million in 4Q23, up 15.0% year over year. This increase is mainly attributed to (i) provisions for loan losses from our new credit product, which totaled R$39.4 million in our cost of services in the quarter and were null in 4Q22; (ii) investments in technology; and (iii) D&A costs as we continue to expand our client base. Excluding provisions from loan losses, cost of services would have increased 9.4% year over year. As a percentage of revenues, Cost of Services decreased from 25.8% in 4Q22 to 24.7 % in 4Q23. Compared with 3Q23, Cost of Services was 3.8% higher, explained by the same aforementioned drivers. Provisions for loan losses contributed with R$39.4 million to our cost of services in the quarter, compared with R$19.0 million in 3Q23. Excluding provisions from loan losses, cost of services would have increased 1.2% sequentially. As a percentage of revenues, Cost of Services remained flat. Administrative Expenses Administrative Expenses were R$308.6 million, down 5.7% year over year. This decrease is mostly explained by changes in the allocation between costs and expenses lines from the Software segment, which were partially offset by higher third-party services. As a percentage of Total Revenue and Income, Administrative Expenses decreased from 12.1% in 4Q22 to 9.5% in 4Q23. Administrative Expenses in 4Q23 were 10.9% higher than in 3Q23, primarily due to (i) higher expenses related to third-party services; combined with (ii) personnel expenses that are usually higher in the fourth quarter. As a percentage of total revenues, Administrative Expenses increased from 8.9% in 3Q23 to 9.5% in 4Q23. Administrative Expenses in 4Q23 include R$31.3 million of expenses that are adjusted in our Adjusted Income Statement, related to amortization of fair value adjustments on acquisitions, mostly related to the Linx and other software companies’ acquisitions (see table 14 in Appendix for the Adjustments by P&L line). Adjusting for those effects, Administrative Expenses were R$296.5 million in 4Q22, R$243.5 million in 3Q23 and R$277.3 million in 4Q23. As a percentage of Total Revenue and Income, Administrative Expenses were 11.0% in 4Q22, 7.8% in 3Q23 and 8.5% in 4Q23. Such year over year and quarter over quarter variations are explained by the same reasons mentioned above for the accounting numbers. Selling Expenses Selling Expenses were R$454.0 million in the quarter, an 11.8% increase year over year primarily attributed to higher expenses with partner commissions. As a percentage of revenues, Selling Expenses decreased from 15.0% in 4Q22 to 14.0% in 4Q23. Compared with 3Q23, Selling Expenses increased by 2.6%, due to higher provisions for variable compensation in the period. As a percentage of revenues, Selling Expenses was flat sequentially. Financial Expenses, Net Financial Expenses, Net were R$943.1 million in the quarter, up 3.5% compared with 4Q22, due to higher prepaid volumes. This was partially offset by a reduction in average CDI in the period, from 13.65% in 4Q22 to 12.25% in 4Q23. As a percentage of revenues, Financial Expenses, Net was 29.0% in 4Q23 compared with 33.7% in 4Q22. Compared with 3Q23, Financial Expenses, Net were 10.9% lower. This decrease was driven by (i) a reduction in average CDI in the period, from 13.27% in 3Q23 to 12.25% in 4Q23, (ii) the lower amount of working days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter; (iii) a seasonal decline in the average duration of funding lines; and (iv) a lower average cash balance in the period. These effects were partially offset by quarterly TPV growth. Financial Expenses include R$2.0 million of expenses that are adjusted in our Adjusted Income Statement related to effects from (i) earn out interests on business combinations, and (ii) financial expenses from fair value adjustments on acquisitions (see table 14 in Appendix for the Adjustments by P&L line). Adjusting for those effects, Financial Expenses, net were R$903.4 million in 4Q22, R$1,044.5 million in 3Q23 and R$941.1 million in 4Q23 or 33.4%, 33.3% and 29.0% as a percentage of Total Revenue and Income, respectively. Such year over year and quarter over quarter variations are explained by the same reasons mentioned above for the accounting numbers. Mark-to-market on equity securities designated at FVPL In 1Q23, we divested our stake in Banco Inter. As a result, from 2Q23 onwards, our profit & loss statement no longer includes mark-to-market gains or losses associated with this investment. This compares with a R$114.5 million loss in 4Q22. Mark-to-market on equity securities designated at FVPL is fully adjusted in our Adjusted Income Statement (see table 14 in Appendix for the Adjustments by P&L line). Other Income (Expenses), Net Other Expenses, Net were R$0.3 million in 4Q23, representing a decrease of R$108.7 million year over year. This decline is mainly attributed to reversal of earn-out provisions. Compared with 3Q23, Other Expenses, net were R$82.3 million lower mostly attributed to the reversal of earnout provisions, being partially offset by higher tax provisions related to share-based compensation due to an increase in the share price in the period. Other Expenses, net include R$133.3 million gains that are excluded in our Adjusted Income Statement, including call options related to acquisitions, earn-out interests, reversal of litigation of Linx and divestment of assets (see table 14 in Appendix for the Adjustments by P&L line). Until 4Q22, we used to also adjust our numbers for share-based compensation expenses related to the one-time IPO grant and non-recurring long term incentive plans, which we stopped doing from 1Q23 onwards. For comparability purposes, based on adjustments criteria adopted from 1Q23 onwards, in which we do not adjust our results for share-based compensation expenses, and adjusting for the factors above, Other Expenses, net, were R$126.1 million in 4Q22, R$90.6 million in 3Q23 and R$133.7 million in 4Q23 or 4.7%, 2.9% and 4.1% as a percentage of Total Revenue and Income, respectively. The year over year variation is mostly explained by higher labor contingencies, being partially offset by lower civil contingencies and POS write off. Income Tax and Social Contribution During 4Q23, the Company recognized income tax and social contribution expenses of R$82.0 million over a profit before income taxes of R$738.2 million, implying an effective tax rate of 11.1%. The difference to the statutory rate is mainly explained by (i) benefits from “Lei do Bem” (Law 11,196/05) incentives from the fiscal year of 2023, as well as (ii) gains from subsidiaries abroad subject to different statutory tax rates. The Income Tax and Social Contribution in our Adjusted Income Statement includes an additional R$7.6 million relating to taxes from the adjusted items (see table 14 in Appendix for the Adjustments by P&L line). Adjusting for those effects, our Income Tax and Social Contribution was R$74.4 million with an effective tax rate in 4Q23 of 11.7%, lower than the statutory rate mostly as a result of the aforementioned explanation for the accounting explanation. EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA was R$1,618.3 million in the quarter, compared with R$1,231.1 million in 4Q22. This increase is mostly explained by higher Total Revenue and Income, excluding Other Financial Income, due to the growth of our operations. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 49.8% in the quarter, compared with 45.5% in 4Q22 and 50.7% in 3Q23. The sequential decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin is mainly attributed to an increase in other expenses and administrative expenses excluding D&A, which offset the sequential growth of Total Revenue and Income, excluding Other Financial Income in the period.

EBITDA was R$1,751.6 million in the quarter, 54.5% higher than R$1,133.6 million in the prior year period, mostly as a result of the increase in Total Revenue and Income, excluding Other Financial Income. These effects were partially offset by higher cost of services and selling expenses, excluding D&A. Net Income (Loss) and EPS Net Income in 4Q23 was R$656.2 million and R$78.8 million in 4Q22 on a comparable basis, mostly as a result of higher total revenue and income, combined with lower administrative expenses and lower effective tax rate. IFRS basic EPS was R$2.10 per share in 4Q23, compared with R$0.25 in the prior-year period. Adjusted Net Income was R$563.8 million in 4Q23 with a margin of 17.4%, compared with R$203.8 million reported in 4Q22 and a margin of 7.5% on a comparable basis (not adjusting for share-based compensation expenses). This increase in Adjusted Net Income is mainly explained by (i) a 28.0% year over year growth in total revenue and income net of adjusted financial expenses, combined with (ii) operating leverage in cost of services (up 15.0% year over year), despite provisions for loan losses in 4Q23, which were null in 4Q22, (iii) lower adjusted administrative expenses (down 6.5% year over year), and (iv) lower effective tax rate. Adjusted Net Income was up 29.6% quarter over quarter, with Adjusted Net Margin improving 3.5 percentage points from 13.9% in 3Q23 to 17.4% in 4Q23, mainly as a result of higher total revenue and income, as well as lower financial expenses and lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS was R$1.76 per share in 4Q23 compared with R$0.63 per share in 4Q22 and R$1.32 per share in 3Q23, on a comparable basis (not adjusting for share-based compensation expenses). Table 8: Adjusted Net Income Reconciliation From 1Q23 onwards, we stopped adjusting share-based compensation expenses in our adjusted results. Those changes may affect the comparability of our adjusted results between different quarters. For that reason, we have included below our historical numbers on a comparable basis, not adjusting for share-based compensation expenses, according to our current adjustment criteria.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the numerator of basic EPS, considering adjustments of potentially convertible instruments related to contingent consideration of acquisitions, as presented in Note 24.3. of our Financial Statements. However, due to the loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, these instruments issued have a non-diluting effect, therefore, they were not considered in the total numerator of diluted loss per share. In the 4Q23, we have improved our accounting policy to calculate the share-based instruments used in the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. For share-based transactions, a calculation is done to determine the quantity of shares that could have been acquired at fair value, considering the difference between (i) the quantity of shares issuable, reduced by (ii) the quantity of shares that could be purchased at the weighted average quoted market price during the period, with the proceeds to be obtained (if any) upon issuance of the shares. As per IAS 33, proceeds for share-based compensation instruments must include, as deemed proceeds, the amount to be recognized as compensation expense in profit and loss in future periods for such instruments. More details presented in Note 16.3.1 of our Financial Statements.

Net Income with and without share-based compensation adjustmentsFollowing the partial sale of our stake in Banco Inter, from 2Q22 onwards we no longer adjust the financial expenses related to our bond in our adjusted numbers. In addition, from 1Q23 onwards, we also stopped adjusting share-based compensation expenses in our adjusted results.

Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. These statements identify prospective information and may include words such as “believe”, “may”, “will”, “aim”, “estimate”, “continue”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “expect”, “forecast”, “plan”, “predict”, “project”, “potential”, “aspiration”, “objectives”, “should”, “purpose”, “belief”, and similar, or variations of, or the negative of such words and expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which involve factors or circumstances that are beyond Stone’s control.Stone’s actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: more intense competition than expected, lower addition of new clients, regulatory measures, more investments in our business than expected, and our inability to execute successfully upon our strategic initiatives, among other factors. About Non-IFRS Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures presented in this press release and related conference call, presentation, or webcast in accordance with IFRS, Stone also presents non-IFRS measures of financial performance, including: Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted EPS (diluted), Adjusted Net Margin, Adjusted Net Cash / (Debt), Adjusted Profit (Loss) Before Income Taxes, Adjusted Pre-Tax Margin, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.A “non-IFRS financial measure” refers to a numerical measure of Stone’s historical or future financial performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS in Stone’s financial statements. Stone provides certain non-IFRS measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the financial information presented in accordance with IFRS.

Further, these measures may differ from the non-IFRS information, even where similarly titled, used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare Stone’s performance to that of other companies.Stone has presented Adjusted Net Income to eliminate the effect of items from Net Income that it does not consider indicative of its continuing business performance within the period presented. Stone defines Adjusted Net Income as Net Income (Loss) for the Period, adjusted for (1) amortization of fair value adjustment on acquisitions, (2) mark-to-market of equity investments, and (3) unusual income and expenses. Adjusted EPS (diluted) is calculated as Adjusted Net income attributable to owners of the parent (Adjusted Net Income reduced by Net Income attributable to Non-Controlling interest) divided by diluted number of shares. Stone has presented Adjusted Profit Before Income Taxes and Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the effect of items that it does not consider indicative of its continuing business performance within the period presented. Stone adjusts these metrics for the same items as Adjusted Net Income, as applicable.Stone has presented Adjusted Net Cash metric in order to adjust its Net Cash / (Debt) by the balances of Accounts Receivable from Card Issuers and Accounts Payable to Clients, since these lines vary according to the Company’s funding source together with the lines of (i) Cash and Cash Equivalents, (ii) Short-term Investments, (iii) Debt balances and (iv) Derivative Financial Instruments related to economic hedges of short term investments in assets, due to the nature of Stone’s business and its prepayment operations. In addition, it also adjusts by the balances of Financial Assets from Banking Solutions and Deposits from Banking Customers. ___________________________________1 Considers transactions from dynamic POS QR Code and static QR Code from Stone and Ton merchants.

(SOUN) partners with NVIDIA DRIVE to introduce an innovative in-vehicle voice assistant that operates on the edge without cloud connectivity. The solution combines real-time and generative AI capabilities, enabling drivers to access Vehicle Intelligence for instant information and seamless voice interaction. Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Technology Analyst The integration of SoundHound's AI with NVIDIA's DRIVE platform represents a significant advancement in automotive technology. By leveraging a large language model running on the edge, this collaboration addresses a key limitation in current in-vehicle voice assistants: the dependency on cloud connectivity. This technological leap has the potential to enhance the user experience by offering seamless voice interaction, even in areas with poor or no internet connection.From an industry perspective, this could set a new standard for in-vehicle systems, compelling competitors to accelerate their own edge-computing capabilities. The move towards edge computing in vehicles aligns with broader trends in data privacy and security, as it allows sensitive information to be processed locally rather than being transmitted to the cloud. For automakers, this could translate into a unique selling proposition, emphasizing user privacy and uninterrupted access to voice assistant features.However, the impact on business and the stock market will largely depend on the adoption rate by automakers and the end-users' reception of the technology. If widely adopted, this could lead to an increase in demand for NVIDIA's DRIVE platform and SoundHound's voice AI solutions, potentially affecting their market positions and financial performance positively. Data Privacy Expert The announcement by SoundHound AI highlights an emerging trend in the technology sector where companies are placing greater emphasis on data privacy. By enabling large language models to run directly on devices, SoundHound and NVIDIA are addressing growing concerns about data privacy and security. This approach could become a competitive differentiator in the market, as consumers are becoming increasingly aware of and concerned about how their data is used and stored.For businesses, this shift towards on-device processing could reduce the risk of data breaches and the associated legal and reputational costs. It also aligns with global regulatory trends, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which impose strict rules on data handling and privacy. Companies that proactively adopt such privacy-centric innovations may find themselves at an advantage both in terms of compliance and customer trust.While the implications for stakeholders are promising in terms of privacy and security, the long-term benefits will depend on the robustness of the technology and its ability to resist hacking attempts. If successful, this could lead to a new wave of privacy-focused products and services in the automotive and broader IoT industries. Market Research Analyst The collaboration between SoundHound AI and NVIDIA to bring generative AI capabilities to vehicles is indicative of the growing consumer demand for advanced in-car technologies. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, features such as sophisticated voice assistants are becoming key factors in consumer purchasing decisions.Market research indicates that consumers value technology that enhances convenience and safety while driving. The ability to access vehicle information and control features through natural speech without the need for internet connectivity could be a strong selling point. This innovation not only improves the driving experience but also has the potential to reduce driver distraction, contributing to road safety.Automakers that adopt this technology early on may gain a competitive edge in the market. However, the cost implications for manufacturers and the added value for consumers will be critical factors in determining the success of this technology. If the technology is cost-effective and reliably improves the user experience, it could lead to increased market share and revenue for the companies involved. 03/18/2024 - 06:02 PM Solution combines SoundHound Chat AI with a large language model running in-vehicle on NVIDIA DRIVE for seamless voice interaction SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SoundHound AI, Inc.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318067099/en/This marks a new chapter for generative AI, proving that the powerful technology can still deliver optimal results in the absence of cloud connectivity. (Graphic: Business Wire) This marks a new chapter for generative AI, proving that the powerful technology can still deliver optimal results in the absence of cloud connectivity. SoundHound’s work with NVIDIA will allow it to significantly expand the number of places and situations that generative AI can be deployed. NVIDIA DRIVE will enable SoundHound Chat AI – a breakthrough in-vehicle voice platform that combines both real-time and generative AI capabilities – to provide responses even when there is no connectivity. Among a range of use cases, the new solution will let drivers access SoundHound Vehicle Intelligence, a product that instantly delivers information directly from the car manual and other relevant data sources using natural speech. Vehicle Intelligence understands a verbal request and seamlessly provides answers – including settings, safety, troubleshooting, and vehicle maintenance – without the need for a cumbersome physical document. Examples include: “I see a flashing light that looks like a car battery and I’m not sure what that means?” “What does the ‘auto hold’ button do?” “How do I use that feature that lets me drive hands-free safely?” In addition to Vehicle Intelligence, users can ask more general questions that can help drivers plan a trip or a vacation, such as: “Where are the best locations to take photographs on the Pacific Coast Highway?” “Which wineries offer riesling in Carmel Valley?” “What kinds of dishes count as Californian cuisine?” This cutting-edge technology opens up huge opportunities for automakers looking to give drivers rapid voice-enabled access to LLM capabilities with the added benefit of greater privacy, flexibility, and lower operating costs. “Together with NVIDIA, we’re marrying the incredible capabilities of generative AI with all the advantages of edge computing,” said Mike Zagorsek, COO of SoundHound AI. “The net result is a fast and private voice experience with seamless results. And with this new level of adaptability, the possibilities are endless.” “We’re working with innovative partners like SoundHound to bring generative AI and accelerated compute into the car – enhancing the occupant experience and bringing greater safety behind the wheel,” said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA. “SoundHound’s in-vehicle voice interface, powered by NVIDIA DRIVE, can provide drivers with fast, accurate information, even when there’s no connection.” SoundHound AI offers a selection of on-device edge voice solutions that allow automakers to grant their end-users greater levels of privacy by keeping data stored locally.

The QCaaS model is likely to provide a recurring revenue model, which is generally favorable for financial stability and forecasting.The early access signup for NVIDIA Quantum Cloud suggests an initial phase of user engagement and feedback, which is important for refining the service before a full-scale launch. This phased approach can help manage costs and scale the service in alignment with user demand and feedback. It's also indicative of a strategic go-to-market plan that mitigates the financial risks associated with new product launches.Given the importance of quantum computing in future technological advancements, the investment in this area could position NVIDIA as a leader in a nascent but rapidly growing market. This strategic move might be well-received by investors looking for companies at the forefront of technological innovation with long-term growth potential. Technology Analyst NVIDIA's CUDA-Q™ platform's role as the foundation for the Quantum Cloud service is a testament to the company's expertise in parallel computing and its application in quantum environments. CUDA has long been a staple in the GPU programming space and its extension to quantum computing could signal a new era of hybrid quantum-classical computing algorithms.The mention of the Generative Quantum Eigensolver and its use of large language models (LLMs) is particularly intriguing. This suggests that NVIDIA is not only providing the infrastructure for quantum computing but is also involved in the development of advanced algorithms that can leverage quantum computing for specific scientific tasks, such as finding the ground-state energy of molecules more efficiently.The integration of sophisticated quantum programs and the execution of quantum circuits through partnerships with companies like Classiq reflects NVIDIA's emphasis on creating a robust and versatile platform. As quantum computing continues to evolve, the ability to generate and analyze complex quantum circuits will become increasingly important for researchers and developers working on cutting-edge scientific problems. 03/18/2024 - 05:58 PM Available Through Major Cloud Providers, NVIDIA’s Quantum Simulation Platform to Help Scientists Advance Quantum Computing and Algorithm ResearchSAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today launched a cloud service that allows researchers and developers to push the boundaries of quantum computing exploration in key scientific domains, including chemistry, biology and materials science. NVIDIA Quantum Cloud is based on the company’s open-source CUDA-Q™ quantum computing platform, which is used by three-quarters of the companies deploying quantum processing units, or QPUs. As a microservice, it lets users for the first time build and test in the cloud new quantum algorithms and applications — including powerful simulators and tools for hybrid quantum-classical programming. “Quantum computing presents the next revolutionary frontier of computing and it’s going to require the world’s most brilliant minds to bring this future one step closer,” said Tim Costa, director of HPC and quantum computing at NVIDIA. “NVIDIA Quantum Cloud breaks down the barriers to explore this transformative technology and lets every scientist in the world harness the power of quantum computing and bring their ideas closer to reality.” Quantum Cloud features powerful capabilities and third-party software integrations to accelerate scientific exploration, including: The Generative Quantum Eigensolver, developed in a collaboration with the University of Toronto, leverages large language models (LLMs) to enable a quantum computer to find the ground-state energy of a molecule more quickly.Classiq’s integration with CUDA-Q allows quantum researchers to generate large, sophisticated quantum programs, as well as to deeply analyze and execute quantum circuits.QC Ware Promethium tackles complex quantum chemistry problems such as molecular simulation.

Market Research Analyst Integration of NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs into the software portfolios of major industrial players marks a significant advancement in digital twin technology. Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems, allowing for real-time monitoring, simulation and analysis. The adoption by companies like Siemens, Ansys and Microsoft not only validates the technology but also signals a broader industry shift towards immersive, interactive simulations and AI-enhanced operations.The ability to create highly accurate and interactive models is a game-changer for industries such as manufacturing, automotive and construction. It enables cost savings by reducing the need for physical prototypes, shortens design cycles and enhances the decision-making process with predictive analytics. The collaboration between these tech giants is likely to accelerate innovation, leading to more sophisticated digital twin solutions that could become industry standards.However, the widespread adoption of such technologies also raises questions about data privacy, security and the need for significant computational resources. As these APIs are integrated into various platforms, companies will have to ensure robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data. Additionally, the computational demand may necessitate investment in high-performance hardware, potentially affecting smaller players who may lack the resources to keep up. Financial Analyst The announcement by NVIDIA about the adoption of its Omniverse Cloud APIs by leading industrial software makers could have a notable impact on NVIDIA's financial performance. The expansion into cloud-based API services opens up new revenue streams and strengthens NVIDIA's position in the enterprise software market. This move could attract further partnerships and increase the company's market share in the digital twin space.For the partnering companies, integrating these APIs could lead to increased efficiency and potentially reduce costs over time, which may reflect positively in their financial statements. Investors should monitor the adoption rate and customer feedback, as these will be critical indicators of the technology's success and its financial implications. The potential for NVIDIA's technology to become a de facto standard in digital twin applications could lead to long-term growth, but it will depend on the continued innovation and competitive edge of NVIDIA's offerings.It is also important to consider the capital expenditures associated with the adoption of these technologies. Companies may face upfront costs for integration and ongoing expenses for cloud services, which could affect short-term profitability but may be justified by long-term gains in operational efficiency and innovation leadership. Legal Expert The widespread integration of NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIs poses legal and regulatory considerations for the companies involved. Compliance with data protection regulations, such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, is essential when handling the vast amounts of data processed by digital twins. The cross-border nature of cloud services further complicates compliance, as data may be subject to multiple jurisdictions with varying laws.Intellectual property rights will also be at the forefront, as the development of digital twins involves complex software and potentially proprietary data. Companies must navigate licensing agreements carefully to avoid disputes over technology usage rights. Furthermore, as digital twins increasingly influence decision-making in critical infrastructure, there could be heightened scrutiny from regulatory bodies to ensure the reliability and safety of these systems.Lastly, the partnership between these tech giants and their use of advanced AI and rendering technologies could attract attention from antitrust regulators. The concentration of such capabilities within a few large entities may raise concerns about competitive fairness and market dominance. 03/18/2024 - 05:38 PM Ansys, Cadence, Hexagon, Microsoft, Rockwell Automation, Siemens, Trimble Adopt Omniverse Technologies to Help Customers Design, Simulate, Build and Operate Physically Based Digital TwinsSAN JOSE, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced that NVIDIA Omniverse™ Cloud will be available as APIs, extending the reach of the world’s leading platform for creating industrial digital twin applications and workflows across the entire ecosystem of software makers.

(NASDAQ: BANX) reported an estimated unaudited Net Asset Value (NAV) of $21.50 as of February 29, 2024.","ArrowMark Financial Corp. Releases Month End Estimated Net Asset Value as of February 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ArrowMark Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: BANX) reported an estimated unaudited Net Asset Value (NAV) of $21.50 as of February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The estimated Net Asset Value (NAV) of ArrowMark Financial Corp. serves as a key indicator for evaluating the company's current financial position. The NAV, which stands at $21.50, provides investors with a snapshot of the company's value per share, excluding any liabilities. This figure is particularly important for closed-end funds, investment trusts and other financial entities that trade on stock markets, as it offers a basis for comparison against the market price.When assessing the implications for stakeholders, the disclosed NAV aids in determining whether the shares are trading at a premium or discount relative to their intrinsic value. A higher NAV compared to the trading price could suggest that the company's assets are undervalued by the market, potentially attracting investors seeking bargain opportunities. Conversely, a lower NAV might indicate overvaluation, prompting a more cautious approach.However, it's imperative to consider that the NAV is unaudited and estimated, which introduces a degree of uncertainty. Stakeholders should anticipate potential adjustments once audited financials are available. Long-term investors, in particular, would benefit from monitoring trends in NAV over time, as this reflects the company's performance and asset management efficacy. Market Research Analyst ArrowMark Financial Corp.'s announcement of its estimated NAV is a valuable piece of information for market participants, as it reflects not only the company's financial health but also market sentiment and operational efficiency. The NAV is a fundamental metric used by analysts to gauge the potential growth or decline in a company's asset base over time.From a market research perspective, the announced NAV can influence investor behavior and stock market performance. If the NAV per share is perceived as strong, it may lead to increased investor confidence and a potential uptick in BANX's stock price. On the other hand, if the NAV is deemed weak, it might result in a negative market reaction. It's important to note that this is just one of many factors investors consider when making decisions.Furthermore, tracking the historical NAV trends can provide insights into the company's asset management strategies and their effectiveness. Any significant deviations from industry norms or historical patterns could signal a need for a deeper analysis of the company's operational and financial strategies. 03/18/2024 - 05:30 PM DENVER, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ArrowMark Financial Corp., (NASDAQ: BANX) (""ArrowMark Financial""), today announced that BANX’s estimated and unaudited Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as of February 29, 2024, was $21.50.

Furthermore, the focus on maintaining intellectual property control may appeal to businesses that are cautious about third-party dependencies and data security concerns.However, the impact on the stock market will largely depend on the actual implementation success and the financial performance derived from these services. Investors will be monitoring the adoption rate and how it translates into NVIDIA's financials. A high adoption rate could signal strong future earnings, while any setbacks or slower-than-anticipated uptake might temper investor enthusiasm. Data Security Analyst NVIDIA's emphasis on allowing enterprises to retain full ownership and control of their intellectual property when using these AI microservices is a critical aspect to consider. In the era of data breaches and stringent data protection laws, companies are increasingly wary of potential vulnerabilities that could arise from using third-party services.By providing a platform that prioritizes security and intellectual property protection, NVIDIA is not only addressing these concerns but also positioning itself as a preferred partner for businesses that prioritize data security. This move could lead to a competitive advantage in the market, as businesses may be more inclined to choose NVIDIA's secure AI solutions over less secure alternatives.While this is a positive development, it's important to consider the ongoing costs associated with maintaining high levels of security. These costs could affect NVIDIA's pricing strategy and profit margins. Investors should pay attention to how these factors balance out in the long term.

The new suite of NVIDIA healthcare microservices includes optimized NVIDIA NIM™ AI models and workflows with industry-standard APIs, or application programming interfaces, to serve as building blocks for creating and deploying cloud-native applications. They offer advanced imaging, natural language and speech recognition, and digital biology generation, prediction and simulation. Additionally, NVIDIA accelerated software development kits and tools, including Parabricks®, MONAI, NeMo™, Riva and Metropolis, can now be accessed as NVIDIA CUDA-X™ microservices to accelerate healthcare workflows for drug discovery, medical imaging and genomics analysis. The microservices, 25 of which launched today, can accelerate transformation for healthcare companies as generative AI introduces numerous opportunities for pharmaceutical companies, doctors and hospitals. These include screening for trillions of drug compounds to advance medicine, gathering better patient data to aid early disease detection and implementing smarter digital assistants. Researchers, developers and practitioners can use the microservices to easily integrate AI into new and existing applications and run them anywhere — from the cloud to on premises — equipping them with copilot capabilities to enhance their life-saving work. “For the first time in history, we can represent the world of biology and chemistry in a computer, making computer-aided drug discovery possible,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “By helping healthcare companies easily build and manage AI solutions, we’re enabling them to harness the full power and potential of generative AI.” NVIDIA NIM Healthcare Microservices for InferencingThe new suite of healthcare microservices includes NVIDIA NIM, which provides optimized inference for a growing collection of models across imaging, medtech, drug discovery and digital health. These can be used for generative biology and chemistry, and molecular prediction. NIM microservices are available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise 5.0 software platform.

The company has six months to file and regain compliance. Chemours is working to complete its reporting process and will announce the earnings release schedule soon. Positive None. Negative Chemours received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE due to a delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which may impact investor confidence and stock performance in the short term. Financial Analyst The notification from the NYSE to Chemours regarding non-compliance with listing requirements due to the delay in filing its Annual Report is a significant matter for investors and the market. The filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K is a fundamental aspect of a publicly-traded company's communication with its shareholders, providing a comprehensive overview of its financial condition, operations and corporate governance. A delay can signal potential issues within the company's financial reporting system, or in more severe cases, underlying financial distress.Investors often view delays in financial reporting as red flags, potentially leading to increased volatility in the company's stock price. The six-month period granted by the NYSE for Chemours to regain compliance is standard procedure, but it puts the company under pressure to resolve any outstanding issues promptly. The market will be closely monitoring the situation for any signs of deeper problems that could affect the company's financial stability and future performance. Market Research Analyst Chemours' delay in the filing of its Form 10-K also has implications beyond immediate financial reporting. Timely and accurate financial disclosures are essential for maintaining investor confidence and for the proper functioning of capital markets. The delay might raise questions among investors about the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. This is particularly important as strong internal controls are a key indicator of a company's financial health and its ability to mitigate risks.Furthermore, the announcement that the Audit Committee's review has been substantially completed provides some reassurance that the company is making progress toward resolving its reporting issues. However, until the Annual Report is filed and investors can review the disclosed financials and management's discussion, uncertainty will likely persist. This uncertainty can have a chilling effect on the stock as potential investors may adopt a 'wait and see' approach, which could dampen trading volumes and potentially impact the stock price. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the non-compliance notice from the NYSE triggers specific procedural requirements for Chemours. The company must now follow a strict timeline to file its Form 10-K to avoid further sanctions, including potential delisting. Delisting from a major exchange like the NYSE can have severe consequences, such as reduced liquidity and access to capital markets, which in turn can impact the company's ability to raise funds and grow.Chemours' situation underscores the importance of adhering to regulatory requirements and the legal risks associated with failing to do so. While the company has not yet reached the point of facing delisting, the notice serves as a reminder to the market of the regulatory framework governing publicly listed companies and the seriousness with which the NYSE treats such infractions. 03/18/2024 - 05:16 PM WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On March 18, 2024, The Chemours Company (“Chemours” or “the Company”) (NYSE: CC) received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that the Company is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual due to a delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Together, they deliver the infrastructure and tools that enable customers to build and run real-time inference on multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and at a lower cost than previous-generation NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon EC2. “The deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world’s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. “NVIDIA’s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS’s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters’ hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system’s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else. Together, we continue to innovate to make AWS the best place to run NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.” ""AI is driving breakthroughs at an unprecedented pace, leading to new applications, business models, and innovation across industries,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what's possible."" Latest innovations from AWS and NVIDIA accelerate training of cutting-edge LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters AWS will offer the NVIDIA Blackwell platform, featuring GB200 NVL72, with 72 Blackwell GPUs and 36 Grace CPUs interconnected by fifth-generation NVIDIA NVLink™. When connected with Amazon’s powerful networking (EFA), and supported by advanced virtualization (AWS Nitro System) and hyper-scale clustering (Amazon EC2 UltraClusters), customers can scale to thousands of GB200 Superchips. NVIDIA Blackwell on AWS delivers a massive leap forward in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion parameter language models. Based on the success of the NVIDIA H100-powered EC2 P5 instances, which are available to customers for short durations through Amazon EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, AWS plans to offer EC2 instances featuring the new B100 GPUs deployed in EC2 UltraClusters for accelerating generative AI training and inference at massive scale. GB200s will also be available on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud, an AI platform co-engineered on AWS, that gives enterprise developers dedicated access to the infrastructure and software needed to build and deploy advanced generative AI models. The Blackwell-powered DGX Cloud instances on AWS will accelerate development of cutting-edge generative AI and LLMs that can reach beyond 1 trillion parameters. Elevate AI security with AWS Nitro System, AWS KMS, encrypted EFA, and Blackwell encryption As customers move quickly to implement AI in their organizations, they need to know that their data is being handled securely throughout their training workflow. The security of model weights—the parameters that a model learns during training that are critical for its ability to make predictions—is paramount to protecting customers’ intellectual property, preventing tampering with models, and maintaining model integrity. AWS AI infrastructure and services already have security features in place to give customers control over their data and ensure that it is not shared with third-party model providers. The combination of the AWS Nitro System and the NVIDIA GB200 takes AI security even further by preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing model weights. The GB200 allows physical encryption of the NVLink connections between GPUs and encrypts data transfer from the Grace CPU to the Blackwell GPU, while EFA encrypts data across servers for distributed training and inference. The GB200 will also benefit from the AWS Nitro System, which offloads I/O for functions from the host CPU/GPU to specialized AWS hardware to deliver more consistent performance, while its enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing—on both the customer side and AWS side. This capability—available only on AWS—has been independently verified by NCC Group, a leading cybersecurity firm. With the GB200 on Amazon EC2, AWS will enable customers to create a trusted execution environment alongside their EC2 instance, using AWS Nitro Enclaves and AWS KMS. Nitro Enclaves allows customers to encrypt their training data and weights with KMS, using key material under their control. The enclave can be loaded from within the GB200 instance and can communicate directly with the GB200 Superchip. This enables KMS to communicate directly with the enclave and pass key material directly to it in a cryptographically secure way. The enclave can then pass that material to the GB200, protected from the customer instance and preventing AWS operators from ever accessing the key or decrypting the training data or model weights, giving customers unparalleled control over their data.

BofA Securities and BTIG were co-placement agents. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of Outlook Therapeutics' private placement, which resulted in $60 million in upfront gross proceeds, is a significant liquidity event for the company. This influx of capital is particularly important for biopharmaceutical firms, as it provides the necessary funds to continue clinical trials, research and development. The potential to receive an additional $99 million upon the exercise of warrants introduces a future financing opportunity that could further bolster the company’s cash reserves without immediate dilution of shares.Analysing the investor profile, the participation of established investment firms like Great Point Partners and Altium Capital suggests a strong vote of confidence in Outlook Therapeutics' potential. However, investors should consider the terms of the warrants, such as the exercise price and expiration, which can impact the timing and likelihood of the additional funding. The involvement of co-placement agents BofA Securities and BTIG also lends credibility to the transaction and might facilitate future capital market activities. Biotech Market Analyst In the biotechnology sector, securing FDA approval is a pivotal milestone that can dramatically change a company's valuation. For Outlook Therapeutics, achieving the first approval for an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for retinal diseases holds significant market potential. Retinal diseases represent a growing concern as populations age and current treatments are often expensive. A new, potentially more cost-effective option could disrupt the market, benefiting patients and healthcare providers alike.However, the path to approval is fraught with regulatory challenges and clinical trial uncertainties. The capital raised through this private placement will be important in navigating these hurdles. Investors should monitor the company's progress closely, as any setbacks or advancements will likely impact the stock's performance. The diversity of the investors, including a life sciences dedicated investor, underscores the broad interest in Outlook Therapeutics' prospects within the specialized field of ophthalmology. Healthcare Economist The economic implications of introducing a new ophthalmic formulation like bevacizumab into the healthcare market are multifaceted. On one hand, it could lead to reduced treatment costs for retinal diseases, which aligns with the broader goal of cost containment in healthcare. On the other hand, the successful commercialization of this drug could shift market shares from existing treatments, affecting competitors' revenues and potentially leading to price adjustments across the industry.From a payer perspective, the introduction of a cost-effective treatment option could alleviate some of the financial burden associated with retinal diseases. This is particularly relevant for Medicare and other insurers who bear a significant portion of these costs. The long-term economic impact will depend on the drug's efficacy, safety profile and pricing strategy post-approval. Investors with a stake in the healthcare sector should consider these factors when evaluating the potential market dynamics Outlook Therapeutics' product might introduce. 03/18/2024 - 05:10 PM ISELIN, N.J., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: OTLK), a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve the first approval for an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of retinal diseases in the US and the EU, today announced that it has closed its previously announced private placement, for upfront gross proceeds of approximately $60 million from the issuance and sale of shares of the Company’s common stock and accompanying warrants, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. Outlook Therapeutics has the potential to receive additional gross proceeds of up to $99 million upon the full cash exercise of the warrants issued in the private placement, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. The private placement was led by Great Point Partners, LLC, with participation from existing investor GMS Ventures as well as new investors Altium Capital, Armistice Capital, Caligan Partners LP, Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, Sphera Healthcare, Velan Capital, Woodline Partners LP, and an undisclosed life sciences dedicated investor. BofA Securities and BTIG acted as co-placement agents in connection with the financing. About the Private Placement Pursuant to the securities purchase agreement entered into on January 22, 2024, Outlook Therapeutics issued to purchasers in the private placement an aggregate of 8,571,423 shares of common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 12,857,133 shares of common stock, at a price of $7.00 per share and accompanying warrant to purchase one and one-half shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $7.70 per share and are exercisable only for cash until their expiration on the fifth anniversary of the issuance date. The warrants include a feature that allows Outlook Therapeutics to require holders to cash exercise the warrants if certain stock price and milestone conditions are met. All of the securities in the private placement were offered by the Company. Outlook Therapeutics intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement to fund its ONS-5010 clinical development programs, including the ongoing NORSE EIGHT clinical trial, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. As previously disclosed, Outlook Therapeutics also entered into a securities purchase agreement with Syntone Ventures, another existing stockholder, to purchase $5 million in shares of common stock and warrants on the same terms as the private placement. The closing of the Syntone investment remains subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The offer and sale of the foregoing securities were made by Outlook Therapeutics in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and such securities have not been registered under the Act or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, such securities may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and such applicable state securities laws. Outlook Therapeutics has agreed to file a resale registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for purposes of registering the resale of the common stock issued or issuable in connection with the private placement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction. About ONS-5010 / LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development as an intravitreal injection for the treatment of wet AMD and other retinal diseases. Because no FDA or European Commission approved ophthalmic formulations of bevacizumab are available currently, clinicians wishing to treat retinal patients with bevacizumab have had to use repackaged IV bevacizumab provided by compounding pharmacies—products that have known risks of contamination and inconsistent potency and availability. If approved, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ would provide an approved option for physicians to treat wet AMD. Bevacizumab-vikg/bevacizumab gamma is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively binds with high affinity to all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of the binding of VEGF to its receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Following intravitreal injection, the binding of bevacizumab-vikg to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation in the retina. About Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Outlook Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company working to achieve FDA and European Commission approval for the launch of ONS-5010/ LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg or bevacizumab gamma) as the first approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications, including wet AMD, DME and BRVO. If ONS-5010 ophthalmic bevacizumab is approved, Outlook Therapeutics expects to commercialize it as the first and only FDA and/or EC approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in treating retinal diseases in the United States, EU, United Kingdom, Europe, Japan, and other markets. As part of the Outlook Therapeutics' multi-year commercial planning process, Outlook Therapeutics and Cencora entered into a strategic commercialization agreement to expand the Outlook Therapeutics’ reach for connecting to retina specialists and their patients. Cencora will provide third-party logistics (3PL) services and distribution, as well as pharmacovigilance services and other services in the United States.

The collaboration aims to revolutionize the long-duration energy storage sector in North America, tapping into a market worth hundreds of Gigawatts. The partnership would create a vertically integrated vanadium supply chain to meet the growing demand for VRFB solutions. The agreement is driven by LCE's innovative technology and Stryten's electrolyte production capabilities, aiming to reduce costs and accelerate commercial adoption of vanadium battery technology. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The joint venture between Largo Inc. and Stryten Energy LLC to integrate supply chains for vanadium and vanadium electrolyte manufacturing is a strategic move to capitalize on the increasing demand for long-duration energy storage solutions. This collaboration aims to create a vertically integrated structure, which is particularly significant given the estimated market size for vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) long-duration energy storage (LDES) solutions in North America.From an energy market perspective, the integration of Largo's vanadium supply and Stryten's high-volume electrolyte production capabilities could lead to economies of scale and potentially reduce costs. This is essential for VRFB solutions to become more competitive with other energy storage technologies and to meet the Department of Energy's levelized cost of storage (LCOS) targets. The emphasis on U.S.-produced vanadium electrolyte also aligns with current trends towards domestic production and supply chain security.However, the realization of these potential benefits hinges on successful negotiation of definitive agreements and due diligence processes. Investors should monitor the progress of this Proposed Transaction closely as it could have significant implications for the LDES sector and the companies involved. Financial Analyst For stakeholders in Largo Inc., the Proposed Transaction with Stryten Energy LLC could represent an opportunity to unlock and maximize the value of Largo Clean Energy Corp. The mention of patented technology and access to vanadium suggests that Largo is positioning itself to be a key player in the VRFB market. The ability to produce electrolyte in large volumes at a reduced cost could give the joint venture a competitive edge, potentially leading to an increase in market share and revenue growth.Yet, it is critical for investors to remain cautious as the deal is not yet finalized and there are no guarantees regarding the completion or the realization of the anticipated benefits. The due diligence phase will be pivotal in determining the viability of the transaction and its alignment with both companies' strategic objectives. Financial performance metrics and market response post-announcement should be analyzed to gauge the potential impact on Largo's stock valuation. Supply Chain Expert The creation of a vertically integrated supply chain for vanadium and vanadium electrolyte manufacturing is a forward-thinking approach that could streamline operations and reduce dependencies on external suppliers. In the context of the global push for renewable energy and energy storage solutions, securing a reliable and cost-effective supply of raw materials is paramount.The Proposed Transaction could enhance supply chain resilience and adaptability for Largo and Stryten, which is particularly relevant in light of recent global supply chain disruptions. By controlling more stages of the supply chain, the joint venture could better manage costs, quality and delivery times, which are critical factors in the energy storage industry.However, the implementation of such a supply chain requires significant investment and coordination. The long-term success of this strategy will depend on the joint venture's ability to maintain operational efficiency and to adapt to market changes and technological advancements within the energy storage sector. 03/18/2024 - 05:05 PM New Relationship Would Establish Integrated Supply Chain for Vanadium and Vanadium Electrolyte Manufacturing; Support Growing Demand For Long-duration Energy Storage Solutions TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Largo Inc. (TSX: LGO) (NASDAQ: LGO) is pleased to announce the signing of a non-binding letter of intent with Stryten Energy LLC (“Stryten”) to establish a 50:50 joint venture that would combine the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Largo Clean Energy Corp. (“LCE”) with Stryten’s vanadium redox flow battery (“VRFB”) business (the “Proposed Transaction”). This announcement comes in concert with Enel Green Power España and LCE’s go-live of a 5.5-megawatt hour VRFB in Spain, the deployment of one of the largest utility scale vanadium system in Europe. The combination of the parties’ decades of VRFB technology expertise, access to raw vanadium supplies from friendly sources, and high-volume electrolyte production capabilities is expected to transform the long-duration energy storage (“LDES”) sector in North America. The estimated market in North America for VRFB LDES solutions is hundreds of Gigawatts in size, requiring the creation of a vertically integrated vanadium supply chain to reliably meet this demand. It is expected that this joint venture would provide access to U.S.-produced vanadium electrolyte needed for VRFB manufacturers to accelerate the commercial deployment of vanadium battery solutions. “The agreement is a direct result of our review and evaluation of strategic alternatives to unlock and fully maximize the value of LCE,” said Daniel Tellechea, Director and Interim Chief Executive Officer of Largo. “The distinctive value proposition LCE presents for vanadium batteries and the long-duration energy storage sector, including its patented vanadium flow battery stack technology, electrolyte purification technology and access to vanadium through Largo Physical Vanadium Corp. (TSX.V:VAND, OTCQX:VANAF), were key determining factors in advancing our discussions with Stryten. Additionally, Stryten’s ability to produce electrolyte in large volumes will help reduce the overall cost for VRFB solutions, a critical factor in catalyzing the commercial adoption of the technology and meeting the DOE LCOS targets.” The Proposed Transaction remains subject to, among other conditions, negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by both parties and receipt of any required Board and regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that the Proposed Transaction will be completed, nor can there be any assurance, if the Proposed Transaction is completed, that the potential benefits of the Proposed Transaction will be realized.

Negative Decrease in revenues and units shipped in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Net loss attributable to Zepp Health in Q4 2023. Lower sales of Xiaomi wearable products impacting revenue. Decrease in research and development, selling, and marketing expenses may affect future innovation and growth. Operating expenses decreased in Q4 2023, potentially impacting long-term competitiveness. Financial Analyst The reported financials by Zepp Health Corporation indicate a mixed performance, with a significant decline in revenue and units shipped, particularly of Xiaomi wearable products, which may raise concerns among investors about the company's market position and future growth prospects. The increase in gross margin and the company's strategic focus on profitability over scale could be seen as a positive shift towards sustainable growth, but it's essential to consider whether this strategy could limit market share expansion in the competitive wearable technology sector. The company's cost management and operating efficiencies, as evidenced by reduced operating expenses and inventory levels, reflect a disciplined approach to cash flow management. However, the net losses reported, both GAAP and non-GAAP, suggest that despite these efforts, the company is still facing challenges in achieving bottom-line profitability. The stock repurchase program continuation signals confidence by the management in the company's valuation, which could be a positive sign for investors. The outlook for Q1 2024 shows a conservative revenue projection, which might be a reflection of ongoing market challenges or strategic shifts in the business model. Overall, the financial results and management's strategic decisions should be closely monitored by investors for indications of long-term financial health and market competitiveness. Market Research Analyst Zepp Health Corporation's reported decrease in revenue and units shipped, particularly in Xiaomi wearable products, suggests a significant shift in the company's market dynamics. The strategic pivot towards profitability over scale, while beneficial for improving margins, could impact the company's ability to compete in the rapidly growing wearable technology market, where scale often correlates with market penetration and consumer mindshare. The introduction of new products like the Amazfit Active series and the Amazfit Helio Ring, along with software innovations such as Zepp OS version 3.5, demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and user experience enhancement. These developments could potentially improve brand perception and customer loyalty, which are critical in a market driven by technological advancements and brand differentiation. However, the success of these new products in contributing to revenue growth remains to be seen. The company's focus on operating cost management and inventory efficiency is commendable, but it's important to balance cost-cutting measures with investments in R&D and marketing to sustain long-term growth and market relevance. The cautious revenue outlook for Q1 2024 could be indicative of conservative growth expectations or an uncertain market environment, which investors should consider when assessing the company's future performance. Economist Zepp Health Corporation's financial report reflects broader economic trends, such as foreign exchange fluctuations and the strategic challenges of balancing profitability with market expansion. The company's substantial decrease in revenue and units shipped, while improving gross margins, indicates a strategic reorientation that may be responsive to current economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. The focus on profitability over scale can be seen as a defensive strategy in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, where consumer spending may be more volatile and cost control becomes paramount. The company's ability to maintain a strong cash position and reduce debt levels is a positive indicator of financial stability, which is particularly important in periods of economic uncertainty. The record low inventory levels and continued share repurchases could be interpreted as a sign of prudent capital management, yet it's essential to ensure that these measures do not undermine the company's capacity for innovation and market responsiveness. The conservative revenue outlook for the upcoming quarter may reflect cautious optimism or strategic recalibration in response to market conditions, which could be influenced by factors such as global economic slowdown, trade tensions and shifts in consumer preferences. Investors should consider the potential impact of these macroeconomic factors on the company's performance and the wearable technology industry as a whole. 03/18/2024 - 05:00 PM MILPITAS, Calif., March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Zepp Health Corporation (""Zepp"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ZEPP) today reported revenues of US$84.5 million (RMB0.6 billion); a basic and diluted net loss per share of US$0.005 (RMB0.03); and a basic and diluted net loss per ADS of US$0.02 (RMB0.14) for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023; adjusted basic and diluted net income per share of US$0.002 (RMB0.01); and adjusted basic and diluted net income per ADS of US$0.01 (RMB0.06). Each ADS represents four Class A ordinary shares. Mr. Wang 'Wayne' Huang, Chairman and CEO of Zepp, commented, ""In the fourth quarter, we continued to make substantial progress in our strategic transformation, a journey characterized by both achievements and challenges. Our approach to balancing profitability with scale has yielded promising results, achieving a second consecutive quarter of profitability and reaching an all-time high in gross margin. These accomplishments demonstrated the strength of our product capability, along with the success of our branding and go-to-market strategy. As we conclude 2023, these accomplishments not only underscore our resilience and adaptability but also set a solid foundation for sustained growth and innovation in the years ahead."" Wayne continued, ""This quarter was also pivotal for us as we expanded and enhanced our product portfolio with significant launches that have notably elevated our market presence. Introducing the Amazfit Active and Amazfit Active Edge series represents a leap forward in our mission to blend sophisticated design with cutting-edge technology. The subsequent launch of our first smart ring, the Amazfit Helio Ring, at CES further underlines our dedication to providing advanced and accessible solutions that enhance well-being. These developments epitomize our commitment to delivering cutting-edge smart wearable healthcare solutions that go beyond meeting basic needs – they aim to inspire and bring joy to our users. Our efforts extend past hardware to include continuous advancements in the software, highlighted by the recent launch of Zepp OS version 3.5. This update integrates Zepp Flow™, a Natural-Language User Interface (LUI) powered by LLM AI, with our operating system, offering seamless natural language communication to provide users with exactly what they want. From setting an alarm, deactivating the 'always on' display feature to providing feedback on last night's sleep quality and analyzing the readiness score from the previous day's activities, and offering recommendations for improvement in the following day, all can be done by interacting with the watch using human natural language and without the need to memorize any predefined commands. These updates are pivotal in enhancing user interaction and underline our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in wearable technology."" Mr. Leon Deng, Zepp's Chief Financial Officer, added, ""Our financial performance in the fourth quarter closely aligned with our guidance, with sales revenue coming in at the lower end of our expectations. This was influenced by several external factors, including our strategic focus on profitability over scale and foreign exchange fluctuation. Despite these challenges, we achieved another record high gross margin, supported by the strong performance of our self-branded products and a favourable product mix. Meticulously managing our operating costs, we have maintained our disciplined approach to spending while continuing to invest in R&D and marketing to sustain our long-term competitiveness. In the fourth quarter, the Company recorded US$3.5 million valuation allowance of deferred tax asset, which is non-cash in nature and does not materially affect our operations. Although GAAP net loss was US$1.2 million with the Non-GAAP net profit of US$0.5 million, the adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter of 2023 was US$4.0 million, while it was a loss of around US$7.4 million in the same period of 2022. We have managed our working capital efficiently, achieving a record low inventory level and further reducing our debt levels. Our cash balance remains at US$140.5 million, and we will continue to buy back stock under our share repurchase plan. As we reflect on the full year of 2023 and look ahead to 2024, these achievements highlight our commitment to operational excellence and strategic foresight while seizing future opportunities and driving further innovation in the wearable technology sector.""

Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Revenues Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 reached US$84.5 million (RMB0.6 billion), a decrease by 44.0% from the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the sales of Xiaomi wearable products. Total units shipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by 53.3% year-over-year to 2.1 million, compared with 4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the decrease in the units of Xiaomi wearable products shipped. Gross Margin Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 34.7%, compared to 20.7% in the same period of 2022. We reached another record-high quarterly gross margin since the third quarter of 2023, supported by the strong performance of our self-branded products and a more favourable product mix. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were US$11.3 million (RMB80.0 million), a decrease by 30.0% year-over-year. This accounted for 13.3% of revenues, compared to 10.7% for the same period in 2022. The decrease was as a result of our refined research and development approaches, as we consistently evaluated resource efficiency to ensure maximum return on investment and productivity. We are committed to investing in new technologies and AI to maintain our competitive edge against our peers. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were US$12.2 million (RMB86.5 million), a decrease by 30.9% year-over-year. This accounted for 14.4% of revenues, compared to 11.7% for the same period in 2022. The decrease was mainly due to our ongoing efforts to enhance retail profitability and optimize our mix of sales channels. This included detailed enhancements to our retail channels and strategic staff allocations across our sales territories. We are dedicated to making informed investments in marketing and branding to guarantee our continued development. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were US$5.1 million (RMB36.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease by 31.6% year-over-year. This accounted for 6.1% of revenues, compared with 5.0% in the same period in 2022. The decrease in absolute value was largely attributable to our personnel optimization efforts and strict administrative expense control. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were US$28.6 million (RMB203.0 million), a decrease by 30.7% year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation, were US$26.9 million (RMB190.9 million). We plan to continue our focus on cost efficiency in the forthcoming quarters.

Operating Income/(Loss) Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was US$0.8 million (RMB5.3 million), compared with operating loss of RMB71.0 million for the same period in 2022. The turnaround in operating profit was largely due to the improved gross margin of our self-branded products and reduced operating expenses.

We generated positive cash flow from our operating activities for the sixth consecutive quarter. We also successfully reduced our total debt, including short-term and long-term bank borrowing balance by US$11.9 million (RMB84.3 million) in the fourth quarter (RMB96.2, RMB34.3 and RMB117.3 from first quarter to third quarter 2023, respectively), and we anticipate further reductions in our debt level in the upcoming quarters. The Company continued to manage its working capital and inventory efficiently and recorded inventory levels of US$84.9 million (RMB602.7 million) as of December 31, 2023, compared to RMB787.0 million as of September 30, 2023 and RMB1,021.9 million as of December 31, 2022. Share Repurchase Program Update The Company announced in its third quarter 2021 earnings release that the board had authorized a share repurchase program of up to US$20 million through November 2022. On November 21, 2022, the board authorized a 12-month extension of the Company's share repurchase program. On November 20, 2023, the board further authorized the Company to extend its share repurchase program for another 12 months. Pursuant to the extended share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase its shares in the form of American depositary shares and/or ordinary shares through November 2024 with an aggregate value equal to the remaining balance under the share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had used US$12.9 million to repurchase 5,051,736 ADSs. The Company expects to fund the repurchases under the extended share repurchase program out of its existing cash balance. Full Year 2023 Revenues Total revenues of 2023 reached US$351.5 million (RMB2.5 billion), a decrease of 39.8% from the full year of 2022. The decrease in total revenues mainly resulted from a 62.0% decline in the sales of Xiaomi wearable products. In 2023, self-branded products accounted for 74.2% of our total revenues, compared with 59.0% in 2022. Sales of our self-brand product decreased by 24.3% as compared with 2022. This was mainly caused by our strategic shift of focusing on profitability over scale. Total units shipped in the full year of 2023 decreased by 40.4% year-over-year to 12.1 million, compared with 20.3 million in the full year of 2022. This was mainly caused by a 43.6% decrease in the shipment of Xiaomi wearable products. Gross Margin Gross margin in the full year 2023 was 26.4%, 7.0 percentage points higher than 19.4% in the full year of 2022. The full year's higher margin was due to the improved gross margin of our self-branded products and largely driven by a better product mix especially on our new products introductions, partially offset by the decrease in the gross margin of Xiaomi branded products. Research and Development Research and development expenses for the full year 2023 were US$51.0 million (RMB361.8 million), a decrease of 30.0% year-over-year. The decrease was as a result of our refined research and development approaches, as we consistently evaluated resource efficiency to ensure maximum return on investment and productivity. Selling and Development Selling and marketing expenses for the full year 2023 were US$44.3 million (RMB314.6 million), a decrease of 31.7% year-over-year. This accounted for 12.6% of revenues, compared with 11.1% for the same period in 2022. The reduction in amount was mainly due to our ongoing efforts to enhance retail profitability and optimize our mix of sales channels. This included detailed enhancements to our retail channels and strategic staff allocations across our sales territories. We are dedicated to making informed investments in marketing and branding to guarantee our continued development. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were US$26.6 million (RMB188.5 million) in the full year 2023, a decrease of 20.1% year-over-year. The decrease was largely attributable to strict administrative expense control. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses for the full year 2023 were US$121.8 million (RMB864.9 million), a decrease of 28.7% year-over-year. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expenses, were US$113.4 million (RMB805.2 million). We plan to continue our focus on cost efficiency in the upcoming year. At the same time, we are dedicated to invest in R&D and marketing efforts, which are essential for maintaining our competitive edge over the long term. Net Income/(Loss) Net loss attributable to Zepp Health Corporation for the full year of 2023 was US$29.9 million (RMB212.1 million), compared with RMB288.3 million in net loss in 2022. The adjusted net loss attributable to Zepp Health Corporation, which excludes share-based compensation expenses attributable to Zepp Health Corporation, was US$21.5 million (RMB152.4 million), compared with the adjusted net loss of RMB239.2 million for the same period of 2022. The narrowed net loss was largely due to the higher gross margin from our self-branded products and reduced operating expenses. The adjusted EBIT for the full year of 2023 was loss of US$20.1 million (RMB142.9 million), compared with loss of RMB261.1 million in 2022. In the full year of 2023, the Company recorded US$4.1 million (RMB29.1 million) valuation allowance of deferred tax asset compared to RMB35.2 million in 2022, which is non-cash in nature and does not materially affect our operations. Outlook For the first quarter of 2024, the Company's management currently expects net revenues to be between US$42 million (RMB300 million) and US$49 million (RMB350 million), compared with RMB645 million in the first quarter of 2023. This outlook is based on current market conditions and reflects the Company's current and preliminary estimates of market, operating conditions and customer demand, which are all subject to change.

Use of Non-GAAP Measures We use adjusted net income/(loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Adjusted operating expenses represent operating expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted operating income/(loss) represents operating income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses. Adjusted EBIT represents net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, income tax (benefit)/expense, interest income and interest expense. Adjusted net income/(loss) represents net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expenses, and such adjustment has no impact on income tax. Adjusted net income/(loss) attributable to Zepp Health Corporation is a non-GAAP measure, which excludes share-based compensation expenses attributable to Zepp Health Corporation, and is used as the numerator in computation of adjusted net income/(loss) per share and per ADS attributable to Zepp Health Corporation. We believe that adjusted net income/(loss), adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income/(loss) attributable to Zepp Health Corporation help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net income/(loss) and net income/(loss) attributable to Zepp Health Corporation. We believe that adjusted net income/(loss), adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income/(loss) attributable to Zepp Health Corporation provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allows for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted net income/(loss), adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income/(loss) attributable to Zepp Health Corporation, should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income/(loss), basic and diluted net income/(loss) per share and per ADS attributable to Zepp Health Corporation or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Adjusted net income/(loss), adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders, presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Exchange Rate The Company's business is primarily conducted in China.

The research surveyed over 2,000 professionals in Australia. Positive None. Negative None. 03/18/2024 - 05:00 PM Top challenge for workers is lack of clarity in roles, responsibilities, and task ownership – leading to poor collaboration Fifty-five percent of workers say their organisation’s leaders don’t do enough to help employees reduce digital exhaustion While two-thirds of leaders say that generative AI will have a very positive impact on work SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Asana, Inc. (NYSE: ASAN) (LTSE: ASAN), a leading work management platform for organisations, today released its State of Work Innovation: Australia 2024 Report, an in-depth analysis around the evolution and future of work in Australia. The research conducted by Asana’s Work Innovation Lab surveyed the behaviours and attitudes of more than 2,000 professionals in Australia, finding that today’s workers struggle with high workload, lack of clarity, and digital exhaustion. Meanwhile, executives are optimistic about the impact of AI when it comes to improving the state of work. Workers Struggle with Digital Exhaustion and Work Overload Over half (52%) of workers feel their workload is so unmanageable that they’ve needed to take a day off at least once a month, and 55% say their organisation’s leaders don’t do enough to help employees reduce digital exhaustion. Professionals almost universally agreed (95%) that organisations need to do a better job innovating how employees communicate and collaborate, revealing the opportunity for organisations to look to work management platforms to increase efficiency and improve cross-functional collaboration. “Professionals across Australia struggle with increasing workloads and a lack of effective tools and processes to thrive in an environment where hybrid and asynchronous work is the gold standard. At the same time, business leaders are challenged to improve productivity while continuing to innovate with transformative technologies like AI,” says Jo Gaines, General Manager, APAC, at Asana. “Organisations don’t need more tools – they need the right tools that are the connective glue which helps teams get clarity around priorities, show impact against company goals, and scale AI to improve business outcomes.” Teams Experience Too Many Meetings, Not the Right Tools Australian workers also feel friction in their daily tasks. Almost half (46%) say they dread meetings at work, with a ‘lack of clear purpose’ being the most cited reason for ineffective meetings. The number one challenge when collaborating was a lack of clarity in roles, responsibilities, or task ownership. And with prevalent tool overload, more than two in three (68%) of those surveyed said they prefer everyone in their organisation to use the same collaboration technologies at work in order to increase efficiency. Executives Realise Opportunity for AI to Drive Business Outcomes Executives are excited about the power of AI to navigate business challenges. Sixty-three percent of Australian leaders said they are enthusiastic about generative AI in day-to-day work, with 66% agreeing it will have a positive or very positive impact at work. However, business leaders need to ensure that AI use guidelines and policies are clearly communicated across organisations. Half of leaders report having an AI policy at their organisation, but only 17% of workers are aware of it. Seventy percent of leaders say their organisation has allocated a budget for AI training and development, but only 30% of workers are aware of this. “As organisations rapidly adopt AI, it’s more critical than ever that leaders define clear guidelines around how it can – and should – be used in the workplace, says Gaines. “With so many Australian workers struggling with work overload and digital exhaustion, there is infinite potential to use AI to maximise resources, increase efficiency, and improve cross-functional collaboration. I’m excited as we continue to improve our AI capabilities to help more organisations across Australia work smarter.” Discover the Power of Humans and AI at Work Learn more about the state of work in Australia at Asana’s Work Innovation Summit in Sydney, and Asana’s latest product innovations here.

(WT) extends its stockholder rights plan to safeguard stockholders' interests against potential takeover attempts. The plan ensures fair treatment and long-term value realization for investors. Key provisions include automatic expiration after the 2024 Annual Meeting, rights exercisable upon acquisition of 10% or 20% of common stock, and protections against limiting future board actions. The plan aims to prevent a single stockholder or group from gaining control without paying a premium. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The extension of a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a 'poison pill', is a significant defensive tactic used by companies to deter hostile takeovers. By allowing existing shareholders the option to purchase additional shares at a discount upon a triggering event, such as an entity acquiring a significant stake, the plan dilutes the potential acquirer's holdings, making a takeover more expensive and difficult. This strategy can influence the company's stock price and market perception, as it signals the board's intention to maintain control and could potentially discourage investment by those looking to acquire a controlling stake.From a financial perspective, the rights plan could be seen as a double-edged sword. While it protects current shareholders' interests by preventing undervalued buyouts, it can also be viewed as a deterrent for potential investors or acquirers who might offer a premium for control. This could lead to a stagnation in stock price or even a decrease if the market perceives the move as the company being less open to acquisition opportunities that could have otherwise benefited shareholders. The plan's impact on the company's valuation and market liquidity should be closely monitored by investors. Corporate Governance Expert The unanimous decision by WisdomTree's Board to extend the rights plan is a clear indication of their dedication to corporate governance and the protection of shareholder interests against what they perceive as opportunistic takeover attempts. However, this move also raises questions about the balance between defensive strategies and shareholder rights. While the plan is designed to prevent shareholders from being sidelined in the event of a takeover, it also grants the board substantial power to influence the outcome of such attempts.The inclusion of a qualifying offer clause that allows shareholders to call a special meeting is a nod to shareholder empowerment, providing a mechanism for them to override the rights plan under specific circumstances. This feature could be seen as a compromise between board authority and shareholder democracy. Investors should consider how this balance affects their rights and the potential for future corporate actions that could impact their investments. Market Research Analyst The extension of WisdomTree's rights plan occurs within the broader context of market trends where shareholder activism and takeover attempts are increasingly common. In this environment, a rights plan can be a signal to the market about the company's stance on potential takeovers. It's essential to analyze how similar companies have been affected by the implementation or extension of such plans, as this can provide insights into possible investor reactions and stock performance.Market participants typically scrutinize such corporate actions for implications on company strategy and growth prospects. If the rights plan is perceived as protective rather than restrictive, it may bolster investor confidence in the board's commitment to enhancing long-term value. Conversely, if the market views the plan as a hindrance to potential value-creating opportunities, it may lead to a less favorable perception of the company's growth trajectory. Thus, the reaction of the stock market to this announcement will be an important indicator of investor sentiment towards WisdomTree's strategic direction. 03/18/2024 - 04:50 PM Stockholders to Vote on Extension of Rights Plan at 2024 Annual Meeting NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WisdomTree, Inc. (NYSE: WT) (“WisdomTree” or the “Company”), a global financial innovator, today announced that its Board of Directors (the “Board”) unanimously voted to extend its existing limited duration stockholder rights plan, as amended (the “rights plan”). The rights plan was overwhelmingly approved by the Company’s stockholders at its 2023 Annual Meeting, and the extension of the rights plan reflects the Board’s continued commitment to safeguard the interests of all stockholders in the face of activism concerns, as described in the Board’s response to the most recent demands of WisdomTree stockholder ETFS Capital Limited, and potential opportunistic attempts by a single stockholder or group of stockholders to obtain control of the Company without paying a control premium. The rights plan is designed to ensure that stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in any proposed takeover of the Company and to enable them to realize the long-term value of their investment in WisdomTree. The rights plan provides several recognized stockholder protections, including the following: The rights plan, as amended, will automatically expire on the day after the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (“2024 Annual Meeting”), unless approved by stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting, in which case it will expire in one year, on March 17, 2025; The rights will be exercisable only if any person (or any persons acting as a group) acquires 10% (or 20% in the case of a passive stockholder, i.e., a stockholder that is entitled to file, and files, or has filed with the SEC, a statement on Schedule 13G) or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock; The rights plan has an exception for offers made for all shares of the Company that treat all stockholders equally, including a qualifying offer clause that provides stockholders the ability to call a special meeting for purposes of exempting a “qualifying offer”; The rights plan does not contain any dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar features that would limit the ability of a future board of directors to redeem the rights; and The rights plan does not preclude the Board from considering an offer that recognizes the full value of the Company. Additional Information on Stockholder Rights Plan Initially, the rights are not exercisable and trade with the shares of WisdomTree common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. The rights generally will become exercisable if a person or group becomes an “acquiring person” by acquiring 10% (or 20% in the case of passive stockholders) or more of the common stock of WisdomTree (which includes stock subject to a derivative transaction or an acquired derivative security) or if a person or group commences a tender offer that could result in that person or group becoming an “acquiring person.” If a person or group becomes an “acquiring person,” each holder of a right (other than the acquiring person) would be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, such number of shares of common stock (or, subject to the terms of the rights plan, shares of preferred stock that are equivalent to shares of WisdomTree common stock) having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. If WisdomTree is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company’s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. A person or group who beneficially owned 10% or more (or 20% or more in the case of passive stockholders) of WisdomTree’s outstanding common stock prior to the first public announcement by WisdomTree of the adoption of the rights plan on March 17, 2023 will not trigger the rights plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of any additional shares of common stock at a time when they still beneficially own 10% or more (or 20% or more in the case of passive stockholders) of such common stock, subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the rights plan. The rights plan, as amended, will expire on the day after the 2024 Annual Meeting, unless approved by stockholders at the 2024 Annual Meeting, in which case it will expire in one year, on March 17, 2025. The date of the 2024 Annual Meeting has not yet been announced. The rights plan contains a qualifying offer clause that provides stockholders the ability to call a special meeting for purposes of exempting a “qualifying offer.” Further details about the rights plan are contained in Current Reports on Form 8-K and in a Registration Statement on Form 8-A and amendments thereto that WisdomTree has filed or will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

CubeSmart Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend,2024-03-18T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"CubeSmart (CUBE) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per common share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 1, 2024.","CubeSmart Declares First Quarter 2024 Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary CubeSmart (CUBE) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per common share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 1, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by CubeSmart represents a tangible return to shareholders and is a key indicator of the company's financial health and its management's confidence in ongoing profitability. A dividend of $0.51 per common share is significant, as it suggests a stable cash flow and the ability to reward investors. Shareholders often view consistent or increasing dividends as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the stock's demand.It is important to analyze this dividend in the context of CubeSmart's historical payout ratios and industry standards. If the payout ratio—dividends as a percentage of net income—is sustainable, it implies prudent financial management. However, if the ratio is too high, it could suggest that the company is prioritizing dividends over reinvestment in growth, which might be concerning for the long-term value creation. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CubeSmart's dividend announcement can influence market perception and stock performance. The self-storage industry, where CubeSmart operates, is often seen as recession-resistant due to the constant demand for storage space, regardless of economic cycles. This perception can make CubeSmart and similar stocks attractive to income-focused investors, especially in volatile or bear markets.Investors should consider the yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price. A competitive yield can make CubeSmart an appealing investment compared to other stocks in the sector or fixed income alternatives. Nevertheless, investors should also be mindful of the total return, which includes both dividend income and capital gains, as a comprehensive measure of investment performance. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM MALVERN, Pa., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CubeSmart (NYSE: CUBE) announced today that its Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per common share for the period ending March 31, 2024. The dividend is payable on April 15, 2024 to common shareholders of record on April 1, 2024. About the Company CubeSmart is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust.

Negative Restatement of Prior Financial Statements due to inventory errors estimated between $7 million and $12 million. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM CHERRY HILL, N.J., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Real Good Food Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: RGF) (“Real Good Foods” or the “Company”), a leading health and wellness frozen and refrigerated foods company, today provided a corporate update concurrent with the appointment of foods executive Tim Zimmer as Chief Executive Officer, effective March 15, 2024. Leadership Changes The Company today announced the appointment of Tim Zimmer as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer effective March 15, 2024. Mr. Zimmer succeeds Gerard Law, who departed the Company as its Chief Executive Officer, effective March 15, 2024. Tim Zimmer was most recently the Chief Marketing Officer at Smithfield Foods and held prior roles that included responsibilities across business management, demand planning, R&D and operation process design. Tim has over 30 years of experience in the packaged foods industry at Smithfield Foods, Sara Lee Foods, Kraft Foods and Nestle. While at Smithfield, Tim played a pivotal role in growing the company’s packaged meats business and significantly improving its profitability. Prior to his tenure at Smithfield, Tim was a leader in the turnaround efforts at Sara Lee Fresh Bakery, transforming it into a profitable business before its eventual sale to Grupo Bimbo. Tim has served in management roles in finance, business management, sales, and marketing over his career in multiple channels and temperature zones. Tim holds a B.B.A. in Marketing & Finance from the University of Texas at Arlington and an M.B.A. in Strategy & Finance from the Wake Forest University School of Business. The Company also appointed Mark Dietz as Senior Vice President of Operations, who will assist the Company with streamlining of the Company’s supply chain and improving efficiencies. Mark brings extensive experience in operational leadership, having previously served as VP of Business Management at Smithfield Foods and holding management roles within Sara Lee Meat Brands. While at Smithfield, Mark had full P&L responsibilities for the Curly’s and Stefano’s brands, which represented well over $600 million in retail sales. Under Mark’s leadership, the Curly’s brand was introduced into the retail channel and grew to over $150 million in retail sales and turned profitable. Mark also oversaw the plant consolidation and turnaround of the Stefano’s brand, which was handheld business that is similar from a manufacturing standpoint to RGF’s operations. In his new role, Mark will spearhead initiatives to optimize supply chain and enhance plant efficiencies. Mark holds a B.B.A. in Finance from The University of Cincinnati, Lindner School of Business. Strategic Actions to Optimize Supply Chain In an effort to accelerate the optimizing of its supply chain, the Company plans to cease operations at its City of Industry (“COI”) facility by June 30, 2024. While ongoing analysis of the closure's overall impact is underway, preliminary assessments indicate substantial cost savings with negligible cash outlays. With a significant portion of COI's production set to transition to the Bolingbrook, IL facility, alongside co-packing arrangements and rationalization measures, this decision is expected to improve capacity utilization, reduced fixed overhead costs, enhance margins, and streamline the supply chain. Business Updates According to SPINS and IRI, for the two months ended February 29, 2024, total consumption of the Company’s branded products increased by 53% year over year. This included a 23% increase in the unmeasured channel and 96% increase in the measured channel. In the measured channel, according to SPINS, consumption for the RGF brand for the two months ended 2/28/24 was $26M or up 96% y/y. For the latest four week ended 2/28/24 consumption was $12.5M or up 102% y/y.In the unmeasured channel, according to IRI, consumption for the RGF brand for the two month ended 2/28/24 was $23.7M or up 23% y/y. The previously disclosed refinancing in March 2024 reduced the Company’s revolver balance to $25 million and reduced the maximum availability under revolver to $35 million, implying $10 million in liquidity at the time of the refinancing. The refinancing in November 2023 and March 2024 combined have significantly reduced the company’s cash debt service and enhanced liquidity. Cash debt service is currently at $1.0 million a month.The aforementioned organizational changes, streamlining of supply chain and yield improvement initiatives are expected to significantly accelerate the Company’s path to generating free cash flow and self-funding its growth. Management Commentary Executive Chairman Bryan Freeman commented: “We are pleased to announce the appointment of Tim Zimmer as Chief Executive Officer, as his experience aligns with the slate of strategic actions we announced today. These are aimed at significantly accelerating the path to profitability and are a testament to our commitment to fellow shareholders. “Our growth remains strong, with total consumption of our branded products increasing 53% year-over-year in the two months ended February 29, 2024. On the liquidity front, after taking into account our latest refinancing, the Company has significantly reduced its cash debt service. Ultimately, we expect these changes will enable us to generate free cash flow and self-fund our future growth.” Tim Zimmer concluded: “In assuming the role of CEO, I am fully committed to leading the Company through the transformative journey that lies ahead. The brand continues to perform well and has a strong, rapidly growing consumer base. I see a clear opportunity to unlock significant value by streamlining the supply chain, improving manufacturing efficiencies and instilling a culture of operational excellence. Together, we plan to earn back our right to grow by proving that we can operate with excellence and generate cash flow.” Restatement of Prior Financial Statements During the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified certain errors related to differences between the 2022 year-end physical inventory listing and the inventory recorded as of December 31, 2022. The Company is currently in the process of assessing the magnitude of the errors, but currently estimates the reduction to the inventory balance as between $7 million and $12 million. The Company will file an amended Form 10-K for 2022 and amended Form 10-Qs for each of the quarters in 2023, as soon as practicable, to restate the financial statements for such periods. Accordingly, investors should no longer rely upon the Company’s previously issued consolidated financial statements and earnings releases for the aforementioned periods. For more information, see the Company’s current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 18, 2024. About Real Good Food Company Real Good Foods, Inc.

Several major financial institutions acted as managers for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst VICI Properties Inc.'s completion of a substantial public offering of senior unsecured notes is a significant financial maneuver. The company's strategic refinance of existing debt, particularly the exchange of notes due in 2024 with higher interest rates for longer-term notes due in 2034 and 2054, indicates a proactive approach to capital management. The choice to lock in interest rates for a longer period could suggest anticipation of a rising interest rate environment. However, investors should note that the new notes have been issued at a discount to par value, which could imply an immediate book loss for the company. The involvement of a broad syndicate of investment banks as book-runners and co-managers reflects the offering's complexity and the need for wide distribution.Analyzing the interest rates of 5.750% for the 2034 Notes and 6.125% for the 2054 Notes against the backdrop of the current yield curve provides insight into investor sentiment regarding credit risk and the time value of money. The higher interest rate on the longer-dated notes suggests a normal upward-sloping yield curve, but it also increases the long-term interest burden on the company. Investors should evaluate the company's cash flow projections to ensure that the increased interest expense can be managed without affecting operational efficiency. Debt Market Analyst The issuance of senior unsecured notes by VICI Properties L.P. reflects a broader trend in the corporate bond market where firms are opportunistically tapping capital markets for refinancing to extend debt maturities and reduce refinancing risk. The decision to repay existing debt due in the near term with proceeds from the new offering is a common debt management strategy. This move may be well-received by the market as it alleviates short-term liquidity concerns and demonstrates prudent financial planning.From a credit perspective, the 'senior unsecured' designation of the notes is crucial. It indicates that these debt instruments rank higher in claim priority compared to subordinated debt in the event of a liquidation, but they are not backed by specific assets as collateral. This could affect the recovery rate for investors in a default scenario. The credit rating of the notes, not specified in the article, would be a key determinant of investor appetite and the success of the offering. A strong rating would imply confidence in the company's ability to meet its debt obligations, potentially leading to a tighter credit spread and lower yield demanded by investors. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst As a REIT, VICI Properties' operations involve managing a portfolio of real estate properties, often with a focus on gaming, hospitality and entertainment assets. The refinancing activity could be indicative of the management's confidence in stable long-term cash flows from its properties, which is essential for covering the coupon payments of the newly issued notes. The offering's success could be partially attributed to the unique nature of REITs, where investors often seek stable income through dividends and companies require consistent access to capital for property acquisitions and development.Investors should consider the REIT's sector-specific risks, such as sensitivity to economic downturns, which could impact occupancy rates and rental income. The long-term nature of the issued notes may provide a buffer against short-term market fluctuations, but it also exposes the company to potential changes in real estate market conditions over the next several decades. The health of the commercial real estate market, interest rates and regulatory changes affecting REITs should be monitored closely as they could significantly impact VICI Properties' financial performance and ability to service its debt. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VICI Properties Inc.

Despite a reduction in total revenue and railcar deliveries year-over-year, the substantial improvement in gross margin from 7.1% to 11.7% suggests that the company is successfully navigating market challenges and enhancing its pricing power or reducing production costs.However, the net loss of ($23.6) million, although improved from last year, raises concerns about the company's ability to translate higher margins into bottom-line profitability. The adjusted EBITDA growth is promising, but the reported non-cash items such as the loss on extinguishment of debt and impairment on leased railcars may obscure the true operational performance of the company. Investors should monitor how these factors could affect future cash flows and the company's financial stability.Lastly, the guidance for 2024, including revenue and delivery projections, will be critical for investors to assess the company's growth trajectory and the effectiveness of its new manufacturing campus in meeting market demand. Financial Analyst FreightCar America's financial results reveal a complex picture. The increase in gross profit is commendable and reflects a stronger command over cost structures, which is key in the capital-intensive manufacturing sector. However, the slight decrease in revenues and the reduction in deliveries highlight potential demand-side issues or production constraints that need to be addressed.Investors should consider the loss on extinguishment of debt as a significant one-time expense that may not recur in the future, potentially improving net income. At the same time, the impairment on leased railcars could suggest a reevaluation of the asset's value, which could have long-term implications for asset turnover and operational leasing strategies.The change in fair market value of warrant liability is a non-operational financial adjustment that investors should separate from core business performance when evaluating the company's results. The transition in leadership with Nick Randall taking over as CEO may introduce new strategic directions, which could impact the company's performance and should be monitored closely. Economist The external factors affecting FreightCar America, such as the US-Mexico border closure and foreign exchange headwinds, are indicative of the broader economic challenges that businesses face in the global market. These factors can lead to supply chain disruptions and cost fluctuations that directly impact the company's operational efficiency and profitability. The company's ability to absorb these impacts and still improve margins is a positive indicator of resilience.Looking ahead, the expansion of the company's manufacturing capabilities could position it well to capitalize on any uptick in demand for railcars. However, the increase in capacity also comes with the risk of underutilization if the market does not grow as anticipated. Investors should balance the potential benefits of increased capacity with the risks associated with fixed cost investments in a volatile economic environment. 03/18/2024 - 04:15 PM Company delivers solid results with Gross Profit up 62% on significant year-over-year margin expansion Provides revenue, deliveries and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 CHICAGO, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FreightCar America, Inc.

Our team continues to remove cost and create efficiencies, which played heavily in our more than doubling Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 on similar volume as compared to the prior year. We did this while simultaneously completing the buildout of our state-of-the-art manufacturing campus which doubles our capacity from one year ago levels. Furthermore, we absorbed the impacts of the US-Mexico border closure in December which lowered fourth quarter deliveries and foreign exchange headwinds, which together decreased results by about $5 million. For the year, we achieved $20.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA on just 3,022 total deliveries, in a footprint now capable of producing 5,000 or more railcars per year.” Meyer concluded, “As we scale-up, we are well positioned to gain meaningful new efficiencies on more railcars in total. Although uncertainties exist around future border disruptions as well as the overall strength of the market at present, we are confident in our ability to drive additional meaningful top and bottom-line growth in 2024.” Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook The Company’s outlook for fiscal year 2024 is as follows: Fiscal 2024OutlookYear-over-YearGrowth at MidpointRevenue$520 - $572 million52.5%Adjusted EBITDA$32 - $38 million74.1%Railcar Deliveries4,000 – 4,400 Railcars39.0% Mike Riordan, Chief Financial Officer of FreightCar America, commented, “During the quarter, we continued to experience headwinds related to foreign exchange and rail service disruptions due to the border closure, which pressured our margins by limiting shipments and impacting our costs. The team’s ability to expand Adjusted EBITDA on a per car basis despite these industry challenges underscores the value proposition of our transformation strategy as we achieved Adjusted EBITDA of $6,658 per car in the year versus $2,642 in the prior year. In addition, we are issuing our 2024 revenue guidance at $520 million - $572 million. We expect railcar deliveries to be between 4,000 and 4,400, with Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $32 million - $38 million.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Conference Call & Webcast Information The Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Tuesday, March 19, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results.

EBITDA $6,491 $1,244 $20,120 $8,411 EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. In addition, our management uses EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance. The calculation of EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall performance of the company’s business. EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, when analyzing our operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities or other statements of operations or statements of cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similar titled measures reported by other companies.Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before the following charges: This adjustment removes the non-cash (income) expense associated with the change in fair market value of the Company’s warrant liability.During the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge on its leased railcar fleet.During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment of its term loan.The Company amortized deferred grant income to cost of goods sold in 2022 that represents a non-cash reduction to its gross margin (loss).The Company transitioned to tolling manufacturing structure in the third quarter of 2022 and as a result incurred permanent VAT costs.The Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement loss in the third quarter of 2023 and 2022.The Company incurred certain costs during 2022 for nonrecurring professional services associated with its financing arrangements.The Company incurred certain costs during 2022 related to new production lines.The Company incurred certain non-recurring consulting costs during 2022.The Company incurred certain non-recurring corporate realignment costs in 2022.The Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax gain related to sales of its leased railcar fleet in the second quarter of 2023. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters.

The company remains on track to share interim clinical data in Q4 2024. Neurogene's NGN-401 gene therapy shows promise in treating Rett syndrome, with positive safety outcomes. The company's financial position is robust with a cash runway into 2H:26 after a reverse merger and private financing in December 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The expansion of the Phase 1/2 gene therapy trial by Neurogene Inc. for Rett syndrome is a significant step forward in the development of NGN-401. This therapy's potential to deliver full-length, functional copies of the MECP2 gene could address a critical unmet need in pediatric neurology. The use of EXACT transgene regulation technology to maintain MECP2 levels within a narrow therapeutic range is a noteworthy aspect of this treatment, potentially mitigating the risk of overexpression-related toxicity, which has been a concern in gene therapies targeting neurological conditions.From a research perspective, the interim data expected in the fourth quarter of 2024 will be pivotal in assessing the efficacy and safety profile of NGN-401. The data will likely influence the company's valuation and could be a catalyst for stock price movement. The financial implications for Neurogene are considerable, as successful interim results could lead to partnerships, licensing deals, or further investment to support the drug's development and potential commercialization. Financial Analyst Neurogene's strong financial position, with a cash runway into the second half of 2026, is a testament to the strategic financial maneuvers executed by the company, including a reverse merger and a private financing round in December 2023. With $197.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, the company appears well-capitalized to pursue its clinical programs without the immediate need for additional capital raising, which is reassuring for investors concerned about dilution.The reported net income of $2.4 million for the fourth quarter, bolstered by a one-time bargain purchase gain, contrasts with the net loss for the full year. This indicates the company's ability to manage expenses effectively, with a slight decrease in R&D spending year-over-year. The increase in G&A expenses is understandable given the company's growth trajectory and the costs associated with the reverse merger. Investors should monitor the company's burn rate and the progress of its clinical trials, as these will be important determinants of Neurogene's long-term financial health and stock performance. Biotech Market Analyst The gene therapy sector within biotechnology continues to attract significant interest and Neurogene's focus on rare neurological diseases positions it in a niche but potentially lucrative market. The company's progress with NGN-401 for Rett syndrome and NGN-101 for CLN5 Batten disease is of particular interest. The rarity of these conditions could qualify Neurogene for various regulatory incentives, including orphan drug designation, which can expedite the review process and provide market exclusivity upon approval.Investors should note the competitive landscape and the regulatory environment's impact on Neurogene's market opportunities. While the company's technological approach and trial expansion are promising, the real test will come with the interim data readouts and subsequent regulatory interactions. Positive results could significantly enhance the company's market position, while any setbacks could have a detrimental impact on investor confidence and the company's strategic outlook. 03/18/2024 - 04:14 PM Expanded Phase 1/2 gene therapy trial for Rett syndrome to inform future registrational study design; Company remains on track to share interim clinical data in 4Q:24 Strong financial position with runway into 2H:26 following reverse merger and private financing in December 2023 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Neurogene Inc. (Nasdaq: NGNE), a clinical-stage company founded to bring life-changing genetic medicines to patients and families affected by rare neurological diseases, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results and highlighted recent corporate updates. “We started the year with strong execution in our Phase 1/2 NGN-401 gene therapy trial for female pediatric patients with Rett syndrome, meeting our goal to expand the trial and add a high-dose cohort. We believe this expanded dataset will support future regulatory discussions to align on the design of a potential registrational study,” said Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Neurogene. “NGN-401 has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment option with a targeted route of administration to deliver full-length, functional copies of the MECP2 gene. We are pleased that NGN-401 has been well-tolerated in all three patients dosed, with no signs of overexpression-related toxicity, demonstrating the potential of our EXACT transgene regulation technology to constrain MECP2 levels within a narrow and therapeutically relevant range. As we look ahead, we remain on track for interim clinical data from the NGN-401 trial in the fourth quarter of this year.” Continued Dr. McMinn, “Our decision to execute a reverse merger, along with the concurrent private financing, provides us with cash runway into the second half of 2026, beyond key inflection points in our NGN-401 program and our NGN-101 program for CLN5 Batten disease. We look forward to sharing data from both programs later this year and continuing to advance our pipeline to enable an additional development candidate using EXACT in 2025.” Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Highlights, and Anticipated Milestones Phase 1/2 Trial of NGN-401 Gene Therapy for Treatment of Rett Syndrome As previously planned, amended the protocol, expanding the trial to include more patients in low-dose Cohort 1 and added a high-dose Cohort 2; these updates are expected to provide a robust dataset and inform the design of a future registrational study Remains on track to report interim clinical data from Cohort 1 in the fourth quarter of 2024; additional interim data, including from Cohort 2, are expected in the second half of 2025 Dosed the third patient early in the first quarter of 2024; removed the dosing stagger in Cohort 1, enabling the remaining patients in the cohort to be dosed in parallel Plans to complete enrollment in Cohort 1 in the second half of 2024; enrollment in Cohort 2 is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2024 Reported that NGN-401 has been generally well-tolerated and there have been no treatment-emergent or procedure-related serious adverse events or signs of overexpression-related toxicity observed in any patient Received NGN-401 clinical trial application approval from the United Kingdom (“UK”) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and working to on-board clinical sites in the UK Phase 1/2 Trial of NGN-101 Gene Therapy for Treatment of CLN5 Batten Disease Continuing enrollment in high-dose Cohort 3, and expects to provide interim clinical data and regulatory update in the second half of 2024 Additional Corporate Updates Expanded the leadership team with appointment of Julie Jordan, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer; Dr. Jordan brings more than 20 years of experience to Neurogene, including design and execution of clinical trials for central nervous system disorders and gene therapies Completed reverse merger and concurrent private placement of $95 million, and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under “NGNE” in mid-December 2023 Continues to expect to advance one additional product candidate, using EXACT technology, from the discovery stage into the clinic in 2025 Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2023 were $197.2 million. Research & Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses were $12.2 million and $44.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $11.0 million and $47.5 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The decrease in R&D expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a decrease in manufacturing and development and pre-clinical costs offset by increased clinical trial costs. General & Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses: G&A expenses were $2.5 million and $11.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $2.0 million and $9.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. The increase in G&A expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in personnel costs, increased professional and consulting fees related to the reverse merger, and increased insurance and information technology costs. Due to the timing of the closing of the reverse merger in mid-December 2023, additional transaction-related expenses are expected to be recognized in the first quarter of 2024. Net Income and Net Loss: Net income was $2.4 million and net loss was $36.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to net loss of $12.3 million and $55.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022, respectively. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 included a one-time $16.4 million bargain purchase gain related to the reverse merger.

Cheetah aims to become an integrated provider of international trade services for small- and medium-sized traders. Negative Challenging market conditions in the PRC led to declines in revenue and profit for the company. The company's ability to profit from parallel-vehicle exports has been significantly challenged. Sales volumes have declined, impacting the company's financial performance. Financial Analyst The financial performance of Cheetah Net Supply Chain Service Inc. reflects a strategic pivot amidst challenging market conditions, particularly within the PRC's luxury vehicle segment. The company's revenue contraction by 30.5% year-over-year is a red flag, signaling a need for close monitoring of their operational efficiency and market strategy. However, the acquisition of Edward Transit Express Group indicates a diversification strategy that could potentially mitigate risks associated with the core business. The company's ability to maintain positive cash flow from operations, despite declining sales, suggests effective cost management, which is important for investor confidence during downturns.From a liquidity standpoint, the reported cash balance seems low at $0.4 million, but the working capital of $7.5 million and the support from the principal stockholder could provide a buffer. The company's future plans to seek additional equity financing could dilute current shareholders but also provide necessary capital for expansion. Investors should weigh the risks of market volatility against the potential benefits of the company's diversification and international trade services expansion. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader implications of Cheetah's performance, the luxury vehicle market in the PRC is indicative of consumer sentiment and economic trends. The compression of margins between U.S. retail prices and wholesale prices in the parallel-import vehicle market suggests an oversupply or decreased demand. This could impact other players in the industry, potentially leading to a market correction. Cheetah's shift towards warehousing, logistics and financial services is a strategic move to reduce dependency on volatile segments and tap into growing demand for comprehensive trade services among small- and medium-sized enterprises.The company's diversification could serve as a case study for similar businesses facing market saturation or regulatory challenges. By expanding their service offerings, they may not only survive but thrive by unlocking new revenue streams. The acquisition of Edward could be a strategic play to gain a competitive edge in logistics, a sector that is becoming increasingly important in global trade dynamics. Economist The financial results of Cheetah reveal underlying economic pressures such as price volatility and consumer purchasing power within the PRC. The contraction in luxury vehicle sales may be symptomatic of broader economic cooling, which could have ripple effects across related sectors. The company's proactive measures in acquiring Edward and expanding into logistics and financial services are indicative of a hedging strategy against sector-specific downturns.Cheetah's decision to diversify could be seen as a response to the economic principle of 'not putting all eggs in one basket,' providing a buffer against sectoral shocks. The move towards integrated international trade services could capitalize on the global trend of increasing cross-border commerce, especially among small- and medium-sized traders who may lack the scale to establish their own logistics networks. This strategic foresight could position Cheetah for recovery and growth as market conditions evolve. 03/18/2024 - 04:10 PM CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cheetah Net Supply Chain Service Inc. (“We,” “Our,” “Cheetah,” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq CM: CTNT), a supplier of parallel-import vehicles sourced in the U.S. to be sold in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) market, today reported results for the financial year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a corporate update. Recent Highlights Challenging market conditions in the PRC have resulted in an industry-wide slowdown of vehicle sales, including price and volume drops in the luxury segment. The Company’s results have been impacted by unfavorable market conditions, experiencing declines in revenue and profit. The favorable margin between the U.S. retail prices of select luxury car models and their wholesale prices in the parallel-vehicle market has been significantly compressed or eliminated.The Company continues to focus on the most popular vehicles in the luxury end of the market, where profit opportunities can still be realized.The Company’s 2023 sales declined by 30.5% from 2022, to $38.4 million due to lower sales volume. Net profit after tax amounted to $0.1 million, and positive cash flow from operations rose to $5.6 million. The Company ended 2023 with a cash balance of $0.4 million.In February 2024, the Company acquired Edward Transit Express Group, Inc. (“Edward”), a California-based common carrier specializing in ocean and air transportation services, for $1.5 million. The acquisition of Edward is being used to launch warehousing and logistics services to third-party parallel-import vehicle and other wholesalers, and to enhance the offering of the Company’s financial services business, which was launched in October 2022.The Company is moving quickly to expand beyond the parallel-import vehicle business with the goal of becoming an integrated provider of international trade services for small- and medium-sized traders. Cheetah Chairman and CEO Tony Liu commented, “Weakening conditions in the PRC market beginning in the second half of 2023 accelerated during the fourth quarter and have continued into 2024. Sales volumes have declined and luxury vehicle manufacturers have responded by discounting the prices of their vehicles below MSRP. As a result, our ability to profit from the sale of parallel-vehicle exports has been significantly challenged. Cheetah remains focused on executing sales to the PRC that generate favorable margins.” Mr. Liu continued, “We are addressing this situation by accelerating our plans to acquire warehousing and logistics businesses to reduce our purchase costs and to offer these services to other parallel-import vehicle exporters. Acquiring Edward is the first step in this plan, and we are actively considering other opportunities. As we cannot predict when the economics of the parallel-vehicle market will improve, we are also accelerating our efforts to provide international trade services, both for imports and exports, that extend beyond automobiles.” 2023 Financial Results During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our financial performance reflected the consequences of strategic decisions and external market forces. Our revenue experienced a substantial decline compared to the previous year. Revenue from our operations decreased by $16.8 million, or 30.5%, from approximately $55.2 million in 2022 to $38.4 million in 2023. This decline can be primarily attributed to an intentional pause in vehicle procurement in the fourth quarter, prompted by a price volatility in the PRC market and the results of an earlier shift in our procurement pricing strategy. The impact of these factors was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2023. Total cost of revenue decreased by $16.6 million, or 32.8%, from $50.7 million in 2022 to $34.1 million in 2023. Our cost of revenue amounted to 88.9% and 91.9%, respectively, of our revenue. Our total cost of revenue decreased in line with the reduced revenue, indicating effective cost control measures. The procurement strategy shift, initiated earlier in 2023, was a significant factor in this decrease, allowing us to manage costs more effectively despite external market pressures. Selling expenses decreased by 25.7% to $0.7 million, representing 1.7% of our revenue, a slight increase from 1.6% in 2022. This change is due to a 29.9% reduction in ocean freight expenses and 19.1% decrease in payroll and benefits, despite a 191.2% increase in other expenses. The decrease in selling expenses can be attributed primarily to a reduction in the number of vehicles sold during the fourth quarter. Income from operations was $1.4 million in 2023, compared with $2.1 million the previous year. Total other expenses consisted primarily of interest expense, which decreased significantly by approximately $1.2 million, or 49.2%, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the significant drop of inventory financing activities, reduced letter of credit financing activities, and the completion of our IPO in the third quarter of 2023. Net income in 2023 was $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share, compared with net income of $0.8 million, or $0.05 per share, for 2022. Liquidity and Cash Flow We reported cash of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Our working capital amounted to approximately $7.5 million, consisting of $9.8 million of current assets less $2.3 million of current liabilities, including $1.8 million in loans payable. Our strong working capital cushion is supported additionally by our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities. From time to time in the past several years, we have been supported by loans from our principal stockholder, and we believe such support will continue to be available in the future, if needed. We are working to further improve our liquidity and capital sources primarily by generating cash from operations, debt financing, and, if needed, financial support from our principal stockholder. In order to fully implement our business plan and sustain continued growth, we may also seek additional equity financing from outside investors. Based on the current operating plan, management believes that the aforementioned measures collectively will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future liquidity and capital requirements for at least 12 months from the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements.

Positive preclinical data for BAER-101 presented at key medical meetings. Final agreement with FDA on Phase 3 safety study of IV tramadol. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The completion of enrollment for Avenue Therapeutics' Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 is a significant step forward in the development of potential treatments for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a condition with no current approved therapies in the United States. The focus on a rare neuromuscular disorder like SBMA highlights a strategic approach to address unmet medical needs, which could lead to expedited regulatory pathways and potential market exclusivity benefits. The use of AJ201 as an Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator and androgen receptor degradation enhancer is indicative of a novel therapeutic mechanism, which may also have implications for other neurodegenerative diseases, potentially broadening the impact of this research.From a medical research perspective, the primary endpoint focusing on safety and tolerability is standard for early-phase trials. However, the efficacy signals and secondary outcomes will be critical for assessing the drug's potential. Positive topline data, expected in the second quarter of 2024, could have a notable impact on Avenue's stock valuation, as it would de-risk the asset and potentially attract partnership or investment opportunities. Conversely, negative results could significantly hinder the company's prospects and stock performance. Financial Analyst Investors will be closely monitoring the progress of Avenue Therapeutics, particularly with the anticipated topline data for AJ201. The financial implications of a successful Phase 1b/2a trial could be substantial, considering the orphan drug status often granted to treatments for rare diseases like SBMA. This status can lead to incentives such as tax credits, user fee waivers and market exclusivity upon approval. The company's mention of requiring additional financing is a critical factor, as it suggests a potential future capital raise that could dilute current shareholders but is necessary for continued development of their pipeline.Moreover, the final agreement with the FDA on the study design for the Phase 3 safety study of IV tramadol indicates a maturing pipeline that may diversify the company's portfolio and reduce investor risk. The progress in the company's pipeline and regulatory milestones typically acts as a positive catalyst for the stock, although the actual impact will depend on the market's perception of the company's ability to bring these products to market and achieve commercial success. Market Research Analyst Understanding the competitive landscape for treatments of rare diseases like SBMA is essential for evaluating Avenue's potential market impact. Currently, the lack of approved treatments for SBMA in the U.S. presents a significant opportunity for Avenue to establish a strong market presence. However, the company will need to navigate the challenges of pricing, reimbursement and patient access strategies that are critical for rare disease therapies. If AJ201 proves to be safe and effective, Avenue could leverage the orphan drug designation to secure a premium pricing strategy, which is common in the rare disease market.The presentation of positive preclinical data for BAER-101 in epilepsy and the advancement of IV tramadol further demonstrate the company's commitment to addressing unmet needs in neurologic diseases. Success in these areas could enhance the company's reputation and market positioning, potentially leading to strategic partnerships or collaborations that could bolster their commercialization efforts and overall market share in the neurologic space. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM - Enrollment completed in Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy; topline data expected in second quarter of 2024 - - Presented positive BAER-101 preclinical data at American Epilepsy Society (AES) and American Society for Experimental Neurotherapeutics (ASENT) Annual Meetings and in publication Drug Development Research - - Final agreement reached with FDA on study design and analysis approach for Phase 3 safety study of IV tramadol – MIAMI, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avenue Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATXI) (“Avenue” or the “Company”), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of neurologic diseases, today reported financial results and recent corporate highlights for the year ended December 31, 2023. “We made considerable progress across our pipeline of differentiated neurologic therapies in 2023,"" said Alexandra MacLean, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Avenue. “Avenue demonstrated tremendous execution capabilities with our lead clinical program AJ201, a potential first-in-class treatment for spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), also known as Kennedy’s Disease. Within nine months of acquiring the rights to AJ201 in March 2023, we dosed the first patient in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, and we completed trial enrollment of 25 SBMA patients across six sites in the U.S. We remain on track to report topline data for AJ201 in the second quarter of 2024, an incredibly exciting milestone for both the Company and patients suffering from SBMA, a debilitating rare neuromuscular disorder with no approved treatments in the U.S. Additionally, we have progressed BAER-101 for the treatment of epilepsy by presenting preclinical data from a translational animal model in multiple peer-reviewed forums. We have also advanced IV tramadol, reaching final agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the safety study and statistical analysis approach for the final Phase 3 study. Pending additional financing, we look forward to progressing BAER-101 and IV tramadol for patients facing great unmet need. We look forward to another productive year in 2024 as we continue to make significant strides across our clinical pipeline and advance our mission of providing impactful therapies to patients suffering from neurologic diseases.” Recent Corporate Highlights: AJ201 (Nrf1 and Nrf2 activator, androgen receptor degradation enhancer for SBMA) In January 2024, Avenue completed enrollment in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 for the treatment of SBMA. The 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of AJ201 enrolled 25 patients randomly assigned to AJ201 (600 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess safety and tolerability of AJ201 in subjects with clinically and genetically defined SBMA. Topline data for the Phase 1b/2a study are anticipated in the second quarter of 2024. More information about this study can be found at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05517603). BAER-101 (GABAA α2/3 positive allosteric modulator) Avenue presented preclinical results for BAER-101, a potentially best-in-class selective GABAA α2,3 positive allosteric modulator, in three scientific peer-reviewed settings, including the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Annual Meeting in December 2023, the publication Drug Development Research in February 2024 and the American Society for Experimental Neurotherapeutics (ASENT) Annual Meeting in March 2024. The in vivo data showcase BAER-101’s ability to significantly suppress seizures using the SynapCell’s Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rat from Strasbourg (“GAERS”) model of epilepsy. BAER-101 fully suppressed seizure activity in the GAERS model with a minimal effective dose of 0.3 mg/kg, PO, and the effect was fast in onset and stable throughout the duration of testing. The data also demonstrated BAER-101’s ability to selectively target GABAA α2 and α3 subtypes more than α1 and α5, potentially improving anti-convulsant and anxiolytic activity while minimizing the risk of tolerance and abuse associated with existing treatments in this drug class. Subject to obtaining the necessary financing, which could be provided through a strategic partnership, Avenue plans to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of BAER-101 to further study its anti-seizure properties in patients with common or rare epilepsies. IV Tramadol In January 2024, Avenue reached final agreement with the FDA on the safety study protocol and statistical analysis approach for the Phase 3 study for intravenous (“IV”) tramadol, which is in development for the treatment of acute post-operative pain in a medically supervised setting. The final non-inferiority study is designed to assess the theoretical risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression related to opioid stacking on IV tramadol compared to IV morphine. The study will randomize approximately 300 post bunionectomy patients to IV tramadol or IV morphine for pain relief administered during a 48-hour post-operative period. Patients will have access to IV hydromorphone, a Schedule II opioid, for rescue of breakthrough pain. Pending additional financing, Avenue aims to initiate the Phase 3 safety study as soon as feasible. The Company believes that the study can be completed and submitted to the FDA within 12 months of the study’s initiation. General Corporate In March 2024, Avenue announced that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel granted the Company’s request for an extension to evidence compliance with all applicable criteria for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, including the $1.00 bid price and $2.5 million stockholders’ equity requirements, through May 20, 2024. 2023 Financial Results: Cash Position: As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.8 million, compared to $6.7 million at December 31, 2022, a decrease of $4.9 million. In January 2024, the Company completed a warrant inducement transaction resulting in $5.0 million in gross proceeds.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the full year 2023 were $6.1 million, compared to $2.7 million in 2022. Additionally, there was $4.2 million in expense for the acquisition of the AJ201 license in 2023.G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the full year 2023 were $4.2 million, compared to $5.3 million in 2022.Net Loss: Net loss for the full year 2023 was $10.5 million, or $0.98 per share, compared to a net loss of $3.6 million, or $1.63 per share, in 2022.

Blackbaud Announces Termination of Stockholder Rights Plan,2024-03-18T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Blackbaud (BLKB) terminates stockholder rights plan, deemed unnecessary by the Board.","Blackbaud Announces Termination of Stockholder Rights Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Blackbaud (BLKB) terminates stockholder rights plan, deemed unnecessary by the Board. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The termination of Blackbaud's stockholder rights plan, also known as a 'poison pill', is a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The board's decision to end the plan ahead of its expiration date suggests a shift in their approach to corporate defense mechanisms. This could indicate a more open stance towards potential acquisition offers, or a sign of confidence in the company's current strategic path.It's essential to assess the implications of this action on the company's valuation. The removal of a poison pill can often lead to an uptick in stock price as it may attract interest from activist investors or potential acquirers. For long-term investors, this could signal a period of volatility as the market reacts to this new development. Corporate Governance Expert From a corporate governance perspective, the board's unanimous decision to terminate the Rights Plan reflects their assessment of the current business landscape and governance trends. Rights Plans are typically adopted as a defensive measure against hostile takeovers. By terminating the plan, Blackbaud's board is effectively removing a significant barrier to potential takeovers, which could be viewed favorably by the market as an indication of transparency and openness to market forces.However, it's also important to consider the potential risks associated with this move. Without a Rights Plan, the company may become more vulnerable to unsolicited bids, which may not always align with the long-term interests of the company or its shareholders. The board's future plans to safeguard the interests of the stakeholders will be an area to watch closely. Market Research Analyst Terminating a Rights Plan can have a ripple effect across the market, particularly within the software and social impact sector. Competitors and peers will likely monitor this development closely, as it could precipitate changes in market dynamics. For instance, if Blackbaud is perceived as a takeover target, it may prompt other companies in the space to reevaluate their own defensive strategies.Moreover, market perception of Blackbaud's operational performance and strategic initiatives will be critical in the coming months. Investors will be keen to understand whether this decision is part of a larger strategic realignment that could affect the company's market position and competitive edge. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM CHARLESTON, S.C., March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB) (""Blackbaud"" or the ""Company""), the leading provider of software for powering social impact, today announced that its Board of Directors (the ""Board"") has unanimously voted to terminate the Company's stockholder rights plan (the ""Rights Plan"") effective as of the close of business on March 18, 2024.

The mention of non-linear timing of end-of-life shipments for memory IC products further underscores the transitionary state of the company's product lifecycle. However, the CEO's forward-looking statements hint at a potential rebound, with an anticipated resumption of revenue growth in the upcoming quarters.Investors would be prudent to monitor the company's order backlog, which stands at over $12 million for memory IC products, as it provides a tangible measure of short-term financial health. Additionally, the new orders for mmWave products targeting fixed wireless access applications, particularly from the company's largest customer, could signal an inflection point for revenue growth and market adoption of their technology.The public offering completed to strengthen the cash position and balance sheet is a strategic move to ensure liquidity and support ongoing operations. However, it's imperative to consider the dilutive effects of such offerings on existing shareholders. The company's optimism, supported by an expanding engagement pipeline and initial indications of renewed customer demand, should be weighed against the inherent risks of the highly competitive tech sector. Market Research Analyst Peraso's engagement with wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) and the commercial order for the DUNE product platform are significant developments. These engagements, particularly in dense urban environments, suggest a strategic pivot towards markets with a high demand for gigabit wireless connectivity.Understanding the market dynamics of FWA and WISP sectors is essential as these are rapidly evolving areas with significant growth potential. Peraso's entry into these markets with a product designed for urban settings could address a critical gap in providing affordable high-speed internet access. The success of the DUNE platform could position Peraso as a key player in this niche, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue.The uptick in customer engagement activity with WISPs also indicates a broader industry trend where the demand for wireless connectivity solutions is on the rise, particularly in international markets. This could represent a larger shift in consumer and business preferences towards wireless solutions, which may have long-term implications for companies in the telecommunications and technology sectors. Technology Industry Analyst The financial narrative of Peraso underscores the volatility and innovation-driven nature of the technology sector, especially within the mmWave technology space. The company's focus on 60 GHz unlicensed and 5G licensed networks places it at the forefront of a critical transition in wireless communication infrastructure.mmWave technology is pivotal for the next generation of wireless networks due to its high bandwidth and speed capabilities. The memory IC product lifecycle and the strategic shift towards mmWave products for FWA applications reflect an industry-wide trend of evolving technology standards and consumer demand for faster connectivity.Peraso's recent public offering to fund its business plan and the initial success of the DUNE platform in dense urban environments could be early indicators of the company's adaptability and potential growth trajectory. However, the technology sector's fast-paced environment means that Peraso must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain a competitive edge. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN JOSE, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 18, 2024 / Peraso Inc. (NASDAQ:PRSO) (""Peraso"" or the ""Company""), a global leader in mmWave technology for 60 GHz unlicensed and 5G licensed networks, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Management Commentary""Consistent with our prior expectations, product revenue for the fourth quarter reflected the ongoing inventory correction in the market for our mmWave products, as well as the non-linear timing of end-of-life shipments for our memory IC products,"" commented Ron Glibbery, CEO of Peraso. ""Since the beginning of the new year, these headwinds have begun to moderate, and we anticipate revenue growth to resume in the first quarter and for the full year. These expectations are supported by over $12 million of remaining total order backlog for our memory IC products, as well as new orders for our mmWave products targeting fixed wireless access (FWA) applications, including from our largest customer.""Also notable, we have recently seen an uptick in customer engagement activity with wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) seeking to deploy affordable gigabit wireless connectivity in international markets. In January, we secured the first commercial order for Peraso's newly launched DUNE product platform designed specifically for dense urban environments, and we have since commenced proof-of concept engagements with multiple additional service providers.""More recently, we took actions to strengthen our cash position and balance sheet by completing a public offering, which provides working capital to continue executing our business plan and focus on growing the customer base for our mmWave products. With the expanding engagement pipeline for our mmWave solutions and the initial indications of renewed customer demand, we are very optimistic about the Company's outlook for 2024.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsTotal net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.8 million, compared with $4.5 million in the prior quarter and $3.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. Product revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 million, compared with $4.3 million in the prior quarter and $3.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential and year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to reduced shipments of both mmWave and memory IC products.GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative 147.3%, compared with 45.4% in the prior quarter and 44.2% in the same quarter a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative 116.6%, compared with 58.0% in the prior quarter and 53.4% in the same quarter a year ago. The negative gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was primary attributable to a $3.0 million inventory write-down during the quarter, which comprised a combination of mmWave and end-of-life memory IC products.Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $5.5 million, which included $0.2 million of asset write-downs, compared with $5.6 million in the prior quarter and $16.2 million in the same quarter a year ago, which included a $9.9 million goodwill impairment charge. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter of 2023, which exclude stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets, were $4.0 million, compared with $4.0 million in the prior quarter and $4.8 million in the same quarter a year ago. The reduction in fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses was attributable to a combination of previous cost reductions initiated in the second half of 2022, as well as incremental cost containment actions taken by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2023.GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $8.9 million, or ($12.48) per share, compared with a net loss of $0.6 million, or ($0.87) per share, in the prior quarter, and a net loss of $14.6 million, or ($28.45) per share, in the fourth quarter 0f 2022.Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $6.1 million, or ($8.52) per share, compared with a net loss of $1.1 million, or ($1.56) per share, in the prior quarter and a net loss of $2.8 million, or ($5.41) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative $5.9 million, compared with a negative $0.9 million in the prior quarter and a negative $2.5 million in the same quarter last year.A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results and GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA is provided in the financial statement tables following the text of this press release.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.6 million. Subsequent to year-end, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of common stock and warrants, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $3.4 million.Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsTotal net revenue for 2023 was $13.7 million compared with $14.9 million in the prior year. Product revenue in 2023 was $12.9 million, compared with $14.2 million in 2022. The decreases in total net revenue and product revenue were primarily attributable to reduced shipments of mmWave products, partially offset by increased shipments of memory IC products.GAAP gross margin for 2023 was 13.6%, compared with 40.1% for 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margin for 2023 was 28.0%, compared with 49.7% for 2022. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin primarily reflected the $3.0 million write-down of inventory in the fourth quarter of 2023.Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis for 2023 were $22.5 million, compared with operating expenses of $38.3 million for 2022. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2023, excluding stock-based compensation expenses and amortization of intangible assets, were $16.4 million, compared with $22.0 million in 2022. Operating expenses on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were reduced by non-recurring gains on a 2022 asset and license sale of which $0.4 million and $2.6 million were recognized in 2023 and 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statement tables following the text of this press release.GAAP net loss for 2023 was $16.8 million, or ($26.00) per share, compared with a net loss of $32.4 million, or ($64.41) per share, for 2022.Non-GAAP net loss for 2023 was $12.2 million, or ($18.90) per share, compared with a net loss of $14.7 million, or ($29.17) per share, in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was a negative $11.2 million, compared with a negative $13.7 million for 2022.Business OutlookThe Company expects total net revenue for the first quarter of 2024 to be in the range of $2.6 million to $2.9 million.Strategic Action UpdateIn August 2023, the Company engaged an investment bank to assist with the exploration of strategic alternatives, including a merger, sale of assets or other similar transaction, with the intention to maximize stockholder value and further our business operations. In January 2024, the Company terminated such advisory agreement. The Company currently has no commitments or agreements and is not negotiating with any parties relating to a merger, sale of assets or other similar transaction.Earnings Conference Call and Webcast InformationRon Glibbery, CEO, and Jim Sullivan, CFO, will host a conference call and webcast with slides today, March 18, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).Date: Monday, March 18, 2024Time: 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time)Conference Call Number: 1-888-506-0062International Call Number: +1-973-528-0011Passcode: 871343Webcast and Slides: Click HereFor those unable to listen to the live Web broadcast, it will be archived on the Company's website, and can be accessed by visiting the Company's investor page at www.perasoinc.com.

Any supporting materials referenced during the live broadcast will be made available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website following the conclusion of the conference call.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement Peraso's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, Peraso uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude from the statement of operations the effects of stock-based compensation,amortization of reported intangible assets, goodwill impairment charges and the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Peraso's management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors and other interested persons because they are one of the primary indicators that Peraso's management uses for planning and forecasting future performance. The press release also makes reference to and reconciles GAAP net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA, which the Company defines as GAAP net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax provision, and depreciation and amortization, as well as stock-based compensation, amortization of reported intangible assets, and the change in fair value of warrant liabilities. Management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items is useful to investors because management does not consider these charges part of the day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company that are within the control of management or that would be used to evaluate management's operating performance.Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which are provided in tables below the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, and management's explanation of why it considers such measures to be useful, refer to the Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 18, 2024, that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including, without limitation, the Company's expectations regarding growth prospects for the Company's products and the Company's 2024 revenue and gross margin trends.

The transition aims to enhance strategic objectives, streamlining corporate structure with new Canadian leadership.","Senstar Technologies Completes Corporate Redomiciliation from Israel to Canada Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Senstar Technologies (SNT) completes redomiciliation from Israel to Canada, with shares trading on Nasdaq under 'SNT'. The transition aims to enhance strategic objectives, streamlining corporate structure with new Canadian leadership. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of Senstar Technologies Corporation's redomiciliation from Israel to Ontario, Canada, represents a strategic shift that could have several implications for the company's operations and market perception. By moving to Canada, Senstar is likely positioning itself to take advantage of Canada's stable economic environment and favorable corporate laws, which could potentially lead to improved operational efficiencies and a more favorable tax structure. Additionally, the move may enhance the company's ability to attract and retain talent within the North American market, which is critical for a high-tech company with global ambitions.Investors should monitor how this transition influences the company's cost structure and whether it leads to any changes in the regulatory landscape that Senstar must navigate. Furthermore, the market will be looking for signs of whether the new Canadian leadership team can successfully implement the strategic vision they have outlined. The immediate impact on the stock might be neutral to positive, as the market digests the long-term benefits of such a move. Financial Analyst The redomiciliation of Senstar Technologies to Canada could impact the company's financials in a number of ways. The transition may lead to one-time costs associated with the move, but could also result in long-term savings from a potentially lower corporate tax rate in Canada compared to Israel. Investors should examine future financial statements to assess the impact of these changes on Senstar's profitability and cash flow.Additionally, the leadership changes, with Alicia Kelly stepping in as CFO, could signal a shift in financial strategy. Her background in global financial management suggests a strong foundation for steering the company's financial operations during the transition period and beyond. Her experience in supply chain and customer service functions could also bring a fresh perspective to the company's cost management and revenue growth strategies. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the redomiciliation of a corporation involves a complex web of regulatory compliance and corporate governance adjustments. Senstar Technologies' move to Canada means adherence to Canadian corporate laws, which may differ significantly from Israeli laws. The company will need to navigate these changes while maintaining compliance with the Nasdaq's listing requirements and the U.S. SEC regulations due to its continued presence on the Nasdaq Global Market.Investors should consider the legal expertise and capabilities of the new leadership team in managing this transition. Effective corporate governance and compliance are essential for maintaining investor confidence and avoiding potential legal pitfalls that could arise from the redomiciliation process. The company's ability to communicate transparently with the SEC and its shareholders about these changes will be key in maintaining a stable legal footing in its new home jurisdiction. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM Ottawa, ON, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Senstar Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: SNT), a leading international provider of comprehensive physical, video and access control security products and solutions, today announced the completion of its redomiciliation process from Israel to Ontario, Canada effective March 18, 2024.

The contract aims to enhance physical and cognitive performance, reduce injury rates, and ensure combat readiness. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Contracting Analyst The announcement by KBR to provide human performance optimization services to the U.S. Air Force Air Combat Command represents a strategic expansion of the company's existing portfolio of government contracts. This move capitalizes on KBR's historical expertise in health and human performance, leveraging more than 50 years of experience in supporting both NASA astronauts and U.S. Special Operations Forces. The multi-award IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity) contract structure is a common procurement method in government contracting, offering flexibility in both the volume and timing of services provided. This could potentially lead to increased revenue stability for KBR over the ten-year period, as IDIQ contracts often include a base period with multiple option years that the government can exercise.For investors, the longevity and scale of the contract may signal a long-term revenue stream, contributing positively to KBR's financial stability and growth prospects. However, it's important to monitor how KBR manages the integration of this new contract into its operations, as well as the potential impact on its profit margins, given the specialized nature of the services required. The contract's focus on optimizing physical and cognitive performance could also position KBR at the forefront of a niche market within the defense sector, potentially opening doors to similar opportunities in the future. Military Readiness Expert The HPO contract's objective to enhance military readiness through optimizing human performance is reflective of the broader trend within military organizations to prioritize the well-being and effectiveness of personnel. By focusing on decreasing occupational injury rates and accelerating return to duty, KBR is addressing key aspects of force readiness that can have significant operational impacts. Effective human performance optimization can lead to enhanced combat readiness, potentially reducing the long-term costs associated with training and healthcare in military settings.As military operations increasingly recognize the importance of cognitive and physical capabilities in achieving strategic objectives, contracts like the HPO are likely to become more prevalent. The emphasis on a comprehensive approach to personnel well-being, including both physical and behavioral health, aligns with modern military strategies that view soldier resilience as a critical component of operational success. The collaboration between KBR and BSIT could serve as a model for future public-private partnerships aimed at advancing military human performance initiatives. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM HOUSTON, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- KBR (NYSE: KBR) announced today it has won a new subcontract with Bering Straits Information Technologies (BSIT), a subsidiary of Bering Straits Native Corporation (BSNC), in support of the U.S. Air Force Air Combat Command to provide human performance optimization services at various military bases around the world.

The company plans pivotal phase 3 trials for IgAN and phase 2 trials for SLE. Financially, Alpine saw a significant increase in collaboration revenue and a strong cash position, enough to fund operations into 2026. Positive Positive clinical data on povetacicept in IgAN and SLE Plans for pivotal phase 3 trial in IgAN and phase 2 trial in SLE Significant increase in collaboration revenue Strong cash position to fund operations into 2026 Negative None. Financial Analyst Alpine Immune Sciences' reported financials reflect a strategic focus on advancing their lead candidate povetacicept, with a robust cash position to support operations into 2026. The increase in collaboration revenue by almost 96%, largely attributed to the amended agreement with AbbVie, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its research partnerships effectively. However, the reported net loss decrease from $57.8 million in 2022 to $32.2 million in 2023, while still significant, suggests improved cost management and potential operational efficiencies. The research and development expenses have increased, indicating ongoing investment in their pipeline, which is necessary for long-term growth but could pressure short-term financial performance. Investors should note the company's commitment to R&D as a sign of confidence in its pipeline's potential. Medical Research Analyst The clinical progression of povetacicept, particularly in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), is noteworthy. The reduction in proteinuria and stable renal function at six months suggest a promising therapeutic profile. The advancement into a pivotal phase 3 trial is a critical milestone that could significantly impact the company's valuation if successful. Moreover, the expansion into systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a planned phase 2 trial indicates a strategic move to widen the drug's potential market. The translational data supporting its efficacy in multiple inflammatory diseases further underpins its best-in-class potential. The medical community will be watching closely for the upcoming data presentations, as these will offer deeper insights into povetacicept's efficacy and safety profile. Biotech Market Analyst Alpine Immune Sciences' strategic amendments with AbbVie and the planned initiation of new clinical trials are indicative of a proactive approach to pipeline development and market positioning. The biotech sector places a premium on such innovative treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, which currently have high unmet medical needs. The company's focus on a next-generation dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor may set them apart in a competitive landscape. The current cash runway into 2026 provides the company with a buffer to navigate the costly clinical trial phases without immediate fundraising pressures. This financial stability, coupled with potential clinical milestones, could make Alpine an interesting case for investors tracking the immunotherapy space. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM -- Clinical data on povetacicept in IgA nephropathy will be updated at the upcoming WCN meeting, including follow up at 80 mg and initial data at 240 mg SC once every four-weeks -- -- Povetacicept advancing towards a pivotal phase 3 trial in IgA nephropathy and a phase 2 trial in systemic lupus erythematosus -- SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALPN), a leading clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing innovative treatments for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, today reported full year 2023 financial results and company highlights for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. “2023 was a transformational year for Alpine, with initial IgA nephropathy (IgAN) data presented at the American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week 2023 suggesting a best-in-class profile for povetacicept, our next-generation dual BAFF/APRIL inhibitor. With our encouraging data set in IgAN, convenient once monthly dosing regimen, and strong balance sheet, we are rapidly advancing development of povetacicept as a potentially meaningful new therapeutic option for patients living with IgAN, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple other autoantibody-related diseases,” said Mitchell H. Gold, MD, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alpine. Dr. Gold continued, “Looking ahead, Alpine is well positioned for a year of meaningful catalysts, with multiple updates for povetacicept in IgAN and other indications, and the planned initiation of RAINIER, a pivotal phase 3 study of povetacicept in IgAN, and DENALI, a phase 2 study of povetacicept in SLE. In addition to updates on our clinical studies, we look forward to sharing translational data that further supports the best-in-class potential of povetacicept in multiple inflammatory diseases.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Corporate Updates Povetacicept (ALPN-303) First clinical data in IgAN demonstrate that povetacicept 80 mg administered once every four-weeks (Q4W) reduced proteinuria (as assessed by urine protein to creatinine ratio, UPCR) by greater than 50% and was associated with stable renal function (as assessed by estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR) at six months. In addition, povetacicept was well tolerated during subcutaneous administration, with no instances of IgG < 3 g/L, and no severe infections (2023 American Society of Nephrology Kidney Week). In a model of murine experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis, povetacicept improved disease activity, with clinical scores superior to treatment with either the FcRn inhibitor efgartigimod or an anti-CD20 depleting antibody (2023 American Association of Neuromuscular & Electrodiagnostic Medicine Annual Meeting). New translational data from povetacicept in systemic lupus erythematosus demonstrate that povetacicept, as compared to single BAFF or APRIL pathway inhibitors, more potently downregulates genes associated with activation in B cells and significantly reduces multiple disease parameters in a mouse model of lupus, more effectively than WT TACI-Fc or conventional B cell depletion (2023 American College of Rheumatology Convergence). Throughout 2023, the Company presented multiple oral and poster presentations on povetacicept at scientific conferences (Full List of Company Publications and Presentations). Corporate Updates The Company plans to present additional data on povetacicept in IgA nephropathy, including follow up data from the 80 mg Q4W and initial data from the IgAN 240 mg Q4W dose cohorts, during a Late Breaking Abstract session at the World Congress of Nephrology 2024 on Monday April 15th at 4:45 PM ET. The Company plans to present new preclinical data on povetacicept, demonstrating its greater distribution to disease-related end organs compared with WT TACI-Ig, at the 14th European Lupus Meeting. These findings correlate with povetacicept’s improved efficacy in multiple preclinical disease models. The Company intends to initiate RAINIER, a pivotal phase 3 study of povetacicept in IgA nephropathy and DENALI, a phase 2 study of povetacicept in systemic lupus erythematosus in the second half of 2024, pending regulatory agreement. The Company plans to share initial data from RUBY-4 in autoimmune cytopenias in the first half of 2024 at a relevant scientific congress. The Company amended its option and license agreement on acazicolcept with AbbVie, stopping enrollment in the phase 2 study in systemic lupus erythematosus (Synergy), and facilitating early assessment of data. The Company ended the year with $368.2 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2023, which the Company anticipates should be sufficient to fund its planned operations into 2026. 2023 Financial Results Cash Position and Runway: As of December 31, 2023, Alpine’s cash and investments totaled $368.2 million compared to $273.4 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company anticipates its current cash and investments are sufficient to fund planned operations into 2026. Collaboration Revenue: For the year ended December 31, 2023, collaboration revenue was $58.9 million compared to $30.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase in collaboration revenue relates primarily to a $24.9 million increase in AbbVie revenue, of which $20.4 million relates to a cumulative catch-up adjustment resulting from the completion of enrollment in Synergy per the amendment with AbbVie, and a $4.5 million increase in Amgen revenue, driven primarily by the expiration of Amgen’s option to select a third Research Program. These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in Adaptimmune revenue as we completed our final deliverables under the agreement in June 2023. Research and Development Expense: For the year ended December 31, 2023, research and development expense, inclusive of non-cash expenses, were $80.9 million compared to $70.2 million for the same period in 2022. The increase of $10.7 million was driven by an $8.2 million increase in povetacicept costs, primarily related to higher clinical trial costs, process development, and manufacturing, a $1.3 million increase in acazicolcept costs, due primarily to process development and manufacturing costs, and a $7.7 million increase in personnel costs. General and Administrative Expenses: For the year ended December 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of non-cash expenses, were $22.2 million compared to $18.0 million for the same period in 2022. The increase of $4.3 million was primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs and professional services. Net Loss: Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $32.2 million compared to $57.8 million for the same period in 2022. Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc.

Based upon an engineered TACI (transmembrane activator and CAML interactor) domain, povetacicept has exhibited greater potency in preclinical studies versus other inhibitors of BAFF and/or APRIL alone and B cell depletion. Povetacicept is in development for multiple autoimmune diseases, including IgA nephropathy and other autoimmune kidney diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autoimmune cytopenias. About RUBY-3 RUBY-3 (NCT05732402) is a multiple ascending dose, multi-cohort, open label, phase 1b/2a study of povetacicept in autoimmune glomerulonephritis, including IgA nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and renal ANCA-associated vasculitis, where povetacicept is being administered subcutaneously for up to 104 weeks. Key endpoints include proteinuria, eGFR, renal response, and disease-related autoantibodies. About RUBY-4 RUBY-4 (NCT05757570) is a multi-cohort, open label, phase 1b study of povetacicept in immune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and cold agglutinin disease, where povetacicept is being administered subcutaneously for up to 48 weeks.

(NASDAQ: FBRX) announces 2023 results, highlighting the advancement of FB-102 into clinical trials. Research and development expenses increased to $21.9 million, with net losses per share at ($1.00). Forte ended 2023 with $37.1 million in cash and approximately 36.3 million shares outstanding. Positive Forte achieved a significant milestone by progressing FB-102 into clinical trials ahead of schedule. Research and development expenses surged to $21.9 million in 2023 compared to $5.6 million in 2022. General and administrative expenses rose to $10.6 million in 2023 from $8.3 million in 2022. Net losses per share were ($1.00) in 2023, higher than ($0.80) in 2022. Forte had approximately $37.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023. Forte reported around 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Negative The increase in research and development expenses to $21.9 million could impact the company's bottom line. General and administrative expenses also rose to $10.6 million, potentially affecting overall profitability. Net losses per share increased to ($1.00) in 2023, indicating a decline in financial performance compared to 2022. Forte Biosciences ended 2023 with a reduced cash position of $37.1 million compared to the previous year. The significant increase in the number of shares outstanding may dilute shareholder value. Financial Analyst The reported increase in research and development expenses by Forte Biosciences, primarily driven by the clinical advancement of FB-102, signifies a strategic allocation of resources towards its core developmental programs. The substantial rise in expenses, from $5.6 million to $21.9 million year-over-year, reflects the company's transition from preclinical to clinical stages, which typically entails higher costs due to manufacturing, regulatory and trial management activities.Investors should note the escalated general and administrative expenses, mainly attributed to professional and legal fees. This could indicate a ramp-up in activities necessitating external expertise, possibly in preparation for regulatory interactions or partnerships. However, the reduction in stock-based compensation suggests a possible strategic adjustment in employee remuneration, potentially to conserve cash.Considering the net loss increase and the diluted net loss per share from ($0.80) to ($1.00), stakeholders should evaluate the company's burn rate in relation to its cash reserves of $37.1 million. The current cash position, in comparison to the net loss, suggests a runway that investors must scrutinize for future funding needs or dilutive financing activities. Biotech Industry Analyst Advancing FB-102 into clinical trials is a pivotal step for Forte Biosciences, as it marks the transition of their lead candidate from a conceptual stage to a tangible product undergoing human testing. The successful completion of the single ascending dose part of the phase 1 trial and the initiation of the multiple ascending dose cohorts are critical for gauging the drug's safety profile and determining appropriate dosing regimens.For industry observers, the progress of FB-102 is of particular interest due to the high unmet need in autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. The company's focus on these conditions could address significant market gaps, providing a potential upside if the clinical outcomes are favorable. Yet, the long-term nature of biopharmaceutical development necessitates cautious optimism, as many compounds fail to make it past clinical hurdles.From an industry perspective, Forte's progress should be contextualized within the broader competitive landscape. The company's performance, particularly in terms of trial outcomes and subsequent regulatory milestones, will be essential in determining its positioning against incumbents and emerging players in the autoimmune therapeutic area. Market Research Analyst When assessing Forte Biosciences' market potential, it is important to consider the broader trends in the biopharmaceutical sector, particularly within the niche of autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases. The successful clinical advancements of FB-102 could position Forte as a notable player in a market that is increasingly driven by personalized medicine and targeted therapies.The stock market's response to such updates often hinges on investor sentiment towards the perceived risks and rewards. While clinical progress can fuel positive sentiment, the increased financial expenditure and subsequent net loss may temper investor enthusiasm. It's important to track the stock's performance in the wake of this announcement, as it may reflect the market's confidence in the company's strategic direction and its ability to bring FB-102 to market.Furthermore, the dilution effect from an increased share count, as indicated by the rise from 21 million to over 36 million shares, is a critical factor for shareholders. This dilution can affect earnings per share and, consequently, the stock price. Investors will likely weigh the potential long-term gains from FB-102 against the immediate dilutive impact and increased operational costs. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forte Biosciences, Inc. (www.fortebiorx.com) (NASDAQ: FBRX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on autoimmune and autoimmune-related diseases, today announced its 2023 results and provided a business update. 2023 Business Highlights “Forte achieved a major milestone by advancing FB-102 into the clinic and beating the timelines we targeted in our third quarter business update. The single ascending dose (SAD) portion of the FB-102 phase 1 trial was successfully completed and dosing has begun in the multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts.” said Paul Wagner, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forte Biosciences. “I am deeply appreciative of the talented Forte team that made this achievement possible. I also want to thank our investors who believe in the potential of FB-102 and in the Forte team as we continue to advance this exciting program. We look forward to providing more clinical updates on FB-102 over the course of this year.” 2023 Operating Results Research and development expenses were $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.6 million during the same period in 2022. The increase of $16.3 million was primarily due to a net increase of approximately $9.9 million in manufacturing expense, a net increase of approximately $6.0 million in preclinical and clinical expenses as our FB-102 program entered the clinic, and a net increase in payroll and related expenses of approximately $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in headcount. General and administrative expenses were $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.3 million for the same period in 2022. The increase of $2.3 million was primarily due to an increase in professional and legal expenses of $2.6 million, an increase in other expenses of $0.4 million, including rent and personnel expenses, partially offset by a reduction in stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million. Net losses per share were ($1.00) and ($0.80) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Forte ended 2023 with approximately $37.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. Forte had approximately 36.3 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023.

While historically, this quarter is our lowest revenue generator, FYQ2 experienced an unexpected interruption in the flow of PURE products to one of our major customers. The impact of this interruption cannot be overstated. We anticipate this shortfall in revenue will be absorbed in future sales.” Business Update We are excited to announce that we are beginning to make headway into new food segments as we work on expanding our footprint in the food industry. Brand Advertising and Marketing. Having a social media presence has been a focus of the newly-formed marketing committee at PURE. Our recently updated website is a helpful sales tool for lead generation, as well as a central location for customer support and questions. PURE will continue to evolve its brand as we work with a new branding firm to guide us in clearly communicating to the public that PURE’s team and chemistry are trustworthy, offering premium products that represent a complete game changer in the world of food safety and sanitization. Our targeted end user is committed to protecting their customers, employees, the environment, as well as their own brand name. Trade Shows. Attending and supporting customer events and trade shows has been and will continue to be a significant part of our growth initiatives. This has proven to be an effective approach to meeting new customers and continue networking and educating the industry on our unique SDC solutions. At the end of FYQ2, PURE attended the global International Production & Processing Expo (IPPE) show for the first time. Our team was able to better understand current industry trends and solutions, as well as network and meet with key customers. In addition, the team was able to facilitate strategic meetings with key industry leaders from North America and across the globe. PURE is again registered to exhibit at the International Association for Food Protection (IAFP) annual meeting in Long Beach, California (July 14-17, 2024). The IAFP annual meeting is attended by more than 3,500 of the top industry, academic and governmental food safety professionals. Distributor Focus and Support. Our business strategy will be shifting focus from a direct sales model to a distributor model. This model provides a much needed expansion of coverage in all regions of the United States. With local boots on the ground, our distributors allow PURE to expand our footprint into new market segments and customer bases as we are integrated into our distribution partners’ chemical portfolios and solution offerings. Due to the unique nature of our SDC molecule and ongoing advancement in application technologies, our distributors will be able to present their customers innovative solutions previously unavailable to them. This transition facilitates: Broader coverage of service personnel and more regular on-site visits to customers; Strengthening and growing partnerships with current distributors; Bringing on new key distributors; Leveraging the PURE team to provide enhanced support from remote to on-site visits; Better market penetration of our brand and product awareness; Acceleration of our sales model; and Expedited access to new market segments. Continued Innovation. The development of new solutions through application equipment is a large part of our current R&D efforts. New business sectors, including the dairy industry and the animal health market, have shown promising interest as we begin to explore the use of our SDC technology. Incorporating technology into our equipment solutions is another avenue through which we are enhancing our ability to support our customers’ greatest needs in food safety. Tim Steffensmeier, Vice President of Sales, said, “The technical sales team we have assembled has nearly 100 years of combined food and chemical industry experience. The varying experience and unique skillsets enables our team to be productive in business development, sales and marketing, new equipment solutions, and new product development and microbiology solutions.

The vision focuses on 'Grow the Core', 'Expand Margins', 'Champion Cash', and 'Explore for More'. Key leaders will discuss strategic priorities, financial objectives, and long-term goals. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Reynolds Consumer Products' Investor Day and the introduction of their 2030 Vision represent a strategic roadmap for the company's future growth and operational efficiency. The emphasis on organic volume growth and margin expansion through the 'Grow the Core' and 'Expand Margins' initiatives underscores a focus on sustainable product innovation and cost management. This is particularly relevant in the consumer products sector, where competition is fierce and margins can be thin. The 'Champion Cash' pillar indicates a prudent approach to capital management, potentially leading to improved liquidity and creditworthiness.From a market perspective, the 'Explore for More' pillar suggests that Reynolds is seeking to diversify its revenue streams, which could mitigate risks associated with market volatility. Additionally, the reaffirmation of Q1 and full-year 2024 guidance provides a level of predictability and confidence for investors, signaling management's belief in the company's stability and growth prospects. Considering the provided financial outlook, the projected net income and adjusted EBITDA figures suggest a healthy profitability margin, which is a positive indicator for potential investors. Financial Analyst Reynolds Consumer Products' financial algorithm and capital allocation framework, as presented by CFO Scott Huckins, are critical for evaluating the company's financial health and investment potential. The targeted net debt figures indicate a strategic approach to leverage, aiming to balance growth investments with financial stability. A reduction in net debt can lead to lower interest expenses and an improved debt-to-equity ratio, which is often viewed favorably by investors and credit rating agencies.The provided earnings per share (EPS) guidance for both Q1 and full year 2024 offers insight into the company's expected profitability and earnings growth. An EPS within the projected range would align with industry standards for a company of Reynolds' size and market position. The total shareholder return (TSR) drivers discussed will be of particular interest to investors, as they directly relate to the potential return on investment from both capital gains and dividends. Sustainability Analyst The introduction of sustainable new products, as part of the 'Grow the Core' initiative, is a response to increasing consumer demand for environmentally friendly options. This move not only caters to market trends but also positions Reynolds Consumer Products as a forward-thinking player in the industry. The focus on digital transformation within the 'Expand Margins' pillar can lead to improved operational efficiencies and reduced environmental impact through more streamlined processes.Investing in enabling technologies, as mentioned in the 'Explore for More' pillar, could further enhance sustainability efforts and operational efficiency, potentially leading to cost savings and a stronger competitive edge. This strategic focus on sustainability is not only beneficial for the environment but can also result in long-term cost savings and brand loyalty, which are important factors for the company's financial performance and stock valuation. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM Introduces 2030 Vision Reaffirms Q1 2024 and Full Year 2024 Guidance LAKE FOREST, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Reynolds Consumer Products Inc.

Forward Looking Statements This press release contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including our first quarter and fiscal year 2024 guidance. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “intends,” “outlook,” “forecast”, “position”, “committed,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “model”, “assumes,” “confident,” “look forward,” “potential” “on track”, or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us, may include projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and recovery of profitability, management of costs and other disruptions and other strategies, and anticipated trends in our business, including expected levels of commodity costs and volume. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the risk factors set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. For additional information on these and other factors that could cause our actual results to materially differ from those set forth herein, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. REYN-F Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP financial measures “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Net Debt” in evaluating our past results and future prospects. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus the sum of income tax expense, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude IPO and separation-related costs, as well as other non-recurring costs. We define Net Debt as the current portion of long-term debt plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions. In addition, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. We use Net Debt as we believe it is a more representative measure of our liquidity. Accordingly, we believe presenting these measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Guidance for fiscal year and first quarter 2024, where adjusted, is provided on a non-GAAP basis. The Company cannot reconcile its expected Net Debt at December 31, 2024 to expected total debt, or expected ratios involving Net Debt, without reasonable effort because certain items that impact total debt and other reconciling measures are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted at this time, to which unavailable information could have a significant impact on the Company’s GAAP financial results. Please see reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used in this release (with the exception of our December 31, 2024 Net Debt outlook, as described above) to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, beginning on the following page.

A special focus will be on the new Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) requirements and the associated benefits for patients and healthcare providers. This collaboration follows the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updating its guidelines for new TB screening requirements for immigrants to the United States. Together, QIAGEN and IPPA are committed to promoting the use of IGRA testing, such as QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON-TB Plus, to ensure a safe immigration process and support the global fight against TB. IPPA is a U.S.-based non-profit organization of physicians who are authorized to conduct immigration medical evaluations by governments of countries that receive migrants, including the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. “Our collaboration with IPPA enables us to raise awareness about the benefits of IGRA testing and support the U.S. national strategy to eliminate TB domestically by 2050. This partnership will lead to better detection of latent TB infection before departure for the United States and help identify immigrants who would benefit from preventive treatment,” said Fernando Beils, Senior Vice President and Head of the Molecular Diagnostics business area at QIAGEN. Alexandra Ortega, MPH, MCHES, Executive Director of the IPPA, said, “Working together with QIAGEN allows us to educate panel physicians on the latest TB screening requirements, ensuring patients receive the most accurate and efficient testing available. This partnership will play a crucial role in global efforts to combat TB.” The updated CDC guidelines now mandate that by October 1, 2024, all individuals aged above 2 years old from countries with a WHO-estimated TB incidence rate of more than 20 cases per 100,000 people will require an IGRA test as part of their U.S. immigrant visa medical exam, expanding from the previous requirement covering only children age 2 to 14. Additionally, in anticipation of World TB Day, QIAGEN is hosting a global CPD-accredited event on March 21, 2024, with top TB experts discussing the vital theme of “TB infection screening and preventive therapy for achieving End TB strategy goals”. The program will explore the global TB landscape, advances in testing and prevention, and screening of migrants. A panel discussion will address TB epidemiology, cost-effectiveness, and challenges faced by high-risk groups like migrants and children. Tuberculosis is a contagious bacterial infection spread primarily by coughing of patients with the active pulmonary form of the disease. The WHO estimated that there were more than 10 million new cases of active TB worldwide and 1.3 million deaths in 2022. One in four people worldwide are believed to have latent TB infections, with 5-10% of them expected at some point to develop active TB. Screening for latent TB infection is therefore essential in the effort to end TB. QIAGEN’s QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay accurately detects TB infection by identifying interferon-gamma released by T-cells in response to TB-specific antigens. This one-visit test outperforms the century‑old, two-visit TB skin test (TST), particularly for patients from high-TB-burden countries who have received BCG vaccination. The CDC and WHO endorse the use of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus to combat the global TB epidemic.

Negative None. Market Research Analyst HeartCore Enterprises' recent agreement with PharmaBio represents a strategic move within the enterprise software and consulting services industry. The arrangement, particularly with the inclusion of a warrant for 3% of PharmaBio's common stock, signifies a potential upside for HeartCore that extends beyond the initial and success fees. This type of deal structure is indicative of a confident outlook on PharmaBio's prospects and aligns with HeartCore's revenue diversification strategy.Moreover, the success of the 'Go IPO' service is a testament to HeartCore's growing influence in the U.S. IPO advisory market, especially among Japanese firms looking to list on major U.S. stock exchanges. The mention of a $9 million gain from a previous warrant sale underscores the financial impact of these services on HeartCore's bottom line. The cumulative effect of these deals could be substantial, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on HeartCore's stock valuation. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the deal's structure with PharmaBio is multifaceted. The $500,000 in initial fees and $300,000 in success fees are straightforward revenue streams that will bolster HeartCore's earnings in the short term. However, the warrant to acquire 3% of PharmaBio's stock introduces a variable component, tying HeartCore's future financial performance to that of PharmaBio post-IPO. The warrant is an instrument of equity interest that could lead to significant returns if PharmaBio's stock performs well after the listing.Investors should note that while this deal can enhance HeartCore's earnings and provide potential capital for M&A activities, it also introduces an element of risk. The actual value realized from the warrant is contingent on PharmaBio's market performance, which can be unpredictable. Stakeholders should weigh this risk against the potential for high returns when considering the long-term implications of such agreements. Legal Expert Legally, the agreement between HeartCore and PharmaBio is notable for the inclusion of a warrant. This element of the deal underscores the need for a thorough understanding of the legal implications of equity-based compensation in consulting arrangements. A warrant provides a right, but not an obligation, to purchase stock at a predetermined price, which can be a complex legal instrument. The success of this agreement from a legal standpoint will depend on the precise terms of the warrant, such as the exercise price and expiration date and how those terms align with the regulatory requirements for public offerings on exchanges like Nasdaq or NYSE.Furthermore, HeartCore's role in assisting PharmaBio with the IPO process, including the preparation of documentation and internal controls, highlights the importance of legal expertise in navigating the regulatory landscape of public listings. Compliance with SEC regulations and proper filing of the S-1 or F-1 is critical to avoid legal pitfalls that could delay or derail the IPO process. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK and TOKYO, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HeartCore Enterprises, Inc.

The company reacquired rights to MicroPine for pediatric myopia in the U.S. and Canada. Eyenovia advances commercial operations with Mydcombi™ launch, FDA approval of manufacturing facility, and copromotion agreement. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The FDA approval of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% is a significant milestone for Eyenovia, potentially expanding the company's product portfolio into the post-operative ophthalmic space. This approval could enhance the company's market share in the ophthalmic industry, as post-operative care is a critical phase in patient recovery and effective pain and inflammation management is highly valued by healthcare providers.Furthermore, Eyenovia's reacquisition of the rights to MicroPine for pediatric myopia in North America is a strategic move, considering the estimated market value of over $1 billion in the U.S. alone. If MicroPine successfully passes the Phase 3 clinical trials and gains FDA approval, it could become a significant revenue stream for the company, considering the current lack of FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for progressive pediatric myopia. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Eyenovia's net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023, though higher than the previous year, is not unexpected given the company's stage of development. The increase in R&D expenses by 84.6% reflects the company's investment in advancing its product pipeline, which could lead to long-term growth if these products reach the market successfully.However, investors should note the company's cash reserves of $14.8 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $22.9 million the previous year. This decrease in cash reserves could indicate a need for additional capital in the near future, especially to support the commercial launch of new products and the ongoing development of its pipeline, including the transition to the Gen-2 Optejet dispenser. Manufacturing and Supply Chain Specialist Eyenovia's FDA approval for its Redwood City manufacturing facility, alongside existing approvals for other facilities, is indicative of the company's commitment to securing a robust supply chain for its Mydcombi product. Ensuring manufacturing capabilities is a critical component for the commercial success of pharmaceutical products. By having multiple approved facilities, Eyenovia is mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions that could affect product availability and ultimately, revenue.The co-promotion agreement with NovaBay is also a strategic move to optimize the sales force and expand market reach for both companies' products. This kind of synergy can be beneficial in maximizing resources and tapping into established sales channels. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced FDA approval of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% for post-operative pain and inflammation following ocular surgery Reacquired development and commercialization rights to MicroPine for progressive pediatric myopia in the U.S. and Canada Continued to advance commercial operations with launch of Mydcombi™, FDA approval of manufacturing facility, onboarding of sales organization and signing of copromotion agreement Company to host conference call and webcast today, March 18th, at 4:30 pm ET NEW YORK, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eyenovia, Inc. (NASDAQ: EYEN), a commercial-stage ophthalmic company, today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Business Developments Announced FDA approval of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% (“clobetasol”) for the treatment of post-operative pain and inflammation following ocular surgery, which the company in-licensed from Formosa Pharmaceuticals for the U.S. With the transfer of the clobetasol NDA for this product to Eyenovia, the company is planning to launch in the second half of 2024 with its existing 10-person sales force.Reacquired the development and commercialization rights to MicroPine in the U.S. and Canada. MicroPine is currently being evaluated in the Phase 3 “CHAPERONE” clinical trial for pediatric progressive myopia. External sources have estimated the value of this market at over $1 billion dollars in the U.S., and of a similar size in China.Announced FDA approval for the Redwood City manufacturing facility. Along with approval of Coastline International in Mexico and Eyenovia’s facility in Reno, Nevada, the company is now the manufacturer of the finished Mydcombi product for commercial distribution.Hired, trained and deployed half of its planned 10-person field sales force, with the remainder set to join in the coming weeks.Signed an agreement with Vision Source, a large buying group consisting of optometrists throughout North America, to offer Mydcombi as an approved product to its member offices.Announced a co-promotion agreement with NovaBay whereby NovaBay will promote clobetasol through its sales channels, and Eyenovia will promote NovaBay’s prescription Avenova Antimicrobial Lid & Lash Solution through its field sales force. Michael Rowe, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During the fourth quarter and subsequent period, we continued to execute on our corporate strategy that we initiated just a few quarters ago. FDA approval of clobetasol propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.05% gives us access to a large-market indication that is complementary to Mydcombi and allows us to add additional value to eye doctors using our existing field sales force. Additionally, our recent decision to reacquire the development and commercialization rights to MicroPine expands our pipeline with a potential blockbuster drug, if approved. With the CHAPERONE study in our hands, we plan to engage with FDA later this year to explore ways to expedite its development. “At the same time, we made significant progress building out our manufacturing capabilities, with FDA approval of both our Redwood City facility as well as our contract manufacturer, Coastline International. These capabilities, together with our facility in Reno, provide us the capacity to manufacture commercial supply of Mydcombi while at the same time supporting both current and future development partnerships as well as our transition from the Gen-1 to Gen-2 Optejet dispenser, beginning with Mydcombi later this year. “We also continue to work on ways to increase uptake of Mydcombi including acceptance of our product by Vision Source, a leading group buying organization supporting optometrists throughout the United States, as well as with formulary wins at ophthalmic surgical institutions. And looking longer term, we see many opportunities to leverage the Optejet through additional collaboration and co-development agreements in high-value indications, including dry eye, which we estimate to be a three-billion-dollar annual market opportunity in the U.S. alone. “Overall, I am extremely pleased with our progress and our current momentum as we successfully transition to a commercial-stage, revenue generating leader in topical ophthalmic medications,” Mr. Rowe concluded. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Financial Review For the fourth quarter of 2023, net loss was approximately $8.0 million, or $0.18 per share. This includes a $0.02 per share loss related to a one-time event for the repatriation of the rights to MicroPine. In 2022, our net loss was $6.1 million, or $0.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full-year 2023, net loss was approximately $27.3 million, or $0.66 per share on approximately 41.0 million shares outstanding, and this compares to a net loss of $28.0 million, or $0.83 per share, on approximately 33.6 million weighted average shares outstanding, for the full year 2022. Research and development expenses totaled approximately $4.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately 84.6%. For the full-year 2023, research and development expenses were $13.0 million, a decrease of 3.0% as compared to $13.4 million for the full-year 2022. The decrease was driven primarily by lower direct clinical and non-clinical expenses, as well as deferral of costs related to future delivery of clinical supply to our partners. For the fourth quarter of 2023, general and administrative expenses were approximately $3.4 million, compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of approximately 7.3%. For the full-year 2023, general and administrative expenses were $12.4 million, a decrease of 8.1% as compared to $13.5 million for the full-year 2022. The full year decrease was driven by reduction in legal expenses and executive recruitment cost year over year. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately $7.5 million, compared to approximately $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This represents an increase of approximately 39.0%. Total operating expenses for the full-year 2023 were $25.4 million, representing a decrease of 5.6% versus $26.9 million for the full-year 2022. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were approximately $14.8 million, as compared to $22.9 million in unrestricted and restricted cash as of December 31, 2022.

The company reported an operating loss of $2.1 million and a consolidated net loss of $1.4 million. Despite challenges, RF Industries remains optimistic about future growth opportunities. Positive RF Industries reported a 15.2% decrease in net sales to $13.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. The company's gross profit margin was 24.5%, down from 27.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. RF Industries faced an operating loss of $2.1 million, primarily due to lower sales volume and reduced contribution from higher margin products. The consolidated net loss for RF Industries was $1.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $1.1 million, down from income of $78,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. RF Industries successfully refinanced its outstanding term loan with a new asset-based revolver with a new lender. The company's backlog increased to $19.3 million, showing potential for future growth. RF Industries promoted Ray Bibisi to President, recognizing his contributions to the company's operational enhancements. Despite challenges in fiscal 2023, RF Industries remains optimistic about future growth and profitability. Negative Net sales decreased by 15.2% to $13.5 million, reflecting a challenging sales environment. The company reported an operating loss of $2.1 million, indicating financial struggles. Consolidated net loss was $1.4 million, highlighting financial difficulties. Adjusted EBITDA showed a loss of $1.1 million, a significant decline from the previous year. RF Industries' gross profit margin decreased to 24.5%, impacting overall profitability. Market Research Analyst RF Industries' reported decrease in net sales and the subsequent operating loss reflect a broader trend in the interconnect products and systems industry, where capital expenditure cycles can greatly affect company performance. The reported 15.2% quarterly and 26.6% year-over-year decline in sales signals a contraction that investors should monitor closely, as it may indicate a cooling period in the industry or loss of market share to competitors.The backlog increase is a positive sign, suggesting potential revenue growth in future quarters. However, the lower gross profit margin points to cost pressures or a shift in sales mix towards lower-margin products, which could impact profitability. Investors might consider the implications of the company's refinancing efforts, which could improve financial flexibility but also may increase interest expenses. Financial Analyst The shift from a net loss of $1.2 million to $1.4 million, alongside a significant change in non-GAAP net loss from $25,000 to $590,000, suggests that RF Industries is facing underlying financial challenges that are not solely attributable to seasonal trends. This deterioration in financial health, coupled with a reduced gross profit margin, might raise concerns over the company's cost management and pricing power.From an investment perspective, the adjusted EBITDA swing from a modest income to a loss of $1.1 million could be seen as a red flag, indicating that the company's core operations are currently not generating positive cash flow. The refinance of the term loan with an asset-based revolver may provide temporary relief but does not address the fundamental issues of declining sales and profitability. Economist The reported financial results of RF Industries must be contextualized within the current economic climate. The reduced capital spend mentioned by the CEO may be reflective of a wider economic slowdown or cautious investment behavior among their client base, particularly in the tech and telecommunications sectors. While the increase in backlog suggests an eventual uptick in demand, the timing and realization of these orders are uncertain and may be influenced by macroeconomic factors.Additionally, the reference to operational initiatives and supply chain enhancements in the management commentary suggests a strategic pivot aimed at cost reduction and operational efficiency. This can be a double-edged sword; while it may lead to lower operating expenses, it could also result in short-term disruptions and potential long-term risks if not managed effectively. 03/18/2024 - 04:03 PM SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 18, 2024 / RF Industries, Ltd. (NASDAQ:RFIL), a national manufacturer and marketer of interconnect products and systems, today announced first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial results for the quarter ended January 31, 2024.First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights and Operating Results:Net sales were $13.5 million; down 15.2% from $15.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and down 26.6% from $18.3 million in the prior-year quarter.Backlog of $16.2 million at the end of the first quarter on bookings of $13.6 million. As of today, the backlog stands at $19.3 million.Gross profit margin was 24.5% compared to 27.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily related to the decrease in sales.Operating loss was $2.1 million, down $916,000 from the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower contribution from higher margin products, offset by lower operating expenses in the first quarter 2024.Consolidated net loss was $1.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net loss of $1.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Non-GAAP net loss was $590,000 or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $25,000, or $0.00 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Adjusted EBITDA loss was $1.1 million down from income of $78,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.The Company successfully refinanced the outstanding term loan with a new asset-based revolver with a new lender.See ""Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,"" ""Unaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Net Loss"" and ""Unaudited Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA"" below for additional information.Management Commentary""The challenging environment of reduced capital spend that we dealt with throughout fiscal 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024. While our first quarter has always been seasonally our slowest period, our results were lower than we anticipated primarily due to customer shipments and orders that were delayed but not cancelled. Despite this, we are encouraged that many projects, which have been in the sales pipeline for several quarters, began to convert into purchase orders in February,"" said Robert Dawson, Chief Executive Officer of RF Industries.""Even better, this increase in new orders is primarily high-value products like our DAC thermal cooling solutions and small cell shrouds being purchased by multiple customers in the Tier 1 Wireless Carrier Ecosystem. All of this renewed activity has led to a substantial increase of $3.1 million to our backlog, which now stands at $19.3 million. The improving order flow and backlog give us confidence that we should see improving results going forward.""Dawson continued, ""On another positive note, we recently announced the promotion of Ray Bibisi to President of RFI. Since joining the Company in 2020, Ray has been an integral part of RFI's transformation to a next-generation communication solutions provider. Ray drove key operational initiatives including major facility relocations and supply chain enhancements, which led to significant expense reductions. In his new role, Ray will work with me and expand his daily impact while aligning and integrating our go-to-market functions across all business units and product areas.""""Regardless of a challenging fiscal 2023 that interrupted our upward growth trajectory of six years, we are proud of our track record of delivering attractive growth and profitability. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond, I am optimistic about our future prospects. The progress we made in 2023 to become a leaner and more efficient operation will have a meaningful impact on profitability as carrier spending normalizes and we work to return to sales and profitable growth,"" concluded Dawson.Conference Call and WebcastRF Industries will host a conference call and live webcast today, March 18, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1:30 p.m. Pacific Time) to discuss its fiscal 2024 first quarter financial results.

Please visit the RF Industries website at www.rfindustries.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to future events. Forward looking statements include, among others, statements concerning our expectations about profitability, revenues, industry trends, markets and demand for our products, current and future purchase orders, and the expected benefits and desirability of our products, in each case which are subject to a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: the Company's cash and liquidity needs, ability to continue as a going concern, non-compliance with terms and covenants in our credit facility, changes in the telecommunications industry and materialization and timing of expected network buildouts; timing and breadth of new products; our ability to realize increased sales; successfully integrating new products and teams; our ability to execute on its go-to-market strategies and channel models; our reliance on certain distributors and customers for a significant portion of anticipated revenues; the impact of existing and additional future tariffs imposed by U.S. and foreign nations; our ability to expand our OEM relationships; our ability to continue to deliver newly designed and custom fiber optic and cabling products to principal customers; our ability to maintain strong margins and diversify our customer base; our ability to initiate operating efficiencies, cost savings and expense reductions; our ability to address the changing needs of the market and capitalize on new market opportunities; our ability to add value to our customer's needs; the success of any product launches; and our ability to increase revenue, gross margins or obtain profitability in a timely manner. Further discussion of these and other potential risks and uncertainties may be found in the Company's public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (www.sec.gov) including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements are based upon information available to the Company on the date they are published, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or new information after the date of this release.Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresTo supplement our unaudited condensed financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release and the accompanying tables and the related earnings conference call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP earnings per share, basic and diluted (non-GAAP EPS).We believe these financial measures provide useful information to investors with which to analyze our operating trends and performance by excluding certain non-cash and other one-time expenses that we believe are not indicative of our operating results.In computing Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP EPS, we exclude stock-based compensation expense, which represents non-cash charges for the fair value of stock options and other non-cash awards granted to employees, non-cash and other lease charges, and severance. For Adjusted EBITDA, we also exclude depreciation, amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions, and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude non-cash expense and non-recurring costs and expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision-making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.Our Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP EPS measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Our Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP EPS are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating or net income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider these non-GAAP measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to limitations and should be read only in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements pre-pared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that these non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our GAAP results of operations. We compensate for the limitations of non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance. A reconciliation of specific adjustments to GAAP results is provided in the last two tables at the end of this press release.RF Industries Contact:Peter YinSVP and CFO(858) 549-6340rfi@rfindustries.comIR Contact:Margaret BoyceFinancial Profiles, Inc.(310) 622-8247RFIL@finprofiles.com# # #RF INDUSTRIES, LTD.

The conference call and webcast are scheduled for today, Monday March 18, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT. DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN), an artificial intelligence (“AI”) company developing targeted and transformative cancer therapies using its proprietary RADR® AI and machine learning (“ML”) platform with multiple clinical-stage drug programs, today announced operational highlights and financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. “This past quarter and the entire year of 2023 was a period of meaningful and remarkable progress for our programs and our AI platform at Lantern Pharma. Our team demonstrated how combining emerging AI technologies, cancer biology models and experiments, chemical, molecular, and multiomic biomarker data, along with large-scale patient data holds the promise of transforming timelines and costs in drug development for oncology. We are very enthusiastic about 2024 and will be actively focused on meeting and possibly exceeding the milestones ahead of us, which include potential initial data from our LP-184 Phase 1A trial; advancing the new company born from AI – Starlight Therapeutics, which is focused wholly on CNS cancers; and progressing our ADC oncology program,” said Panna Sharma, President and CEO of Lantern Pharma. Sharma continued, “Computational and AI-driven approaches are increasing their value-driving impact on oncology drug development, and our team continues to increase the capabilities and usefulness of our platform while also helping to de-risk and sharpen the focus of our existing clinical drug candidates. Our leadership in the innovative use of AI and machine learning to transform costs and timelines in the development of precision oncology therapies has guided three drug development programs in active clinical trials. We believe this pace of development with our focused team and resources should yield significant future benefits for investors and patients as our industry matures, adopts and accepts a data and AI-centric approach to drug development.” Highlights of AI-Powered Pipeline: LP-284 – Launched the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial with LP-284 targeting recurrent non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) and other cancers. Lantern also announced recently that initial patients had been dosed in the LP-284 clinical trial. LP-284 has shown nanomolar potency across multiple published in vitro and in vivo studies, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), double hit lymphoma (DHL), and other advanced NHL cancer subtypes with DNA damage response deficiencies, notably those with compromised functioning of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene due to mutations or deletions. Nearly all MCL, DHL, and High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma (HGBL) patients relapse from the current standard-of-care agents and there is an urgent and unmet need for novel improved therapeutic options for these patients. In the US and Europe, MCL, DHL, and HGBLs are diagnosed in 16,000-20,000 patients each year and have an estimated annual market potential of over USD 3+ billion. LP-184 – Several cohorts of patients have been dosed in the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial – a first-in-human Phase 1 basket trial across multiple solid tumor indications that are advanced and refractory to existing standard-of-care therapies. The trial is enrolling patients that have relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumors, such as pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma (GBM), brain metastases (brain mets.), lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and multiple other solid tumor types with DNA damage response deficiencies. Lantern expects to continue Phase 1A enrollment throughout the first half of 2024 across a growing number of US clinical trial sites, including Fox Chase Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Medicine, and other leading centers, with the potential for an initial readout in Phase 1A during late summer or early fall. The dosage and safety data obtained in the Phase 1A trial are expected to be used to advance the central nervous system (CNS) indications for a future Phase 1b/2 trial to be sponsored by Lantern’s wholly owned subsidiary, Starlight Therapeutics. Additionally, AI and preclinical studies are ongoing to further refine drug combination studies supporting the use of LP-184 to improve the durability of response and/or the overall response rates in combination with FDA approved drugs that are widely used in cancer treatment. Globally, the aggregate annual market potential of LP-184’s target indications is estimated to be approximately $12+ billion, consisting of $4.5+ billion for CNS cancers and $7.5+ billion for solid tumors. LP-300 – Twelve sites for the Phase 2 Harmonic™ trial have been activated in the US, and 3 Asian countries are in various phases of regulatory allowance for clinical trial commencement. This strategy should increase the potential for dosing additional patients in the Phase 2 Harmonic™ trial during 2024, which should help address the patient enrollment challenges Harmonic™ has faced in the US. In these Asian countries, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the incidence of never-smokers with NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) is double or higher than that of patients in the US. The Harmonic trial is assessing the effect of LP-300 in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy in never-smoker patients with relapsed NSCLC. Globally, never-smokers with NSCLC are a growing population of patients and do not respond well to PD-1/PD-L1-based therapies, leaving them with reduced treatment options. In the US, there are approximately 20,000-40,000 never-smokers with NSCLC diagnosed annually, representing an estimated US annual market potential of $1.5 billion and a global estimated annual market potential of over $2.6 billion. Additional information on the Harmonic™ trial can be found at the Harmonic™ website and clinicaltrials.gov. RADR® Platform Growth and Development: RADR® continues to advance in size, scope, and capabilities and is also progressing towards becoming a standard for AI-driven drug development in oncology – for both early-stage development and later-stage patient biomarker and combination therapy identification. RADR® has now surpassed 60+ billion oncology-focused datapoints and is projected to reach over 100 billion datapoints by the end of 2024. The scope of RADR®’s data has broadened with a strategic focus on additional classes of compounds, detailed data on chemical and biochemical features and drug-interaction data. Additionally, data from clinical studies such as those being obtained from liquid biopsy, and data from preclinical combination studies that aim to define drug interaction and optimal dosage are being incorporated into the datapoints and data sets powering RADR®. Lantern will potentially focus additional data growth efforts of the RADR® platform on: drug sensitivity data, combination treatment outcome data, and biomarker data in rare cancers, and on emerging synthetic lethal targets that are aimed at accelerating the development of new therapies for Lantern and its partners. Additionally, the RADR® platform's generative AI capabilities, focusing on molecular optimization and automated feature extraction to improve understanding and prediction of molecular dynamics, safety, and drug-drug interactions are planned to increase in functionality and scope in the coming quarters. Starlight Therapeutics: In Q1 2023, Lantern formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Starlight Therapeutics Inc. (“Starlight”), for the clinical development of drug candidate LP-184’s central nervous system (CNS) and brain cancer indications – including GBM, brain mets., and several rare pediatric CNS cancers. Starlight will refer to the molecule LP-184, as it is developed in CNS indications, as “STAR-001”. Lantern recently recruited a Starlight Chief Medical Officer who will focus on Starlight’s clinical trials, development of personnel to execute on the planned clinical strategy and overall support in corporate development activity. Starlight and Lantern plan on initiating Phase 1B/2 clinical trials during the second half of 2024. The market potential for the currently planned indications for Starlight’s synthetically-lethal, cancer-cell DNA damaging agent – STAR-001 – is estimated to be $4.5 billion to $5+ billion USD across both adult and pediatric primary and secondary CNS cancers. ADC Program: Lantern, in collaboration with academic research partners, has advanced the development, synthesis, and preclinical proof-of-concept of a novel, highly potent, cryptophycin-based ADC (cpADC). The cpADC has shown picomolar potency in a wide range of solid tumors tested in preclinical development and is being further evaluated for clinical potential in six solid tumor indications. In preclinical work, the cpADC produced an 80% cancer cell kill rate which is more than other ADC drug payloads, including in a cancer sub-type, medium HER-2 expression cancers, which is an unmet and critical patient need. Lantern leveraged RADR®, a proprietary AI platform for oncology drug development, for target selection and molecular payload characterization in ADCs, and a unique, controlled conjugation approach for maximizing drug-to-antibody ratios while controlling for non-specific conjugation. Lantern expects to move towards IND development of the ADC program during 2024 with a focus on select solid tumors that are unresponsive or refractory to current therapies. Additional Operational Highlights: During the 4th quarter of 2023, Lantern filed 3 new patent applications culminating in 11 new patent applications for the calendar year 2023. Lantern was awarded its fifth orphan drug designation by the FDA during the fourth quarter of 2023 relating to LP-284 in High Grade B-Cell Lymphoma (HGBL) HGBL represents a rare and aggressive form of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) with no established standard of care treatment approach. Typically, frontline intervention involves a combination of chemo-immunotherapies such as R-CHOP or DA-R-EPOCH. However, approximately 20-30% of HGBL patients stop responding to these therapeutic agents and continue cancer progression. For those with relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease, the survival prognosis is 8.6 to 16 months. The other 4 FDA granted orphan designations, include 3 for LP-184 in High Grade Gliomas (including GBM), Pancreatic Cancer, and Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumors (ATRT), and another for LP-284 in Mantle Cell Lymphoma. New data and scientific findings will be presented for LP-284 at AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) during the 2024 Annual Meeting in San Diego from April 5 to 10.

Financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 showing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and net loss. Negative None. Biotech Equity Analyst The recent update from Adverum Biotechnologies regarding their LUNA Phase 2 trial of Ixo-vec for wet AMD has significant implications for the company's valuation and investor sentiment. The reported reduction in anti-VEGF injections and the percentage of patients not requiring supplemental injections suggest a strong efficacy profile. This could position Ixo-vec as a competitive product in the wet AMD market, which is currently dominated by frequent and costly injections. The safety profile appears favorable, which is critical for patient compliance and market acceptance.The completion of a $127.5 million private placement financing is a positive signal to the market, indicating institutional confidence in Adverum's pipeline. The financing at a 20% premium to the volume-weighted average price also reflects the perceived value of the company's assets. This cash injection extends the company's runway, reducing near-term financial risk and allowing investors to focus on the clinical development milestones.The approval of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split is a strategic move often aimed at increasing the stock price to meet exchange listing requirements and improve perception. However, it can also dilute existing shareholders and may not have the desired long-term effect if the underlying business concerns are not addressed. Medical Research Analyst The preliminary data from the LUNA trial suggests that Ixo-vec could be a transformative treatment for wet AMD, potentially reducing the treatment burden significantly. The 90% and 94% reductions in annualized anti-VEGF injections are particularly noteworthy, as current treatments can be burdensome for patients. Maintaining or improving mean Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) and Central Subfield Thickness (CST) are key indicators of efficacy in ocular therapies and will be closely monitored by clinicians.Long-term data from the OPTIC trial showing sustained aflibercept levels and reduced injection frequency over three years provide additional support for the durability of Ixo-vec's effect. This could lead to a paradigm shift in treatment, moving from chronic management to a more sustained approach, potentially improving patient quality of life and reducing healthcare costs.The absence of serious adverse events related to Ixo-vec is encouraging, but it is important to remain cautious until more comprehensive safety data are available. Intraocular inflammation is a known risk with ocular gene therapies and being responsive to corticosteroids is a positive sign, but long-term surveillance will be key to understanding the full safety profile. Healthcare Financial Analyst The financial results show a decrease in research and development expenses, which can be attributed to more efficient trial management and possibly a strategic narrowing of focus within the company's pipeline. The reduction in general and administrative expenses, through decreased facilities costs and increased sublease income, indicates a leaner operation, which is often welcomed by investors seeking efficient capital allocation.However, the reported net loss of $23.7 million underscores the high costs associated with biotech R&D and the importance of the recent financing in maintaining operational stability. The pro forma cash position suggests a healthy buffer for the company, but it is critical for investors to monitor the burn rate and the progress of clinical trials to gauge the likelihood of additional financing needs or a potential partnership or acquisition. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM - Preliminary LUNA data presented at the Annual Meeting of the Macula Society support potential best-in-class clinical activity and an encouraging safety profile in patients with wet AMD - - Completed $127.5 million private placement financing with new and existing institutional investors - - Cash runway expected into late 2025 – - 1-for-10 reverse stock split to be effective March 21, 2024 - REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: ADVM), a clinical-stage company pioneering the use of gene therapy as a new standard of care for highly prevalent ocular diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The company also provided recent pipeline highlights and corporate updates. “We have made tremendous progress during 2023 and in 2024 to date in our development of Ixo-vec as a durable potential gene therapy treatment for the millions of patients suffering from wet AMD,” stated Laurent Fischer, M.D., president and chief executive officer of Adverum Biotechnologies. “We were pleased to present at Macula Society preliminary data from our ongoing LUNA Phase 2 trial of Ixo-vec, which demonstrated potentially best-in-class clinical activity at both the 2E11 and 6E10 doses of Ixo-vec, with the data trending similar to, or better than, the data in our first-in-human OPTIC trial. Importantly, the preliminary data demonstrated that Ixo-vec was generally well tolerated. We look forward to presenting the 26-week interim analysis of our LUNA Phase 2 program in mid-2024.” Dr. Fischer continued, “In the lead-up to the data presentation at Macula Society, Adverum completed a $127.5 million private placement financing with new and existing investors that we expect to meaningfully extend our cash runway into late 2025, well beyond the anticipated presentation of topline 52-week data from our ongoing LUNA Phase 2 trial. In parallel, we are continuing to interact with regulators in the U.S. and E.U. to inform Phase 3 development of Ixo-vec, which we plan to initiate in the first half of 2025.” Ixo-Vec Program Highlights: Preliminary Ixo-vec LUNA Trial Data at Macula Society 2024: In February 2024, we announced positive preliminary efficacy and safety data from the ongoing LUNA Phase 2 trial of Ixo-vec in patients with wet AMD at the 47th Annual Meeting of the Macula Society in Palm Springs, California.LUNA patients treated with either the 2E11 or 6E10 dose of Ixo-vec experienced potentially best-in-class reduction in annualized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections and the percentage of patients receiving no supplemental injections through 26 weeks. Patients at the 2E11 and 6E10 doses had mean 90% and 94% reductions, respectively, in annualized anti-VEGF injections.85% and 68% of patients at the 2E11 and 6E10 doses, respectively, received no supplemental injections through 26 weeks. Maintained or improved mean BCVA and mean CST at both dose levels.Ixo-vec continued to be generally well tolerated, with cases of intraocular inflammation responsive to local corticosteroids.No Ixo-vec related serious adverse events, episcleritis, vasculitis, retinitis, choroiditis, vascular occlusion or hypotony were reported. Long-Term Ixo-vec OPTIC Trial Data at AAO 2023: In November 2023, the company announced 3-year data from the OPTIC extension study of patients with wet AMD during the Retina Subspecialty Day at the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) 2023 Annual Meeting in San Francisco, California.Patients in the OPTIC extension trial continue to experience long-term benefit from Ixo-vec through 3 years of follow-up, including maintenance of vision, durability of anatomic improvements and sustained reduction in anti-VEGF treatment burden. Patients at the 2E11 dose had an 84% reduction in annualized anti-VEGF injections, with 53% of the participants at the 2E11 dose receiving zero supplemental injections through three years.Aflibercept protein levels have been sustained through follow-up, which is up to 4.5 years post-treatment.BCVA was maintained and CST was improved through 3 years. Ixo-vec was generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse event being dose-dependent inflammation that was responsive to topical corticosteroids. Corporate Updates: Approval of 1-for-10 reverse stock split: On March 8, the Board of Directors approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock. The Company's common stock will begin trading on a reverse stock split-adjusted basis on March 21, 2024. Following the reverse stock split, there will be approximately 20.8 million shares of the company’s common stock outstanding.$127.5 Million Private Placement Financing: In February 2024, the Company completed a private placement of 106.25 million shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof) to a select group of institutional and accredited healthcare specialist investors at a price of $1.20 per share, representing a premium of approximately 20% to Adverum’s 30-day volume-weighted average price. The financing was led by TCGX with participation from new and existing investors including 5AM Ventures, Commodore Capital, Frazier Life Sciences, Logos Capital, Samsara BioCapital, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners and Vivo Capital, as well as two large investment management firms.

About Wet Age-Related Macular DegenerationWet AMD, also known as neovascular AMD or nAMD, is a VEGF driven advanced form of AMD affecting approximately 10% of patients living with AMD associated with the build-up of fluid in the macula and the retina. Wet AMD is a leading cause of blindness in people over 65 years of age, with approximately 20 million individuals worldwide living with this condition. New cases of wet AMD are expected to grow significantly worldwide as populations age. AMD is expected to impact 288 million people worldwide by 2040, with wet AMD accounting for approximately 10% of those cases. Additionally, wet AMD is a bilateral disease, and incidence of nAMD in the second eye is up to 42% in the first two to three years. The current standard of care requires frequent life-long repeated bolus injections of anti-VEGF in the eye. IVT gene therapy has the promise to preserve vision and reduce most or all injections for the life of the patient by delivering stable therapeutic levels of anti-VEGF to control macular fluid. About Ixo-vec in Wet AMDAdverum is developing ixoberogene soroparvovec (Ixo-vec, formerly referred to as ADVM-022), its clinical-stage gene therapy product candidate, for the treatment of wet AMD. Ixo-vec utilizes a proprietary vector capsid, AAV.7m8, carrying an aflibercept coding sequence under the control of a proprietary expression cassette. Unlike other ophthalmic gene therapies that require surgery to administer the gene therapy under the retina (sub-retinal approach), Ixo-vec is designed to be administered as a one-time IVT injection in the physician’s office, deliver long-term efficacy, reduce the burden of frequent anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, optimize patient compliance and improve vision outcomes for patients with wet AMD. In recognition of the need for new treatment options for wet AMD, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted Fast Track designation for Ixo-vec for the treatment of wet AMD. Ixo-vec has also received PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency and the Innovation Passport from the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of wet AMD. About Adverum BiotechnologiesAdverum Biotechnologies (NASDAQ: ADVM) is a clinical-stage company that aims to establish gene therapy as a new standard of care for highly prevalent ocular diseases with the aspiration of developing functional cures to restore vision and prevent blindness. Leveraging the capabilities of its proprietary intravitreal (IVT) platform, Adverum is developing durable, single-administration therapies, designed to be delivered in physicians’ offices, to eliminate the need for frequent ocular injections to treat these diseases. Adverum is evaluating its novel gene therapy candidate, ixoberogene soroparvovec (Ixo-vec, formerly referred to as ADVM-022), as a one-time, IVT injection for patients with neovascular or wet age-related macular degeneration. Additionally, by overcoming the challenges associated with current treatment paradigms for debilitating ocular diseases, Adverum aspires to transform the standard of care, preserve vision, and create a profound societal impact around the globe.

Synthetic Psilocybin Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Psyence Biomedical welcomes a study showing nature-derived psilocybin may be more therapeutic than synthetic, with potent effects on neuroplasticity. The study, published in Molecular Psychiatry, highlights potential benefits for Palliative Care patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The findings from the Hebrew University study on nature-derived psilocybin present a significant advancement in the field of psychedelic medicine. The potential of a more potent effect on neuroplasticity could be a game-changer for treatments involving mental health, particularly in the palliative care sector. The concept of neuroplasticity is central to understanding how the brain adapts and heals and a substance that can enhance this process might offer substantial benefits for patients with life-limiting diagnoses.Furthermore, the mention of 'the entourage effect' suggests that a combination of molecules found in natural psilocybin could lead to better therapeutic outcomes. This is analogous to findings in cannabinoid research, where the combination of various compounds in the cannabis plant is believed to provide superior effects compared to isolated compounds. If similar principles apply to psilocybin, Psyence Biomed's focus on a nature-derived product could differentiate their treatment options and potentially lead to a more effective therapy. Healthcare Economist The projected growth of the U.S. Palliative Care market to $28.6 billion by 2030 indicates a substantial economic opportunity for companies like Psyence Biomed. The economic implications of introducing an effective, nature-derived psilocybin therapy could be profound, not only in terms of market share but also in the potential to reduce healthcare costs. The report from the Journal of Clinical Oncology underscores the cost-saving benefits of palliative care, showing an 18.7% decrease in hospitalizations.Considering the cost implications of Adjustment Disorder in the context of life-limiting illnesses, an effective treatment could alleviate the financial burden on the healthcare system. The potential to improve patient quality of life while simultaneously reducing healthcare costs makes this development of interest to stakeholders across the healthcare value chain, from patients and providers to payers and investors. Oncology Psychotherapist Adjustment Disorder is a prevalent and distressing condition for patients facing life-limiting diagnoses, such as cancer. The integration of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in palliative care could represent a substantial improvement in the management of psychological distress in these patients. The therapeutic model of combining psychedelics with psychotherapy is gaining traction and evidence suggesting that nature-derived psilocybin could offer enhanced benefits adds to the potential of this treatment approach.Psyence Biomed's upcoming Phase llb clinical trial will be closely watched by the oncology community for its implications on patient care. If successful, this could lead to a paradigm shift in how emotional and psychological support is provided to patients with life-limiting conditions, potentially setting a new standard in palliative care practices. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM The study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, suggests that nature-derived psilocybin may be demonstrably more therapeutic than its synthetic analog Benefits are thought to include a more potent and prolonged effect on neuroplasticity NEW YORK, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Psyence Biomedical Ltd. (Nasdaq:PBM) (""Psyence Biomed"" or the ""Company"") today issued a statement welcoming the results of a recent study finding evidence that nature-derived psilocybin may be demonstrably more therapeutic than synthetic psilocybin. Published on February 20, 2024, in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, the study was conducted by a research team from Hebrew University, and supervised by Professor Bernard Lerer, MD, Executive Director of the Hadassah Brain Labs and Center for Psychedelic Research. The study presents evidence that nature (mushroom)-derived psilocybin delivers a “more potent and prolonged effect” on “neuroplasticity” than its synthetic analog. “Neuroplasticity” is increasingly recognized as the gold standard by which the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic pharmaceutical medicines can be measured. The study in mice also suggests that a potential combination of molecules that the study refers to as “the entourage effect” may provide “enhanced or prolonged therapeutic effects” not found in synthetic psilocybin. Dr. Neil Maresky, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Psyence Biomed, the first Nasdaq-traded botanical (non-synthetic) psilocybin biopharma company, stated, “This evidence-based and independent finding affirms Psyence Biomed’s pioneering commitment to nature-derived psilocybin and developing an FDA-approved, nature-derived psilocybin therapeutic for Palliative Care.” Palliative Care is a holistic and integrative medical specialty that provides patients who have received a life-limiting diagnosis with treatment for their emotional, physical, or spiritual distress or discomfort. Proprietary research suggests that the U.S. Palliative Care market is projected to grow to $28.6 billion in 2030. While most psychedelic companies research synthetic psilocybin, Psyence Biomed stands alone as the only Nasdaq traded biopharmaceutical company to research a nature-derived psilocybin candidate to treat Adjustment Disorder in the context of Palliative Care. Psyence Biomed has recently received ethics approval for the trial protocol for its Phase llb clinical trial to move forward. It is expected that the first patients will be randomized in the second quarter of 2024, with topline results available in 2025. The Psyence Biomed study will examine the use of nature-derived psilocybin as a treatment for Adjustment Disorder due to a recent cancer diagnosis in the Palliative Care context. Adjustment Disorder is a serious condition affecting approximately 19% of patients with a life-limiting diagnosis. It severely impacts the quality of life for patients, their families and caregivers, and regularly ranks among the top seven psychiatric diagnoses in the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr. Maresky added, “Developing therapies such as psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, which may reduce patients’ stress and anxiety and result in better quality of life as they navigate a cancer diagnosis, can be very impactful. With psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, there is an opportunity to both improve patient quality of life while also reducing health care costs associated with Palliative Care.” Palliative Care is also increasingly recognized by the oncology community as a solution to stretching scarce health care resources. According to a separate report this month in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the ASCO journal, “Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that Palliative Care can improve quality of life and survival for outpatients with advanced cancer.” The JCO study found that with Palliative Care, hospitalizations decreased 18.7%. Neither Psyence Biomedical nor any of its investors or affiliates funded or in any way sponsored the Hebrew University study.

Raised $47 million in net proceeds from recent financing, extending cash runway into the second half of 2025. Negative None. Biotech Equity Research Analyst The recent financial update and clinical progress report from Tenaya Therapeutics provides a mixed outlook for investors. The company's end-of-year cash position of $104.6 million, bolstered by an additional $46.5 million from a follow-on offering, suggests a stable financial runway into the second half of 2025. This is a positive indicator, as it implies that Tenaya can continue its research and development efforts without the immediate need for further capital raising, which could dilute current shareholders' stakes.However, the reported net loss of $124.1 million for the year, equating to $1.68 per share, reflects the high costs associated with the R&D of novel therapies. While these figures are not uncommon in the biotech sector, where upfront investment is significant before any potential product revenue, they do highlight the inherent risks and long-term nature of biotech investments.Investors should note the progress in clinical trials, as the advancement of TN-201 and TN-401 into Phase 1b trials could be pivotal for the company's future. The FDA's Fast Track Designation for TN-401 is particularly noteworthy, as it may expedite the review process and potentially lead to an earlier market entry if clinical outcomes are positive. The focus on gene therapies for heart disease also taps into a high-need medical area, which could lead to significant market opportunities if successful treatments are developed. Medical Research Analyst The therapeutic areas targeted by Tenaya's pipeline, particularly MYBPC3-associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) and PKP2-associated Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), represent conditions with significant unmet medical needs. The use of gene therapy as a one-time treatment offers a potentially transformative approach compared to current management options, which are largely symptomatic and do not address the genetic root of the disease.The interim results indicating low levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to AAV9 in the majority of MYBPC3-associated HCM patients are promising. This increases the potential patient population that could benefit from TN-201, as preexisting immunity can be a barrier to the effectiveness of gene therapies using viral vectors like AAV9. The combination of HDAC6 inhibition with empagliflozin in HFpEF models also represents an innovative approach, as current HFpEF treatments are limited and do not significantly improve long-term outcomes.However, the true value of these therapies will only be understood upon the release of clinical data. The initial safety, biopsy and biomarker data expected in the second half of 2024 for TN-201 will be critical for investors and the medical community to assess the viability of this treatment approach. Until then, the investment in Tenaya remains speculative, with the potential for high reward tempered by the risk inherent in early-stage clinical development. Financial Analyst Tenaya Therapeutics' recent financial performance and capital raise through a follow-on offering provide a foundation for analyzing the company's investment potential. The pricing of the follow-on offering at $4.50 per share, along with the issuance of pre-funded warrants, reflects a strategic approach to financing that minimizes immediate dilution while securing necessary funds.From a financial perspective, the R&D expenses totaling $98.0 million for the year are in line with industry norms for companies at a similar stage of clinical development. The G&A expenses of $33.2 million also indicate a controlled overhead cost structure relative to the company's size and stage of development. The net loss per share of $1.68 is significant but expected for a clinical-stage biotech company and should be weighed against the potential long-term returns of successful product development.Investors should consider the company's cash burn rate in relation to its current cash reserves and the extended runway provided by the recent capital infusion. The ability to finance operations into the second half of 2025 reduces the immediate risk of cash shortfall but does not eliminate the long-term financing needs inherent in biotech R&D. Careful monitoring of clinical trial progress and subsequent data releases will be essential for evaluating the company's ongoing financial health and prospects. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM Initial Data from Ongoing MyPeak™-1 Phase 1b of TN-201 for MYBPC3-associated HCM Expected in Second Half of 2024 On Track to Dose First Patient in RIDGE™-1Phase 1b Clinical Trial of TN-401 for PKP2-associated ARVC in Second Half 2024 $47 Million Net Proceeds from Recent Financing Extends Cash Runway into Second Half of 2025 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaya Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNYA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying causes of heart disease, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “Tenaya had a successful year of sustained execution in 2023 that meaningfully advanced our portfolio of genetic medicines for heart disease. We announced IND clearance for the TN-201 and TN-401 gene therapy programs; activated clinical trial sites in the USA, Canada, and Europe; dosed the first patient with TN-201; manufactured sufficient clinical trial material for both gene therapy programs at our own cGMP facility; and presented compelling preclinical data from our gene editing and capsid engineering efforts,” said Faraz Ali, Chief Executive Officer of Tenaya. “We look forward to focusing efforts in 2024 on generating early clinical data with TN-201 from the MyPeak-1 study and on initiating patient dosing with TN-401 in the RIDGE-1 study.” Business and Program UpdatesTN-201 – Gene Therapy for MYBPC3-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) In October 2023, the first patient was dosed in the MyPEAK-1 Phase 1b clinical trial of TN-201 for the treatment of Myosin Binding Protein C3 (MYBPC3)-associated HCM. MyPEAK-1 is a multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to assess safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-201. Tenaya anticipates sharing initial safety, biopsy and biomarker data from the first cohort of patients in MyPEAK-1 trial in the second half of 2024. Tenaya is conducting two non-interventional studies to support the development of TN-201: MyClimb, a natural history study of pediatric patients with MYBPC3-associated HCM and a study evaluating seroprevalence to adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) antibodies among adults with MYBPC3-associated HCM. In October 2023, Tenaya shared interim results indicating that a majority of MYBPC3-associated HCM patients could be eligible for TN-201 treatment due to low levels of preexisting neutralizing antibodies to AAV9. TN-401 – Gene Therapy for PKP2-Associated Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) Tenaya is on track to begin dosing in the RIDGE-1 Phase 1b clinical trial of TN-401 in the second half of 2024. RIDGE-1 is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to assess safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-401 for the treatment of ARVC caused by mutations to the Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) gene.In November, TN-401 received Fast Track Designation from the FDA.Tenaya is currently conducting a global, non-interventional seroprevalence and natural history study (RIDGE™) enrolling adult PKP2-associated ARV patients. TN-301 – Small Molecule HDAC6 Inhibitor for Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) At the 2023 Heart Failure Society of America Annual Scientific Meeting in October 2023, Tenaya shared positive clinical and preclinical data for its small molecule HDAC6 inhibitor program, TN-301. Results from a Phase 1 dose-escalation study demonstrated that TN-301 was generally well tolerated across the broad range of doses studied. Pharmacokinetic (PK) results showed overall dose proportionality in the single- and multiple-ascending dose stages of the study with a half-life supportive of once-daily dosing. Robust HDAC6 inhibition was observed and increasing doses and exposures with TN-301 correlated with increased pharmacodynamic effects.New preclinical results demonstrated that the combination of Tenaya’s HDAC6 inhibitor with empagliflozin (a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor) achieved additive benefits in validated HFpEF mouse models compared to either compound alone. Follow-on FinancingIn February 2024, Tenaya completed a follow-on offering with net proceeds of $46.5 million after discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. The offering consisted of approximately 8.89 million shares of common stock priced at $4.50 per share and, in lieu of common stock for one investor, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million shares at a price of $4.499 per pre-funded warrant. The offering included participation from new and existing investors, The Column Group, RA Capital Management, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, Octagon Capital, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Armistice Capital, Integral Health Asset Management, PFM Health Sciences, LP and Soleus Capital. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Cash Position and Guidance: As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities were $104.6 million. Tenaya expects these funds, combined with net proceeds of $46.5 million from the recent financing, will be sufficient to fund the company into the second half of 2025.Research & Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $22.9 million for the fourth quarter and $98.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023.

Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Announces Proposed Public Offering,2024-03-18T20:04:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. initiates a public offering of $500 million in shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to support commercial activities for Rezdiffra™ (resmetirom) launch in the U.S. The offering aims to drive research, development, clinical trials, acquisitions, and capital expenditures.","Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Announces Proposed Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. initiates a public offering of $500 million in shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants to support commercial activities for Rezdiffra™ (resmetirom) launch in the U.S. The offering aims to drive research, development, clinical trials, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Madrigal Pharmaceuticals' decision to commence an underwritten public offering of $500 million in common stock and pre-funded warrants is a strategic move to bolster the company's financial position. The offering's size is significant, indicating a substantial capital infusion which could support the commercial launch of Rezdiffra™ in the U.S., a novel therapeutic for NASH. This influx of capital is expected to strengthen Madrigal's balance sheet, providing the flexibility needed for R&D, clinical trials and potential strategic opportunities such as acquisitions or partnerships.However, the dilutive effect on existing shareholders cannot be overlooked. The introduction of additional shares to the market typically leads to the dilution of earnings per share, which may affect the stock price negatively in the short term. The 30-day option granted to underwriters to purchase an additional 15% of shares could further dilute current shareholder value if exercised. Investors should monitor the stock's performance post-announcement and consider the long-term value creation that this capital raise could enable versus the immediate dilutive impact. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and companies like Madrigal must continuously invest in research and development to stay ahead. The public offering's success will largely depend on market conditions and investor confidence in Madrigal's pipeline, particularly Rezdiffra™. The choice of joint bookrunning managers, including prominent investment banks, suggests confidence in Madrigal's prospects and the ability to reach a broad investor base.It's important to consider how the market is valuing NASH treatments and Madrigal's positioning within this space. If Rezdiffra™ is well-received, the funds raised could significantly enhance Madrigal's market share and competitive edge. Nevertheless, if the market perceives the offering as a sign of financial weakness or if the launch of Rezdiffra™ encounters setbacks, there could be negative implications for the stock's value. Investors should assess Madrigal's market strategy and the potential ROI from the offering, keeping in mind the inherent risks of investing in biopharmaceutical companies with pending product launches. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an effective shelf registration statement, which expedites the process of capital raising by allowing the company to sell securities to the public without a lengthy SEC review process each time. This method demonstrates Madrigal's foresight in regulatory compliance and capital market strategies. However, the legal stipulation that securities cannot be sold in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the respective securities laws is an important point for investors. It indicates that Madrigal is adhering to securities regulations, which is a positive sign of corporate governance.Investors should be aware of the legal frameworks governing such offerings and the implications for their investments. The reliance on a preliminary prospectus supplement indicates that while the offering's terms are set, they are not final until the SEC filings are complete. This adds a layer of uncertainty that must be factored into investment decisions, as changes in terms or market conditions could alter the offering's outcome. 03/18/2024 - 04:04 PM CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: MDGL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of $500 million in shares of its common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase common stock.

The system's sleeveless Flex-Channel design, which has been well-received by early adopters, indicates a potential shift in the industry towards more efficient and user-friendly endoscopic equipment. The positive feedback and successful procedures, especially in the high acuity setting of upper GI bleeding, suggest that the system could see increased adoption, which may lead to revenue growth for the company.Furthermore, the reported financial results show a decrease in net loss from the previous year, which could be indicative of a positive trajectory in cost management and operational efficiency. The infusion of $2.7M in gross proceeds, extending the company's cash runway, provides Motus GI with more time to pursue strategic partnerships and commercialization efforts without immediate financial pressure. This financial breathing room is critical for investors to monitor as it could influence the company's stock performance in the medium term. Healthcare Industry Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Motus GI's reported revenue decline from $592,000 in 2022 to $319,000 in 2023 raises concerns about the company's market penetration and sales execution. However, the reduction in net loss and the decrease in cash used for operating activities suggest improved financial discipline. The strategic focus on forming partnerships could be a catalyst for growth and may mitigate the impact of the revenue dip. Investors should consider the potential for these partnerships to unlock new markets and drive future revenue streams.The issuance of a new patent adds to the company's intellectual property portfolio, potentially increasing its valuation and serving as a deterrent to competitors. This strategic intellectual property management can be a lever for negotiating partnerships and could impact the company's long-term market position. The balance sheet improvements and extended cash runway are positive signals, but the company's ability to convert these into sustainable growth remains to be seen. Patent Law Expert The new patent for the 'Colon Cleaning System with Automatic Self-Purging Feature' enhances Motus GI's competitive edge within the medical device sector. The protection of innovative features, such as the use of sensors to detect and purge blockages, is important for maintaining a unique market position and can be leveraged during strategic partnership discussions. For stakeholders, patents are tangible assets that can contribute to a company's valuation. The implications of such intellectual property developments are twofold: they serve to attract potential investors and partners while also providing a moat against competitive pressures. The timing of this patent issuance aligns with the company's current commercial and strategic initiatives, potentially increasing the attractiveness of Motus GI to collaborators and investors alike. 03/18/2024 - 04:05 PM Initiated limited U.S. commercial launch of the Pure-Vu® EVS Gastro and Gen 4 Colon system, including successful UGI procedures at several leading hospital systemsThe Company is engaged in the process to seek strategic partnerships aimed at accelerating commercialization of the Pure-Vu System and maximizing stockholder valueRecent exercise of certain outstanding warrants provided infusion of $2.7M in gross proceeds to the Company, which extended its cash runway into the fourth quarter of 2024 FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Motus GI Holdings, Inc., (NASDAQ: MOTS) (“Motus GI” or the “Company”), a medical technology company focused on improving endoscopic outcomes and experiences, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “During the past year, we achieved several key milestones that we believe strengthen our position operationally and subsequently initiated a limited U.S. commercial launch of the Pure-Vu® EVS Gastro and Gen 4 Colon system. The new indication for the Upper GI space, along with several technological advancements in both devices are expected to strengthen our ability to penetrate the endoscopy market,” commented Mark Pomeranz, Chief Executive Officer. “We believe the EVS Gastro system opens up significant new market opportunities for our technology, especially in the emergent setting of upper GI bleeding.

Following its initial launch, we received positive feedback on these latest devices in terms of easy of setup and better handling with our Flex Channel technology that has no oversleeve in both the upper and lower GI tract. We are in the process of moving existing accounts over to these new devices, which is expected to be completed by end of the first quarter of 2024 and will move on to targeting new accounts in the second quarter.” “Over the last six months, we have been able to improve our balance sheet by reducing our debt, eliminating a historical royalty commitment and receiving an infusion of capital. We believe our ability to achieve all these milestones over the past year has created significant value in our business and put us in a strong position to seek strategic partnerships,” concluded Mr. Pomeranz. Fourth Quarter and Recent Business Highlights Initiated over the last quarter, a limited U.S. commercial launch of the Pure-Vu® EVS Gastro and Gen 4 Colon system. This initial phase of the rollout is targeting existing customers, which is currently on track to be completed by end of the first quarter of 2024. The new device, which features a sleeveless Flex-Channel design, has been well received by early-adopters, who have commented on the system’s improved handling and easy setup. The Company also received positive feedback from customers using the EVS Gastro with patients presenting with a UGI bleed. Also, the system has been used successfully removed stomach contents to support therapeutic upper GI treatments that typically would have otherwise been canceled due to poor visualization.The Company announced positive data from an international, multicenter colonoscopy study that evaluated if an adequate level of bowel cleansing could be achieved with the Pure-Vu System in patients with previous poor bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS)<6). Results from the study met the primary endpoint, showing a median BBPS increase from 1-2-2 (IQR 1–2) to 3-3-3 (IQR) (p < 0.0001), with 31.8% and 88.6% of patients adequately prepared before and after using the Pure-Vu System, respectively (p < 0.0001). The study also met its key secondary endpoints and no serious adverse events occurred. These data were published in a manuscript titled, “An intraprocedural bowel cleansing system for difficult-to-prepare patients—A multicenter prospective feasibility study,” in the peer-reviewed journal, United European Gastroenterology (UGE).In February 2024, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued the Company a new patent (patent # 11904085) titled, “Colon Cleaning System with Automatic Self-Purging Feature.” The new patent covers systems and methods for cleaning a colon or other portion of the GI tract include optional use of sensors to detect conditions of blockage of flow of materials within an evacuation channel used to remove debris from the body; and devices and methods for purging such blockages from the evacuation channel. This latest patent application is a continuation of U.S. patent applications Ser. No. 16/389,955 filed on April 21, 2019.The Company continues its process to seek strategic partnerships aimed at accelerating commercialization of the Pure-Vu System and maximizing stockholder value.

Positive None. Negative NCM 's operating loss for FY 2023 was $180.9 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million for FY 2022. NCM, Inc. reported a net income of $705.2 million for FY 2023, compared to a net loss of $28.7 million in the prior year. Financial Analyst The announcement of National CineMedia's (NCM) $100 million share repurchase program signals a strong vote of confidence by the company's board in its stock and financial health. Share buybacks are often used to return capital to shareholders and can indicate that the company believes its stock is undervalued. By leveraging operating cash flow for these repurchases, NCM is utilizing its generated cash in a way that can potentially enhance shareholder value. However, the flat revenue year-over-year and the decrease in total revenue for the fiscal year raise questions about growth prospects. Investors may scrutinize the company's strategic initiatives and their potential to drive future revenue increases.Furthermore, the significant net income reported due to the cancellation of historical debt after NCM LLC's emergence from bankruptcy is a one-time event that investors should not expect to recur. The operating loss for the fiscal year and the contraction in adjusted OIBDA margin suggest underlying challenges in operational efficiency or market conditions that could affect long-term profitability. Investors will likely monitor the company's ability to manage these challenges while executing its capital return strategy. Market Research Analyst NCM's increase in national advertising revenue, driven by a higher utilization rate, is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its advertising platform. However, the decrease in local and regional advertising revenue, coupled with a drop in attendance, could be reflective of broader trends in the advertising industry or specific challenges in those market segments. The increase in active national advertisers and record revenue per attendee suggests that NCM is effectively leveraging its reach among moviegoers, a demographic that advertisers highly value for its youth and diversity.However, the contraction in adjusted OIBDA margin may be a concern, as it might indicate rising costs or pricing pressures. The advertising industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology and consumer behavior. NCM's strategic initiatives aimed at growing its advertising network will be important in maintaining and expanding its market position against these headwinds. Legal Expert The mention of NCM LLC's Chapter 11 Case and related appeals indicates that the company has recently undergone a restructuring process. The legal and financial ramifications of emerging from Chapter 11 can be complex, often involving negotiations with creditors and adjustments to the company's capital structure. While the restructuring process can provide a path to reduce debt and improve the balance sheet, it can also lead to significant legal and administrative expenses.Moreover, the reconsolidation of NCM LLC's intangible assets and the subsequent amortization expenses reflect the accounting adjustments that follow such legal proceedings. Stakeholders should be aware that these adjustments can significantly affect reported earnings and may not be indicative of the company's ongoing operational performance. It is essential to distinguish between these one-time restructuring impacts and the company's core operating metrics when evaluating its financial health. 03/18/2024 - 04:02 PM Fourth quarter revenue per attendee reaches record high Fourth quarter adjusted OIBDA significantly exceeds guidance Announces $100 million share repurchase program CENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National CineMedia, Inc. (NASDAQ: NCMI) (“the Company” or “NCM”), the managing member of National CineMedia, LLC (“NCM LLC”), the operator of the largest cinema advertising platform in the U.S., today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, ended December 28, 2023. “In 2023, NCM successfully re-established the importance of cinema for best-in-class advertisers, with movies driving the cultural conversation and the box office reaching its highest point since 2019,” said Tom Lesinski, CEO of NCM. “We are very encouraged by our strong fourth quarter performance, which led to a 43% increase in active national advertisers and record revenue per attendee. This resulted in strong adjusted OIBDA, significantly exceeding our fourth quarter guide. Our confidence in the strength of NCM’s business model and cash flow generation is highlighted by our new $100 million share repurchase program. What remains clear is that the biggest brands continue to turn to NCM as a trusted and effective way to reach the millions of young, diverse moviegoers.” Share Repurchase Program NCM today announced that its board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of shares of the Company’s common stock through April 1, 2027. During the course of the program, NCM plans to use operating cash flow distributions from NCM LLC to opportunistically repurchase shares at prevailing market prices, while continuing to invest capital in growing its advertising network through strategic initiatives. In determining the amount of capital to allocate to share repurchases, the Company will take into account, among other things, its historical and expected business performance, cash and liquidity position, economic and market conditions, ongoing strategic initiatives and the market price of the Company’s common stock. The timing, manner, price, and amount of any repurchases under the share repurchase program will be determined by the Company in its discretion. Repurchases under the Company’s share repurchase program may be made through open market transactions (including the use of SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plans), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchases or other structured transactions, subject to market conditions and applicable legal requirements. The Company has no obligation to repurchase shares, and the share repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Q4 2023 NCM LLC Results1 In the fourth quarter of 2023, NCM LLC delivered total operating revenue of $90.9 million, approximately flat compared to $91.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. NCM LLC’s national advertising revenue increased to $71.9 million, up 2% compared to $70.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by a 14.1% increase in utilization and offset by a 6% decrease in attendance. NCM LLC’s local and regional advertising revenue decreased to $16.2 million, down 5% compared to $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by a decrease in contract size and activity in the government, electronics, and travel categories. NCM LLC’s operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $21.3 million compared to operating income of $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by an increase in amortization expenses associated with NCM LLC’s intangible assets based upon the purchase price adjustments to NCM LLC’s intangible assets upon reconsolidation on August 7, 2023, as well as an increase in expenses incurred due to NCM LLC’s Chapter 11 Case and related appeals. NCM LLC’s fourth quarter 2023 adjusted OIBDA was $39.8 million compared to $42.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and adjusted OIBDA margin contracted by 210 basis points to 43.8% compared to 45.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

NCM, Inc.’s operating income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $20.5 million compared to operating income of $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. NCM Inc. reported net income of $23.7 million, or net income per share of $0.24, compared to net income of $6.1 million, or a net income per share of $0.60 in the prior year, largely driven by an increase in amortization expenses associated with NCM LLC’s intangible assets based upon the purchase price adjustments to NCM LLC’s intangible assets upon reconsolidation on August 7, 2023, an increase in expenses incurred due to NCM LLC’s Chapter 11 Case and related appeals, as well as an increase in weighted average shares outstanding. This is offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the cancellation of historical debt after NCM LLC’s emergence from bankruptcy.

NCM LLC’s national advertising revenue increased to $190.1 million, up 2% compared to revenue of $187.2 million in fiscal year 2022, driven by a 9% increase in impressions sold and an 11% increase in network attendance compared to the prior year. NCM LLC’s local and regional advertising revenue increased to $51.1 million, up 18% compared to $43.5 million in fiscal year 2022, driven by a year-over-year increase in contract activity and average deal size within the government, healthcare, travel, and education service categories. NCM LLC’s operating loss for fiscal year 2023 was $180.9 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million for fiscal year 2022. This loss was primarily related to the disposal of the intangible asset related to the Regal ESA. NCM LLC’s fiscal year 2023 adjusted OIBDA was $52.7 million compared to $57.3 million for fiscal year 2022 and adjusted OIBDA margin contracted by 270 basis points to 20.3% compared to 23.0% in fiscal year 2022.

NCM, Inc.’s advertising revenue decreased to $155.1 million, down 38% compared to total revenue of $249.2 million in fiscal year 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the deconsolidation of NCM LLC for the period of April 11, 2023, through August 7, 2023, during NCM LLC’s Chapter 11 Case. NCM, Inc.’s operating loss for fiscal year 2023 was $27.3 million compared to operating income of $6.9 million for fiscal year 2022. NCM, Inc. reported net income of $705.2 million, or net income per share of $14.34, compared to a net loss of $28.7 million, or a net loss per share of $3.50 in the prior year. 1Q 2024 Outlook For the first quarter of 2024, NCM, Inc. expects to earn total revenue of $34.5 million to $35.5 million, compared to total revenue for the first quarter 2023 of $34.9 million, and adjusted OIBDA in the range of negative $7.5 million to $6.5 million, compared to adjusted OIBDA for the first quarter 2023 of negative $10.9 million.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations Unaudited Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA Margin Adjusted Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”) and Adjusted OIBDA margin are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP in the United States. Adjusted OIBDA represents operating income before depreciation and amortization expense adjusted to also exclude amortization of intangibles, non-cash share-based payment costs, executive transition costs, advisor fees related to abandoned financing transactions, impairment of long-lived assets, sales force reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding and Chapter 11 Case. Our management use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. The Company believes the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it enables them to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management, helps improve their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare the Company’s results with other companies that may have different depreciation and amortization policies, amounts of amortization of intangibles, non-cash share-based compensation programs, executive transition costs, advisor fees related to abandoned financing transactions, impairment of long-lived assets, sales force reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding and Chapter 11 Case, interest rates, debt levels or income tax rates. Adjusted OIBDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted OIBDA by total revenue. Our management use this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate operating performance, to forecast future results and as a basis for compensation. The Company believes this is an important supplemental measure of operating performance because it eliminates items that have less bearing on its operating performance and highlight trends in its core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures.

A limitation of both of these measures, however, is that they exclude depreciation and amortization, which represent a proxy for the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in NCM LLC’s business. In addition, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin have the limitation of not reflecting the effect of the Company’s depreciation, amortization of intangibles, non-cash share-based payment costs, executive transition costs, advisor fees related to abandoned financing transactions, impairments of long-lived assets, sales force reorganization costs, termination of the Regal ESA and advisor fees related to involvement in the Cineworld Proceeding or Chapter 11 Case. Adjusted OIBDA should not be regarded as an alternative to operating income, net income or as indicators of operating performance, nor should it be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that operating income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA, and operating margin is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Adjusted OIBDA margin. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these non-GAAP presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies, or calculations in NCM LLC’s debt agreement. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP Adjusted OIBDA measure to forward-looking GAAP operating income due to the inability to predict the amount and timing of impacts outside of the Company’s control on certain items, including the timing of revenue and charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers, the amount of which, based on historical experience, could be significant and are difficult to reasonably predict. Accordingly, a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.

The property offers luxury amenities and is strategically located near major employers in Silicon Valley. The sale reflects increasing investor demand in supply-constrained markets, driven by recent improvements in leasing demand and interest rates. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The sale of Prado, a luxury multifamily asset in Santa Clara, for $125 million underscores the robust investor appetite for high-quality residential properties in strategic locations. The per-unit price of $498,008 reflects the premium market positioning of the property, which is bolstered by its proximity to major Silicon Valley employers. Such locations are highly sought after due to the potential for stable rental income streams and property value appreciation, given the concentration of high-paying tech jobs in the area.The acquisition financing of $73.5 million at a 5.95% interest rate signifies a moderate level of leverage for the buyer, Alliance Residential. This financing structure could potentially offer a balance between risk and return, considering the current interest rate environment. The involvement of established players like IPA Capital Markets in arranging the deal demonstrates the strategic importance of the asset and the confidence in the Silicon Valley real estate market. Economic Analyst The transaction of the Prado multifamily asset is indicative of broader economic trends affecting the real estate sector. The noted 'modest decrease in interest rates' has likely contributed to increased transaction volumes by making financing more affordable. This could signal a favorable investment climate for real estate in the short term. However, it is important to be cognizant of the potential long-term implications of fluctuating interest rates on real estate valuations and investors' yield expectations.Furthermore, the high engagement levels on listing assignments mentioned may reflect a supply-demand imbalance in the Bay Area, which is known for its limited housing supply. This dynamic can lead to competitive bidding environments and potentially drive up asset prices, impacting the affordability and accessibility of housing for residents in the region. Urban Development Expert The Prado's location within walking distance to Caltrain and major expressways enhances its appeal to residents who value connectivity and convenience. The development's focus on lifestyle amenities, such as an Olympic-sized pool and a state-of-the-art fitness center, aligns with current urban development trends that prioritize mixed-use spaces and community-centric features. This approach caters to the evolving preferences of urban dwellers, particularly in tech-centric regions where work-life balance is increasingly important.The presence of nearby tech giants like Nvidia and Apple is likely to sustain demand for housing in the area, but it also raises questions about the impact on local infrastructure and community services. As Silicon Valley continues to grow, the challenge for urban developers will be to balance the needs of the business community with those of residents to ensure sustainable development. 03/18/2024 - 03:47 PM SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Institutional Property Advisors (IPA), a division of Marcus & Millichap (NYSE: MMI), announced today the sale of Prado, a 251-unit multifamily asset in Santa Clara, California. The property traded for $125 million, or $498,008 per unit. IPA Capital Markets arranged $73.5 million in acquisition financing. “Prado is one of Silicon Valley’s newest luxury communities, with an ideal combination of lifestyle amenities and proximity to the region’s major employers,” said Philip Saglimbeni, IPA executive managing director. “Investor demand for quality assets in supply-constrained markets is on the rise, as demonstrated by high engagement levels on listing assignments. Moreover, recent improvements in Bay Area leasing demand and a modest decrease in interest rates have further spurred transaction volume and closure of bid ask spreads.” Philip Saglimbeni and IPA’s Stanford Jones, Salvatore Saglimbeni and Alex Tartaglia represented the seller, Summerhill Apartment Communities, and procured the buyer, Alliance Residential. Brian Eisendrath, Cameron Chalfant and Jesse Zarouk of IPA Capital Markets arranged five-year, 5.95% financing. The property is close to the Lawrence and San Tomas Expressways, State Routes 82, 85, and 87, Interstates 280 and 880, and U.S. Highway 101. Caltrain, the Bay Area’s commuter rail line connecting San Francisco and San Jose, is within a five-minute walk. The western edge of Golden Triangle, Silicon Valley’s largest employment center with over 1,500 businesses and 138,000 employees, plus 22 million square feet of office space, is close by. Employers nearby include Nvidia, Apple, Intel, PayPal, Netflix, eBay, Cisco, Adobe, Samsung, and LinkedIn. Completed in 2021, Prado has well designed one- and two-bedroom floor plans with contemporary finishes and an average unit size of 843 square feet. Community amenities include an Olympic-sized pool and spa, a two-story club-style fitness center, indoor and outdoor resident lounges, a remote-work business center, game room, and barbecue area.

(NASDAQ: NCMI) announces a new $100 million share repurchase program to buy back common stock until April 1, 2027, using operating cash flow distributions. The Board and Management show confidence in the cinema advertising network's future, aiming to drive long-term shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a new share repurchase program by National CineMedia, Inc. reflects a strategic financial decision that can have various implications for the company's valuation and shareholder wealth. Share repurchase programs often signal management's belief that the company's stock is undervalued and by reducing the number of shares outstanding, the earnings per share (EPS) metric can potentially increase, which could lead to a higher stock price.From a financial perspective, the use of operating cash flow distributions from NCM LLC for repurchasing shares indicates that the company is generating sufficient cash from its operations to fund the buyback without the need to incur additional debt. This self-funding approach to the buyback program is a positive sign, showing that the company is managing its cash flow effectively.However, the allocation of capital to share repurchases must be balanced with other investment opportunities that could drive growth. The company's commitment to investing in strategic initiatives to grow its advertising network is important to maintain long-term competitiveness in the cinema advertising industry. It is important to consider whether the capital used for the buyback could be better deployed in these growth initiatives. Market Research Analyst The cinema advertising industry is facing a dynamic market environment, with evolving consumer behaviors and technological advancements. National CineMedia's decision to authorize a share repurchase program must be viewed in the context of these industry trends. The company's focus on growing its advertising network through strategic initiatives is indicative of an attempt to capture a larger market share and adapt to the changing landscape.It is essential to evaluate the potential impact of this share repurchase program on the company's market position. By potentially improving financial metrics through share buybacks, National CineMedia may enhance its appeal to investors. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy largely depends on the execution of the company's growth initiatives and the overall health of the cinema industry post-pandemic.Investors should also consider the broader economic and market conditions, as the company's performance is not solely dependent on internal strategies but also on external factors such as consumer spending on entertainment and competition from alternative advertising platforms. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM CENTENNIAL, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National CineMedia, Inc.

The agreement increases the CAM-leased 767 fleet at DHL to fourteen, showcasing ATSG's Lease+Plus strategy. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The lease agreement between Air Transport Services Group, Inc. (ATSG) and DHL Network Operations (USA), Inc. for a 767-300 freighter aircraft is a strategic move that both companies are making to address the increasing demand for air freight services. The addition of another aircraft to DHL's fleet, raising the number to fourteen leased from ATSG, indicates a strengthening of their partnership and a commitment to expanding DHL's capacity for express delivery operations.From a market perspective, the Boeing 767 is a key player in the medium-widebody freighter market, known for its payload capacity and range capabilities. This makes it a preferred choice for logistics companies looking to optimize their delivery operations. With the e-commerce industry continuing to grow, the demand for efficient and reliable air freight solutions is expected to rise, potentially benefiting both ATSG and DHL.ATSG's Lease+Plus strategy, which bundles leasing with additional services such as heavy maintenance and freighter conversions, presents a competitive advantage. This integrated approach can be attractive to leasing customers who are seeking to scale operations without incurring the capital expenditures associated with purchasing aircraft. Financial Analyst The new lease agreement with DHL is likely to have a positive impact on ATSG's revenue stream, considering the scale of the contract and the increased fleet size. Investors might view this as a sign of ATSG's robust business model and ability to secure long-term contracts with major players in the logistics industry. The lease of a 767-300 freighter is significant as it suggests a sustained demand for ATSG's aircraft and services, potentially leading to stable cash flows.Analyzing the financial implications, it is important to consider the operational costs associated with maintaining and operating the aircraft versus the revenue generated from the lease. The long-term nature of such agreements usually provides financial predictability and can be a buffer against market volatility. However, investors should also be mindful of the capital expenditure commitments and the impact of economic cycles on the air freight industry. Logistics Industry Expert The leasing of a 767-300 freighter from ATSG to DHL reflects ongoing trends in the logistics industry, where agility and flexibility in capacity are paramount. The ability to quickly adjust to market demand without the risks associated with owning assets is a strategic approach adopted by many logistics companies. DHL's decision to lease rather than purchase can be seen as a move to maintain liquidity and reduce financial risk.Moreover, the medium-widebody freighter market is experiencing a surge in demand due to the rise of e-commerce and changes in consumer behavior. The 767-300 model, with its balance of capacity and range, is particularly well-suited for express delivery services that require quick turnarounds and efficient operations. The lease agreement signals confidence in the continued growth of the sector and the need for robust logistics solutions. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM WILMINGTON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Air Transport Services Group, Inc.

Negative impact on net income due to non-cash effects and currency fluctuations. Downward trend in Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q4 2023 compared to previous quarters. Impact of higher expatriation costs on Gross Profit margin in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results of dLocal Limited highlight significant year-over-year growth in key financial metrics such as Total Payment Volume (TPV), revenue, gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA. The TPV's 67% increase indicates a robust expansion in the volume of transactions processed by the company, which is a critical indicator of market penetration and customer adoption. The 55% revenue growth aligns with the increase in TPV, suggesting effective monetization of the increased transaction volume.Furthermore, the Net Revenue Retention Rate (NRR) of 150% is particularly noteworthy. An NRR exceeding 100% typically indicates that existing customers are spending more over time, which can be a sign of strong customer satisfaction and upselling effectiveness. The Adjusted EBITDA's 32% year-over-year growth, coupled with a high ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Gross Profit (73%), suggests that the company is not only growing but also maintaining profitability despite scaling operations.From a liquidity perspective, the generation of $166 million in Free Cash Flow (FCF) and a robust cash balance position the company well for strategic investments or shareholder returns. However, investors should be mindful of the potential volatility in emerging markets, as evidenced by the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation on the company's financials. This highlights the geopolitical and currency risks inherent in dLocal's business model. Market Research Analyst dLocal's impressive performance in Brazil and Mexico, with revenue increases of 89% and 72% year-over-year respectively, underscores the company's strategic focus on key emerging markets. The entry into five new markets within a year signifies aggressive expansion and a commitment to capturing market share in high-growth regions. The company's ability to attract five of the six largest tech companies by market cap as clients is a testament to the platform's scalability and the trust large enterprises place in dLocal's payment solutions.The emphasis on strengthening the engineering talent pool and investing in back-office capabilities indicates a long-term strategy focused on sustainable growth. However, the reliance on emerging markets, while offering substantial growth opportunities, also presents risks such as political instability, regulatory changes and economic volatility. Investors should consider the balance between the growth potential in these markets and the associated risks. Economist The reported growth in TPV and revenue from emerging markets such as Africa and Asia, which saw a 114% increase in revenue year-over-year, reflects broader economic trends where digital payments are rapidly expanding in regions with rising consumer and business digital adoption. dLocal's strategy to deepen relationships with global banking partners and grow its license portfolio aligns with the need for robust financial infrastructure to support this growth.However, the company's forward-looking statements regarding expected TPV growth of 40% to 50% for 2024 suggest a deceleration in growth rate. This projected slowdown may be indicative of maturing markets or increasing competition. The focus on maintaining high EBITDA margins while investing for long-term growth presents a challenge in balancing short-term profitability with the necessary expenditures to sustain long-term market leadership in the rapidly evolving digital payments industry. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM Full Year 2023 resultsUS$17.7 billion Total Payment Volume, up 67% year-over-yearRevenue of US$650 million, up 55% year-over-year150% Net Revenue Retention RateGross Profit of US$277 million, up 37% year-over-yearAdjusted EBITDA of US$202 million, up 32% year-over-year Fourth Quarter 2023US$5.1 billion Total Payment Volume, up 55% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarterRevenue of US$188 million, up 59% year-over-year and 15% quarter-over-quarter149% Net Revenue Retention RateGross Profit of US$70 million, up 27% year-over-year and down -6% quarter-over-quarterAdjusted EBITDA of US$49 million, up 22% year-over-year and down -11% quarter-over-quarter dLocal reports in US dollars and in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay , March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DLocal Limited (“dLocal”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) (NASDAQ:DLO), a technology - first payments platform today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. “I am proud to share the extraordinary results we delivered during 2023. Despite facing market tests and macro challenges, our team continued to execute our strategy, investing with discipline, and putting our merchants at the center of everything we do. Our 2023 performance demonstrates the resilience of our value proposition and business model. We are now serving 5 of the 6 largest tech companies in the world as measured by market cap. Yet we have only begun to tap into the immense opportunity ahead of us. We remain committed to realizing our long-term ambition: unlocking the potential of emerging markets. During 2023 we achieved a record TPV of US$18 billion, increasing by 67% YoY, and we over-delivered on our revenue guidance, reaching US$650 million, up 55% YoY. This strong growth has been fueled by our existing merchants as we continue to gain wallet share. The trust our merchants place in our solution is also evidenced in our stellar NRR of 150%. We remain focused on driving gross profit dollars growth. Gross profit grew 37% YoY to US$277 million. Adjusted EBITDA surpassed US$200 million in line with our guidance. Our profitability continues to be among the best in our comparable set. Our ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Gross Profit came in at 73% for 2023. We experienced sound growth across our diverse verticals. In 2023, our platform solution gained traction, especially with marketplace merchants, expanding into 5 key markets in just one year. From a geographic standpoint, we saw very strong performance in our key markets, Brazil and Mexico, with revenues increasing 89% and 72% YoY respectively. Africa and Asia delivered an impressive 114% YoY increase in revenue. We grew our global team from 726 in 2022 to 901 people by the end of 2023, located across 49 countries. We continue to build upon our existing strengths by making investments in key capabilities, including: 1) growing our license portfolio, with 10 incremental registries and licences granted in 2023, 2) deepening our relationships with global banking partners, adding more Global Systemically Important Banks, continental and nationally market leading banks for our processing, FX and hedging activities - around 80% of all foreign exchange transactions during H2 2023 were carried out via GSIBs, continental and national banks; and 3) ramping up our operations and back-office effectiveness. We ended the year with a robust liquidity position, having generated US$166 million of FCF, and reaching US$326 million of funds, including US$223 million of own funds cash balances and US$103 million of short term investments in Argentina dollar-linked bonds. Our strong cash generative business gives us the flexibility to evaluate opportunities to deploy our cash generation, including inorganic growth opportunities or distributing to our shareholders through share repurchases. Looking ahead, I am even more excited for what's to come. For 2024 we expect TPV growth of 40% to 50%, surpassing $26B of TPV at the midpoint. We see gross profit between US$320 and US$360m and Adjusted EBITDA between US$220 and US$260m. We are committed to running a financial model that combines robust mid-term gross profit growth with an EBITDA margin that is among the best in our comparables. Therefore, we are re-affirming our mid-term guidance of 25%-35% gross profit CAGR and Adjusted EBITDA to gross profit of 75%+. The trajectory towards that mid-term guidance comes in for 2024 at around 70% Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit as we continue investing and tightening the foundations for long-term growth by 1) further strengthening the dLocal team, with particular emphasis on our engineering talent pool; 2) further upgrading back office capabilities and 3) continuing to invest behind our license portfolio throughout emerging markets. The combination of these actions will further widen our moat and continue to position DLO as the go-to payments platform to serve emerging markets. As we look beyond 2024, we believe that as we conclude our short-term investment cycle, we will start to see the operational leverage inherent to our business kick in. We steer our business for decades, not quarters. We continue to have a high conviction in our massive opportunity. Finally, let me share that after a few months working with Sebastian as co-CEOs, we will continue to collaborate closely and shape dLocal’s bright future but now from different roles. It is truly an honor and a privilege to share that I am taking on the role of CEO, while Sebastian is stepping down from his executive position but remains an active member of the Board and will be fully dedicated to leveraging his vast experience to lead the newly established Commercial, Business Development and M&A Committee as part of the company's Board of Directors. I am sure Seba will continue to be an instrumental piece in DLO’s long term successful story. In addition, in another step to strengthen our executive team, I am thrilled to reveal that Mark Ortiz will be joining the company as Chief Financial Officer, commencing on April 15. Mark brings a wealth of experience, boasting three decades of senior financial leadership at General Electric. Mark's extensive background includes living, working, and traveling across over 20 markets, aligning seamlessly with our mission to unleash the potential of emerging markets. We extend our gratitude to Diego Cabrera Canay for his invaluable contributions to dLocal. As we advance as a listed company, we are delighted to announce the appointment of Veronica Raffo as a new independent Board member, effective immediately. Verónica is a partner in FERRERE, a leading law firm in Uruguay, and participates actively in its management and strategic leadership. She has more than 25 years of experience advising high profile global clients in areas of labor law, compliance audits, and corporate governance. Ms Raffo is a member of the “International Bar Association”, a member of the IBA’s Committee on Labor and Industrial Relations, a Director at the Vance Center’s Project for the Advancement of Women Lawyers, and has consistently been recognized amongst the most reputed Uruguayan business leaders by the Corporate Reputation Business Monitor (MERCO). Veronica will replace Mr. Jitendra Gupta who has decided to step down from our Board. We thank Jitendra for his service since our pre-IPO process and the guidance he has offered the company over this time. Finally, I want to make sure we thank our global team, our valued customers, and our investors for their continued support. They are what allow us to continue pursuing our mission of unlocking the potential of emerging markets.” said Pedro Arnt, CEO of dLocal Fourth quarter 2023 Financial Highlights Total Payment Volume (“TPV”) reached a record US$5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 55% year-over-year compared to US$3.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 and up 11% compared to US$4.6 billion in the third quarter of 2023.Revenues amounted to US$188.0 million, up 59% year-over-year compared to US$118.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and up 15% compared to US$163.9 million in the third quarter of 2023.Gross profit was US$69.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 27% year-over-year compared to US$55.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 6% decrease when compared to US$74.5 million in the third quarter of 2023.During the fourth quarter of 2023, the strong performance of our merchants across most of our markets was in part offset by our business in Argentina, driven by: 1) what we believe to be a temporary shift in business mix, with higher local to local revenues compared to prior periods as a consequence of tighter capital controls leading up to the year end government transition, and 2) impact from the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso towards the end of the quarter. Despite what we view as short term headwinds, we continue with our long term view that Argentina is a relevant market for us and our merchants. Excluding Argentina, revenues increased by 70% year-over-year and 27% quarter-over-quarter, whereas gross profit grew by 48% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter.Gross profit margin was 37% in this quarter, compared to 47% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 45% in the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, gross profit margin was negatively impacted by higher expatriation costs.Gross profit over TPV was at 1.4% decreasing from 1.6% in the third quarter of 2023 and from 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022 mainly due to shifts in country mix and business mix, with lower share of pay-ins and cross-border volumes.Adjusted EBITDA was US$49.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, up 22% year-over-year compared to US$40.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and down 11% compared to US$55.6 million in the third quarter of 2023.Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the 34% recorded both in the third quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted, in line with gross profit margin.Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit remained best in class at 71% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 75% in the third quarter of 2023 and 73% a year ago.Net financial income was US$1.0 million, compared to US$1.5 million in the third quarter of 2023 and compared to a loss of US$3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.Effective income tax rate was 21% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 18% in the third quarter of 2023, as a result of the country mix, with higher local-to-local share of pre-tax income and the non-deductibility of IFRS inflation adjustment.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was US$28.5 million, or US$0.10 per diluted share, up 47% compared to a profit of US$19.4 million, or US$0.06 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2022 and down 29% compared to a profit of US$40.4 million, or US$0.13 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2023.During the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was affected by two non-cash effects: IFRS inflation adjustment accounting during a quarter of significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso, and exchange differences from USD liabilities held by our Argentina subsidiary during that period; these were partially offset by the fair value gain on our Argentine dollar-linked bonds. Adjusted Net Income (excluding these non-cash effects, in addition to other non-recurring items in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation) was $40.6 million during the period.

Cross-border volume accounted for 44% of the TPV in the fourth quarter of 2023.Local-to-local TPV increased by 86% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter to US$2.9 billion. Local-to-local volume accounted for 56% of the TPV in the fourth quarter of 2023.LatAm revenue increased 42% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 and contracted by 3% quarter-over-quarter to US$131.5 million, accounting for 70% of total revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we continue to experience strong revenue growth in our largest markets, Brazil and Mexico. In Brazil revenues doubled year-over-year and increased 12% quarter-over-quarter, whereas in Mexico, they increased 59% year-over-year and 18% quarter-over-quarter. The sequential contraction was mainly driven by Argentina.Africa and Asia revenue grew by 121% year-over-year and 103% quarter-over-quarter to US$56.5 million, accounting for the remaining 30% of total revenue. Part of the growth was driven by Nigeria which revenues doubled year-over-year and increased by 3x quarter-over-quarter driven by the widening spread between the official and the parallel exchange rates, which conversely, also resulted in higher expatriation costs. Excluding Nigeria, revenues increased by 144% year-over-year and by 44% quarter-over-quarter in Africa and Asia showing the continued growth across Africa and Asia.During the quarter, dLocal continued delivering strong revenue growth both from existing and from new customers. Revenue from Existing Merchants increased to US$176.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The net revenue retention rate, or NRR, in the fourth quarter of 2023 reached 149%.Revenue from New Merchants was US$11.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA as used by dLocal is defined as the profit from operations before financing and taxation for the year or period, as applicable, before depreciation of property, plant and equipment, amortization of right-of-use assets and intangible assets, and further excluding the changes in fair value of financial assets and derivative instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss, impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment non-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and inflation adjustment. dLocal defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated revenues. Although Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may be commonly viewed as non-IFRS measures in other contexts, pursuant to IFRS 8, (“Operating Segments”), Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are treated by dLocal as IFRS measures based on the manner in which dLocal utilizes these measures. Nevertheless, dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for net income for the periods presented under IFRS. dLocal also believes that its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin metrics are useful metrics used by analysts and investors, although these measures are not explicitly defined under IFRS. Additionally, the way dLocal calculates operating segment’s performance measures may be different from the calculations used by other entities, including competitors, and therefore, dLocal’s performance measures may not be comparable to those of other entities. Finally, dLocal is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment. The table below presents a reconciliation of dLocal’s Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to net income: $ in thousandsThree months ended 31 of DecemberTwelve months ended 31 of December 2023202220232022Profit for the period28,48119,364149,086108,697Income tax expense7,4763,93529,42811,586Depreciation and amortization3,6042,45712,2258,147Finance income and costs, net(996)3,071(11,394)6,590Share-based payment non-cash charges4,8503,81011,9228,684Other operating (gain)/loss-(9)-697Secondary offering expenses¹---89Impairment loss / (gain) on financial assets2(657)5,640(3,135)5,534Inflation adjustment6,04013212,5371,037Other non-recurring costs³4342,0141,6632,014Adjusted EBITDA49,23240,414202,332153,075 Note: 1Corresponds to expenses assumed by dLocal in relation to secondary offerings of its shares which occurred in 2021. 2In 2022, the Company utilized FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) services for the repatriation of funds from one country. On November 11, 2022, when FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States, the Company had deposits of $5.6 million, whose withdrawals had not been processed by FTX. Such deposits were included in the loss allowance as of December 31, 2022. The Group entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell 100% of these deposits for an amount of $3.5 million. Thus, during Q3 2023 the Group recognized a gain of $2.5 million and a gain of US$0.9 million during Q4 2023 as result of the reversion of the loss allowance. 3Other non-recurring costs related to an internal review of the allegations made by a short-seller report and costs related to class action proceedings, which include fees from independent counsel, independent global expert services and a forensic accounting advisory firm were included. Special note regarding Adjusted Net Income Adjusted Net Income is a non-IFRS financial measure. As used by dLocal Adjusted net income is defined as the profit for the period (net income) excluding impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, share-based payment non-cash charges, secondary offering expenses, and other operating (gain)/loss, in line with our Adjusted EBITDA calculation (see detailed methodology for Adjusted EBITDA in page 9). It further excludes the accounting non-cash charges related to the fair value gain from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and the exchange difference loss from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase the bonds. In addition, it excludes the inflation adjustment based on IFRS rules for hyperinflationary economies. We believe Adjusted Net Income is a useful measure for understanding our results for operations while excluding for certain non-cash effects such as currency devaluation and inflation. Our calculation for Adjusted Net Income may differ from similarly-titled measures presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for our measure of profit for the period as presented in accordance with IFRS.

In this sense, the financial statements of the Argentinian subsidiaries were restated to reflect the purchasing power of the currency and therefore a gain on net monetary position arose. ²During Q4 2023 we recognized a fair value gain of US$ 50.8 million (US$24.2 million in Q3 2023 and US$ 3.6 million in Q2 2023) from the Argentine dollar-linked bonds and an exchange difference loss of US$ 51.9 million (-S$ 27.4 million in Q3 2023 and -US$ 1.8 million in Q2 2023) from the intercompany loan denominated in USD that we granted to our Argentine subsidiary to purchase part of the bonds. 3We calculated the tax impact on all adjustments based on their corresponding tax rate. Earnings per share We calculate basic earnings per share by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group by the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding during the three-months and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to owners of the group of dLocal by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus the weighted average number of common shares that would be issued on conversion of all dilutive potential common shares into common shares.

The quarterly financial information in this press release has not been audited, whereas the annual results for the year ended December 31, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 are audited. Outlook full year 2024 We are including TPV guidance this year, as we believe this is the most relevant operational metric for the company and the cleanest indicator of market share. Additionally, along with adjusted EBITDA and as we always emphasize, we also focus on maximizing absolute dollar gross profit growth. Thus, we decided to guide for growth profit as well.As outlook for the full year 2024, we expect to grow our TPV to between US$25 to US$27 billion and gross profit to between US$320 and US$360 million in 2024. Our expectations for TPV and gross profit assume increased mix coming from “Tier 0” merchants as we continue to ramp-up those global relationships, driving incremental TPV and wallet share from the world's leading tech companies, but at lower take rates. In addition, we see sustained growth in our local to local business, and mix of growth shifting to less mature markets, where our operations have not reached scale. Our gross profit outlook assumes normalization of foreign exchange spreads in certain dual currency rate markets.In terms of profitability, we expect Adjusted EBITDA between US$220 to US$260 million and Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin around 70%.We are committed to running a financial model that combines robust mid term gross profit growth with an EBITDA margin that is best-in-class. As such we are re-affirming our mid term outlook of: 1) 25%-35% gross profit CAGR growth and 2) 75%+ Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin. Our 2024 outlook implies a temporary deviation from mid-term guidance as we prepare the business for sustainable long term growth. In 2024, we will invest primarily in tech, mostly to grow our tech team, followed by investments in operations and sales. As we look beyond 2024, once we conclude our short term investment cycle in tools, processes, and people, we believe we will start to see the operational leverage inherent to our business to kick in.

About dLocaldLocal powers local payments in emerging markets, connecting global enterprise merchants with billions of emerging market consumers in more than 40 countries across APAC, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Through the “One dLocal” platform (one direct API, one platform, and one contract), global companies can accept payments, send pay-outs and settle funds globally without the need to manage separate pay-in and pay-out processors, set up numerous local entities, and integrate multiple acquirers and payment methods in each market. Definition of selected operational metrics“API” means application programming interface, which is a general term for programming techniques that are available for software developers when they integrate with a particular service or application. In the payments industry, APIs are usually provided by any party participating in the money flow (such as payment gateways, processors, and service providers) to facilitate the money transfer process. “Cross-border” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting in one currency and settling into a different currency and/or in a different geography. “Local payment methods” refers to any payment method that is processed in the country where the end user of the merchant sending or receiving payments is located, which include credit and debit cards, cash payments, bank transfers, mobile money, and digital wallets. “Local-to-local” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal is collecting and settling in the same currency. “Net Revenue Retention Rate” or “NRR” is a U.S. dollar-based measure of retention and growth of dLocal’s merchants. NRR is calculated for a period or year by dividing the Current Period/Year Revenue by the Prior Period/Year Revenue. The Prior Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us to all our customers in the prior period. The Current Period/Year Revenue is the revenue billed by us in the current period to the same customers included in the Prior Period/Year Revenue. Current Period/Year Revenue includes revenues from any upselling and cross-selling across products, geographies, and payment methods to such merchant customers, and is net of any contractions or attrition, in respect of such merchant customers, and excludes revenue from new customers on-boarded in the preceding twelve months. As most of dLocal revenues come from existing merchants, the NRR rate is a key metric used by management, and we believe it is useful for investors in order to assess our retention of existing customers and growth in revenues from our existing customer base. “Pay-in” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal’s merchant customers receive payment from their customers. “Pay-out” means a payment transaction whereby dLocal disburses money in local currency to the business partners or customers of dLocal’s merchant customers. “Revenue from New Merchants” means the revenue billed by us to merchant customers that we did not bill revenues in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year. “Revenue from Existing Merchants” means the revenue billed by us in the last twelve months to the merchant customers that we billed revenue in the same quarter (or period) of the prior year. “TPV” dLocal presents total payment volume, or TPV, which is an operating metric of the aggregate value of all payments successfully processed through dLocal’s payments platform. Because revenue depends significantly on the total value of transactions processed through the dLocal platform, management believes that TPV is an indicator of the success of dLocal’s global merchants, the satisfaction of their end users, and the scale and growth of dLocal’s business. Forward-looking statementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements convey dLocal’s current expectations or forecasts of future events, including guidance in respect of total payment volume, gross profit, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit CAGR and Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit margin. Forward-looking statements regarding dLocal and amounts stated as guidance are based on current management expectations and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause dLocal’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are described in the “Risk Factors,” “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” sections of dLocal’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless required by law, dLocal undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events after the date hereof. In addition, dLocal is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking guidance for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA over gross profit, which are forward-looking non-IFRS measures, because dLocal cannot reliably predict certain of their necessary components, such as impairment gains/(losses) on financial assets, transaction costs, and inflation adjustment. dLocal

Strong funded backlog of $5.1 million and $12.7 million in combined Cash and Account Receivable balances as of January 31, 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The substantial revenue growth reported by Red Cat Holdings indicates a positive trajectory for the company's financial health and market position. The 250% year-over-year increase in revenue and 49% sequential growth are significant metrics that suggest increasing market demand and successful expansion strategies. The company's entry into new markets like Latin America and the Middle East, alongside strategic partnerships for technology integration, such as with Primordial Labs, are likely to enhance its competitive edge and diversify its revenue streams.Furthermore, the sale of the Consumer segment and the focus on the Enterprise segment, particularly with Teal Drones, reflects a strategic pivot towards higher-margin and potentially more scalable business operations. The strong funded backlog, which stands at $5.1 million, provides a clear visibility of future revenues and indicates a robust order book, which is a positive sign for investors. The financial flexibility provided by the $12.7 million in Cash and Account Receivable balances is also noteworthy, as it may allow Red Cat to invest in further growth initiatives or weather unforeseen market conditions. Defense Industry Analyst Red Cat's positioning as a finalist in the U.S. Army's Short Range Reconnaissance program and the anticipated participation in the Department of Defense Replicator Initiative are pivotal developments. The defense sector is known for its stringent requirements and long procurement cycles, so being a finalist indicates that Red Cat's products meet high operational standards. The $3M extended contract award is a testament to this and could lead to significant future contracts.The passing of the American Security Drone Act by Congress is another critical factor, as it could lead to increased demand for secure and domestically produced drones, benefiting companies like Red Cat. The $750k Manufacturing Modernization Grant from the State of Utah for Teal Drones underscores the support and confidence in the company's manufacturing capabilities, which may lead to improved production efficiencies and cost savings in the long term. Financial Analyst The financial health of Red Cat is underscored by the strategic divestiture of its Consumer segment, which resulted in the receipt of 4,250,000 shares of UMAC common stock, a $1 million cash payment and a $2 million note payable. This move not only streamlines the company's focus on its core Enterprise segment but also strengthens its balance sheet. The transaction provides liquidity and potential future income from the stock holdings. Investors should note the implication of this divestiture on the company's financials, as it may lead to a more focused investment in growth areas and potential appreciation in the value of the UMAC stock.The guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting $7 million in revenue, indicates management's confidence in the company's growth trajectory. However, it is essential to monitor the actual performance against this guidance in the future to assess the accuracy of management's forecasts and the company's ability to meet its targets. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM Red Cat reports record revenue for the company in Fiscal Third Quarter 2024, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growthSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Red Cat Holdings, Inc.

She has done a stellar job, and the company expects this to become a permanent position for Lunger,” added Thompson.

The company achieved a gross profit increase of 54% to $6.2 million and $21.5 million for the respective periods. Augmedix anticipates revenue of $60 to $62 million in 2024, reflecting strong growth prospects. Positive Revenue surged by 45% to $12.7 million in Q4 and $44.9 million for the full year 2023. Gross profit saw a significant increase of 54% to $6.2 million in Q4 and $21.5 million for the full year 2023. Net loss decreased by 20% to $4.5 million in Q4 and 22% to $19.2 million for the full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved by 26% to $3.3 million in Q4 and 22% to $15.2 million for the full year 2023. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, stood at $46.2 million, reflecting a solid financial position. Augmedix expects to generate approximately $60 to $62 million of revenue in 2024, highlighting positive growth expectations. The company's strategic partner HCA Healthcare is planning a broad roll-out of Augmedix's solutions across its network of hospitals, indicating strong industry partnerships. The introduction of Augmedix Go, a clinician-controlled mobile app, has received positive feedback and is expected to drive further growth. The company's diversified product portfolio and focus on profitability goals position Augmedix as a market leader in the medical documentation sector. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results presented by Augmedix display a robust revenue increase of 45% year-over-year, which is a significant indicator of the company's growth trajectory. The reported net revenue retention rate of 152% for Health Enterprise customers is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that not only is Augmedix retaining its customer base, but it is also expanding its revenue streams from existing clients. This metric is often seen as a bellwether for future revenue stability and growth potential.From a profitability perspective, the gross margin expansion of 300 basis points to 49.3% is commendable, demonstrating operational efficiency and cost management. However, the company continues to operate at a loss, with a net loss reduction of 20% compared to the previous year. Investors may view the reduced operating cash burn positively, as it reflects a move towards financial sustainability. The capital raise in November is likely to support further expansion and investment in product development, which could be a catalyst for future growth. Market Research Analyst Augmedix's strategic positioning in the ambient AI medical documentation sector is significant, considering the growing demand for efficient healthcare documentation solutions. The launch and anticipated roll-out of Augmedix Go, both in ambulatory and emergency room settings, demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and meeting the needs of clinicians. The market's positive response to the app's quality and acceptance by clinicians could be a driver for increased adoption rates.Additionally, the partnership with HCA Healthcare and plans for a broad network roll-out could substantially increase market penetration and reinforce Augmedix's presence in the healthcare sector. As the company continues to target both ambulatory and acute care settings with its portfolio, the potential market leadership position it aims for could materialize, provided that the execution aligns with strategic goals and customer acquisition continues to accelerate. Healthcare Technology Analyst Augmedix's performance in a rapidly evolving healthcare technology market is impressive, with its HITRUST certification adding a layer of credibility and trust in its solutions. The company's focus on ambient AI technology for medical documentation aligns with the industry's move towards digitalization and automation to improve efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on clinicians.The integration of structured data and bi-directional communication channels into its product offerings demonstrates a deep understanding of healthcare providers' needs. As the company anticipates strong growth and gross margin expansion in 2024, it will be important to monitor how its investments in technology and product development translate into market share gains and customer satisfaction. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Augmedix (Nasdaq: AUGX), a leader in ambient AI medical documentation and data solutions, today reported financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023. “The fourth quarter was a solid end to a strong year for Augmedix both operationally and financially,” stated Augmedix CEO Manny Krakaris. “We delivered a 45% increase in revenue to $12.7 million, ahead of our most recent guidance, driven by a 44% increase in clinicians in service and net revenue retention of 152%. Additionally, we made steady progress toward our profitability goals by increasing gross profit by 54% to $6.2 million, a margin expansion of 300 basis points to 49.3%, which contributed to the reduction in our operating cash burn.” “We are pleased with the early performance of Augmedix Go, our clinician-controlled mobile app that uses ambient AI technology and structured data to create a fully automated draft medical note,” continued Krakaris. “Feedback has been encouraging in terms of quality and acceptance by clinicians. Initial orders for the ambulatory version since it was made generally available in December have met our expectations. Meanwhile, the emergency room version of Augmedix Go is on track for its own General Availability release by the end of March. Independently, our strategic partner HCA Healthcare is making plans for a broad roll-out across its network of hospitals.” Concluded Krakaris, “With expanded capital resources, we are accelerating our efforts to capture the growing medical documentation opportunity in front of us. We are highly confident that our broad portfolio of products, including a high-performing automated documentation solution, that works effectively across ambulatory and acute care settings, structured data, a bi-directional communication channel to the point of care, and HITRUST certification, provide Augmedix with a differentiated offering that will enable Augmedix to be one of the market leaders as the market matures over the coming years. In 2024, we anticipate another year of strong growth and continued gross margin expansion that will benefit from our increased investment from our November capital raise proceeds.” Quarter Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Change 2023 2022 ChangeFinancial Highlights: Revenues$12,680 $8,751 45% $44,855 $30,933 45%Gross profit$6,245 $4,049 54% $21,526 $13,954 54%Gross margin49.3 % 46.3 % 300 bps 48.0 % 45.1 % 290 bpsNet loss$(4,492) $(5,599) 20% $(19,171) $(24,449) 22%Loss per share$(0.09) $(0.15) 40% $(0.44) $(0.65) 32%Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)$(3,306) $(4,470) 26% $(15,210) $(19,404) 22% Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights All comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are to the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Definition of Key Metrics Average Clinicians in Service: We define a clinician in service as an individual doctor, nurse practitioner or other healthcare professional using our products. We average the month-end number of clinicians in service for all months in the measurement period and the number of clinicians in service at the end of the month immediately preceding the measurement period. We believe growth in the average number of clinicians in service is a key indicator of the performance of our business as it demonstrates our ability to penetrate the market and grow our business. Average Annual Revenue Per Clinician: Average revenue per clinician is determined as total revenue, excluding Data Services revenue, recognized during the period presented divided by the average number of clinicians in service during that same period. Using the number of clinicians in service at the end of each month, we derive an average number of clinicians in service for the periods presented. The average annual revenue per clinician will vary based upon minimum hours of service requested by clinicians, pricing, and our product mix. Dollar-Based Net Revenue Retention: We define a ""Health Enterprise"" as a company or network of doctors that has at least 50 clinicians currently employed or affiliated that could utilize our services. Dollar-based net revenue retention is determined as the revenue from Health Enterprises as of twelve months prior to such period end as compared to revenue from these same Health Enterprises as of the current period end, or current period revenue. Current period revenue includes any expansion or new products and is net of contraction or churn over the trailing twelve months but excludes revenue from new Health Enterprises in the current period. We believe growth in dollar-based net revenue retention is a key indicator of the performance of our business as it demonstrates our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expansion of users and products, as well as our ability to retain existing customers.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted Operating Expense as total operating expenses less share-based compensation expense. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Augmedix changed its computation of Adjusted EBITDA to better reflect the performance of the Company’s business predominantly due to the equity financing that occurred in November of 2023, which significantly increased the Company’s cash balance. We now define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense; income tax expense (benefit); and other income (expense) net, which consists of interest expense on our debt facility, interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, realized foreign currency gains and losses, loss on extinguishment of debt, change in fair value of a warrant liability, and grant income from the Bangladesh government related to our Bangladesh subsidiary. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company did not exclude interest income earned on cash balances, realized foreign currency transaction gains or losses or grant income received from the Bangladesh government from the computation of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA has been recast in prior periods to reflect this change for consistency in presentation. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from reviewing these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in accordance with GAAP. For more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Metrics table in this press release.

Seven out of 15 patients achieved a confirmed partial response with a seven-month median duration of response. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The data indicating a partial response in nearly half of the efficacy evaluable population presents a significant stride in the treatment landscape for advanced ovarian cancer, which often sees low response rates due to the disease's aggressiveness and the development of resistance to conventional therapies. The seven-month median duration of response is a notable outcome, considering the heavily pre-treated nature of the patient cohort. It suggests that rezatapopt could potentially offer a meaningful extension of disease control for patients who have exhausted other treatment options.The focus on a specific mutation, TP53 Y220C, exemplifies the shift towards personalized medicine in oncology. This precision approach could lead to better patient outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources by targeting therapies to those most likely to benefit. However, it's important to consider the scalability of such treatments, as the mutation-specific approach requires comprehensive genetic testing and may limit the eligible patient population. Medical Research Analyst The favorable safety profile of rezatapopt is a important aspect of this study, particularly in a heavily pre-treated population where the tolerance for adverse effects is often reduced. The predominance of low-grade treatment-related adverse events is encouraging and could contribute to higher patient compliance and quality of life during treatment. However, the long-term safety data will be critical to fully understand the risk-benefit ratio of the therapy.Moreover, the inclusion of patients who are homologous recombination deficiency positive and those with a BRCA2 mutation suggests that rezatapopt might be effective across various genetic backgrounds within the TP53 Y220C mutation subset. This could have implications for future combination strategies, potentially with PARP inhibitors or other targeted agents, to further enhance efficacy in these difficult-to-treat populations. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the progress of rezatapopt through clinical trials is a positive signal for investors in PMV Pharmaceuticals, indicating potential future revenue streams from a new oncology product. The specificity of the drug for TP53 Y220C and KRAS wild-type tumors positions the company in the niche but growing field of precision oncology. As the Phase 2 trial is registrational, a successful outcome could expedite the path to market approval and commercialization.However, the commercial success will depend on the prevalence of the TP53 Y220C mutation in the wider cancer population and the ability of healthcare systems to identify and refer appropriate patients. It will also be influenced by the competitive landscape of ovarian cancer treatments, reimbursement policies and the eventual pricing strategy adopted by PMV Pharmaceuticals. 03/18/2024 - 04:01 PM Phase 1 analysis from the PYNNACLE Phase 1/2 study showed promising efficacy of rezatapopt (PC14586) in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced ovarian cancer harboring a TP53 Y220C mutation featured in a late-breaking oral presentation at 2024 SGO Annual MeetingOf the 15 patients in the efficacy evaluable population, seven patients achieved a confirmed partial response with a seven-month median duration of response and a favorable safety profileRezatapopt is a first-in-class precision oncology investigational therapy in patients with advanced solid tumors with a TP53 Y220C mutation and KRAS wild-type which is being evaluated in a registrational Phase 2 study PRINCETON, N.J., March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PMV Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Negative Revenue decline in Q3 due to competition, end of relief programs, and store renovation slow-down Operating loss increased in Q3 compared to the previous year Net loss reported for both Q3 and nine-month period of fiscal 2024 Higher selling and general administrative expenses led to an operating loss for the nine-month period Market Research Analyst The specialty grocery sector, particularly those focusing on ethnic foods, is a niche yet growing segment of the retail industry. Maison Solutions' strategic expansion through store renovations and acquisitions is a bold move to capture more market share. However, the reported decline in revenues and net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the prior year, indicates competitive pressures and the end of COVID-19 relief programs are impacting the company's bottom line.While the increased cash and equivalents position following their IPO and private placement suggests a strong liquidity position, the net cash used in operating activities raises concerns about the company's cash flow sustainability. Investors should monitor whether the new store openings and renovations can reverse the trend of declining sales and create a positive cash flow from operations. Financial Analyst Maison Solutions' financial performance shows a concerning trend with net losses widening in the third quarter. The decrease in gross margin, from 25.6% to 23.4%, suggests that the company is facing margin compression, likely due to increased competition and possibly inefficient cost management. The drop in perishable goods revenue is particularly noteworthy as these items typically drive store traffic and can indicate reduced customer loyalty or shifts in consumer behavior.Investors should consider the long-term viability of the company's expansion strategy against the backdrop of these financial results. The opening of a flagship store could be a significant growth catalyst, but it also represents a substantial investment at a time when profitability is under pressure. The balance between growth and profitability will be key in assessing Maison Solutions' financial health. Retail Industry Consultant Renovations and new store openings in the retail sector are often a double-edged sword. While they can attract new customers and increase sales, they also require significant capital investment and can disrupt existing operations, as seen with the temporary slowdown at Maison Solutions' El Monte store. The challenge for Maison Solutions will be to ensure that these investments translate into a superior shopping experience that drives increased foot traffic and customer retention.The use of a recently purchased software suite to optimize store layout and shelf displays is a positive step towards leveraging technology for revenue growth. It's essential that Maison Solutions effectively integrates this technology to enhance the customer experience and streamline operations, thereby improving financial outcomes in future quarters. 03/18/2024 - 02:13 PM MONTEREY PARK, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 18, 2024 / Maison Solutions Inc. (""Maison Solutions"" or the ""Company""), (Nasdaq:MSS), a U.S.-based specialty grocery retailer offering traditional Asian food and merchandise to modern consumers, today announced financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2024 ended January 31, 2024.""We continue to make considerable operational progress through store renovations, new store openings, and acquisitions of additional stores to efficiently grow our footprint,"" said John Xu, President and Chief Executive Officer of Maison Solutions. ""Our El Monte store, which is the first of our planned store renovations, is on track to be completed later this month, and will provide a vibrant, contemporary shopping experience for customers, while leveraging our recently purchased software suite to drive revenues through optimization of store design, layout and shelf displays. Additionally, we remain on schedule to open our flagship, 37,000 square-foot, store in Rowland Heights, California later this year, which we believe will become one of the largest and most advanced Asian grocery supercenters in the state.Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Financial ResultsTotal revenues, net, were $13.6 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, compared with $15.6 million for the prior-year quarter. Results primarily reflected competition from two newly opened Asian supermarkets near the Company's San Gabriel store, the end of certain COVID-19 customer relief programs, and a temporary slow-down at the Company's El Monte store during its renovation. Revenue for perishable goods, which include meat, seafood, vegetables and fruit, were $7.2 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, versus $8.7 million for the same period last year. Revenues for non-perishable goods, which include grocery, liquor, cigarettes, lottery tickets, newspapers, reusable bags, non-food, and health products, were $6.4 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, compared with $6.9 million for last year's fiscal third quarter.Total cost of revenues, which includes rental expense, depreciation, the direct costs of purchased merchandise, shrinkage costs, store supplies, and inbound shipping costs, decreased 10.5 percent to $10.4 million for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, from $11.6 million for fiscal 2023 third quarter. The decline primarily is related to lower sales and reduced freight costs.Gross profit for the fiscal 2024 third quarter equaled $3.2 million, compared with $4.0 million from the same period last year. Gross margin was 23.4 percent, versus 25.6 percent for the same quarter last year.Operating loss was approximately $307,000 for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, compared with a loss of approximately $48,000 for the fiscal 2023 third quarter. The change mainly was due to the revenue and gross profit declines.Net loss attributable to Maison Solutions was approximately $549,000, or a loss of $0.03 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, versus net income attributable to Maison Solutions of approximately $988,000, or $0.06 per fully diluted share, for the prior-year period. Contributing to the net loss in the fiscal 2024 third quarter was a reduction in ""other income,"" primarily due to $1.3 million in employee retention credits received by the Company related to the COVID-19 pandemic in last year's fiscal third quarter that was not repeated in the fiscal 2024 period.At January 31, 2024, the Company had cash and equivalents of $9.4 million, up from $2.6 million at April 30, 2023. Maison Solutions completed an initial public offering on October 10, 2023, generating gross proceeds of approximately $10.0 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions.

Perishable goods revenues were $22.4 million, versus $23.1 million for the first nine months of the last fiscal year. Non-perishable goods revenues were $18.7 million, versus $18.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Total cost of revenues were $31.7 million for the fiscal 2024 year-to-date period, compared with $31.8 million for the prior-year period.Gross profit was $9.4 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. Gross margin improved by 10 basis points to 22.9 percent, from 22.8 percent for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Operating loss was approximately $270,000 for the fiscal 2024 nine-month period, compared with operating income of approximately $80,000 for the same period in fiscal 2023. The change was principally related to higher selling and general and administrative expenses.Net loss attributable to Maison Solutions was approximately $562,000, or a loss of $0.03 per share, for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, versus net income attributable to Maison Solutions of approximately $921,000, or $0.06 per fully diluted share, for the prior-year period.About Maison Solutions Inc.Maison Solutions Inc. is a U.S.-based specialty grocery retailer offering traditional Asian food and merchandise to U.S. consumers, particularly to members of Asian-American communities.

The therapy aims to restore enzymatic function with a single treatment, potentially halting or slowing disease progression. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval of Lenmeldy for early-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) represents a significant milestone in rare disease treatment. The therapy's mechanism, involving the insertion of functional ARSA gene copies into a patient's hematopoietic stem cells, potentially offers a durable solution to halt or decelerate disease progression with a single treatment. This is a breakthrough for a condition where patients previously had no definitive treatment options, shifting the paradigm from palliative care to proactive management.From a medical research perspective, the long-term data suggesting up to 12 years of follow-up is particularly compelling. It implies that the treatment may offer sustained benefits over an extended period, which is critical for a disease that progresses rapidly and has historically led to death within a few years of onset. Furthermore, the use of a lentiviral vector to modify stem cells ex vivo before infusion is a sophisticated technique that could pave the way for similar treatments for other genetic disorders. Healthcare Economist The approval of Lenmeldy by the FDA also has significant economic implications for the healthcare system. The potential to transform a rapidly progressing, fatal condition into a manageable disease could reduce the long-term costs associated with intensive care and end-of-life support. While the upfront costs of gene therapies are typically high, the trade-off may be justified by the reduction in cumulative healthcare expenses and the improvement in quality of life for patients and their families.However, it is essential to consider the broader economic impact, including the need for universal newborn screening to identify patients before symptom onset. The infrastructure and funding required for such screening programs will need careful consideration. Additionally, the transfer of the Priority Review Voucher to GSK highlights the strategic business relationships and potential financial benefits that can arise from the development of orphan drugs. Market Research Analyst The approval of a novel gene therapy like Lenmeldy can have a profound impact on the stock market, particularly for companies involved in its development and commercialization. Investors often respond positively to FDA approvals, especially for treatments addressing unmet medical needs in rare diseases. The Priority Review Voucher received by Orchard Therapeutics, which can be sold or transferred, is a valuable asset that can expedite the review process for future drug candidates, thus potentially increasing a company's market value.Additionally, the acquisition of Orchard Therapeutics by Kyowa Kirin may be viewed favorably by the market as a strategic move to enhance their portfolio in gene therapies. The approval of Lenmeldy could signal further advancements and partnerships within the biotech industry, potentially impacting the stock prices of companies in this sector. 03/18/2024 - 03:41 PM One-time treatment with Lenmeldy has shown the potential to restore enzymatic function to stop or slow disease progression, with up to 12 years of follow-up (median 6.76 years)TOKYO and LONDON and BOSTON, March 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orchard Therapeutics, recently acquired by Kyowa Kirin with the goal of accelerating the delivery of new gene therapies to patients around the globe, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lenmeldy™ (atidarsagene autotemcel), formerly known as OTL-200, for the treatment of children with pre-symptomatic late infantile (PSLI), pre-symptomatic early juvenile (PSEJ) or early symptomatic early juvenile (ESEJ)—collectively referred to as early-onset—metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). “The FDA approval of Lenmeldy opens up tremendous new possibilities for children in the U.S. with early-onset MLD who previously had no treatment options beyond supportive and end-of-life care,” said Bobby Gaspar, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief executive officer of Orchard Therapeutics. “MLD is a rapidly progressing, life-limiting and ultimately fatal rare disease that has a devastating impact on afflicted children and their families. This achievement is the culmination of decades of research and development in partnership with our academic and clinical collaborators at the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the patients and families who participated in our clinical trials as well as to the broader MLD community—we would not be here today without your contributions and support.” Dr. Gaspar continued, “I am also incredibly proud of the entire team at Orchard for their tireless effort to make this moment possible, and we look forward to ensuring broad and sustainable access to this remarkable innovation for eligible patients in need.” MLD is a rare, fatal genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the gene responsible for encoding the enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA) leading to neurological damage and developmental regression due to the accumulation of fats called sulfatides in the brain and other areas of the body which, when not broken down, damage the central nervous system over time. In its most severe form, babies develop normally but in late infancy start to rapidly lose the ability to walk, talk and interact with the world around them. These children eventually deteriorate into a vegetative state, which may require 24-hour intensive care, and the majority pass away within five years of disease onset, creating an enormous emotional and financial burden on the family. Lenmeldy aims to correct the underlying genetic cause of MLD by inserting one or more functional copies of the human ARSA gene ex vivo (outside the body) into the genome of a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) using a lentiviral vector. The genetically repaired cells are infused back into the patient, where, once engrafted, they differentiate into multiple cell types, some of which migrate across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system and express the functional enzyme. This approach has the potential to restore enzymatic function to stop or slow disease progression with a single treatment. “This is a momentous occasion and I commend the FDA for recognizing the clinical impact Lenmeldy has on this cruel disease,” said Barbara Burton, M.D., attending physician, genetics, genomics and metabolism at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. “For too long, my colleagues and I have consoled families at their most vulnerable times—usually following an arduous diagnostic odyssey, coping with a dire prognosis and being told there were no treatments, and then having to watch their young child slip away. With this approval, we are now one significant step closer to ensuring future generations of children, families and healthcare professionals no longer need to experience first-hand the terrible manifestations this disease has on untreated patients.” “As a mother who lost a child to MLD, it is difficult to articulate how much of a watershed moment this is for patients, families and advocates,” said Maria Kefalas, Ph.D., co-founder of the Calliope Joy Foundation and a founding member of Cure MLD. “I, and so many others in our community, have made it our life’s work to end the horror caused by MLD so other families may not have to face the same terrible fate as ours. Today, we are closer than ever to making that vision a reality, but there’s still more work to be done. With the first therapy for this childhood disease now approved, we must act urgently and collaboratively to enable universal newborn screening for MLD in the U.S. so babies with these pathogenic mutations can be diagnosed and referred for appropriate treatment before the onset of symptoms.” Lenmeldy was granted Priority Review in September 2023. It was previously given both Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designations from FDA. In connection with the approval, Orchard Therapeutics received a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which will be transferred to GSK in accordance with the terms of the original licensing agreement. Orchard Therapeutics will provide more details about the launch of Lenmeldy in the U.S. through a separate announcement this week. Overview of Clinical Development Program and Results The FDA approval of Lenmeldy is based on data from 37 pediatric patients with early-onset MLD, enrolled in two single-arm, open-label clinical studies or treated under European expanded access frameworks, who received a one-time administration of the gene therapy and compared with natural history data. All treated patients were administered Lenmeldy and subsequently monitored at Ospedale San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. With more than 12 years of follow-up in the earliest treated patients (median 6.76 years), treatment with Lenmeldy significantly extended overall survival and resulted in the preservation of motor function and cognitive skills in most late infantile MLD patients past ages at which untreated patients showed severe cognitive and motor impairments. Lenmeldy also resulted in the preservation of motor function and cognitive skills in some early juvenile MLD patients which is not expected when compared to untreated patients. The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 10%) were: febrile neutropenia (85%), stomatitis (77%), respiratory tract infections (54%), rash (33%), device related infections (31%), other viral infections (28%), pyrexia (21%), gastroenteritis (21%), and hepatomegaly (18%). The most common laboratory abnormalities were: elevated D-dimer (67%), neutropenia (28%), and elevated liver enzymes (23%). Please see below for additional details and Important Safety Information. About MLDMLD is a rare and life-threatening inherited disease of the body’s metabolic system estimated to occur in approximately one in every 100,000 live births based on existing literature. MLD is caused by a mutation in the arylsulfatase-A (ARSA) gene that results in the accumulation of sulfatides in the brain and other areas of the body, including the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and/or spleen. Over time, the nervous system is damaged, leading to neurological problems such as motor, behavioral and cognitive regression, severe spasticity and seizures. Patients with MLD gradually lose the ability to move, talk, swallow, eat and see. In its late infantile form, mortality at five years from onset is estimated at 50 percent and 44 percent at 10 years for juvenile patients.i About LenmeldyLenmeldy™ (atidarsagene autotemcel), formerly known as OTL-200, is the only approved therapy in the U.S. for the treatment of children with pre-symptomatic late infantile (PSLI), pre-symptomatic early juvenile (PSEJ) or early-symptomatic early juvenile (ESEJ) metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). For additional details about Lenmeldy, please refer to the full Prescribing Information. In Europe, Lenmeldy is known as Libmeldy®, where it has been approved by the European Commission (EC), UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic). For more information about Libmeldy, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) available on the EMA website. The program was originated by and developed in partnership with the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget) in Milan, Italy. It was licensed by Orchard Therapeutics from GSK in 2018. INDICATION LENMELDYTM (atidarsagene autotemcel) is an autologous hematopoietic stem cell-based gene therapy indicated for the treatment of children with pre-symptomatic late infantile (PSLI), pre-symptomatic early juvenile (PSEJ), or early symptomatic early juvenile (ESEJ) metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Thrombosis and Thromboembolic Events:Treatment with LENMELDY may increase the risk of thrombosis and thromboembolic events. A child with PSEJ MLD died after experiencing a left hemisphere cerebral infarction secondary to a thrombotic event in a large blood vessel approximately 1 year after treatment with LENMELDY. Evaluate the risk factors for thrombosis prior to and after LENMELDY infusion according to best clinical practice. Consider monitoring D-dimer levels after LENMELDY treatment. Encephalitis:Treatment with LENMELDY may increase the risk of encephalitis. A child with ESEJ developed a serious event of encephalitis after treatment with LENMELDY. The etiology of this event is unclear but attribution to LENMELDY cannot be ruled out. Treatment with LENMELDY may trigger a relapsing-remitting pattern of disease progression. No other events related to encephalitis have been reported during the clinical development of LENMELDY. Monitor children for signs or symptoms of encephalitis after LENMELDY treatment. Serious Infection:In the period between start of conditioning and within 1 year after LENMELDY treatment, severe Grade 3 infections occurred in 39% of all children (21% bacterial, 5% viral, 5% bacterial and viral or bacterial and fungal, and 8% unspecified). Grade 3 febrile neutropenia developed within 1 month after LENMELDY infusion in 82% of children. In the event of febrile neutropenia, monitor for signs and symptoms of infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated. Monitor children for signs and symptoms of infection after myeloablative conditioning and LENMELDY infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic antimicrobials according to best clinical practice. Veno-Occlusive Disease:Three children (8%) treated in clinical trials of LENMELDY developed veno-occlusive disease (VOD) with one Grade 4 SAE and two Grade 3 AEs. None of these three events met Hy’s Law criteria. Monitor children for signs and symptoms of VOD including liver function tests in all children during the first month after LENMELDY infusion. Consider prophylaxis for VOD with an anti-thrombotic such as defibrotide or ursodeoxycholic acid based on risk factors for VOD and best clinical practice. Delayed Platelet Engraftment (DPE):DPE has been observed with LENMELDY treatment. Bleeding risk is increased prior to platelet engraftment and may continue after engraftment in children with prolonged thrombocytopenia. In clinical trials of LENMELDY, 4 (10%) children had delayed platelet engraftment after day 60 (range day 67-109), with 3 children requiring platelet transfusions until engraftment occurred. Patients should be informed of the risk of bleeding until platelet recovery has been achieved. Monitor patients for thrombocytopenia and bleeding until platelet engraftment and recovery are achieved. Neutrophil Engraftment Failure: There is a potential risk of neutrophil engraftment failure after treatment with LENMELDY. Monitor neutrophil counts until engraftment has been achieved. If neutrophil engraftment failure occurs in a child treated with LENMELDY, provide rescue treatment with the unmanipulated back-up collection of CD34+ cells. Insertional Oncogenesis: There is a potential risk of LVV-mediated insertional oncogenesis after treatment with LENMELDY. Children treated with LENMELDY may develop hematologic malignancies and should be monitored lifelong. Monitor for hematologic malignancies with a complete blood count (with differential) annually and integration site analysis as warranted for at least 15 years after treatment with LENMELDY. In the event that a malignancy occurs, contact Orchard Therapeutics at 1-888-878-0185 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of samples for testing. Hypersensitivity Reactions: The dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in LENMELDY may cause hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis which is potentially life-threatening and requires immediate intervention. Hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis can occur in children with and without prior exposure to DSMO. Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions during infusion and after infusion. Anti-Retroviral Use: Children should not take prophylactic HIV anti-retroviral medications for at least one month prior to mobilization, or for the expected duration of time needed for the elimination of the medications. Anti-retroviral medications may interfere with the manufacturing of LENMELDY. If a child requires antiretrovirals for HIV prophylaxis, initiation of LENMELDY treatment should be delayed until confirmation of a negative test for HIV. Interference With Serology Testing: Due to the likelihood of a false-positive test for HIV, children who have received LENMELDY should not be screened for HIV infection using a PCR-based assay. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy TestingAs a precautionary measure, a negative serum pregnancy test must be confirmed prior to the start of mobilization, and reconfirmed prior to conditioning procedures, and before administration of LENMELDY in females of childbearing potential. Contraception Consult the Prescribing Information of the mobilization and conditioning agents for information on the need for effective contraception. Males capable of fathering a child and females of childbearing age should use an effective method of contraception from start of mobilization through at least 6 months after administration of LENMELDY. InfertilityThere are no data on the effects of LENMELDY on fertility. Data are available on the risk of infertility with myeloablative conditioning. In clinical trials of LENMELDY, seven children (50% of females) developed ovarian failure. Advise children of the option to cryopreserve semen or ova before treatment, if appropriate.

The Total Consideration for each series of Notes and the terms of the Tender Offers are detailed in the press release. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer by Xerox Holdings Corporation for its 2024 and 2025 notes is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at optimizing the company's debt structure. From a financial analyst's perspective, the key points to assess are the interest rates of the notes, the total consideration and the timing of the tender offers. The 3.800% rate for the 2024 notes and the 5.000% rate for the 2025 notes indicate a proactive approach to managing interest expenses, particularly in an environment where interest rates are expected to fluctuate. The fixed spread and early tender payment details suggest an incentive for note holders to participate in the tender offer, which can be seen as a move to manage the company's short-term liquidity needs. The proration factor of approximately 66.608% for the 2025 notes that were tendered indicates a demand that exceeds the maximum tender cap, reflecting investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness. It is also noteworthy that the tender offers are being executed at a premium to the face value of the notes, which is typically done to entice note holders to relinquish their securities ahead of maturity. This strategy could indicate that Xerox Holdings is aiming to reduce its debt burden or refinance at more favorable terms, given the current market conditions. The impact on the company's financial leverage and interest coverage ratios will be critical to monitor in subsequent financial reporting periods. Debt Capital Markets Analyst Examining Xerox Holdings' tender offers from a debt capital markets perspective reveals insights into the company's capital structure strategy. The tender offer, especially when it involves a premium and a fixed spread, indicates an attempt to manage the company’s cost of capital amidst a dynamic interest rate environment. The utilization of U.S. Treasury securities as a reference for setting the fixed spread is a common practice that aligns the offer with market expectations and provides a transparent benchmark for investors. The early settlement date and the additional payment for early tenders serve as a liquidity event for note holders and can be interpreted as a signal from management regarding their confidence in the company's cash flow management and future financial prospects. Moreover, the pro rata acceptance of the 2025 notes due to oversubscription suggests a careful balance between satisfying investor demand and maintaining fiscal prudence. This approach could potentially minimize future refinancing risk by addressing maturities in a staggered fashion, which is a positive sign for bondholders and equity investors alike, as it demonstrates a methodical approach to liability management. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, Xerox Holdings' tender offer announcement can influence market perception and investor sentiment towards the company. The willingness to pay a premium for the notes and the specific terms of the tender offer may lead to a reassessment of the company's risk profile and financial stability by analysts and investors. Market reaction to such financial maneuvers can vary, but typically, a successful tender offer that reduces higher-cost debt and potentially improves the company's debt maturity profile is viewed favorably. It may lead to an improved credit rating or outlook, which in turn could lower the cost of future borrowing for the company and positively impact the stock price. The pro rata basis acceptance and the oversubscription scenario for the 2025 notes could also be interpreted as a sign of a robust appetite for the company's debt instruments, which may reflect broader market confidence in Xerox Holdings' operational and financial strategy. This aspect of the tender offers could be leveraged by the company in future capital market activities. 03/18/2024 - 02:15 PM NORWALK, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xerox Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ: XRX) (“Xerox Holdings”) today announced the consideration payable in connection with the previously announced cash tender offers for the 2024 Notes and 2025 Notes (each as defined below).

The tender offers are being made pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the offer to purchase, dated March 4, 2024, as amended by Xerox Holdings’ press release dated March 5, 2024 (as amended, the ""Offer to Purchase""). The tender offers comprise (i) Xerox Holdings’ offer to purchase for cash up to $362 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.000% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) and (ii) Xerox Corporation’s (“Xerox” and, together with Xerox Holdings, the “Company”) offer to purchase for cash any and all of its 3.800% senior notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes” and, together with the 2025 Notes, the “Notes”) (collectively, the “Tender Offers”). The Company refers investors to the Offer to Purchase for the complete terms and conditions of the Tender Offers. The ""Total Consideration"" listed in the table above per $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes was determined at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on March 18, 2024.

Holders will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase from the applicable last interest payment date up to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date (""Accrued Interest""). Because the amount of 2025 Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn exceeds the Maximum Tender Cap (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), any such tendered 2025 Notes will be accepted on a pro rata basis as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, subject to a proration factor of approximately 66.608%.

Market Research Analyst In the competitive landscape of ecommerce logistics, the expansion of regional delivery services by Pitney Bowes is a strategic move to capture market share and improve customer satisfaction. By reaching 90% of the US population within 1-3 days, they are positioning themselves as a formidable competitor to established players like UPS and FedEx, who also offer similar delivery windows. The move could potentially lead to an increase in market penetration, especially among retailers who prioritize quick delivery to enhance customer experience.The introduction of Gift Tracking and a new returns solution indicates a focus on post-purchase customer experience, which is important for customer retention and brand loyalty. The BOXpoll survey results suggest that there is a market for enhanced tracking services, particularly among younger consumers. This could translate to higher customer engagement and possibly additional revenue streams if the feature attracts new clients or encourages existing ones to increase their usage of Pitney Bowes services. E-commerce Strategy Consultant For e-commerce businesses, the post-purchase experience is often a differentiator and Pitney Bowes' new offerings in this space are noteworthy. Gift Tracking could redefine the gifting experience in the e-commerce sector, potentially setting a new industry standard. The ability for gift-givers to personalize the delivery experience is an innovative approach that could lead to increased customer satisfaction and differentiation in a crowded market. However, the adoption rate and actual usage by customers will be key factors in determining its success.The Customer Service Returns application could help reduce friction in the returns process, which is a pain point for many online shoppers. By empowering customer service reps with tools to handle returns more efficiently, Pitney Bowes is addressing a critical aspect of e-commerce logistics. If successful, this could lead to a reduction in operational costs associated with returns and improve the overall customer experience, potentially leading to increased loyalty and repeat business. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the enhancements to Pitney Bowes' logistics solutions could lead to an improvement in their competitive positioning, which may be reflected in their stock performance (NYSE:PBI). Investors should monitor the adoption rates of the new services and the impact on the company's revenue and margins. The cost of implementing these services versus the potential increase in revenue will be a critical factor in the financial success of these initiatives.Furthermore, the ability of Pitney Bowes to leverage these services to secure new contracts or upsell existing clients will be important for revenue growth. However, it is essential to remain cautious and look for concrete financial indicators such as quarterly earnings reports and customer acquisition numbers to gauge the real impact of these new services on the company's bottom line. 03/18/2024 - 01:32 PM The Company’s latest ecommerce logistics solutions include new gift tracking, customer service returns and expanded regional delivery service, which now reaches 90% of the population in the United States within 1-3 days.

Intended Purchases of Ordinary Shares in Connection with the Deferred Compensation Plan,2024-03-18T17:12:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Burford Capital  announces a share repurchase program for its Ordinary Shares worth up to £5.0 million in connection with future obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan.,"Intended Purchases of Ordinary Shares in Connection with the Deferred Compensation Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Burford Capital announces a share repurchase program for its Ordinary Shares worth up to £5.0 million in connection with future obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The initiation of a share repurchase program by Burford Capital Limited represents a strategic financial maneuver that can have multiple implications for the company's financial health and shareholder value. Share buybacks are typically seen as a positive signal, indicating that the company believes its shares are undervalued or that it seeks to return capital to shareholders in a tax-efficient manner. The £5.0 million allocated for the repurchase also suggests a controlled approach, possibly aiming to avoid dilution from the Deferred Compensation Plan.From a financial perspective, the repurchase could lead to an improved earnings per share (EPS) metric, as the overall share count decreases. This can make the company more attractive to investors seeking companies with strong per-share earnings growth. However, it is essential to analyze the company's cash flow statements and balance sheet to ensure that the repurchase does not negatively impact its liquidity or leverage ratios. In the long term, the strategic use of cash for repurchases should be balanced against potential investments in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market's response to share repurchase announcements is key to assessing the potential impact on Burford Capital Limited's stock performance. Historically, share buybacks have been associated with a positive market reaction, as they can be interpreted as a sign of confidence by management in the company's prospects. The timing and scale of the buyback can also reflect management's view on the stock's current valuation.However, the market context is crucial. If the sector is facing headwinds or if the overall market sentiment is bearish, the impact of the buyback announcement may be muted. Additionally, investor perception of the company's long-term strategy and its ability to generate sustainable returns is paramount. If the repurchase is seen as a short-term fix rather than part of a coherent long-term strategy, the positive effects may be limited. 03/18/2024 - 01:12 PM NEW YORK, March 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Burford Capital Limited (the ""Company""), the leading global finance and asset management firm focused on law, today announces a share repurchase program for the Company's ordinary shares, no par value per share (""Ordinary Shares""), with authorization to repurchase up to a maximum aggregate amount of £5.0 million (the ""Program"") in connection with future obligations under the Company's deferred compensation plan (the ""Deferred Compensation Plan"").

They also recycled more than 2 million pounds of cables and wires, which allowed the company to obtain credits toward future purchases. One of the standout aspects of FirstEnergy's recycling endeavors has been its employee-led initiatives. These include the NexTrex challenge, which has enabled FirstEnergy employees to collect more than 1,800 pounds of plastic waste over the past year. Further, more than 250 pairs of employee-donated blue jeans have been repurposed into home insulation, showcasing the innovative and impactful nature of FirstEnergy's approach to recycling.

The campaign was launched on March 15. The campaign highlights Asian Americans who pursue an exciting life by infusing a taste of the outdoors into their daily lives as a way of expressing themselves. At the same time, it addresses the demands of Asian American consumers who value premium and sophisticated spaces for their lifestyles.
