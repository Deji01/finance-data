The data — seen as “uneventful” by many investors — came just 24 hours before the release of the Fed’s favored inflation gauge.Listen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal. Read the transcript.Following a jump in both the consumer and the producer price indexes, Thursday’s core personal consumption expenditures gauge will likely highlight the bumpy path the central bank faces in achieving its 2% target. The data would also validate recent commentary from officials showing no rush to cut rates.“The recent data is noise and should be ignored outside of its impact for very short-term market movements,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “We are more interested in the PCE data that will be released tomorrow.”The S&P 500 fell to around 5,060. Nvidia Corp. extended its decline from a record. Apple Inc. hovered near its $180 technical support. UnitedHealth Group Inc. sank on news reports that the US Department of Justice initiated an antitrust probe. Tesla Inc. climbed. Bitcoin trimmed its rally after approaching $64,000. Treasury 10-year yields fell two basis points to 4.29%.“Despite the ‘reinflation’ alarm bells that went off earlier this month, other data hasn’t necessarily pointed to an overheating economy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “Investors and the Fed are in the same boat right now, having to wait for more data to come in before a clearer picture emerges.”Story continuesSwap traders have been moving to price a little over 75 basis points of US easing by year-end — roughly in line with what policymakers in December indicated as the likeliest outcome. That would equate to three interest-rate cuts in 2024 — as the Fed moves have historically been increments of 25 basis points.Wall Street also kept an eye on the latest remarks from central-bank officials.Fed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said policymakers will likely lower rates later this year as the outlook for sustainable 2% inflation strengthens.To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, given that long-term Treasury yields have shown significant signs that they have seen a change in trend to the upside this year, Thursday’s inflation data could still shake things up before the week is over.“If tomorrow’s inflation data pushes yields higher, it just might cause stock investors to finally react to this year’s change in trend in bond yields,” Maley noted.Bolstered by speculation on rate cuts and the artificial-intelligence euphoria, equities have posted successive records this year and are now heading toward their fourth consecutive monthly advance. Such optimism has spurred warnings about either a consolidation or a pullback at this stage.“We believe there are valuation concerns throughout the markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at the Bahnsen Group. “Markets are pricing in unrealistic earnings growth at this point. It is just hard for us to rationalize entering the indexes at these levels.”Bahnsen also notes that investors should be “prudent and selective” — avoiding a strategy that simply buys the stocks that go up.“We expect market breadth to increase,” he added. “The only question is whether or not it increases from the top 5-10 names underperforming or the currently underperforming components of the market increasing — or some combination thereof.”US stocks have reached a significant inflection point — poised to either “top out or broaden out,” according to Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. Technical evidence suggests the next 10% move in the equity market is likely lower than higher, he added.“We continue to observe overall poor market breadth,” Johnson noted. “A broadening out will favor the financial and healthcare sectors as they are among the largest weightings in the Russell 2000. A topping out would likely result from profit-taking in the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks.”To Marc Dizard at PNC, while valuations are higher for the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps, they are warranted for the group delivering earnings growth that’s “significantly better” than the remaining companies in the S&P 500.The cohort — which includes giants Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. — saw its average earnings per share rise 55% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Right now, the Magnificent Seven names aren’t an area I would over concentrate, but I wouldn’t want to neglect them in a portfolio either,” Dizard said. “So certainly have, and maintain, an exposure to these names – but keep it in context of a more broadly diversified portfolio.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Scott Rubner — who recently dubbed Nvidia “the most important stock on planet earth” ahead of its blockbuster earnings — says it has proved impossible to call the peak in this euphoric US stock market.Retail traders have been lured into this rally just as a Goldilocks scenario — where the economy is running neither too hot nor too cold — has been playing out, prompting analysts quickly to upgrade their year-end targets, Rubner wrote. March is now a “fuller house” and the rally is “tired,” however there is no catalyst for a potential selloff, he said.Corporate Highlights:US regulators issued an ultimatum to Boeing Co. in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident last month, giving the US plane manufacturer 90 days to devise a plan to fix what it called “systemic” quality-control issues.Walt Disney Co. and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s conglomerate have signed a binding pact to merge their media operations in India, creating a sector behemoth valued at $8.5 billion in one of the world’s fastest-growing entertainment markets.EBay Inc. posted a strong holiday quarter, giving investors fresh hope that the company can boost profits following steep job cuts.Beyond Meat Inc., the maker of plant-based protein food products, reported fourth-quarter sales that surpassed expectations.Bumble Inc. is cutting about one-third of its workforce after a recent executive shakeup as the online dating app company seeks to overhaul its app to revive slowing user growth.Royal Bank of Canada beat analysts’ estimates as stronger-than-expected performance in the firm’s capital-markets and wealth-management businesses countered an increase in loan-loss provisions and higher expenses.Baidu Inc.’s profit plunged a worse-than-anticipated 48%, underscoring the growing costs of training and developing AI to fend off challengers in the burgeoning arena.Key Events This Week:Germany CPI, unemployment, ThursdayUS consumer income, PCE deflator, initial jobless claims, ThursdayFed’s Austan Goolsbee, Raphael Bostic and Loretta Mester speak, ThursdayChina official PMI, Caixin manufacturing PMI, FridayEurozone S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, CPI, unemployment, FridayBOE chief economist Huw Pill speaks, FridayUS construction spending, ISM Manufacturing, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, FridayFed’s Raphael Bostic and Mary Daly speak, FridayStocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.3% as of 12:39 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.6%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%The MSCI World index fell 0.4%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%The euro was little changed at $1.0836The British pound fell 0.2% to $1.2655The Japanese yen fell 0.1% to 150.70 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 6.4% to $60,378.88Ether rose 1.5% to $3,298.53BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.29%Germany’s 10-year yield was little changed at 2.46%Britain’s 10-year yield declined one basis point to 4.18%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $78.70 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.1% to $2,032.93 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Carly Wanna and Thyagaraju Adinarayan.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety ViolationsChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle ClassHong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in ShenzhenThere’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So GreatHollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Chairman Warren Buffett has built a financial empire reaching a nearly $1 trillion market capitalization, a milestone that places the conglomerate on the verge of joining an elite global club. Despite this achievement, Buffett regards his investment in Berkshire Hathaway, a then-struggling textile company, as the ""dumbest stock I ever bought"" believing that the company’s value could have potentially doubled.Don't Miss:The average American has $65,100 in their savings account — How do you compare?This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?Berkshire Hathaway’s ascent to the brink of the $1 trillion valuation follows a surge in its stock price, fueled by a strong quarterly earnings report. The company, with holdings ranging from insurance (Geico) to fast food (Dairy Queen Inc.), saw its market capitalization reach $905 billion, with class B stock climbing 2% in premarket trading.Its share price has increased by 17% since the year’s start, positioning Berkshire Hathaway to join the ranks of tech giants like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., alongside other behemoths such as Saudi Arabian Oil Group (Aramco) and Amazon.com Inc. in the trillion-dollar market cap sphere.During a 2010 interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick Buffett shed light on what he considers his most regrettable investment decision: acquiring Berkshire Hathaway. Initially, Buffett was drawn to the company, a declining textile manufacturer, for its practice of buying back its own stock using proceeds from the sale of its mills. Seeing an opportunity, Buffett began purchasing shares, planning to sell them back to the company at a profit.Trending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.The critical turn of events occurred in 1964 when, after agreeing to tender his stock at $11.50 per share, Buffett received an offer at $11.375 per share. Feeling slighted by this lower offer, he reacted by buying more stock, eventually taking control of the company and dismissing the then-CEO Seabury Stanton. This decision led to Buffett’s extensive investment in a failing industry, which he later recognized as a significant error.Story continuesAt the time of the interview, Berkshire Hathaway’s valuation stood at approximately $200 billion. Buffett humorously remarked, ""And — so there you have it, the story of — a $200 billion — incidentally, if you come back in 10 years, I may have one that's even worse.""This comment reflects the magnitude of the missed opportunity; Buffett believed that had he initially steered his investment toward the insurance sector rather than the textile industry, Berkshire Hathaway’s worth could have been double its existing value. He underscored the lesson learned from this experience, saying, ""If you get in a lousy business, get out of it"" and highlighting the importance of recognizing and rectifying investment mistakes to avoid substantial financial losses.Buffett's ability to transform a struggling textile business into a near trillion-dollar conglomerate is a testament to his strategic foresight and managerial acumen. As Berkshire Hathaway continues to thrive, Buffett’s legacy as one of the world’s most astute investors remains intact, serving as a beacon for investors worldwide.Read Next: Copy and paste Mark Cuban’s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.Discover why high-profile names like Leonard Dicaprio are turning to diamond assets and how you can get involved with just $100.""ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON"" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 ""news & everything else"" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?APPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis ReportTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis ReportThis article Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Nears $1 Trillion Market Capitalization, But He Refers To It As 'The Dumbest Stock I Ever Bought' — It Could Have Been Worth Twice As Much Today If He Had Cut His Losses Sooner originally appeared on Benzinga.com© 2024 Benzinga.com.

Motley Fool,"Why Baidu, Alibaba, and Other Chinese Stocks Sank on Wednesday",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-baidu-alibaba-other-chinese-190436144.html,"An earnings report, economic challenges, and moves by Chinese regulators were weighing on these stocks.","Stocks of some of China's most widely held companies were sinking in unison on Wednesday, with several catalysts sending them lower. One company delivered a disappointing financial report, concerns about China's economy continued, and the country's policymakers announced moves that shook up its stock market.With that as a backdrop, several of China's biggest technology stocks lagged the broader market. Shares of Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU) slumped 7.2%, Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY) declined 3.9%, and Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) fell 3.4%, as of 1:22 p.m. ET today.Image source: Getty Images.Disappointing resultsBaidu reported its fourth-quarter results, and investors were not pleased. The company generated revenue of $4.9 billion, up 6% year over year, while the diluted earnings per American depositary share (ADS) of $0.95 cratered 50%.To give those numbers context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $4.86 billion and per-ADS earnings of $2.48, so profits fell far short of investor expectations.The news wasn't all bad, as Baidu's ChatGPT-style offering, ERNIE, helped boost revenue, despite an ongoing downturn in advertising, which is the company's bread and butter. On the other hand, steep spending on artificial intelligence (AI) helped erode the bottom line, weighing on profits.The company noted that revenue from its core business, which consists mainly of online advertising, cloud computing, and AI, grew 7% to $3.87 billion, while growth at its streaming platform iQiyi lagged, increasing 2% to $1.1 billion.A weak economic backdropBaidu is the latest company to report earnings that highlight the current challenges besetting China's economy. The country is suffering from high unemployment among younger citizens, slowing growth, and lower consumer spending.Any economist will tell you that consumer spending is the backbone of an economy, so this could be a bad harbinger.Exacerbating the situation is the crisis in China's real estate market. Just last month, a judge ordered the liquidation of property developer China Evergrande Group, which helps illustrate the ongoing challenges in the country as property transactions have slumped.Story continuesLast year, home sales in China declined 6.5%, and market commentators suggest the worst isn't over. By some accounts, real estate represents roughly 25% of China's economy, which just makes things worse.Lastly, the country's moves to curb certain investing strategies are not being well received. Chinese securities regulators announced a crackdown on short-selling, going so far as to say that malicious short-sellers would ""lose their shirts and rot in jail,"" according to a report by Reuters.China also announced curbs on quantitative or computer-driven trading. Regulators directed quant funds to stop accepting new cash and discontinue existing ""direct market access"" products. These recent moves have cast a pall on the market, helping send these popular stocks lower.Will investors follow the government's lead?Investors already leery about the worsening economy in China have more reasons to be wary. Furthermore, each of our trio of companies listed above is highly dependent on consumer spending and a strong economy:Baidu is China's leading internet search provider, and like Alphabet's Google -- its U.S. counterpart -- it relies on digital advertising for the vast majority of its revenue. Weakness in the economy translates to much lower ad sales.Alibaba is one of the country's largest digital retailers. Lower consumer spending equals less sales.Tencent's social media makes much of its money from advertising, while its gaming and ancillary services are highly dependent on consumer discretionary income.In the face of macroeconomic headwinds and high unemployment, consumer spending in China is slowing, which could further weaken an already fragile economy. As a result, the future is uncertain, particularly for companies that depend on consumers for their livelihoods.To be clear, I'm not suggesting investors should avoid these stocks completely. In fact, they are currently trading at compelling valuations, as Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu are selling for 14 times, 12 times, and 12 times earnings, respectively -- each a significant discount to the broader market. And Baidu and Alibaba are selling for a price-to-sales ratio of less than 2, the benchmark for underpriced stocks.That said, investors should factor China's weakening economic outlook into their thinking and ensure they approach these companies with a long-term outlook.Furthermore, investing in China carries additional risk, and any position should be a modest part of a well-diversified portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Baidu right now?Before you buy stock in Baidu, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Baidu wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Boston Beer Stock Was Taking a Dive Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-boston-beer-stock-taking-183228783.html,The Sam Adams brewer turned in another underwhelming quarter.,"Shares of Boston Beer (NYSE: SAM) were sliding Wednesday after the maker of Sam Adams beer, Truly hard seltzer, and other alcoholic beverages posted disappointing fourth-quarter results, continuing a recent pattern.Boston Beer goes sourRevenue continued to move in the wrong direction with sales falling 12% for the fiscal quarter, or 3.1% on a 13-week comparable basis, to $393.7 million, which was well below estimates at $413.8 million. (The company's fiscal 2022 Q4 included an extra week, complicating direct comparisons.) Depletions, a proxy for end-consumer demand based on unit sales from distributors to retailers, were down 9% year over year, or 1% on a 13-week comparable basis.Management cited continued declines in sales of Truly hard seltzer for the dip in revenue, though those were offset by rising sales of Twisted Tea, Sam Adams non-alcoholic beverages, and Dogfish Head canned cocktails.Gross margin increased from 37% to 37.6% due to price increases and procurement savings, even as the company continues to face headwinds from contractual shortfalls in third-party production capacity agreements.On the bottom line, the company reported a loss of $1.49 per share in the seasonally weak quarter, which was worse than both the consensus estimate for a loss of $0.25 per share and its loss of $0.93 per share in the prior-year quarter.""As we look forward into 2024, we believe we have the right strategies in place to steadily improve our revenue and margin performance while continuing to invest in our brands and industry-leading salesforce,"" said Chairman Jim Koch in the earnings release.What's next for Boston BeerThe company said that year to date, depletions are down 2%, and looking ahead, it expects depletions and shipments to be around flat for the year. It's also calling for price increases of 1% to 2%, implying a slight increase in revenue, and it's guiding for generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share of $7 to $11. That would be a significant improvement from the $6.21 per share it reported in 2023, but still below the $11.39 that the average analyst forecast called for.Story continuesAt that expected profit level, Boston Beer stock still looks expensive. Its current valuation implies a recovery that has yet to materialize.Should you invest $1,000 in Boston Beer right now?Before you buy stock in Boston Beer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Boston Beer wasn’t one of them.
