The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, traditionally seen as so-called safe haven currencies, edged higher in early trading Monday. Oil opened steady in Asia while gold rose 0.7%.With investors already rattled by sticky inflation and the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates, the escalation of the Middle East crisis is injecting fresh volatility into markets. As the conflict widens, many say oil could surpass $100 a barrel and expect a flight to Treasuries, gold and the dollar, along with further stock-market losses.While Iran said “the matter can be deemed concluded,” traders are now awaiting Israel’s response and whether the conflict spirals into a widespread regional war. Still, nerves may be tempered following a report that President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US won’t support an Israeli counterattack against Iran.“For markets this may eventually play out as a fade as Iran and Israel step back from the brink,” said Namik Immelbäck, chief strategist at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB. “But near term this should lead to position reduction from especially trend following quant strategies” which should exacerbate the typical flight to safety, he said.Read More: Iran’s Attack on Israel Sparks Race to Avert a Full-Blown WarStory continuesBitcoin sank almost 9% in the wake of the attacks on Saturday, only to rebound and trade near the $64,000 mark.

Bloomberg,Emerging Markets Battle Weak Currencies Amid Dollar Might,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-markets-battle-weak-currencies-211601290.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Currency intervention has become a key battleground in emerging markets, especially Asia, as the latest leg up in the dollar piles pressure on officials to act.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Versus Iran — What All-Out War Could Look LikeTexas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next WeekIran’s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain FromIsrael Grapples With New Phase in its Multi-Front War With IranA $150 Billion Fortune Bolsters Qatari Royals at Critical MomentIn South Korea,","(Bloomberg) -- Currency intervention has become a key battleground in emerging markets, especially Asia, as the latest leg up in the dollar piles pressure on officials to act.Most Read from BloombergIsrael Versus Iran — What All-Out War Could Look LikeTexas Warns of Possible Power Emergency Next WeekIran’s Missile Barrage Was an Error Israel Can Gain FromIsrael Grapples With New Phase in its Multi-Front War With IranA $150 Billion Fortune Bolsters Qatari Royals at Critical MomentIn South Korea, Thailand and Poland, officials have said they are closely monitoring for currency volatility or spelled out they’ll step in if needed. Indonesia has gone a step further by selling dollars and China has repeatedly pushed back against depreciation, implying to traders that the yuan’s stability is key.Faster-than-expected US inflation data last week damped bets on Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts, suggesting the battle against dollar strength isn’t going to end anytime soon. Increasing tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran risk creating a fresh surge in demand for the greenback as a haven.“Right now, we do see lots of verbal intervention from different central banks,” said Marcella Chow, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. Given the Fed seems unlikely to ease policy soon, “there might be more weakening with regards to Asian currencies and that may suggest that there might be more verbal intervention that’s needed,” she said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.The uptick in central bank activity is just another zone of conflict stemming from the Fed’s pivot to higher-for-longer rates. Traders have been winding back bets on expected US rate cuts in recent months due to sticky consumer-price data, which suggests emerging-market policymakers still have plenty of work ahead of them.Currency JawboningThai policymakers are faced with a stern test in trying to support the baht, which has tumbled about 6% this year. Their approach has been to use rhetoric to try and talk it higher.Story continues“The committee will continue to closely monitor the volatilities in the foreign exchange market,” policymakers said at their April 10 meeting. They kept interest rates on hold at the gathering to help the currency, defying the wishes of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin who has stressed the need to ease policy.Poland’s central bank repeated at its April 4 meeting that it may intervene to bolster the zloty. A stronger local currency helps curb inflation, policymakers said after they held rates.And Bank of Korea officials have said they are watching the won closely, after it came under pressure last week. Governor Rhee Chang-yong’s remarks on the currency on Friday contained verbal intervention terminology, Director General Oh Kum-hwa told Bloomberg.Selling DollarsBank Indonesia has gone a step further by buying the rupiah to limit losses. Governor Perry Warjiyo has said intervention and the sale of high-yielding securities will be their main levers this year to underpin the currency.Their latest official foray was on April 2 when the local currency slid to a four-year low. In Indonesia’s case though it’s not just the dollar to blame: the rupiah has also been under pressure due to concerns about the spending plans of incoming president Prabowo Subianto.Peru’s central bank, which surprised economists with an interest rate cut last week, is said to have been a frequent seller of dollars in recent months as it seeks to prop up the sol. Officials have said in the past the goal of interventions is to reduce currency fluctuations.Read more: Peru Delivers Shock Rate Cut as Pension Withdrawal ApprovedAlthough not primarily in response to the dollar, Israel’s central bank deployed unprecedented sales of its US currency following the Hamas attack in October to protect the shekel.Many of the most interventionist central banks have been in Asia, which has seen some of the largest currency losses in the past month.“Asian central banks just can’t let down their guard,” said Paul Mackel, global head of foreign-exchange research at HSBC Holdings Plc in London. Given that weak currencies often stoke price pressures, “it could also mean that actually the last mile of inflation is not only difficult for the US, it could be for a number of different economies,” he said.China’s DilemmaA prime example of the challenge facing some officials in emerging markets is China’s dilemma over the yuan: prop it up and risk worsening the economic downturn, or let it weaken and encourage capital outflows.The central bank has chosen the former, and turned to its trusted yuan fixings as its key instrument. Policymakers have kept the daily reference rate in a tight range in recent months, even as the yuan has weakened, meaning the currency is getting ever closer to the 2% daily boundary around the fixing in which it’s allowed to trade.The dangers of relaxing their hold have already been demonstrated. The People’s Bank of China set a weaker-than-expected fixing on March 22 and the yuan slumped the most in two months.China is prioritizing exchange-rate stability but may have to use more tools to keep yuan depreciation at bay if the dollar continues to strengthen, said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore.Time to Buy?Still, while there are few signs the dollar rally is about to let up, some analysts at least suggest this may be a decent time to start returning to some of the most beaten up currencies.The likelihood of the Fed delaying rate cuts after March US inflation data “adds to the continued headwinds for Asian currencies,” said David Chao, a strategist at Invesco Asset Management in Singapore. “This could be an opportunity to buy the dip” in regional risk assets, he said.What to Watch:The IMF and World Bank spring meetings take place in Washington.

Just ahead of the global industry’s meetup, the metal has surged. There are a number of factors that drove gains to a 22-month high last week: Factory activity is improving everywhere from the US to China, there are flares of supply stress, and there’s the much-vaunted demand potential from new-energy industries. Attendees at Cesco Week in top producer Chile will weigh whether this is another false dawn, or the start of copper’s march toward bigger gains above $10,000 a metric ton.Clean TechThe world’s dependence on China has increased for technologies needed to support a global transition away from fossil fuels, according to BloombergNEF. Breakneck spending has pushed China’s share of global production capacity above 80% in 11 clean-technology value chain segments. China’s capacity is set to far surpass global demand across solar, batteries and electric vehicles for years to come. Supply chains for clean energy will be among the topics discussed at BNEF’s summit on Tuesday and Wednesday.OilWith Mexico curbing its oil exports at the same time that OPEC+ curtails output, investors are watching for any changes to US production, which surprised to the upside last year. Shale production in the first three months of this year has already been predicted by the Energy Information Administration to be flat and the agency expects overall US output in 2024 to grow more slowly than in previous years. EIA’s Drilling Productivity Report that comes out Monday will offer a fresh forecast on where shale output is heading in May.Story continuesEggsBird flu is flaring up again: The top US eggs producer reported this month the worst American outbreak since December while the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus made the jump to dairy cattle. Egg prices so far have held relatively in check, but there are expectations they could rise again with more egg-laying chickens potentially catching the virus amid peak migration season for wild birds. The worst-ever outbreak has never fully abated since it was first detected in the US in February 2022.EnergyA strong oil-fueled rally in energy stocks is gathering momentum, helping them outperform technology indexes this year. The closely watched Energy Select Sector exchange-traded fund, or XLE, is up nearly 15% since the start of the year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has gained just 7%. Rising oil has helped, after West Texas Intermediate crude broke above $80 a barrel in mid-March. Energy has led the S&P 500’s 11 market sectors since the start of March, rising more than 11% compared with the next closest group, communication services, at 5.8%, and the 0.3% decline in the broader index.--With assistance from Brian Eckhouse, Geoffrey Morgan and Doug Alexander.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data CentersCocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the BeanToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and HyundaiEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Bloomberg,Markets Weigh Up Risk of Retaliation-Cycle After Iran Hits Israel,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-weigh-risk-retaliation-cycle-121654817.html,(Bloomberg) -- Financial markets will face the new week fretting about geopolitics with much riding on whether Iran’s unprecedented weekend strike on Israel triggers rounds of retaliation.

Now as the conflict widens, many say oil could surpass $100 a barrel and expect a flight to Treasuries, gold and the dollar, along with further stock-market losses.A spike in nerves may still be tempered by the flight to safety in markets on Friday in anticipation of a strike, Iran’s statement that “the matter can be deemed concluded” and a report that President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US won’t support an Israeli counterattack against Iran.“Investors’ natural reaction is to look for safe-haven assets in moments like this,” said Patrick Armstrong, chief investment officer at Plurimi Wealth LLP. “Reactions will be somewhat dependent on Israel’s response. If Israel does not escalate from here, it may provide an opportunity to buy risk assets at lower prices.”Risk-Addicted Wall Street Funds Are Shaken as Bad News Piles UpBitcoin gave an early insight into market sentiment. The token sank almost 9% in the wake of the attacks on Saturday, only to rebound on Sunday and trade near the $64,000 mark.Stocks markets in Saudi Arabia and Qatar posted modest losses under thin trading volumes. Israel’s equity benchmark fluctuated between gains and losses at least nine times before closing with a small gain.Story continues“Middle Eastern markets opened with relative calm following Iran’s attack, which was perceived as a measured retaliation, rather than an attempt at escalation,” said Emre Akcakmak, a senior consultant at East Capital in Dubai. “However, the market impact might extend beyond the Middle East due to secondary effects on oil and energy prices, potentially influencing the global inflation outlook.”Investors will now weigh the risk of a strike and counter-strike cycle, with many looking to oil as a guide for how to respond. Brent crude is already up almost 20% this year and trading north of $90 a barrel.While the conflict in the Middle East hasn’t yet had any impact on production, Red Sea attacks by Iran-backed Houthis in the Red Sea have disrupted shipping. Traders mostly fear a widening conflict could disrupt tanker shipments from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz.Israel’s War Cabinet Discusses Response to Iran Strikes: TOPLiveWorries about turmoil in the region have also been filtering through global markets. The S&P 500 is coming off its biggest weekly decline since October on the back of higher-than-expected inflation and disappointing bank earnings.In the bond market, traders will be weighing the risk that more expensive energy bills may add to swirling inflation fears. While Treasuries tend to benefit in times of uncertainty, the threat of interest rates staying high could limit moves. US equity and bond futures will open at 6 p.m. New York time Sunday.Meanwhile, gold has been on a tear, gaining 13% this year to hit a record above $2,400 an ounce. Investors have also sought the stability of the US dollar. An index of the currency rose 1.3% last week, the best performance since late 2022.Here’s what investors and analysts are saying:Erik Meyersson, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB:“Our oil analysts do not see much sign of a geopolitical risk premium in oil prices so far. We expect this to reflect market perceptions of low risks of escalation up until now. This equilibrium is likely to be tested if Iran and Israel continue to attack each other.”Gonzalo Lardies, senior equities fund manager at Andbank:“A new environment of uncertainty is now opening up, but the market on Friday already partially priced in this situation, so if it does not get worse the impact should not be very high. The risk is if this situation escalates and there is contagion in the region.”Alfonso Benito, chief investment officer at Dunas Capital:“I wouldn’t expect sharp drops given how Israel has defended its air shield. We should see defense companies up, oil up and gas up, while airlines could decline. Bonds will rise, but I don’t think excessively. Investors could take advantage to partially correct the increases of recent months.”Joachim Klement, a strategist at Liberum:“The reaction will very much depend on the reaction of Israel today and whether the US can manage to restrain Benjamin Netanyahu.”“In the next couple of days, stock markets will focus on the geopolitical situation, rather than central bank action or the strong economy in the US. Hence, we expect the rally to stall until there is more clarity if the situation in Iran-Israel calms down. If we end up in a shooting war between Israel and Iran, then the rally will be stalled for longer.”Mark Matthews, strategist at Bank Julius Baer in Singapore:“The good thing is that Iran did warn about the attack well beforehand. Military analysts say it was done in a way that minimized casualties. I don’t see why it would cause Fed rate expectations to fall more or it would cause the oil price to go up a lot. Iran is trying to defuse this and so is the US. The key is what Israel’s answer will be, and then Iran’s answer to that. If Israel does a de-escalatory strike, and then the Iranians do an even more de-escalatory strike, then it will be over with.”Geoff Yu, senior strategist for EMEA Markets at BNY Mellon in London:“There is scope for further accumulation of dollars, even with recent buying after the CPI data. Our clients remain overweight the euro, Canadian dollar and some high-carry currencies such as the Mexican peso, so this is where we would watch for rotation in the greenback’s favor.”Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics in London:“Our sense is that events in the Middle East will add to the reasons for the Fed to adopt a more cautious approach to rate cuts, but they won’t prevent it from cutting altogether. We expect the first move in September. And assuming that the energy prices don’t spiral over the next month or so, we think that both the ECB and BOE will cut in June.”--With assistance from Macarena Muñoz, Allegra Catelli, Alice Gledhill and Anthony Di Paola.(Updates prices throughout, adds quote.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Pioneering Blackjack Master Beats the Odds of AgingRace for AI Supremacy in Middle East Is Measured in Data CentersCocoa’s Surge Is Drawing Africa’s Farmers Back to the BeanToyota Pins Its Hopes on Revamped 4Runner to Beat Ford and HyundaiEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Motley Fool,"Billionaire Dan Loeb Sold Amazon and Microsoft but Bought This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-dan-loeb-sold-amazon-185000001.html,"The hedge fund manager's decision to increase his stake in one ""Magnificent Seven"" stock is already paying off handsomely.","Dan Loeb is known as a mover and a shaker in the investing world. He founded the New York-based hedge fund Third Point in 1995. It now has roughly $11.5 billion in assets under management. Loeb's net worth stands at $3.3 billion, according to Forbes.The activist investor did some moving and shaking in his hedge fund's portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2023. Loeb reduced his stakes in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). However, the billionaire investor bought another ""Magnificent Seven"" stock.Taking profitsLoeb sold 210,000 shares of Microsoft in Q4. While this reduced Third Point's stake in the tech giant by over 9.4%, Microsoft remains the second-largest holding in the hedge fund's portfolio.The billionaire investor has owned Microsoft off and on since 2006. He most recently initiated a new position in the fourth quarter of 2022, just in time to ride the generative AI wave started by OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT. Microsoft was a major beneficiary of this wave thanks to its partnership with OpenAI.Third Point first owned Amazon in late 2019 and held the stock through the second quarter of 2022. Loeb didn't stay on the sidelines long with the e-commerce and cloud services leader. He initiated a new position in Amazon in the second quarter of 2023. Although he reduced Third Point's stake in the stock by nearly 10.3% in Q4 2023, Amazon still ranks as the hedge fund's third-largest holding.Why did Loeb trim his positions in Amazon and Microsoft? The most likely reason is he wanted to take some profits. Both stocks delivered impressive gains last year.A bigger bet on MetaAlthough Loeb cooled somewhat on two Magnificent Seven stocks, he placed a bigger bet on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). The hedge fund manager increased Third Point's stake in Meta by nearly 5.5% in Q4 2023. The $410.6 million value of the position made Meta the sixth-largest holding for Third Point at the end of 2023.Story continuesLoeb's history with Meta goes back to the second quarter of 2016 when he first bought the stock. He owned shares of the social media company for a little over two years before exiting the position. The activist investor again bought Meta stock in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained a position through 2021 Q4. Loeb went back to the well in the third quarter of 2023 with another new stake in Meta.Like Amazon and Microsoft, Meta enjoyed a generative AI tailwind last year. However, I suspect that wasn't Loeb's primary reason for adding to his position in the stock. Instead, my hunch is that Loeb liked Meta's moves to increase its profitability.Those efforts are paying off. Meta's earnings more than tripled year over year in 2023 Q4. Full-year profits jumped 69%.Did Loeb make the right moves?In one sense, Loeb went one for three with these Magnificent Seven transactions. Loeb's decision to increase Third Point's stake in Meta is already paying off. Meta stock has skyrocketed over 45% since the end of 2023. However, Amazon and Microsoft are also up by double-digit percentages year to date. Loeb could have made more money by holding his shares in both companies.However, trimming the positions in Amazon and Microsoft could still have been the right call for Loeb. Both stocks make up significant percentages of Third Point's portfolio. You can't blame any investor for wanting to ensure their holdings aren't overly concentrated in a handful of stocks.Over the long term, I think that Loeb -- and other investors -- will be well served by owning all three of these stocks. Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses should continue to grow robustly thanks largely to AI. I like Meta's focus on business messaging and smart glasses with embedded AI assistants. I predict Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta will remain magnificent for a long time to come.Should you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?Before you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Nvidia Is Not in a Bubble: You Should Be Buying This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Hand Over Fist Before It Soars,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-not-bubble-buying-artificial-181700375.html,"Nvidia investors should look at the bigger picture, which indicates that the stock could continue rallying in the long run.","Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) stunning artificial intelligence (AI) surge has left investors and analysts in awe. Shares of the chipmaker, which originally made its name as a manufacturer of graphics cards for personal computers (PCs), have jumped nearly sixfold since the beginning of 2023.However, this big jump has created doubts in certain corners of Wall Street that Nvidia stock may be in a bubble. From comparisons with the dot-com bubble of 1999 to a potential decline in AI-related demand for its chips, to its expensive valuation, there are multiple reasons why some believe that Nvidia is a bubble waiting to burst.But a closer look at the AI market in general and Nvidia in particular will illustrate why the company is far from being in a bubble.Why it isn't right to call Nvidia, and AI, a bubbleA stock market bubble is a ""significant run-up in stock prices without a corresponding increase in the value of the businesses they represent."" In a bubble, the valuation of a company is based on speculation instead of the actual fundamentals.However, if you take a closer look at how AI is driving productivity gains across multiple industries, it will become easier to understand that the adoption of this technology should ideally continue gaining momentum. For instance, Meta Platforms says that the integration of AI tools has led to an impressive jump of 32% in returns delivered by ad campaigns. Meanwhile, customer service associates are reportedly witnessing a 14% increase in productivity thanks to AI.Factories, on the other hand, are expected to witness a 30% to 50% jump in productivity in the future by integrating AI, according to Bain & Company. Investment bank UBS believes that AI could drive productivity growth of 2.5% this year, ahead of the Federal Reserve's estimate of 1.5%. Over the next three years, UBS is expecting AI to deliver 17% of productivity gains.Nvidia's chips are going to play a central role in driving these productivity gains across different industries. That's because AI models need to be trained using millions and billions of parameters before they can be deployed in the real world. These models are known as large language models (LLMs), and they are being deployed across multiple verticals from manufacturing to automotive to cloud computing.Story continuesTraining these LLMs requires massive computing power, which Nvidia's GPUs provide. This explains why companies have been queuing up to get their hands on Nvidia's flagship H100 processor, giving the chipmaker a monopoly-like position in the AI chip market with an estimated share of over 90%. The H100 sells for $25,000 to $30,000, and Nvidia reportedly makes a 1,000% profit on these cards as per Raymond James. This explains the outstanding growth in Nvidia's revenue and earnings.NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) ChartSo, the sharp jump in Nvidia's stock price is not based on speculation or euphoria, but it is backed by the eye-popping growth in the company's revenue and earnings. The good part is that Nvidia seems capable of sustaining its outstanding growth over the long run, and the U.S. government is likely to play a key role in helping it remain the dominant force in the AI chip market.A new grant by the U.S. government could help Nvidia maintain its AI supremacyNvidia's H100 processor, based on the Hopper architecture, commands solid pricing power, and that's not surprising given that it has been the go-to chip for customers looking to train AI models. As it turns out, the demand for this chip was so strong at one point that customers had to wait for as long as a year to get their hands on it.Nvidia is now set to bring a new chip architecture to the market, known as Blackwell. The B200 Blackwell graphics card, which will be the successor to the H100 once it is launched later this year, is reportedly going to deliver performance gains of 7x to 30x over the H100. Nvidia also claims that it will reduce energy consumption by up to 25x.This performance gain isn't surprising as Blackwell is reportedly going to be manufactured using a custom 4-nanometer (nm) node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. For comparison, the Hopper-based H100 was manufactured using a custom 5nm process from TSMC. By shrinking the size of the process node, TSMC has allowed Nvidia to pack 208 billion transistors as compared to 80 billion transistors in the H100.These transistors are now packed more closely together on the chip, and as a result they deliver more computing power and generate less heat, thereby reducing electricity consumption. And now, TSMC has received a $6.6 billion grant from the U.S. government, along with a $5 billion low-cost loan facility, to build a third chip plant in Arizona.TSMC is expected to use these funds to build a 2nm chip plant. Given that Nvidia is expected to be one of the customers for TSMC's 2nm chips, which are expected to go into mass production in 2025, it won't be surprising to see the graphics specialist coming out with even more powerful AI graphics cards. This explains why analysts are expecting Nvidia's data center revenue to multiply nicely in the coming years.What's more, Nvidia's earnings are expected to increase at an annual rate of 35% for the next five years, as per consensus estimates. Based on the company's fiscal 2024 earnings of $12.96 per share, its bottom line could jump to $58.11 per share after five years.Nvidia has a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39, which is slightly higher than its forward earnings multiple of 36. But even if Nvidia trades at a discounted 27 times forward earnings after five years (in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple, as a proxy for tech stocks), its stock price could jump to $1,569. That would be an 85% increase from current levels.However, don't be surprised to see this AI stock delivering stronger gains. Nvidia can outpace Wall Street's earnings growth expectations and the market could continue rewarding it with a premium valuation as its product development moves should ideally help it remain the top player in the lucrative AI chip market.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"A Once-in-a-Generation Investment Opportunity: 1 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in April Before It Surges 55%, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/once-generation-investment-opportunity-1-180500565.html,Palantir came onto the scene in 2023 following a successful launch into the world of artificial intelligence (AI).,"The excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) is fueling the markets to new heights. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have eclipsed new records in just the first few months of the year.Much of these gains are thanks to the ""Magnificent Seven"" -- a catchy moniker used to describe the world's largest companies including Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. But savvy investors understand that there are plenty of other opportunities in the AI realm besides megacap tech.One company that's emerging as a leader is big data analytics software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). 2023 was a breakout year for the company as it released its fourth major product: the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).AIP's smashing success helped accelerate Palantir's revenue and profits -- and investors took notice. But with shares up nearly 180% in the last year, is it too late to buy the company's stock?Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives thinks the stock has much more room to grow. His price target of $35 per share implies roughly 59% upside from the company's current trading levels, as of market close on April 10.Read on to discover why scooping up shares in Palantir could be a lucrative opportunity right now.The rise of the Palantir Artificial Intelligence PlatformFor many years, Palantir sold three core software products: Apollo, Gotham, and Foundry. But last April, it quietly announced its foray into artificial intelligence (AI) following the release of AIP. But AIP's launch was largely overshadowed by the moves big tech was making -- including investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and its competitors.In order to spread the word about AIP, Palantir resorted to a creative lead generation strategy. Namely, the company began hosting immersive seminars called ""boot camps."" During these sessions, prospective customers were able to demo Palantir's various software platforms. The idea behind this was to show off Palantir's tech chops in a tangible way while simultaneously helping business leaders identify and form a use case surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).Story continuesSince the beginning of this campaign, Palantir has hosted over 850 boot camps. Moreover, AIP customers have publicly demonstrated how the product is being used to uncover new insights across myriad applications.While AIP has only been commercially available for about a year, its initial success is encouraging. Palantir increased its customer count by 35% year over year in 2023 and is making progress in the private sector. During the fourth quarter alone, the company grew its U.S. commercial revenue operation by a sizzling 70%.Image source: Getty ImagesThe journey is just getting startedSure, accelerating revenue is always nice to see. For Palantir, it's particularly meaningful because the company has gotten some pushback from Wall Street skeptics over the years -- many of whom see the company as too reliant on lumpy government deals with the U.S. Military and its Western allies.However, AIP is proving that Palantir has legitimate tech capabilities that are attracting customers from a whole host of industries outside of the public sector. Considering big tech's pulse within the overall AI landscape, Palantir is proving that it can compete with the biggest companies.I see 2023 as the first chapter in a long story in the AI narrative for the company. It's moving fast, and other behemoths in tech are eager to work with Palantir AIP. It's well-positioned to continue generating robust revenue growth while maintaining a healthy profitability profile and strong balance sheet.A premium valuation that's well worth the priceThe chart below illustrates Palantir benchmarked against a cohort of other leading AI software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses on a price-to-sales (P/S) basis. At a P/S of 23.1, Palantir is the most expensive stock among this peer set, based on that metric.PLTR P/S Ratio data by YCharts.Palantir's valuation multiples expanded dramatically following its jaw-dropping fourth-quarter earnings report in February. Since then, the stock has experienced some momentum and is only now starting to take a breather.Further, it's not just revenue growth that's impressive for Palantir. The company's entire financial picture is strong. The success of the boot camps has allowed Palantir to keep expenses in sales and marketing relatively low. As such, the company is consistently profitable -- unlike many of its competitors.In 2023, Palantir expanded its operating margin by 6%. This dropped right to the bottom line, as the company generated $730 million of free cash flow in 2023 -- up more than threefold year over year.With shares trading at such a premium compared to the competition, investors may be tempted to sell and book some profits. But I'd encourage investors to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.While AIP has served as a catalyst for Palantir's business and played an influential role in the excitement pushing the stock higher, the company's shares are still down 40% from their all-time highs. Now is a terrific time to scoop up shares, as Palantir continues taking advantage of the long-term secular themes in AI.Using dollar-cost averaging is a prudent strategy to initiate a position or add to an existing one. With so much potential upside, it's hard to glance over Palantir.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Better AI Stock: Nvidia vs. Intel,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ai-stock-nvidia-vs-161900181.html,"Chip stocks are some of the best ways to invest in AI, with these companies developing the hardware that makes the industry possible.","A boom in artificial intelligence (AI) shook up the tech world last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT reignited interest in the technology and highlighted just how far AI had come. As a result, countless companies have pivoted their businesses to the budding sector in an effort to take their slice of a $200 billion pie.According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by the end of the decade.Consequently, it's not too late to invest in AI, and chip stocks are some of the most attractive options. These companies are developing the hardware necessary to train and run AI models, suggesting they'll be well positioned to profit from the AI market's tailwinds for years.As leading chipmakers, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have significant potential in AI. However, these companies are at drastically different stages in their AI journeys, which could mean one has more room to run over the long term.So, let's examine these chipmakers more closely and determine whether Nvidia or Intel is the better AI stock right now.NvidiaNvidia's business has exploded over the last year. Its stock is up 230% since last April. Meanwhile, its quarterly revenue and operating income have spiked 207% and 536%, respectively, thanks to soaring chip sales.In 2023, Nvidia cornered the market on AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while many of its competitors scrambled to catch up. Nvidia's head start allowed it to take full advantage of the increased demand for AI GPUs, capturing an estimated 90% market share.Nvidia's meteoric rise has some analysts questioning how much room the company has left to run. However, its stock keeps defying expectations, rising 60% in the last three months. Meanwhile, Nvidia's free cash flow has increased by 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, indicating it has the funds to continue investing in AI and retain its market supremacy. Story continuesGiven the massive potential of AI and Nvidia's position in the market, I wouldn't bet against it over the long term.IntelNvidia's established role in AI has made it one of the more reliable options. However, it could be worth looking at a company like Intel, which isn't as settled in the industry but could have more growth potential.Intel has hit more than a few roadblocks in recent years. Its stock is down about 45% over the past three years after seeing decreased market share in central processing units (CPUs) and ending a more than decade-long partnership with Apple.However, Intel is making major changes to its business, which could see it come back strong in the coming years. Last June, Intel announced a ""fundamental shift"" to its business, adopting an internal foundry model that it believes will help it save $10 billion by 2025.Moreover, Intel is moving into AI. In December 2023, the company debuted a range of AI chips, including Gaudi3, a GPU designed to challenge similar offerings from Nvidia. Intel also showed off new Core Ultra processors and Xeon server chips, which include neural processing units for running AI programs more efficiently.Intel is on the road to recovery, but it will take time for its financials to reflect recent changes. As a result, an investment in Intel is recommended for more patient investors who are willing to hold for at least a decade. Is Nvidia or Intel the better AI stock?NVDA PE Ratio (Forward) ChartThis chart indicates Intel's stock is trading at a significantly better value than Nvidia's, with a far lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.Forward P/E is calculated by dividing a company's current share price by its estimated earnings per share. Meanwhile, P/S divides its market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. These are useful valuation metrics since they consider a company's financial health. And for both, the lower the figure, the better the value.As a result, Intel's lower forward P/E and P/S suggest its stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's. However, the question is which is the better AI stock, not which is the better value.Consequently, the answer lies in the investor. If you're looking to invest in an established AI company that will likely deliver consistent but potentially small gains over many years, Nvidia is the answer. However, if you're willing to take a chance on Intel's ability to turn things around and potentially reap major rewards for its efforts, it's the AI stock to buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"1 Stock That Turned $1,000 Into $30 Million",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-stock-turned-1-000-160000032.html,A remarkable return like this can only be achieved if a company becomes dominant in its industry.,"Investing in the stock market is one of the best ways that people can grow their wealth. Over many decades, the results that the S&P 500 can produce can be truly extraordinary.But there is one business in particular that has absolutely crushed it for investors, much more than the overall market. Since its initial public offering in 1981, this top retail stock has generated a total return of 3,000,000%, which would have turned a $1,000 investment into an astonishing $30 million today. That's an incredible gain.Continue reading to learn what company I'm talking about, its ascent over the years, and whether it's a smart investment to make today.Dominating the industryInvestors should understand that it's not a technology or internet enterprise that has been such a huge winner. The business operates in the boring home-improvement sector. It's Home Depot (NYSE: HD), the industry heavyweight.This business hasn't changed much since the early days. Home Depot sells various supplies and tools to DIY and professional customers to help them handle renovation projects. Its current scale is truly remarkable. As of Feb. 20, there were 2,335 stores in total, which are on average over 100,000 square feet in size. What's even more impressive is that there is a Home Depot location within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, demonstrating its wide reach.It wasn't always this way, though. About 30 years ago, the company only had 264 stores open. And in fiscal 1993, Home Depot registered $9 billion in revenue, a fraction of the roughly $153 billion it posted last fiscal year.The early executive team made the correct call that the best strategy was to rapidly expand the store footprint across the U.S. Over the decades that followed, Home Depot continued growing its sales base and profitability, which undoubtedly helped drive those outstanding shareholder returns.Home Depot has become such a financial success story that it is now able to return incredible amounts of capital back to investors. Making $21 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023 allowed management to pay $8 billion in dividends and to repurchase $8 billion worth of outstanding stock. These capital allocation decisions are a usual occurrence these days.Story continuesShould you buy Home Depot shares today?Buying stocks based on their historical performance isn't necessarily a sound strategy. Businesses mature, and their opportunities for growth start to diminish. I think this is definitely the case with Home Depot.To be fair, though, the stock has doubled in the past five years, including dividends, which is a solid gain. But shares are 16% off their all-time high.At its current size, it's reasonable to assume slower sales gains going forward. That's only a natural progression. The struggles have been real in recent times, too. Revenue fell last year, and it is projected to rise by just 1% in fiscal 2024. Demand from consumers to tackle bigger renovation projects just isn't as robust in the current uncertain macro backdrop, one characterized by higher interest rates and inflationary pressures.But I still believe Home Depot is a worthy investment candidate for those who can look out over the next five years. The business has competitive advantages working in its favor, namely its scale and brand recognition. Even smaller rival Lowe's can't match Home Depot in this area. It also operates in a massive industry, giving it the opportunity to steal share from smaller shops in the fragmented market.Investors who can look past near-term headwinds should consider buying shares. Home Depot's returns won't resemble the past, but they could provide a boost to your portfolio.Should you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?Before you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Home Depot wasn’t one of them.
