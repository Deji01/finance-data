The Telegraph,AI boom drives global stock markets to best first quarter in five years,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-boom-drives-global-stock-180135785.html,Global stock markets have recorded their best first-quarter performance in five years as investors throw their weight behind the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.,"US Stock ExchangeGlobal stock markets have recorded their best first-quarter performance in five years as investors throw their weight behind the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.MSCI’s world index has risen almost 8pc since the start of the year, marking the strongest opening three months since 2019.The performance was driven by strong gains for the US benchmark S&P 500, which has risen 11pc to record highs.Investors have been piling into major US tech stocks in recent months amid a wave of enthusiasm for AI.Shares in Nvidia, which manufactures computer chips required to underpin the new technology, have surged 88pc so far this year, pushing its market value to almost $2.3 trillion.The tech rally has also been boosted by strong financial results for Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook owner Meta, which last month announced plans to return $50bn to shareholders after reporting record revenues and a steep rise in profits.The optimism has spread to other industries, with General Electric, Walt Disney and pharmaceutical group Eli Lilly all enjoying gains of at least 35pc in the first quarter.Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, said the S&P’s growth could last “for months”.He added: “This type of rally is seen in mature bull markets that have had enough of a push off the bottom but are not yet struggling to go higher.”Growth in US stock markets has outstripped the UK, with the benchmark FTSE 100 lagging behind with growth of just 3pc in the year so far.The London Stock Exchange has been battling to stem an exodus of companies defecting to New York in a bid to tap into a deeper pool of capital.Building materials company CRH, betting giant Flutter Entertainment, packaging supplier Smurfit Kappa and travel group Tui are among the companies that have moved their main listing to the US in recent months.However, there are signs UK stocks are starting to regain some ground. The FTSE 100 has risen 4.2pc in the last month, compared to a 3.1pc gain for the S&P 500.Story continuesStrong investor confidence comes despite signs of lingering inflation that have prompted markets to pare back hopes of rapid interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.Figures published on Friday showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, the Fed’s favoured index, stood at 2.5pc in February, up 0.1 percentage points from a month earlier.The reading, which was driven by higher fuel prices, was in line with forecasts. However, it remains above the central bank’s target of 2pc.In an appearance at the San Francisco Fed on Friday, chairman Jerome Powell said the latest figures were “pretty much in line with our expectations”, adding: “We don’t need to be in a hurry to cut.”Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell insists there is no rush to cut interest rates - Susan Walsh/APFed officials have signalled three interest rate cuts in 2024, with markets expecting the central bank to begin loosening monetary policy in June.Michael Pearce at Oxford Economics said: “The loosening of labour market conditions, stable inflation expectations, and likely disinflation in rents to come all make us confident that inflation will still trend slightly lower over the course of this year.“That should be enough to give the Fed confidence to begin removing some of the policy tightness later this year, though the resilience of the real economy means policymakers are in no rush.”Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “Investor sentiment has improved over the past six months thanks to growing expectations for central banks to cut interest rates.“Investors have been happy to take greater risks, partly influenced by cash savings rates trending lower, which has driven more people to equities in search of better returns.“This confidence has helped to drive up valuations but also raises the prospect that markets could find it harder to keep rising if inflation proves stickier than expected and we don’t get the Fed’s monetary policy pivot any time soon.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

TheStreet,Analyst who correctly forecast Palantir's stock rally updates outlook,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analyst-correctly-forecast-palantirs-stock-173300455.html,Here's what may happen to Palantir's shares next.,"The artificial intelligence boom has helped many tech stocks, including Palantir Technologies, produce market-beating returns.While the S&P 500's 10% first-quarter return is nothing to sneeze at, Palantir shares surged 34%. Its shares also substantially outperformed the benchmark index over the past year, returning 172% since March 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up about 29%.Those extraordinary gains likely surprised many investors who were concerned that the Peter Thiel-founded company would struggle because the possible recession and congressional wrangling over the debt ceiling would dent demand.However, where others saw risk, TheStreet Pro's Stephen Guilfoyle saw an opportunity. He bought shares when they were trading below $10 in April 2023, allowing him to profit handsomely from surging optimism over AI spending.Given Palantir's shares rocket-ship ride higher and a current price near $23, Guilfoyle has updated his analysis and stock price target.Peter Thiel, co-founder and chairman of Palantir Technologies Inc., sees significant tailwinds from artificial intelligence spending.Bloomberg/Getty ImagesPalantir's demand driven by AI waveGuilfoyle's purchase of Palantir stock last year was based on its strong, debt-free balance sheet, improving free cash flow, and a clearer pathway to profit growth.The highly successful launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in December 2022 has proven to be a boon for the company, making Guilfoyle's prediction prescient.Interest in using AI to digest, interpret, and create new insights from siloed data has swelled across most industries, resulting in the most rapid research and development since the Internet Age in the 1990s.Related: Analyst unveils new Super Micro Computer stock price targetBanks are using AI programs to hedge risks, evaluate loans, and price products. Drugmakers are exploring its use in predicting drug targets and clinical trial outcomes. Manufacturers are evaluating if it can boost production and quality. AI may also help retailers forecast demand, manage inventories, and curb theft.Story continuesAI's widespread applications seem boundless, which has led many companies and governments to turn to Palantir's deep expertise in managing and protecting data for help in training and running new AI apps.Palantir's (PLTR) roots stretch back to helping the U.S. government design systems for counter-terrorism. Its Gotham platform continues to assist governments in those efforts today. It also offers solutions that manage, interpret, and report data across enterprise and cloud networks to large companies too.Its deep data experience positioned it perfectly to help customers design large language models and other AI solutions using its AI platform (AIP).""The demand for [Artificial Intelligence Platform] AIP is unlike anything we have seen in the past twenty years,"" said CEO Alan Karp last summer. ""We are currently in discussions with more than three hundred additional enterprises to deploy AIP within their organizations, all of which are searching for an effective and secure means of adapting the latest large language models for use on their internal systems and proprietary data.""Related: White House explains how the government can and can't use AIKarp's optimism appears to have been well-placed. Palantir's year-over-year sales growth has exceeded 20% in each of the past three quarters, and its earnings per share growth in each of those quarters has been in the double-digit percentages.Revenue totaled $736 million and earnings per share were 9 cents in the fourth quarter, up 21% and 16% from the previous year.Wall Street analysts think Palantir's profit growth will continue. The consensus analyst estimate for earnings in 2024 and 2024 is 33 cents and 39 cents, respectively, an increase of 34% and 17%.Palantir pause may set up another opportunityInitially, Guilfoyle's Palantir stock price target was $12. However, he bumped that target to $18 last June, $20 last July, and $22 last August.Shares eclipsed $22 in February, reaching a high of $27.5 in early March. Since then, they've retreated about 16% to $23.More AI Stocks:Analysts revamp C3.ai stock price targets after earningsAnalyst overhauls Nvidia stock price target after conferenceAMD stock analysts overhaul price targets after China newsGuilfoyle thinks Palantir's pullback may be creating another upside opportunity for investors.""Palantir is on sale and I'm buying for future generations,"" wrote Guilfoyle recently. ""Palantir remains a top-15 long-side allocation for me.""The biggest knock against Palantir is its valuation.The company's shares aren't cheap by most metrics and boast a sky-high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a fact that Guilfoyle concedes.""The stock trades at 74 times forward-looking earnings (probably a little less now), 25 times sales, and 15 times book,"" said Guilfoyle.Tech stocks are known for trading at higher valuations because of their faster growth rates. Still, Palantir's P/E is significantly higher than that of many companies in the sector. For example, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two other AI stock beneficiaries, have forward P/E ratios of 38 and 56.Nevertheless, Guilfoyle thinks Palantir's got enough going right for it to deserve a premium valuation. In his words, it has a ""fortress-like balance sheet"" and substantial operating cash flow.Operating cash flow exceeded $700 million in the past 12 months, and its current ratio, a measure of its ability to pay short-term liabilities with short-term assets, is 5.5, giving it plenty of financial firepower to take advantage of the AI opportunity.Guilfoyle believes shares will trade higher since the AI spending trend appears to have multi-year legs. His price target is $27.Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"

Motley Fool,Nikola Soared Again Thursday. Is the Red-Hot Stock a Buy Right Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nikola-soared-again-thursday-red-163400130.html,Investors liked news about the company's hydrogen refueling stations.,"Nikola (NASDAQ: NKLA) stock recorded another day of big gains in Thursday's trading. The electric vehicle (EV) company's share price closed out the daily session up 14%.Nikola stock began gaining ground last week after the company celebrated the opening of its first Hyla hydrogen refueling station in Southern California. The rally received an extra boost of energy after it was announced Wednesday that Alberta, Canada, would be getting its first commercial hydrogen refueling station courtesy of Nikola's Hyla brand and a collaboration with Suncor, Leduc County, Emissions Reduction Alberta, and Blackjack Roadhouse.Due to Nikola stock being heavily shorted, positive developments on the hydrogen-refueling front also appear to be triggering a short-squeeze. Many investors had bet against the stock by borrowing shares with the hope that they could buy them back at a lower price and score the difference as a profit.Is it time to buy Nikola stock?Due to the sudden share price surge, the short-sellers are now apparently quickly buying back shares to close out their positions and avoid potentially massive losses. That purchasing is creating even more bullish momentum for the stock. Nikola stock is now up roughly 57% over the last five trading days.While it's possible that Nikola stock could continue heading higher in the near term, it's important to keep in mind that most short-squeezes tend to be fairly short-lived. The EV specialist's share price has already seen a dramatic upswing, and the long-term outlook for the business remains fraught despite recent signs of progress for its refueling station business.Nikola's fuel-cell-electric-vehicle trucks continue to be the company's main source of revenue and continue to be sold at massive losses. Last year, the business recorded a net loss of roughly $966.3 million on sales of approximately $35.8 million.With the business burning cash at a rapid pace, Nikola will need to secure new funding through new stock sales or taking on debt. The company has a poor track record when it comes to executing and fulfilling promises, and its weak business momentum and financial position suggest that the stock won't work out as a long-term investment.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Nikola right now?Before you buy stock in Nikola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nikola wasn’t one of them.
