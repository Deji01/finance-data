This could bring about a future where the seller would no longer be paying for the buyer's agent, leading to more buyers being their own agents.The changes would ""decouple"" the commissions owed to the buyer and seller agents, allowing more flexibility in negotiation, according to Stephen Brobeck, a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America.Don't Miss:Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can co-invest in at $1.15 per share.US military-backed AI robotics company announces new equity raise for regular investors, here’s how to buy shares and potentially own a stake.He estimates that over time, a home being sold for $500,000 would save $10,000 in commission costs, potentially lowering the price of homes being sold.However, not everyone is convinced that buyers will benefit from the rule change, at least in the short term.Lei Wedge, an associate professor specializing in real estate and investments at the University of South Florida, told Yahoo! Finance that ""it's going to be worse for the buyer"" because ""buyers will [probably] end up paying more money for the home because now they have to come up with a commission to pay their buyer agent because this is a seller’s market.""Trending: Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series.Even with those concerns, Wedge remains optimistic that over the longer term, it'll bring progress in lowering costs as ""[in] the rest of the world, the commission to sell a property is 2% to 3% ... there’s no reason the average cost of selling a property in the United States is 5.49%.""Story continuesMarkets have already started to price in the prospect of a major shake-up to the commission structure that occurs in today's real estate transactions.Before the settlement was determined, financial services firm Morningstar singled out CoStar Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CSGP), which owns homes.com, as a beneficiary, saying, ""Homes.com should be largely unaffected from the direct implications of this lawsuit as it aims to monetize just one side of the transaction by selling advertisement products to enhance the exposure of seller listings on its platform.""Meanwhile, Morningstar argued that ""real estate portals like Zillow and Realtor.com stand to lose the most from the impacts of this decision as they make most of their revenue by routing buyer leads to real estate agents that buy its advertising products. Since the lawsuit mainly targets the buyer-side brokerage commission, therefore it can have a significant impact on Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Realtor.com.""The stocks of CoStar and Zillow have diverged accordingly, with CoStar up about 18% in the past month compared to Zillow down over 3%.Regardless of how the situation plays out, it's left those in the real estate industry with significant uncertainty.

Motley Fool,"This ""Magnificent Seven"" Stock Still Has 20% Upside After Its Recent Surge, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-stock-still-20-194747259.html,The best performer among this vaunted group still has room to run.,"Some of the market's best performers last year had one thing in common. They were already well acquainted with the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and have since become known jointly as the ""Magnificent Seven."" The group has continued its market-beating ways in 2024, rising 88%, on average, so far this year (as of Monday afternoon).One Wall Street analyst believes the best-performing member of this group still has upside ahead.Trillions of dollars in spending are on the horizonNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been a clear winner in the AI revolution. The stock is up 257% over the past year, leaving investors to wonder when it will run out of steam. TD Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay believes there's more to come, raising Nvidia's price target to $1,100 while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the shares. That represents a potential upside for investors of 15% compared to the stock's price Monday afternoon.After attending the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) last week, the analyst was bullish on Nvidia's ""leadership position in all forms of accelerated computing, especially AI, across compute, networking, and software.""I believe the analyst is definitely on the right track. The biggest upside potential could come from data centers, where much of the accelerated computing and AI processing occurs. Existing data centers must be upgraded to handle the rigors of AI processing, which requires much more computational horsepower than before.Estimates suggest $1 trillion will be spent upgrading data centers over the coming four years. Furthermore, the rapid adoption of AI will require new data centers to be built. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggests that over the coming four to five years, the installed base of data centers will double to more than $2 trillion.Nvidia stock currently sells for 38 times forward earnings. While that's a premium compared to the price-to-earnings ratio of 28 for the S&P 500, Nvidia's track record of growth and the significant opportunity ahead make it worth every cent.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), the exchange-traded fund with the largest Boeing share at 16%, was up slightly less than 1%. ITA's stake, valued at $950 million, is far smaller than that held by the fund with the largest overall Boeing stake, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), which slipped less than 1%. That fund's Boeing stake of 19 million shares is valued at $5 billion, according to etf.com data.CEO Dave Calhoun is stepping down at the end of this year after four years in the post where he was unable to put an end to quality problems with the 737 Max and eliminate snafus like doors blowing off of planes and manufacturing glitches. Boeing's Chairman Larry Kellner is also being replaced and Stan Deal head of its commercial aircraft business, will depart immediately.ITA and other Boeing-heavy ETFs incremental moves on the Boeing news play into the reasons why investors prefer ETFs over owning a single stock as a way to reduce risk.“The diversification that ETFs provide tends to make it so a single stock has limited impact on investor returns—usually,” said etf.com analyst Sumit Roy.“Sometimes weightings in single stocks can be substantial, such as in narrower ETFs that hold a relatively small number of stocks, or ETFs that target industries where one company dominates,"" he said. ""But even in those cases, moves in a single stock—unless they are huge—tend to get watered down by the rest of the portfolio.""While Boeing is up 5% over the past five days, the shares are down 25% year to date, compared to a 10% rise in the S&P 500. Over the past five years, Boeing has dropped 46% while the S&P 500 has added 87%, according to charts on Yahoo Finance. In that time, ITA has gained 6.6%Story continuesITA has lost $185 million in outflows since January. Even while Boeing's poor performance has contributed to percentage point losses, its other holdings have prevented Boeing's stock from tanking the fund.Boeing is also a major part of the $18.5 million leveraged Direxion Daily Aeropace & Defense Bull 3X Shares (DFEN), which is up 4% to date and the $52 million First Trust Indxx Aerospace & Defense ETF (MISL), which has seen gains of 5% year to date.Boeing Quality Control ProblemsWhile investors cheered the leadership change, potential headwinds exist. Calhoun’s departure comes after a slew of quality problems and manufacturing slowdowns at the company, especially with the Boeing 737 Max plane model.Criticism about quality problems escalated in early January when the panel of a new Boeing 737 fell out minutes into an Alaska Airlines flight. The Federal Aviation Administration announced in late January they were pausing Boeing’s production of tis 737 Max aircraft.In an interview on CNBC Monday, Calhoun said that his decision to leave as “100% his own.Boeing CFO Brian West said last week that the company would see a major cash outflow for the first quarter this year after a slower output and regulatory scrutiny.Contact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Investors took a more cautious stance on speculation that the personal consumption expenditures price index — due on Good Friday — will show inflation probably remained uncomfortably high. On that same day, Jerome Powell is also due to speak.A sense of prudence also prevailed after a stock surge spurred speculation the market has gone too far, too fast. Concern about a disconnect between earnings expectations and share prices have grown, with Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. warning that it’s hard to justify lofty valuations if profit acceleration fails to materialize.“We continue to see sentiment as stretched and think a US equity market pullback is overdue,” said Lori Calvasina at RBC Capital Markets.The S&P 500 hovered neat 5,225. Intel Corp. slipped on a news report China is limiting the use of foreign chips. Boeing Co. climbed after announcing that its chief will step down. Treasury 10-year yields rose five basis points to 4.25%. Bitcoin topped $70,000.In a sign of how stretched the stock market has been, the S&P 500 finished last week 14% above its 200-day moving average.“That’s quite stretched historically,” said Jonathan Krinsky at BTIG. “The big question is: do we get a correction through time, or price. The latter has been elusive for the last five months, but we do think there is a window here for some modest price weakness.”Story continuesThat happens at a time when consensus earnings estimates have been revised lower, with analysts currently expecting earnings-per-share to grow about 9% this year versus 11% at the start of November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.“The stock market faces its next test in a few weeks when earnings season begins in mid-April,” said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth. “Stock prices and valuations are elevated heading into this next earnings season, which leaves little room for disappointment if companies fail to deliver strong earnings.Investors looking to put new money to work in the market should wait for a pullback, Bellin added.“The market already had a few minor pullbacks so far this year,” Bellin also noted. “They were shallow and quick, but they proved to be good buying opportunities.”The combination of healthy US economic data, expectations the Fed will cut rates and optimism about artificial intelligence have all driven the S&P 500 up almost 10% this year — leaving many year-end forecasts in the dust.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists are sticking with their year-end prediction of 5,200 — but have a scenario in which tech megacaps lead the index up to 6,000.“Although AI optimism appears high, long-term growth expectations and valuations for the largest TMT stocks are still far from ‘bubble’ territory,” the strategists led by David Kostin wrote.Strong corporate earnings, economic resilience in the face of higher interest rates and “prospects for innovation” have prompted Oppenheimer Asset Management’s John Stoltzfus to raise his year-end target on the S&P 500 Index to 5,500 — joining Societe Generale for the highest forecast on Wall Street.“The big surprise this year has not been so much the resilience of the economy, but rather the substantial capitulation among the bears and bearish community,” Stoltzfus said. Profit taking, particularly in Big Tech, is expected and normal — and any near-term volatility is opportunity to “catch babies that get thrown out with the bath water,” he noted.Corporate Highlights:Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. face the risk of potentially hefty fines as the European Union opened a full-blown investigation into the firms’ compliance with strict new laws reining in the power of Big Tech.US aviation authorities are considering drastic measures to curb growth at United Airlines Holdings Inc., including preventing the carrier from adding new routes, following a series of safety incidents.Lucid Group Inc. is getting a $1 billion cash injection from its biggest investor, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, providing the troubled electric carmaker with a needed lifeline.Manulife Financial Corp. has struck another deal to offload some of its less-profitable assets, agreeing to reinsure C$5.8 billion ($4.3 billion) of Canadian policies with RGA Life Reinsurance Co. of Canada.Match Group Inc., the owner of dating apps Tinder and Hinge, named two directors to its board following discussions with activist investor Elliott Investment Management.Novo Nordisk A/S agreed to buy Cardior Pharmaceuticals for up to €1 billion ($1.1 billion) as the Danish maker of weight-loss drugs continues to expand into treatments for cardiovascular disease.Key events this week:ECB chief economist Philip Lane participates in event in Dublin, TuesdayUS durable goods, Conference Board consumer confidence, TuesdayChina industrial profits, WednesdayBank of England issues financial policy committee minutes, WednesdayEurozone economic confidence, consumer confidence, WednesdayFed Governor Christopher Waller speaks, WednesdayUK GDP revision, ThursdayUS University of Michigan consumer sentiment, initial jobless claims, GDP, ThursdayJapan unemployment, Tokyo CPI, industrial production, retail sales, FridayUS personal income and spending, PCE deflator, FridayGood Friday.

Motley Fool,Buy the Dip on Tesla Stock? Forget It -- Here's Why.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-dip-tesla-stock-forget-183600395.html,"The EV maker is dealing with some challenges, and the shares are taking a hit because of it.","With the Nasdaq Composite index in record territory these days, investors might think that all growth-focused businesses are soaring in value. That's just not true.Take Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). The once high-flying electric vehicle (EV) stock is driving in the wrong direction. Shares are down 31% this year and off 58% from their all-time high, which was set in November 2021.Contrarian investors might be thinking it's the perfect time to buy the dip on Tesla. I'd think twice about this course of action. Here's why.Temporary issues or permanent struggles?Tesla's ongoing challenges have been widely publicized. The business reported 3.5% revenue growth in Q4. That was a major slowdown compared to previous years. It points to the higher-rate environment that discourages consumers from wanting to buy new cars. This situation makes monthly payments more expensive.But Tesla's decelerating revenue demonstrates the competitive nature of the EV industry as well. There are numerous rivals all focused heavily on EV investments, hoping to boost manufacturing capacity and launch new models. This means Tesla will have its work cut out for it going forward.Consequently, the business must compete aggressively on price. Over the past couple years, Elon Musk and his team haven't shied away from lowering prices on its range of cars on many different occasions to support demand and maintain market share. The result has been contracting margins, which no investor wants to see.It's not a surprise that shareholders have rushed for the exits. Tesla's financials have taken a hit. And the stock is down big, now trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40. That valuation is certainly cheaper than it was just three months ago.Investors who are considering buying the stock need to ask if Tesla's latest struggles are temporary or permanent. If you believe they're the former, then adding shares to your portfolio looks like a smart move. But this might not be the case.Story continuesFrom losers to winnersAfter reporting two straight quarters of subscriber losses at the start of 2022, Netflix shares took a beating. From their all-time high in November 2021 to their low in May 2022, they dropped 76%. The stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 15.During a roughly 14-month stretch from September 2021 to November 2022, Meta Platforms saw its shares tank 76%, and they were selling at a cheap P/E ratio of under 9. Investors were worried about the weak digital ad market pressuring sales growth, as well as crushed margins due to heavy metaverse spending. Both Netflix and Meta have absolutely skyrocketed since those lows, thanks mainly to stronger business performance and a favorable market backdrop.Tesla bulls will quickly point to how the EV maker's current situation mimics these two leading internet companies. It's easy to be skeptical about this stance, though.For starters, Tesla's current valuation is astronomically higher than where Meta and Netflix traded at during their low points in 2022. You can argue that Tesla has much greater growth potential, but that would imply lofty expectations about the future, with the hopes that EV sales will catapult higher in an interest rate environment that's not as supportive as it was during the 2010s.Investors are probably also pricing it the probability that Tesla will introduce fully autonomous vehicles, or that it will start selling humanoid robots to other companies, or that its energy ambitions will take off. This stuff is unpredictable, but it's likely reflected in the valuation.Meta and Netflix were and are still the clear leaders in industries whose competitive dynamics have already largely played out. Netflix had the most subscribers of any streaming service, with impressive profitability and unit economics. Meta, on the other hand, had billions of daily active users and a global network effect. Once industry and macro conditions improved, these companies got back to their positive trajectories.The EV market is less established. But it has proven to resemble the cyclical nature of the traditional auto market. So while it might be tempting to rush and buy Tesla stock on the dip, that's not what I'm doing. The issues the business is facing may prove to be the beginning of more normalized trends.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool contributor Travis Hoium expressed similar sentiments.However, one analyst at DA Davidson, Gil Luria, thinks otherwise, maintaining his price target of $685. Bolstered by 16% growth in remaining performance obligations (RPO) and unrelenting product innovation courtesy of generative artificial intelligence (AI), Adobe still offers 37% upside, according to Luria.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Adobe's AI opportunityIntegrating a rapidly growing array of AI use cases across its Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds, Adobe has positioned itself to thrive amid the technological revolution. Whether it's Adobe's AI Assistant within Acrobat and Reader, Firefly (its creative generative AI models), or GenStudio -- an enterprise-grade AI offering -- the company promises not to be left behind on today's investing megatrend.One example highlighting the widespread adoption of Adobe's offerings: Over 80% of entrants to the Sundance Film Festival used one or more of the company's products.Is Adobe a buy?Although the company trades at 35 times free cash flow (FCF) as of this writing, this figure drops to 30 after adjusting for the one-time fee of $1 billion tied to its failed Figma acquisition. While Luria's price target of $685 -- based on forecasted 2025 earnings -- is lofty at 41 times FCF, Adobe looks like a good candidate for dollar-cost-averaging.With that strategy, investors can get some skin in the game on a potential $1 trillion company without going ""all in"" at one price.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Adobe right now?Before you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Adobe wasn’t one of them.

One lingering issue may continue to weigh on the stock in the near term, but the analyst believes better-than-expected earnings results should support the stock's valuation.The last cloud hanging over DisneyDisney is still facing a challenge from activist investors. Nelson Peltz's Trian Group owns $3.5 billion of Disney stock and is attempting to win board seats through a proxy vote at Disney's annual shareholder meeting on April 3.Venkateshwar believes the uncertainty of the proxy vote has taken investors' attention away from Disney's solid earnings results last quarter. But an end to the proxy battle could shift more focus back to Disney's fundamentals, and the stock is already responding to more optimistic earnings growth assumptions from Wall Street analysts.DIS ChartWhy buy Disney stockDuring the most recent earnings call in February, CEO Bob Iger said the company was on track to meet or exceed $7.5 billion in cost savings. Disney is in the process of improving profitability while investing more in its theme parks and other entertainment properties to grow the business over the next decade.The consensus estimate currently has Disney reporting adjusted earnings of $1.06 for its next quarterly update in May, representing a 14% year-over-year increase.
