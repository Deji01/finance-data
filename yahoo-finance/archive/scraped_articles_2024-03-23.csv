Motley Fool,This Small Dividend Stock Has a $200 Million-Plus Secret Weapon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-dividend-stock-200-million-191900873.html,Want to own a business that has built-in growth to support its dividend (and dividend growth)?,
Motley Fool,This High-Yield Dividend Stock's $23 Billion Secret Weapon,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-yield-dividend-stocks-23-190500599.html,"As the advertising market rebounds, this real estate investment trust could be a big winner.","If you're looking for a high-yield dividend stock, one of the best places to find one is in the real estate sector, specifically among the real estate investment trusts (REITs).REITs tend to pay generous dividend yields because they are required by law to pay out at least 90% of their profits as dividends.Right now looks like a great time for dividend investors to capitalize on the opportunity in REITs because share prices in the sector have fallen as interest rates have surged. However, interest rates should start falling later this year, according to the Federal Reserve's forecast, which should encourage investors to move back into dividend stocks like REITs, lifting their share prices.Investors have a lot of choices in the REIT sector -- office, residential, industrial, retail, and healthcare, each of which offers different advantages. A high-yielding REIT stock that is different from most of the sector is Outfront Media (NYSE: OUT), one of the biggest owners of outdoor advertising properties, including digital and traditional billboards.The stock currently offers a dividend yield of 7.6% and has the stock surged in recent months, nearly doubling from its low in October.Outfront will also benefit from a secret weapon in its industry, but first, let's look at why the stock is a good bet to keep climbing from here.Image source: Getty Images.A cyclical tailwindLike other REITs, Outfront has benefited from expectations of falling interest rates since October, when the stock market began rallying.In addition to the benefit from falling interest rates, Outfront is also getting a tailwind from a rebound in the advertising market, which is highly cyclical. Advertisers had scaled back on ad spending in 2022 and 2023 in preparation for a recession that never arrived, and now ad demand is picking back up as consumer spending remains strong.Outfront's fourth-quarter growth was modest, with revenue up just 1.3%, in part because of headwinds in its transit segment. However, management pointed to stronger demand in its billboard segment, which is leading to higher rates and should drive expanding margins as well.Story continuesFor 2024, the company expects adjusted funds from operations to increase by high single digits from the $271 million it reported in 2023.However, the real reason the stock could soar is its emerging digital business as the outdoor advertising industry converts to digital billboards.Outfront's $23 billion opportunityOutfront's digital revenue rose 8.9% in the quarter to $179.5 million, making up 35.8% of its total revenue, but the opportunity in digital out-of-the-home (DOOH) advertising is much larger and growing swiftly.According to one estimate, the DOOH market was worth $23.2 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow by 11.2% annually through 2029 to reach a market size of $48.9 billion.Outfront looks uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity, especially as features like programmatic advertising add value to its DOOH properties and raise advertising rates.On Tuesday, for example, the company announced a significant expansion of programmatic advertising in New York City's transit system. Outfront has digitally programmable signs in nearly every subway station, 3,800 in total, and the platform allows advertisers to run ads and change them according to variables like time of day and location. Outfront has also partnered with companies including The Trade Desk, Freshpet, and the NBA.If Outfront can capitalize on the double-digit growth in the DOOH market, while benefiting from the fall in interest rates and the rebound in the broader advertising market, the stock looks set to be a winner over the coming years. Investors who buy the stock today can also take advantage of its appealing 7.6% dividend yield.Should you invest $1,000 in Outfront Media right now?Before you buy stock in Outfront Media, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Outfront Media wasn’t one of them.

Business Insider,Elite investor Jeffrey Gundlach compares the AI boom in stocks to the dot-com bubble — and warns of economic pain,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elite-investor-jeffrey-gundlach-compares-083101889.html,Jeffrey Gundlach said he doesn't want to own the Magnificent Seven stocks at these price levels. Bill Gross and John Hussman issued similar warnings.,
Motley Fool,"If There Was a ""Magnificent Seven"" for Dividend Stocks, These Would Be My Top Picks",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/magnificent-seven-dividend-stocks-top-151600880.html,"They're quality companies from a variety of sectors, including tech, consumer staples, industrials, energy, and financials.","The Magnificent Seven includes some of the most innovative tech-orientated companies on the market. But what if there was a Magnificent Seven for dividend stocks?Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), and United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) represent their industries well and are all top dividend stocks you can count on for decades to come. Here's why they would make my list for the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks.Image source: Getty Images.1. MicrosoftMicrosoft is the only Magnificent Seven stock that also deserves to be in the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks. It is the most valuable company in the world. Microsoft only yields 0.7%, but it pays the most dividends of any U.S.-based company.Microsoft's low yield is due to its outperforming stock price, not a lack of commitment to dividend raises. Since fiscal 2019, Microsoft has raised its dividend by 9% to 11% every year like clockwork. The dividend has doubled over the last eight years -- a faster growth rate than many of the market's top dividend stocks.Microsoft is monetizing artificial intelligence and growing its earnings, paving the way for plenty of future dividend raises. If the stock price languishes, the dividend yield will rise to a much more attractive level. However, Microsoft shareholders would surely prefer outsized gains over a higher dividend yield.2. Coca-ColaCoke uses its dividend as the primary way to reward faithful shareholders. With a yield of 3.2%, Coke allows investors to collect passive income from a tried and true Dividend King with 62 consecutive annual dividend increases.Coke is a low-growth business, so investors shouldn't expect outsized gains from the stock. But this is the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks, not growth stocks. And when it comes to generating passive income, Coke is as reliable as it gets.Coke's consistency is the core reason why Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held the stock for over 30 years.Story continuesIf it were a decision between Coke and a 10-year Treasury, I'd take Coke all day. The 10-year gives investors another percentage point or so in yield, but with no participation in the market. Of course, no stock is as safe as the risk-free rate, but Coke is close. It's the ideal investment for risk-averse investors or anyone looking to supplement income in retirement.3. Procter & GambleProcter & Gamble has a massive capital return program. It is a great example of a company using dividends and stock repurchases to reward shareholders.The following chart is one of the prettiest you'll ever see from a stodgy consumer staple company.PG Shares Outstanding ChartP&G stock has more than doubled over the last decade, the dividend is up over 46%, and P&G has repurchased a considerable amount of stock, reducing its share count by 13%.P&G may not be the most exciting business, but glitz and glam isn't the point of this list. When it comes to rewarding shareholders, P&G has done it in many ways and has the business model and brand power needed to continue that streak going forward.4. ChevronChevron's stock buybacks aren't nearly as consistent as P&G's. The oil giant tends to buy back more stock during an uptick in the business cycle and pull back on repurchases and capital spending when oil and gas prices fall.But Chevron's dividends are as consistent as they come. Chevron has raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. That means it didn't cut it during the COVID-19-induced crash, the 2014 and 2015 downturn, or any oil and gas downturn since the late 1980s.Chevron has the balance sheet, cost profile, and portfolio to continue rewarding shareholders. Its dividend yield of 4.2% makes it one of the higher-yielding reliable stocks out there.5. Home DepotHome Depot has been a perfect dividend stock over the last decade. It has crushed the broader market, and somehow, the dividend has grown at an ever faster rate.HD ChartHome Depot has also reduced its share count by over a fourth while expanding the business.Investors shouldn't expect this level of growth over the next 10 years, but Home Depot is still a good investment. The company is vulnerable to external factors, such as broader economic cycles, the housing market, the construction industry, and consumer spending. But it is well positioned, and one of the best cyclical dividend stocks to own long term.6. JPMorgan ChaseSince Nov. 1, JPMorgan is up over 38% -- a massive move for such a large, diversified bank. JPMorgan is now worth more than Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and half of Citigroup combined. The Big Four banks have really turned into JPMorgan and the other three.Banking is a cyclical industry that tends to ebb and flow to the tune of the broader economy. Right now, JPMorgan's profits are soaring.Still, what makes the company a good long-term investment, and a worthy addition to the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks, is that it regularly returns value to its shareholders. Over the last decade, the dividend is up 176%, while the share count is down nearly a fourth.JPM Net Income (TTM) ChartJPMorgan slashed most of its dividend in 2009 during the fallout of the financial crisis. But since then, it has raised its dividend every year. Today, the dividend is nearly triple what it was pre-cut, and JPMorgan has turned into a quality passive income play.The recent run-up in the stock price has pushed JPMorgan's yield down to 2.2%. But the company is at the top of its game and is a good representative of the financials sector in the Magnificent Seven of dividend stocks.7. UPSUPS has raised its dividend every year for the last 21 years, except for in 2009, when it kept its dividend flat. The company isn't the most reliable dividend payer on this list, but it has increasingly used dividends as a key way to reward shareholders.In 2022, UPS raised its dividend by 49%, a significant increase for its size. Today, UPS yields 4.3%, which is high for an industry-leading industrial company.UPS is a cyclical business that depends on the strength of the broader economy. Package delivery volumes to businesses are higher during an economic expansion. Similarly, deliveries to consumers are higher when discretionary spending is strong.Although UPS offers investors a compelling yield, it's doubtful the company will make as large of raises to its dividend going forward. Still, its current level is quite high, as UPS stock would have to rally about 45% for the yield to fall below 3%.Different companies, similar investmentsMicrosoft, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Chevron, Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, and UPS have track records of dividend raises, solid underlying businesses, future growth prospects, and industry leadership. Many of these companies also reward shareholders with stock repurchases, as well as long-term capital gains for patient investors.These companies may not always have the highest yields, but they do have earnings growth, which sets the stage for future raises.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,3 Reasons to Buy Ford Stock Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-ford-stock-150200853.html,"Ford's electric vehicle business is costing it a pretty penny, but the company still has a lot going for it currently.","There's a lot of doom and gloom surrounding Detroit automakers right now. The automotive industry is capital intensive; consumers aren't adopting electric vehicles (EVs) quickly enough to justify the billions of investment into fleets of EVs and battery technology; and Chinese automakers are on the brink of entering the lucrative U.S. market.Despite all the pessimism surrounding Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and the broader industry, the folks at the blue oval still have a lot going for them. Here are three big reasons to buy Ford stock now.Overlooked businessWhen investors think of Ford, they generally picture large trucks and SUVs. That's fair, especially considering that's what Detroit autos do best. But what many investors overlook is just how lucrative its commercial business is.In fact, Ford Blue, which is what investors consider its historical internal combustion engine business, generated $7.46 billion in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) during 2023. But right behind that segment was Ford Pro. Ford's commercial business, which includes its popular Transit vans, generated a surprising $7.22 billion EBIT.Here's the kicker: Ford Pro generated better margins than Ford Blue and grew its revenue at a higher rate. Ford Pro's EBIT margin checked in at a much healthier 12.4% compared to Ford Blue's 7.3%. (The latter is pretty standard for the mainstream automotive industry.) Furthermore, Ford Pro's revenue grew 19% compared to the prior year, a much faster rate compared to Ford Blue's 8% revenue growth.What's intriguing about Ford Pro going forward is that its software subscriptions increased by nearly 50% from the prior year, and orders for mobile repairs more than doubled. Ford Pro is a crucial part of Ford's investment thesis and will only continue to become more important for profits in the future.Improving ROICAnother thing many investors overlook is Ford's target for improving return on invested capital (ROIC). While Ford Blue and Ford Pro are thriving, the company's Model e -- its electric vehicle business -- is far from thriving.Story continuesIn fact, Model e lost roughly $4.7 billion in 2023 alone. But management is tightening up its operations, reducing costs, and postponing roughly $12 billion in planned spending on EV production capacity. As Ford improves its operating efficiency, it plans to improve ROIC from about 14% in 2023 to 20% over the next couple of years.In a highly capital-intensive industry, the improvement to ROIC shouldn't be overlooked and will also play a large role in improving Ford's investment thesis.Strong dividendInvestors simply can't form a Ford investment thesis without considering its healthy dividend. Ford declared a first-quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share, making its forward yield almost 5%. It gets better, though. Ford also announced a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share -- a cherry on top for investors.What's even better for investors is that the company is targeting distributions between 40% and 50% of adjusted free cash flow. Speaking of cash flow, Ford's adjusted free cash flow checked in at $6.8 billion in 2023, far better than it's outlook of $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion, ensuring the dividend and supplemental potential remain strong going forward.Is Ford stock a buy?While the automotive industry can make for challenging investments, Ford is a great income story with its strong cash flow, 5% dividend yield, and reoccurring supplemental dividends. Plus, with the pessimism surrounding EV investments right now, the company trades at a modest 11 times price-to-earnings, leaving investors with an opportunity to pick up shares fairly cheaply.Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.
