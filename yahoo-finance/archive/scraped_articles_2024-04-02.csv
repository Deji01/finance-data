Treasury 10-year yields hit the highest levels in 2024 — putting further pressure on equities — a market which had been ignoring the hawkish repricing of rate-cut bets over the last few months. Aside from the macroeconomic picture, valuation concerns after a torrid rally have spurred calls for a pullback.“Stocks bulls may find it difficult justifying buying stocks at these elevated level as yields rise,” said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and FOREX.com. “Looking ahead of the rest of the week, Federal Reserve speeches scheduled for this week are in double digits, and the market may anticipate Monday’s manufacturing data to instil caution among officials regarding substantial policy easing.”Following hotter-than-estimated data around the world, Citigroup’s Economic Surprise Index — which measures the difference between actual releases and analyst expectations — is now hovering near the highest level in about a year.The S&P 500 fell 1% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 underperformed, with Tesla Inc. leasing losses in megacaps. Treasury 10-year yields rose seven basis points to 4.38%. Oil hovered near $85 for the first time since October, copper rallied back above $9,000 a ton and gold hovered near all-time highs. Bitcoin sank.Equities have rallied this year, powered by megacap and technology stocks, as the economy has stayed resilient while inflation has been trending down, underpinning the case that rate cuts will come this year. Still, expectations for the first Fed cut has been pushed back — and odds that the central bank will lower rates at the June meeting are a coin-flip at the moment.Story continuesTo Mislav Matejka at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the market has made the assumption that economic growth would come to the rescue — yet earnings estimates for 2024 are still not moving up. The firm’s fixed-income strategists expect bond yields to move lower in the second half of the year, and Matejka says that there is also a “lot of complacency in the bond market” about inflation risks.Bank of America Corp. clients from mom-and-pop investors to hedge funds were net sellers of US equities last week, withdrawing a net $1.9 billion from the asset class across the final five trading days of the first quarter.Corporate Highlights:Tesla Inc. suffered its first year-over-year sales drop since the early days of the Covid pandemic. The electric carmaker handed over 386,810 vehicles in the first three months of 2024. That fell so far short of analysts’ average estimate for 449,080 deliveries that it was its biggest miss ever.Health insurance stocks tumbled after US regulators didn’t boost payments for private Medicare plans like the industry had come to expect.PVH Corp. shares plunged the most since 1987’s Black Monday crash after the company gave full-year sales guidance that fell short of expectations.SLB agreed to acquire rival oil field service provider ChampionX for $7.8 billion in an all-stock deal, a move that will bulk up SLB’s portfolio as aging shale fields mean US drillers need better technology to maintain oil and gas production.Airbus SE delivered about 145 aircraft in the first three months of the year as the planemaker works to ramp up output and meet its annual handover goal of 800 jets.Verve Therapeutics Inc. tumbled after it cited safety concerns for pausing enrollment in a study of its gene-editing treatment for people with high cholesterol, delivering a setback to the promising new field of medicine.Key events this week:China Caixin services PMI, WednesdayEurozone CPI, unemployment, WednesdayJapan services PMI, WednesdayUS ADP employment, ISM Services, WednesdayFed Chair Jerome Powell speaks, WednesdayFed’s Austan Goolsbee, Adriana Kugler and Michelle Bowman also speak, WednesdayEurozone S&P Global Services PMI, PPI, ThursdayUS initial jobless claims, Challenger job cuts, ThursdayFed’s Loretta Mester, Alberto Musalem, Thomas Barkin, Patrick Harker, Austan Goolsbee speak, ThursdayEuropean Central Bank publishes account of March rate decision, ThursdayEurozone retail sales, FridayUS unemployment, nonfarm payrolls, FridayFed’s Michelle Bowman, Thomas Barkin and Lorie Logan speak, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 1.1% as of 10:16 a.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1%The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.8%The MSCI World index fell 0.7%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%The euro rose 0.3% to $1.0770The British pound was little changed at $1.2563The Japanese yen was little changed at 151.53 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 6% to $65,613.88Ether fell 5.8% to $3,295.61BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced seven basis points to 4.38%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced 12 basis points to 2.42%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced 15 basis points to 4.09%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.1% to $84.60 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.9% to $2,271.83 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Michael Msika.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

They’re forecasting about 65 basis points of rate reductions in 2024, compared to the 75 basis points signaled by the median estimate of projections released following the Fed’s March 19-20 meeting.“I thought it would be hard for the market to challenge the Fed on the hawkish side, but apparently it is willing to do so, in the face of some evidence,” said Benoit Gerard, a rates strategist at Natixis in Paris.Traders are reacting to a couple of economic data points from the past few days that point to strength in the US economy, potentially reducing the need for rate cuts. Bonds have slumped in response, with the yield on 10-year US Treasuries hitting 4.35% on Tuesday, the highest level since November.First came income and spending data for February that showed consumption remains strong. Then, on Monday, a gauge of US manufacturing activity expanded for the first time since 2022, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the consumption data that the figures were “pretty much in line with our expectations” and repeated that the US central bank isn’t in any rush to cut interest rates.No Fed ratesetter has spoken publicly on monetary policy since Monday’s news, though there are several on the slate for later on Tuesday, including New York Fed President John Williams, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.Story continuesData on US factory orders, light vehicle sales and job openings due Tuesday may also offer more clues on the economy ahead of key payroll numbers on Friday.It’s not the first time in recent weeks traders have challenged the Fed’s outlook. They were also betting on fewer than 75 basis points of easing in the days leading up the March rates decision, though this time round the pricing is even more hawkish.The shift is also casting doubt on bets that the first rate cut will land in June. The probability of a quarter-point reduction in June briefly dropped below 50% on Monday.“While June is not off the table, market conviction for a first Fed cut by then is fading,” ING strategists including Benjamin Schroeder wrote in a note. “In the coming weeks we can expect some Fed speakers to remain vocal about June cuts, but in the end the data will be the deciding factor.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

The company owes lenders about $205 million, according to court documents.The company won court approval Tuesday to seek a quick vote of creditors in the coming weeks, which is a key step before it can emerge from bankruptcy. US Bankruptcy Judge Thomas Horan scheduled a hearing for May 8 to consider giving Airspan final approval for its debt-cutting plan.Should Horan bless the plan, Airspan would be able to leave bankruptcy after only about a month under court supervision.“The quicker we can get out the better,” company attorney Eric Lopez Schnabel told Horan during the court hearing.The company, based in Boca Raton, Florida, also won initial approval of a $53.9 million financing package that will refinance some older debt and provide fresh cash to help pay for the restructuring. The company will get access to $7.5 million of the cash immediately and must return to court for final approval for the rest.Founded in 1998, Airspan develops software and hardware for big wireless networks used by industrial customers and other major users who need to Internet signals throughout areas that have difficulty getting reception. One of the company’s biggest projects has been to help install wireless technology in New York’s subway system.Story continuesIn 2021, Airspan merged with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, under a process designed to help a business become publicly-traded more quickly and with fewer regulatory requirements than typically required under an initial public offering of shares. Only about 15% of such deals completed in 2021 have turned a profit.The case is Airspan Networks Holdings, 24-10621, US Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Cautionary Tale of Wirecutter and the Internet’s Favorite WokHow Michael Rubin Ended Up Holding All the CardsBuilding Diversity When Affirmative Action Is BannedFTX’s Original Sin Is a Warning to All of CryptoEclipse Boomtowns Await Their Moment in the (Blocked) Sun©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,"Why Advanced Micro Devices, C3.ai, Arm Holdings, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Slumped on Tuesday",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-advanced-micro-devices-c3-180436030.html,There are a lot of moving parts impacting the artificial intelligence (AI) space.,"It's clear that a couple of forces have been propelling the markets higher over the past year or so. Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) helped kick-start a bull market last year, as the technology promises to unleash a tidal wave of productivity increases. Market watchers are also keen to know when the Federal Reserve might begin lowering interest rates and how quickly those rate cuts might progress.With that as a backdrop, several AI-related stocks were sinking Tuesday. As of 1:16 p.m. ET, semiconductor specialist Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) had slumped 3.7%, AI software maker C3.ai (NYSE: AI) was down 2.8%, chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) had dropped 1.8%, and chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was also off by 1.8%A check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- showed nothing in the way of company-specific news to explain those falling share prices, which suggests investors are focused on broader economic developments.Image source: Getty Images.A rate cut in June? Not so fastMarket watchers have been eager for the Fed to begin dialing down its benchmark interest rate -- an event that will be a major indicator that U.S. inflation is finally under control. Yet Fed Chair Jerome Powell threw cold water on investors' hopes Friday, suggesting that while the central bank does still plans to cut the federal funds rate this year, it isn't in any hurry to start doing so. In a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, Powell said the Fed is looking for ""more good inflation readings"" and doesn't want to jump the gun and change monetary policy before inflation is under control.On Tuesday morning, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) released its highly watched ISM manufacturing index, which rose to 50.3, up from 47.8 and higher than the level of 48.1 expected by economists. Any number over 50 is indicative of growth in the manufacturing sector, which illustrates that inflation has yet to be fully tamed and adds to the mounting pile of indicators that the Fed may not cut rates as quickly as market watchers had hoped. It also suggests that the chances of a rate cut in June may be fading.Story continuesThat view was reinforced by the resilient jobs data released on Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Job openings were virtually unchanged at 8.8 million, while the number of hires and separations were also little changed at 5.8 million and 5.6 million, respectively.The robust economic growth signaled by strong manufacturing and jobs data suggests that while inflation is waning, it's not yet under control.Why it mattersSo, what does this have to do with our quartet of AI stocks? In short, when borrowing money costs more, businesses are less likely to adopt game-changing -- and costly -- technologies like generative AI. When money is tight, managers are content to postpone that type of spending until borrowing costs are lower.AMD provides graphics processing units (GPUs) that facilitate the training and use of AI models. These systems can cost tens of thousands of dollars or more per chip, making borrowing costs a consideration for many would-be buyers of them.C3.ai provides ready-built software models for enterprises, which companies may be unwilling to adopt when money is tight.Arm Holdings creates the blueprints upon which many widely used semiconductors are based, receiving licensing fees and royalties for the use of its designs. Higher inflation and slower adoption of tech could result in lower revenue.Micron Technology makes flash memory and storage processors that are critical components of AI processing, so it, too, is affected by higher interest rates.You get what you pay forIn terms of their valuations, this group of stocks is a mixed bag, though none are particularly cheap based on the most widely used metrics. Arm Holdings, AMD, C3.ai, and Micron currently trade for 27 times, 9 times, 9 times, and 4 times forward sales, respectively. However, when measured using a forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in a company's current growth rate -- Arm Holdings, Micron, and AMD clock in at less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock. C3.ai is the riskiest of the four, as the company has yet to generate a profit.It's still early innings for AI, so there is plenty of upside ahead. That said, investing in AI-related companies isn't for the faint of heart. Those considering it should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and ability to withstand the gut-wrenching volatility that's sure to continue.Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

Schaeffer's Investment Research,Bearish Trendline Threatening Chinese E-Tail Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bearish-trendline-threatening-chinese-e-172542903.html,Alibaba stock just brushed its historically bearish 100-day moving average,"U.S.-listed shares of China-based e-tailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) are 0.8% lower at $72.80 at last glance, following news that the company bought back shares worth $4.8 billion -- its second largest repurchase ever. BABA is underperforming in 2024, down 6.1% year to date, and a historically bearish signal is flashing that could keep headwinds blowing.Specifically, Alibaba stock just pulled back within one standard deviation of its 100-day moving average after mostly trading above the trendline since August. According to a study from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, eight other similar instances occurred in the last three years. After 75% of these occurrences, the equity suffered a drop one month later, averaging a 9.8% loss.A similar move from its current perch would put BABA near the $65.70 level, surpassing its year-to-date lows and moving to its lowest mark since November 2022. What's more, it would extend the stock's already steep 26% year-over-year deficit.BABA Chart 2 April 022024Sentiment surrounding Alibaba stock is already quite bullish. Of the 15 covering analysts, 12 rate the shares a ""strong buy."" Plus, short interest dropped 7.4% in the last reporting period.Now might be the perfect time to speculate on BABA's next move with options. The stock's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) of 29% sits in the low 8th percentile of its annual range. In other words, options players are pricing in lower-than-usual volatility expectations at the moment."
