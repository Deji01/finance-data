The acquisition aims to drive business transformation by providing comprehensive network management capabilities on a single, AI-first digital workflow platform. ServiceNow's partnership with Atrinet will enable telcos to streamline network processes, boost productivity, and reduce costs. The acquisition reflects ServiceNow's commitment to developing tailored industry solutions to accelerate customer transformation and efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of NetACE by ServiceNow represents a strategic move to bolster its offerings in the telecommunications sector. By integrating NetACE's network management and automation technology, ServiceNow is positioning itself as a comprehensive provider for telcos, aiming to streamline operations and improve efficiency. The consolidation of network lifecycle management on a single platform is anticipated to address the current inefficiencies telcos face due to manual processes. This could lead to a reduction in operational costs and an increase in productivity for ServiceNow's telecom clients, potentially making ServiceNow's platform more attractive and increasing its market share in this vertical.From a market perspective, this acquisition could signal ServiceNow's deeper foray into the telecom industry, suggesting possible future growth in this sector. Investors may interpret this move as ServiceNow's commitment to expanding its service offerings, which could have positive implications for the company's growth trajectory and stock performance. However, the impact on the stock market will depend on the successful integration of the technology and the realization of the anticipated operational efficiencies. Financial Analyst ServiceNow's acquisition of Atrinet's NetACE technology, while not disclosing financial terms, is an investment in the future of its telecom offerings. The market will be closely monitoring the post-acquisition integration process, as the success of this venture is contingent upon seamless technological integration and market adoption. Investors should consider the potential for increased revenue streams from new and existing telecommunications clients, as ServiceNow leverages NetACE to enhance its Telecom Network Inventory and Order Management products.Given that the acquisition is set to close in Q2 2024, investors should expect to see the financial impact of this deal reflected in subsequent financial statements. It will be critical to assess the return on investment in subsequent quarters through indicators such as revenue growth in the telecom segment, margin improvements and customer acquisition rates. The long-term financial health of ServiceNow could be positively influenced if the company successfully capitalizes on the growing demand for AI-first digital workflow platforms in the telecom industry. Telecommunications Industry Expert The integration of Atrinet's NetACE technology into the ServiceNow platform is a significant development for the telecommunications industry. This move addresses a common pain point for telcos: the complexity of managing extensive network infrastructures. By offering a low-code, cloud-native suite for automating network management processes, ServiceNow is enabling telcos to shift from manual to automated operations, which is critical in an industry that is rapidly evolving with the advent of 5G and IoT technologies.The partnership between ServiceNow and Atrinet, with Atrinet becoming a certified ServiceNow Consulting and Implementation Partner, suggests a collaborative approach to implementation and customer service post-acquisition. For telco clients, the promise of a unified platform for network lifecycle management, including discovery, activation and incident management, could translate into more agile operations and improved service delivery. This strategic acquisition may enhance ServiceNow's competitive edge in the telecom space, as telcos increasingly seek out intelligent, integrated solutions to manage their networks more efficiently. 02/25/2024 - 11:04 PM Acquisition to enable end-to-end network lifecycle management for telecommunications companies on a single, AI-first platform BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mobile World Congress -- ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), the leading digital workflow company making the world work better for everyone, today announced it has signed an agreement to acquire NetACE™ network management and automation technology from Atrinet to accelerate business transformation for telecommunications companies (telcos). Once re-platformed into the ServiceNow platform, Atrinet’s NetACE technology will enable comprehensive, end-to-end network lifecycle management for telcos on a single, AI-first digital workflow platform. Telcos often lack the tools and technology needed to drive efficiency in managing their network, and frequently rely on manual processes. The addition of Atrinet’s NetACE network discovery and activation capabilities to the Now platform will address these challenges by delivering stronger connectivity for telcos' workflows and greater alignment across their vast networks—from initial sales to activating and assuring a service. These new capabilities accelerate ServiceNow’s roadmap for telcos supporting ServiceNow’s Telecom Network Inventory and Order Management for Telecom products, with a significant step toward providing closed loop automation for telecommunications networks. “The power of ServiceNow is its ability to connect the entire telecommunications stack on a single platform,” said Rohit Batra, general manager, telecom, media, and technology industries at ServiceNow. “By adding Atrinet’s discovery and activation capabilities into our Telecom industry products, we're helping service providers manage the entire network lifecycle—driving productivity up and costs down.” This acquisition reflects ServiceNow’s dedication to developing comprehensive, purpose-built industry solutions to help customers boost productivity, drive efficiencies, and accelerate business transformation. Through this acquisition, ServiceNow is enabling telcos to manage essential network processes including discovery, activation, field service, incident management, and initiating workflows, all from a single platform. Atrinet NetACE cloud-native product suite provides a low-code approach to automating all discovery, provisioning, and network management processes for telcos under an open network, unified management system. In conjunction with the sale of NetACE to ServiceNow, Atrinet has become a certified ServiceNow Consulting and Implementation Partner. This partnership aims to deepen ServiceNow’s relationship with Atrinet and expand their offerings to provide implementation services to ServiceNow customers. Atrinet is fully committed to honoring its existing contracts, ensuring the delivery of exceptional services. ""Atrinet’s mission to provide innovative operations and network automation solutions to the telco industry complements ServiceNow’s intelligent platform and commitment to driving business transformation for customers,” said Efi Levi, CEO and founder of Atrinet. “We look forward to a deep partnership with ServiceNow to help global telcos drive operational efficiencies, exceptional customer service and business growth.” Atrinet was founded in 2013 and is headquartered in Hod-Hasharon, Israel. The acquisition of Atrinet’s NetACE™ network management and automation technology is the latest example of ServiceNow’s ongoing commitment to drive innovation in the telco industry. ServiceNow today announced it is partnering with NVIDIA to launch generative AI solutions for telcos, including Now Assist for Telecommunications Service Management (TSM), which will help telcos boost agent productivity, speed time to resolution, and enhance customer experiences. Segra, one of the largest independent fiber infrastructure bandwidth companies in the U.S., also announced it selected ServiceNow to launch its new SegraOne for Case and Incident Management. This solution will use ServiceNow Telecom Service Management to simplify everyday work and transform customer service and employee experiences by helping them resolve issues faster with AI-driven resolutions, increase transparency, and optimize omnichannel self-service.

Alcoa Announces Agreement With Alumina Limited on Terms and Process to Acquire Alumina Limited in All-Stock Transaction,2024-02-25T22:04:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Alcoa (AA) announces an agreement with Alumina Limited (AWC) for the acquisition of Alumina Limited, strengthening Alcoa's position as a leading bauxite and alumina producer. The all-scrip transaction values Alumina Limited at approximately $2.2 billion, with Alumina Limited shareholders receiving 0.02854 Alcoa shares per Alumina Limited share.

The all-scrip transaction values Alumina Limited at approximately $2.2 billion, with Alumina Limited shareholders receiving 0.02854 Alcoa shares per Alumina Limited share. The acquisition aims to enhance operational flexibility, provide long-term value creation, and increase exposure to Alcoa's global aluminum business. Positive Alcoa's agreement with Alumina Limited strengthens its position as a major bauxite and alumina producer. The all-scrip transaction values Alumina Limited at around $2.2 billion, with shareholders receiving 0.02854 Alcoa shares per Alumina Limited share. The acquisition aims to enhance operational flexibility, create long-term value, and increase exposure to Alcoa's global aluminum business. Alcoa's commitment to Western Australia is reaffirmed through the proposed acquisition. The transaction offers significant strategic and financial benefits for both companies' shareholders. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited by Alcoa represents a strategic move that could significantly alter the competitive landscape of the bauxite and alumina industry. This transaction would enhance Alcoa's vertical integration, providing control over a larger portion of the supply chain. Such consolidation can lead to economies of scale, potentially lowering production costs and increasing bargaining power with suppliers and customers. From a market research perspective, the deal could strengthen Alcoa's market position against competitors, particularly in regions where these tier-1 assets are located.Furthermore, the premium offered to Alumina Limited's shareholders suggests confidence in the synergies expected from the deal. The premium is indicative of the value Alcoa sees in acquiring Alumina Limited's assets, which could be a result of anticipated cost savings, increased market share, or improved operational efficiencies. The proposed secondary listing on the ASX for Alcoa could also facilitate liquidity for the new shareholders and demonstrate Alcoa's commitment to the Australian market. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications of the acquisition, the all-stock nature of the deal suggests a conservative approach to financing, avoiding the increase in debt that could accompany cash acquisitions. The implied equity value of $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited and the share exchange ratio should be scrutinized against industry benchmarks and historical transactions to ensure fair valuation. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Alcoa's earnings, given the potential for cost synergies and increased operational flexibility.However, the financial benefits must be weighed against the risks of integration and the costs associated with the transaction. The long-term financial profile of the combined entity will hinge on Alcoa's ability to effectively integrate Alumina Limited's operations and realize the anticipated value creation. Investors should also consider the impact of the transaction on Alcoa's capital returns program and whether the projected growth strategy aligns with current market conditions and commodity cycle trends. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the transaction is subject to various customary conditions and regulatory approvals, which include a scheme implementation agreement and approvals from both Alumina Limited's shareholders and Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. The absence of a financing condition underscores the transaction's preparedness but also places emphasis on the importance of regulatory compliance and shareholder approval.The appointment of two directors from Alumina Limited to Alcoa's Board post-acquisition is a strategic move to ensure smooth governance transition and representation of Alumina Limited's shareholder interests within the new corporate structure. The legal complexities of such cross-border transactions require meticulous due diligence to navigate the regulatory environment and to anticipate any potential antitrust concerns. 02/25/2024 - 05:04 PM Transaction would further enhance Alcoa’s position as of one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers with increased ownership of core, tier-1 assets Transaction would provide Alumina Limited shareholders the opportunity to participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better-capitalized company with a larger, more diversified portfolio Transaction would result in significant and long-term value creation for both companies’ shareholders from greater operational flexibility Alumina Limited’s largest holder, Allan Gray Australia, has entered into an agreement with Alcoa which gives Alcoa the right to acquire up to 19.9% of Alumina Limited’s issued share capital Investor conference call scheduled for today, February 25, 2024 at 6:00 p.m. ET / February 26, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. AEDT PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa (NYSE: AA or “Alcoa”) today announced that it has entered into an agreement with Alumina Limited (ASX: AWC) on terms and process for the acquisition of Alumina Limited, subject to entry into a scheme implementation agreement. Alcoa and Alumina Limited have entered into an exclusivity and transaction process deed (“Process Deed”), and the Alumina Limited Board of Directors has confirmed that, subject to entry into a scheme implementation agreement, it intends to recommend the transaction to Alumina Limited shareholders. Under the all-scrip, or all-stock, transaction, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive consideration of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share (the “Agreed Ratio”). Based on Alcoa’s closing share price as of February 23, 2024, the Agreed Ratio implies an equity value of approximately $2.2 billion for Alumina Limited. The Alumina Limited Board of Directors intends to recommend the Agreed Ratio in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the transaction is in the best interests of Alumina Limited shareholders. Under the Process Deed, Alcoa and Alumina Limited intend to finalize and enter into a scheme implementation agreement for the all-scrip transaction (the “Agreement”). Upon completion of the Agreement, Alumina Limited shareholders would own 31.25 percent, and Alcoa shareholders would own 68.75 percent of the combined company.1 Alcoa is the sole operator of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), a joint venture (“JV”) with Alumina Limited. AWAC consists of a number of affiliated entities that own, operate or have an interest in bauxite mines and alumina refineries in Australia, Brazil, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Guinea. AWAC also has a 55 percent interest in an aluminum smelter in Victoria, Australia. Alcoa owns 60 percent and Alumina Limited owns 40 percent of the AWAC entities, respectively, directly, or indirectly. The Agreement would increase Alcoa’s economic interest in its core business and simplify governance by acquiring the minority partner in its AWAC JV, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. It would also allow Alumina Limited shareholders to participate in the upside potential of a stronger, better-capitalized company with a larger and more diversified portfolio while offering exposure to Alcoa’s upstream aluminum business. Executive Commentary “We are pleased to have entered into the transaction process and exclusivity deed to finalize the terms of the transaction, which will provide significant and long-term benefits to both Alcoa and Alumina Limited shareholders,” said William F. Oplinger, Alcoa’s President and CEO. “Alcoa has been a proven operator of AWAC, and we recognize the value creation opportunities possible under a simplified ownership structure, including the ability to implement AWAC’s operational and strategic decisions on an accelerated basis. We believe now is the right time to consolidate ownership in AWAC and look forward to working closely with the Alumina Limited team to consummate a transaction that will better position Alcoa to execute on our long-term growth strategy.” Mr. Oplinger continued, “This acquisition would build on our commitment to Western Australia, and provides significant benefits to employees, customers, host communities, and others who rely on the continuing success of our global business.” Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits Increases Alcoa’s exposure to its core, tier-1 bauxite and alumina business, and provides Alumina Limited shareholders with exposure to Alcoa’s global aluminum business. The acquisition of Alumina Limited would consolidate Alcoa’s ownership of one of the world’s largest bauxite and alumina producers with tier 1 assets. With this acquisition, Alcoa would significantly increase its ownership in five of the 20 largest bauxite mines and five of the 20 largest alumina refineries globally (excluding China).2 This complements Alcoa’s low carbon, global smelting portfolio that has the fifth largest global production (excluding China).3 Importantly, Alumina Limited shareholders gain access to the benefits of Alcoa’s upstream aluminum business. Enhances Alcoa’s global position as the leading pure-play upstream aluminum company. A combination of Alcoa and Alumina Limited would enhance Alcoa’s vertical integration across the value chain, with leading positions across bauxite, alumina and aluminum smelting and casting, excluding China. AWAC's mining operations are strategically located in proximity to AWAC refineries and major Atlantic and Pacific markets. Alcoa’s smelters are strategically located proximate to key markets in North America and Europe. The increased vertical integration in a combined company also provides more stability throughout the commodity cycle. Offers Alumina Limited shareholders ownership in a stronger, well-capitalized business. With ownership of the combined entity, Alumina Limited shareholders will exchange their shares in a non-operating passive investment vehicle for an ownership position in Alcoa. As part of this transition, Alumina Limited shareholders would participate in Alcoa’s capital returns program, including the current dividend, and would have access to a larger, strong balance sheet that will be better able to fund portfolio actions, maintenance capital, and growth capital. Simplifies corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater operational flexibility and strategic optionality. Having 100 percent ownership of AWAC simplifies the corporate structure and allows for a more efficient operating model. With a centralized management team and strategy, Alcoa will be better positioned to execute operational and strategic decisions on an accelerated basis. In addition, a simplified corporate structure will result in efficiencies through a reduction in corporate costs. Bolsters long-term financial profile and maximizes value creation for both companies’ shareholders. The proposed transaction would increase Alcoa's financial flexibility, enabling more efficient funding and capital allocation decisions, as well as liability management. Alcoa would be better positioned to achieve many of the Company’s long-term strategies to maximize value creation for shareholders. These being: returning cash to shareholders, increasing portfolio exposure to what has been Alcoa’s highest margin and highest return on capital business historically, and positioning for growth with the ability to make decisions on a streamlined basis. Additionally, an acquisition of Alumina Limited increases Alcoa’s financial flexibility for its Western Australia mining projects and near-term portfolio actions. Reaffirms Alcoa’s commitment to Western Australia – a premier global mining jurisdiction. Alcoa has a long track record in the tier-1 Western Australia mining jurisdiction. The proposed acquisition of Alumina Limited builds on Alcoa’s commitment to continued productive relationships built on engagement with local communities, significant employment, and improved environmental performance. The proposed acquisition would better position Alcoa to continue its long-term plan of investing in Australian bauxite mining and alumina refining. Transaction Details Under the proposed all-scrip, or all-stock, Agreement, Alumina Limited shareholders would receive consideration of 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share.4 This consideration would imply a value of A$1.15 per Alumina Limited share, based on Alcoa’s closing share price on the NYSE as of February 23, 2024 of $26.52.5 This represents a premium of 13.1% to the closing price of Alumina Limited’s shares on February 23, 2024. As part of the proposed transaction, Alcoa would apply to establish a secondary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (""ASX"") to allow Alumina Limited shareholders to trade Alcoa common stock via CHESS Depositary Interests (""CDIs"") on the ASX. Under the terms of the Agreement, two new mutually agreed upon directors from Alumina Limited’s Board would be appointed to Alcoa’s Board of Directors upon closing. Conditional Share Sale Agreement with Allan Gray Australia Alumina Limited’s largest holder, Allan Gray Australia, has entered into an agreement with Alcoa that gives Alcoa the right to acquire up to 19.9 percent of Alumina Limited at the Agreed Price 0.02854 Alcoa shares for each Alumina Limited share. The conditional share sale agreement will be disclosed in a substantial holder notice to be released to ASX. Transaction Conditions The transaction would be subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions and regulatory approval, including entry into a scheme implementation agreement, a recommendation from Alumina Limited’s Board of Directors that Alumina Limited shareholders vote in favor in the absence of a superior proposal, and an independent expert concluding (and continuing to conclude) that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of Alumina Limited's shareholders, approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, Alumina Limited's shareholders approving the transaction and Alcoa shareholders approving the issue of the new Alcoa shares under the NYSE rules.

(NASDAQ: FFIE) announces a 1-for-3 reverse stock split of common stock, effective February 29, 2024. The split-adjusted trading begins on March 1, 2024. Stockholders approved the proposal at a special meeting, impacting convertible securities, stock options, and warrants. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Faraday Future to initiate a reverse stock split is a strategic move often employed by companies aiming to shore up their stock price and meet exchange listing requirements. This action typically signals to the market that a company's shares have been trading at low levels, which can be a concern for investors regarding the company's market valuation and long-term prospects.From a financial standpoint, the reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's valuation, as it is a cosmetic alteration of the stock structure. However, it can have psychological effects on investor perception, potentially making the stock more appealing to institutional investors who might avoid lower-priced shares. For current investors, the reverse stock split will proportionally consolidate their holdings, which could lead to increased volatility due to the reduced number of shares available for trading.It is also noteworthy that the reverse stock split will adjust the exercise price of warrants and convertible securities. This is a critical factor for derivative holders to consider, as it alters the terms under which these financial instruments operate, potentially impacting their value and the decisions of holders regarding exercising or converting these securities. Market Research Analyst The impact of a reverse stock split on a company's reputation and investor sentiment can be significant. In the case of Faraday Future, the market's response will be an indicator of confidence in the company's future performance and management's ability to execute its business plan. Historically, reverse stock splits have been met with mixed reactions, as they can be perceived as a measure to avoid delisting, but can also be seen as a step towards restructuring and stabilizing share price.Furthermore, the reduction in authorized shares from 1,389,937,500 to 463,312,500 represents a significant decrease in potential dilution risk, which could be viewed positively by current shareholders. It's essential to monitor how this action aligns with the company's overall strategy and any subsequent announcements or changes in operations that might provide further context to the reverse stock split decision. Securities Lawyer Legally, the execution of a reverse stock split must be in compliance with both corporate governance and securities regulations. Faraday Future's disclosure that the stockholders voted to approve the reverse stock split indicates adherence to the necessary legal procedures, including amending the company's Charter.For shareholders, it is important to understand that no fractional shares will be issued and instead, they will receive one full share for any fractional entitlement. This aspect of the reverse stock split can have implications for shareholder rights and the distribution of ownership post-split. Shareholders should be aware of their rights in this context and how the consolidation might affect their voting power and dividend entitlements, if applicable. 02/25/2024 - 09:00 PM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIE) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced that the Company intends to implement a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “common stock”), at a ratio of 1-for-3 (the “reverse stock split”), that is expected to become effective at 5:00 p.m. ET on February 29, 2024. The Company’s common stock is expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis commencing upon market open on March 1, 2024. As previously disclosed, at the Company’s Special Meeting of Stockholders held on February 5, 2024, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve a proposal authorizing the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the “Charter”) to effect a reverse stock split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock and a corresponding reduction in the total number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue. As a result of the reverse stock split, every three shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of common stock. The Company’s Class A common stock will trade under a new CUSIP number, 307359 703, effective March 1, 2024, and remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FFIE.” The Company’s Class B common stock will have a new CUSIP number, 307359 802, effective March 1, 2024. The Company’s publicly traded warrants will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “FFIEW” and the CUSIP number for the warrants will remain unchanged. However, under the terms of the applicable warrant agreement, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be proportionately decreased. Specifically, following effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, every three shares of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to the exercise of public warrants now represents one share of Class A Common Stock that may be purchased pursuant to such warrants. Accordingly, for the Company’s warrants trading under the symbol “FFIEW”, every three warrants will be exercisable for one share of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $2,760 per share of Class A Common Stock. The reverse stock split reduces the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Company’s outstanding convertible securities, and the exercise or vesting of its outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants in proportion to the ratio of the reverse stock split and causes a proportionate increase in the conversion and exercise prices of such convertible securities, stock options, restricted stock units and private warrants. In addition, the authorized shares of Common Stock will be reduced from 1,389,937,500 to 463,312,500. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will be entitled to receive from the Company one full share of the post-reverse stock split common stock. The reverse stock split impacts all holders of the Company’s common stock proportionally and will not impact any stockholder’s percentage ownership of the Company common stock. Faraday Future has chosen its transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, to act as exchange agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders owning shares via a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions automatically adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split and will not be required to take further action in connection with the reverse stock split, subject to brokers’ particular processes. Additional information about the Reverse Stock Split and the related Charter amendment can be found in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10, 2024, as supplemented on January 24, 2024.

Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 10:44 PM HONG KONG, Feb. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On 24 February, the Lantern Festival, the 4th Fosun Family Season, which was held for 72 days, concluded successfully with the inaugural digital lighting ceremony of the 2024 Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival. This year's Fosun Family Season was held during the Chinese New Year period for the first time. Centering around ""Celebrating Chinese New Year with Fosun,"" it brought together more than 60 brands under Fosun including Yuyuan Tourist Mart, Atlantis Sanya, Club Med, Laomiao, and Shede Spirits, and created a festive atmosphere and immersive experience with oriental lifestyle aesthetics for families worldwide, including activities such as enjoying lanterns, drinking wine to celebrate the arrival of spring, wearing gold jewelry, having reunion dinner, getting new clothes, getting glowing skin and sending gifts. In addition, integrating the festive atmosphere, it released more than 80 new products for the Year of the Dragon and hosted thousands of events domestically and internationally to meet consumer demands in areas such as clothing, food, accommodation, tourism, health, wellness, and wealth. Highlights of this year's Fosun Family Season include total sales exceeding RMB10 billion, the overseas debut of Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival, and the digital construction of Fosun Family Season. With an emphasis on ""stability"" and even stronger emphasis on ""progress"" and ""establishment"", the highlights of this year's Fosun Family Season sent a more positive signal of high-quality development. Seek development from ""IPs"" to stimulate new momentum During the Lantern Festival, the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival in Shanghai once again became a top attraction. The 40-day Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival kicked off with the lighting of the lantern installation ""A Night of Fish and Dragon Dance"" and ushered in a lantern-viewing frenzy. During the New Year period, foot traffic exceeded 200,000 in a single day, highlighting the influence of the IP. While receiving good feedback, it also gained more favor from consumers. During the Chinese New Year, Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival in Shanghai saw people from all over the country and welcomed nearly 700,000 visitors, driving sales of various industries and products to increase by about 50%. To date, this year's Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival attracted more than 4 million visitors, and the sales performance during the holiday significantly improved. As a national intangible cultural heritage, the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival has been held 29 times. With strong IP attributes, it has potential to make a significant impact in driving dissemination and empowering development. The Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival's ""Adventure of Mountains and Seas"" was replicated as an IP content to Rudong, Jiangsu and Shenyang, generating further market resonance and achieving rapid consumption conversion. During the Spring Festival, ""Rudong's First Chinese New Year Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival"" held in Forte Shang He Yin Xiang in Rudong saw a 150% increase in average daily foot traffic compared to the previous period, and a nearly 200% increase in sales compared to January, while Sheng Jing Long Cheng in Shenyang saw a 173% year-on-year increase in foot traffic, and a 172% year-on-year increase in sales. Seeking benefits and development from IPs is an opportunity and a challenge of the times. How can we create IPs with greater impact and vitality? This year's Fosun Family Season gave an answer. Atlantis Sanya experienced a high level of popularity during the 2024 Spring Festival. From the 26th day of the last month of the lunar calendar to the 11th day of the first month of the lunar calendar, Atlantis Sanya saw a revenue of RMB200 million in 16 days, representing an increase of 22% over the same period in 2023. In particular, non-hotel room revenue (including waterpark, dining, retail, performances) grew significantly. Atlantis Sanya also live-streamed Spring Festival events at the hotel, attracting a large number of non-hotel guests to watch the Year of the Dragon Lantern Festival and the underwater dragon dance performance at Atlantis Sanya. It is reported that for the 2025 Spring Festival, Atlantis Sanya plans to create the largest Chinese New Year Lantern Festival in Hainan, echoing the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival in Shanghai to create the ultimate experience and unforgettable memories for guests in both locations. The integration of traditional IP and innovative IP will create new development breakthroughs that are worth looking forward to. High-quality cultural provision stimulates endogenous momentum Since 15 December 2023, 60 large lantern installations and more than 2,000 lanterns from the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival in Shanghai, China, have landed Jardin d'Acclimatation in France. With the theme of ""Spirit of the Mountains and Seas"", the Festival Dragons et Lanternes is inspired by the ancient Chinese mythology ""The Classic of Mountains and Seas"" written more than 2,000 years ago. It integrates various mythical creatures of the mountains and seas, such as the strong Longma (Dragon & Horse), the soaring Kunpeng (big fish), the powerful Yinglong (flying dragon), and the elegant white deer into 60 lantern installations and more than 2,000 lanterns, showcasing the blessing ritual of Chinese New Year with oriental spiritual essence, and presenting a dazzling Chinese fantasy world to overseas visitors. Jardin d'Acclimatation, established in the 19th century, has opened an evening session for the Festival Dragons et Lanternes, with tickets priced at 18 euros. Visitors often arrived early, forming long queues that stretch across two blocks before the park opens. During peak hours, Jardin d'Acclimatation recorded a huge foot traffic of 4,000 people per hour. As a result, crowd control measures had to be implemented, and the President of Jardin d'Acclimatation said, ""I haven't seen a such huge crowd in years!"". After visiting the Festival Dragons et Lanternes in person, officials responsible for public space in some cities around Paris expressed that their desire to introduce the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival. Culture serves as an important pillar for promoting high-quality development. High-quality cultural provision plays an increasingly prominent role in activating corporate momentum, improving the quality of development, and promoting the optimization and upgrading of the economic structure. In this year's Fosun Family Season, the grand scenario Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival integrated culture and economy to further stimulate the endogenous momentum of the corporate ecosystem. Various dragon-themed products such as dragon lanterns and dragon hats at the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival were highly sought after by consumers, with sales increasing by 50% year-on-year; the cultural gene of Laomiao, ""good luck"", caters to the inner desires of young people, driving the consumption of gold jewelry. During this year's Chinese New Year, Laomiao's sales increased by 45% year-on-year; the sales of Yayi Year of the Dragon gold bars were more than ten times that of other years. It is worth mentioning that as the chief partner of the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival in Shanghai, this year marks the third collaboration with the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival to jointly showcase cultural integration and oriental craftsmanship. The sales of Shede's Year of the Dragon spirits saw a 39% increase compared to the same period last year. This year's Fosun Family Season demonstrated the significance of strengthening high-quality culture provision. By transforming cultural resource advantages into industrial advantages, it not only injected new momentum into the high-quality development of enterprise, but also served as an important driving force for economic development. In the future, Fosun will continue to create and replicate more than ten phenomenon event IPs, including Shede aged spirits banquet, Wolves Esports, and Fengjing Market, which are expected to stimulate new momentum in the consumer market. Digital and physical integrated development to explores new paths A giant dragon soared from the screen, ascending around the main lighting installation at the central square of Yuyuan Tourist Mart. Guests at the scene turned the pointer of the compass, and thousands of lights lit up instantly. The first digital lighting ceremony in the history of the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival completed the seamless integration of online and offline lantern festival, marking a new path for the digital and physical integrated development of Fosun's ecosystem. The integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy has become a crucial strategic initiative in China's new journey towards modernization. As a global innovation-driven consumer group, Fosun has been committed to enhancing operational efficiency of industries through digitalization. This year's Fosun Family Season integrated various industries and brands under Fosun, including jewelry, commercial districts, dining, beverages, tourism to provide users with cost-effective benefits and products through Alipay special venues, live streaming sessions, etc., resulting in sales exceeding RMB100 million on Alipay. In particular, Yuyuan took the lead in adopting the same ""AR interactive + digital human"" technology as the Asian Games opening ceremony on Alipay in offline commercial districts to present the world's first digital lantern festival. To date, over a million people have used Alipay to light up dragon lanterns for blessings, and scanned the AR code to experience the virtual and reality integrated ""Adventure of Mountains and Seas""; more than 1.5 million people have watched the Yuyuan Garden AR live stream to enjoy the Yuyuan Garden Lantern Festival and experience the festive atmosphere of Yuyuan Garden from the comfort of their homes; Laomiao, a subsidiary of Fosun, held live streaming sessions on Alipay, with cumulative sales exceeding RMB60 million. During the Lunar New Year's Shopping Festival, Laomiao achieved sales of nearly RMB9 million from a single live streaming session. ""Home is where happiness begins, and household consumption scenario is a scenario that brings happiness to all. In the future, household consumption demand will be even more vibrant, and Fosun will remain committed to its mission of 'creating happier lives for families worldwide'. We will continue focus on the household consumption sector, and constantly create good products, content and scenarios, bringing more happiness to families worldwide,"" Xu Xiaoliang, Co-CEO of Fosun International said.

The distance between CV5 and CV13 has now been traced to ~3 km with ongoing drilling focused, in part, on closing this gap.Assays are reported herein for 15 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite. For drill holes completed in 2023, results remain to be reported for an additional 20 holes at the CV13 Pegmatite, 42 holes at the CV5 Pegmatite, and 18 holes at the CV9 Pegmatite.At the Corvette Property in 2024, through February 22, approximately 23,000 m of drilling have been completed – 21,200 m at CV5 and 1,800 m at CV13 – with ten (10) drill rigs active at site.Two (2) drill rigs are currently active at the CV13 Pegmatite as part of the ongoing 2024 winter drill program. The drilling is targeted to further delineate the principal pegmatite body at CV13 along strike and downdip.The Company is mobilizing an additional drill rig as part of the winter drill program, which will focus on geomechanical holes at CV5. An updated mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for the Corvette Project, including both CV5 and a maiden MRE for the CV13 spodumene pegmatites, is planned for Q3 2024, with the focus of the MRE update to increase the confidence of the Inferred Resource.The Company's exploration camp at KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road, Shaakichiuwaanan, is operational at an initial 80-person capacity, with a planned increase to at least a 132-persons later in the year.The 2024 winter program is entirely ground supported (i.e., no helicopters), through a combination of winter and all-season access road constructed by the Company, extending from KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road to CV5 and through to CV13, resulting in dramatically reduced costs for the drill program.A geomechanical drill program at CV5 is anticipated to begin shortly, with geotechnical and hydrogeological drill programs planned for this summer. Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Patriot"") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce additional drill results from the 2023 program completed at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as well as recent infrastructure development supporting the ongoing 2024 drill program at the Corvette Property. The Corvette Property (the ""Property"" or ""Project""), wholly owned by the Company, is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite is located approximately 3 km west-southwest of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1 and is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. CV13 Pegmatite, 2023 Drill ResultsDrill results for 15 drill holes completed in 2023 at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite are reported herein (Figure 1). These holes primarily target the near-surface and downdip extension of the principal pegmatite body along its western limb, as well as the eastern limb. Results include: 22.5 m at 1.10% Li2O, including 15.2 m at 1.57% Li2O (CV23-300).19.4 m at 1.20% Li2O (CV23-312).16.1 m at 1.54% Li2O, including 7.2 m at 2.57% Li2O (CV23-319).13.8 m at 1.16% Li2O (CV23-320).The drilling continues to trace spodumene pegmatite at CV13 to the west-northwest along geological trend and remains open along strike and downdip in this area. Results remain to be reported for twelve (12) drill holes, covering approximately 300 m of strike, over the far portions of this western limb. The mineralized pegmatite in this area has a shallow northeasterly dip resulting in pegmatite being traced down dip for over 250 m with minimal drilling, while still only being approximately 100 m vertical depth below surface – see geological cross-section in Figure 2, which includes drill holes CV23-305 and 312 as reported herein. Results are also reported herein for one (1) hole completed in 2023 (CV23-300, noted below) within the apex of the regional host structure at CV13. One (1) drill hole (CV23–302) completed in 2023 remains to be reported from this area (Figure 1). 22.5 m at 1.10% Li2O, including 15.2 m at 1.57% Li2O (CV23-300).Results reported herein for drill holes completed over the eastern limb of the CV13 Pegmatite (CV23-293, 299, 301, and 306) returned only minor intervals of pegmatite ranging from <2 m to 5.8 m (core length). However, the pegmatite remains well mineralized in drill holes CV23-299 (4.7 m at 1.38% Li2O) and CV23-293 (2.7 m at 1.10% Li2O). The pegmatite dyke thins in this area of the eastern limb; however, is confirmed to thicken moving northeasterly along strike as evidence from drill holes completed in 2022. Results for six (6) drill holes completed in 2023 along the eastern limb of CV13 remain to be reported (Figure 1). The CV13 Pegmatite is currently interpreted to be characterized by a principal ""upper"" dyke and a secondary ""lower"" dyke, as well as several subordinate sub-parallel dykes, and are collectively geologically modelled to be shallowly dipping northerly. The principal dyke (the ""upper"" dyke), dips typically between 20-25° and has been traced at depth to at least 300 m down-dip (vertical depth from surface of ~140 m). The principal dyke at CV13 has been traced over a 2.3 km strike length, as defined by multiple outcrop exposures and drilling completed to date, and remains open along strike at both ends and to depth. In 2024, through February 22, approximately 23,000 m of drilling have been completed at Corvette – 21,200 m at CV5 and 1,800 m at CV13 – with ten (10) drill rigs active at site (see Figure 3 and Figure 4). Two (2) of the ten (10) drill rigs are currently active at the CV13 Pegmatite. The drilling at CV13 is targeted to further delineate the principal pegmatite body along strike and downdip. An updated mineral resource estimate for the Corvette Project, including both the CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites, is planned for Q3 2024. Core sample assays for drill holes reported herein are presented in Table 1 for all pegmatite intersections >2 m. Drill hole locations and attributes are presented in Table 2. For drill holes completed in 2023, results remain to be reported for the CV13 Pegmatite (20 holes), the CV5 Pegmatite (42 holes), and the CV9 Pegmatite (18 holes). Infrastructure DevelopmentThe 2024 winter drill program is entirely ground supported, utilizing the all-season/winter road constructed by the Company, which extends south from KM–270 of the Trans-Taiga Road to the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5). The winter portion of this road has been further extended westerly to support drilling at the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite. No helicopters are currently active at site due this infrastructure now emplaced and in daily use. The Company's exploration camp at KM-270 of the Trans-Taiga Road has been operational since early January at an initial 80-person capacity, with an anticipated increase to at least 132-person later in the year (Figure 6). After consultation with elders from the Cree Nation of Chisasibi by the tallyman and his family, the camp has recently been formally named the Shaakichiuwaanan Camp (pronounced Shaa-gi-chi-waa-nan), a Cree word meaning ""to climb up a hill or mountain"". The camp is located only 13 km directly north of the CV5 Pegmatite, thereby dramatically reducing the transport time of field staff to and from the drill area. The combination of the Company's exploration camp on the Trans-Taiga and direct access roads to the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites have dramatically reduced the costs of the drill program through more cost-effective staff movement, reduced transport time, reduced accommodation costs, and reduced time for drill moves. In addition to the camp and road infrastructure development, the Company anticipates completing a geomechanical drill program this winter at CV5. Data from this drilling and sampling will provide key datapoints to assess pit slope stability and design. This work will be followed in the summer by an infrastructure and condemnation geotechnical drill program, which will include potential tailings and waste rock storage sites, process plant, and camp accommodations for operation. A phase II hydrogeological drill program at CV5 is also planned for the summer, which will build upon the preliminary hydrogeological model completed in 2023. 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Largest in the Americas based on contained LCE. Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)A Quality Assurance / Quality Control protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5%. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and coarse-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation. All core samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which includes drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. The pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). About the CV Lithium TrendThe CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.4 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, seven (7) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, and CV13. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

Competent Person Statement (ASX Listing Rule 5.22) The mineral resource estimate in this release was reported by the Company in accordance with ASX Listing Rule 5.8 on July 31, 2023. The Company confirms it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates in the announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed. The Company confirms that the form and context in which the competent person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market announcement. Appendix 1 – JORC Code 2012 Table 1 information required by ASX Listing Rule 5.7.1Section 1 – Sampling Techniques and DataCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Sampling techniques Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialized industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the Public Report.In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverized to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. Core sampling protocols meet industry standard practices. Core sampling is guided by lithology as determined during geological logging (i.e., by a geologist). All pegmatite intervals are sampled in their entirety (half-core), regardless if spodumene mineralization is noted or not (in order to ensure an unbiased sampling approach) in addition to ~1 to 3 m of sampling into the adjacent host rock (dependent on pegmatite interval length) to ""bookend"" the sampled pegmatite. The minimum individual sample length is typically 0.3-0.5 m and the maximum sample length is typically 2.0 m. Targeted individual pegmatite sample lengths are 1.0 m. All drill core is oriented to maximum foliation prior to logging and sampling and is cut with a core saw into half-core pieces, with one half-core collected for assay, and the other half-core remaining in the box for reference. Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Drilling techniques Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). NQ size core diamond drilling was completed for all holes. Core was not oriented. Drill sample recovery Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. Measures taken to maximize sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. All drill core was geotechnically logged following industry standard practices, and includes TCR, RQD, ISRM, and Q-Method. Core recovery is very good and typically exceeds 90%. Logging Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. Upon receipt at the core shack, all drill core is pieced together, oriented to maximum foliation, metre marked, geotechnically logged (including structure), alteration logged, geologically logged, and sample logged on an individual sample basis. Core box photos are also collected of all core drilled, regardless of perceived mineralization. Specific gravity measurements of pegmatite are also collected at systematic intervals for all pegmatite drill core using the water immersion method, as well as select host rock drill core. The logging is qualitative by nature, and includes estimates of spodumene grain size, inclusions, and model mineral estimates. These logging practices meet or exceed current industry standard practices. Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize representivity of samples. Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. Drill core sampling follows industry best practices. Drill core was saw-cut with half-core sent for geochemical analysis and half-core remaining in the box for reference. The same side of the core was sampled to maintain representativeness. Sample sizes are appropriate for the material being assayed.A Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC) protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included systematic insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs) into sample batches at a rate of approximately 5% each. Additionally, analysis of pulp-split and course-split sample duplicates were completed to assess analytical precision at different stages of the laboratory preparation process, and external (secondary) laboratory pulp-split duplicates were prepared at the primary lab for subsequent check analysis and validation at a secondary lab.• All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. Core samples collected from drill holes were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Core sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). The Company relies on both its internal QAQC protocols (systematic use of blanks, certified reference materials, and external checks), as well as the laboratory's internal QAQC. All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Verification of sampling and assaying The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. The use of twinned holes. Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. Discuss any adjustment to assay data. Intervals are reviewed and compiled by the VP Exploration and Project Managers prior to disclosure, including a review of the Company's internal QAQC sample analytical data. Data capture utilizes MX Deposit software whereby core logging data is entered directly into the software for storage, including direct import of laboratory analytical certificates as they are received. The Company employs various on-site and post QAQC protocols to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Adjustments to data include reporting lithium and tantalum in their oxide forms, as it is reported in elemental form in the assay certificates. Formulas used are Li2O = Li x 2.153, and Ta2O5 = Ta x 1.221. Location of data points Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. Specification of the grid system used. Quality and adequacy of topographic control. Each drill hole's collar has been surveyed with a RTK Trimble Zephyr 3 or RTK Topcon GR-5. The coordinate system used is UTM NAD83 Zone 18. The Company completed a property-wide LiDAR and orthophoto survey in August 2022, which provides high-quality topographic control. The quality and accuracy of the topographic controls are considered adequate for advanced stage exploration and development, including mineral resource estimation. Data spacing and distribution Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. Whether sample compositing has been applied. At CV5, drill hole collar spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, tightens to ~50 m in multiple areas, and widens to ~150 m in a small number of areas. Several collars are typically completed from the same pad at varied orientations resulting in more varied pegmatite pierce points at depth. At CV13, drill hole spacing is dominantly grid based at ~100 m; however, collar locations and hole orientations may vary widely, which reflect the varied orientation of the pegmatite body along strike. At CV9, drill hole collar spacing is irregular with varied hole orientations and multiple collars on the same pad. It is interpreted that some of the drill hole spacing is sufficient to support a mineral resource estimate. Core sample lengths typically range from 0.5 to 1.5 m and average ~1 m. Sampling is continuous within all pegmatite encountered in the drill hole. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. No sampling bias is anticipated based on structure within the mineralized body. The principal mineralized bodies are relatively undeformed and very competent, although have some meaningful structural control. At CV5, the principal mineralized body and adjacent lenses are steeply dipping resulting in oblique angles of intersection with true widths varying based on drill hole angle and orientation of pegmatite at that particular intersection point. i.e., the dip of the mineralized pegmatite body has variations in a vertical sense and along strike, so the true widths are not always apparent until several holes have been drilled (at the appropriate spacing) in any particular drill-fence. At CV13, the principal pegmatite body has a shallow varied strike and northerly dip. At CV9, the orientation and geometry of the pegmatite is not well understood. The pegmatite is currently interpreted to be comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. Sample security The measures taken to ensure sample security. Samples were collected by Company staff or its consultants following specific protocols governing sample collection and handling. Core samples were bagged, placed in large supersacs for added security, palleted, and shipped directly to Val-d'Or, QC, being tracked during shipment along with Chain of Custody. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were cross-referenced with the shipping manifest to confirm all samples were accounted for. At the laboratory, sample bags are evaluated for tampering. Audits or reviews The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. A review of the sample procedures for the Company's 2021 fall drill program (CF21-001 to 004) and 2022 winter drill program (CV22-015 to 034) was completed by an Independent Competent Person and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada"", by Alex Knox, M.Sc., P.Geol., Issue Date of June 27th, 2022.) A review of the sample procedures through the Company's 2023 winter drill program (through CV23-190) was completed by an independent Competent Person with respect to the CV5 Pegmatite's maiden mineral resource estimate and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled "" NI 43–101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property"" by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Additionally, the Company continually reviews and evaluates its procedures in order to optimize and ensure compliance at all levels of sample data collection and handling. Section 2 – Reporting of Exploration ResultsCriteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Mineral tenement and land tenure status Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. The Corvette Property is comprised of 424 CDC claims located in the James Bay Region of Quebec, with Patriot Battery Metals Inc. being the registered title holder for all of the claims. The northern border of the Property's primary claim block is located within approximately 6 km to the south of the Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of CV5, respectively. The Company holds 100% interest in the Property subject to various royalty obligations depending on original acquisition agreements. DG Resources Management holds a 2% NSR (no buyback) on 76 claims, D.B.A. Canadian Mining House holds a 2% NSR on 50 claims (half buyback for $2M) and Osisko Gold Royalties holds a sliding scale NSR of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2% on all other products, over 111 claims. The vast majority of the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as is currently delineated, is not subject to a royalty. The Property does not overlap any atypically sensitive environmental areas or parks, or historical sites to the knowledge of the Company. There are no known hinderances to operating at the Property, apart from the goose harvesting season (typically mid-April to mid-May) where the communities request helicopter flying not be completed, and potentially wildfires depending on the season, scale, and location. Claim expiry dates range from February 2025 to November 2026. Exploration done by other parties Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. No core assay results from other parties are disclosed herein. The most recent independent Property review was a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property, James Bay Region, Québec, Canada"", by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Geology Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. The Property overlies a large portion of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt, considered part of the larger La Grande River Greenstone Belt and is dominated by volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The claim block is dominantly host to rocks of the Guyer Group (amphibolite, iron formation, intermediate to mafic volcanics, peridotite, pyroxenite, komatiite, as well as felsic volcanics). The amphibolite rocks that trend east-west (generally steeply south dipping) through this region are bordered to the north by the Magin Formation (conglomerate and wacke) and to the south by an assemblage of tonalite, granodiorite, and diorite, in addition to metasediments of the Marbot Group (conglomerate, wacke). Several regional-scale Proterozoic gabbroic dykes also cut through portions of the Property (Lac Spirt Dykes, Senneterre Dykes). The geological setting is prospective for gold, silver, base metals, platinum group elements, and lithium over several different deposit styles including orogenic gold (Au), volcanogenic massive sulfide (Cu, Au, Ag), komatiite-ultramafic (Au, Ag, PGE, Ni, Cu, Co), and pegmatite (Li, Ta). Exploration of the Property has outlined three primary mineral exploration trends crossing dominantly east-west over large portions of the Property – Golden Trend (gold), Maven Trend (copper, gold, silver), and CV Trend (lithium, tantalum). The CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites are situated within the CV Trend. Lithium mineralization at the Property, including at CV5, CV13, and CV9, is observed to occur within quartz-feldspar pegmatite, which may be exposed at surface as high relief 'whale-back' landforms. The pegmatite is often very coarse-grained and off-white in appearance, with darker sections commonly composed of mica and smoky quartz, and occasional tourmaline. The lithium pegmatites at Corvette are categorized as LCT Pegmatites. Core assays and ongoing mineralogical studies, coupled with field mineral identification and assays, indicate spodumene as the dominant lithium-bearing mineral on the Property, with no significant petalite, lepidolite, lithium-phosphate minerals, or apatite present. The pegmatites also carry significant tantalum values with tantalite indicated to be the mineral phase. Drill hole Information A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: easting and northing of the drill hole collar elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar dip and azimuth of the hole down hole length and interception depth hole length. If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. Drill hole attribute information is included in a table herein. Pegmatite intersections of <2 m are not typically presented as they are considered insignificant. Data aggregation methods In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. Length weighted averages were used to calculate grade over width. No specific grade cap or cut-off was used during grade width calculations. The lithium and tantalum average of the entire pegmatite interval is calculated for all pegmatite intervals over 2 m core length, as well as higher grade zones at the discretion of the geologist. Pegmatites have inconsistent mineralization by nature, resulting in some intervals having a small number of poorly mineralized samples included in the calculation. Non-pegmatite internal dilution is limited to typically <3 m where relevant and intervals indicated when assays are reported. No metal equivalents have been reported. Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known'). At CV5, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports a principal, large pegmatite body of near vertical to steeply dipping orientation, flanked by several subordinate pegmatite lenses (collectively, the 'CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite') At CV13, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports an upper and lower pegmatite body, each trending sub-parallel to each other with a shallow northerly dip (collectively, the 'CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite') At CV9, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation indicates CV9 is comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. A strike length of 450 m has been delineated through drilling and outcrop. All reported widths are core length. True widths are not calculated for each hole due to the relatively wide drill spacing at this stage of delineation and the typical irregular nature of pegmatite, as well as the varied drill hole orientations. As such, true widths may vary widely from hole to hole. Diagrams Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. Please refer to the figures included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Balanced reporting Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. Please refer to the table(s) included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Results for pegmatite intervals <2 m are not reported. Other substantive exploration data Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. The Company is currently completing baseline environmental work over the CV5 and CV13 pegmatite area. No endangered flora or fauna have been documented over the Property to date, and several sites have been identified as potentially suitable for mine infrastructure. The Company has completed a bathymetric survey over the shallow glacial lake which overlies a portion of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The lake depth ranges from <2 m to approximately 18 m, although the majority of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, as delineated to date, is overlain by typically <2 to 10 m of water. The Company has completed preliminary metallurgical testing comprised of HLS and magnetic testing, which has produced 6+% Li2O spodumene concentrates at >70% recovery on both CV5 and CV13 pegmatite material, indicating DMS as a viable primary process approach, and that both CV5 and CV13 could potentially feed the same process plant. A DMS test on CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite material returned a spodumene concentrate grading 5.8% Li2O at 79% recovery, strongly indicating potential for a DMS only operation to be applicable. Various mandates required for advancing the Project towards economic studies have been initiated, including but not limited to, environmental baseline, metallurgy, geomechanics, hydrogeology, hydrology, stakeholder engagement, geochemical characterization, as well as transportation and logistical studies. Further work The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. The Company intends to continue drilling the pegmatites of the Corvette Property, focused on the CV5 Pegmatite and adjacent subordinate lenses, as well as the CV13 Pegmatite. A follow-up drill program at the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite is anticipated following receipt of assays.

(FEAM) progresses towards plant completion and commercial operations in CY Q2 2024 at the 5E Boron Americas Complex. The Company updates mining operations, facility progress, market engagement, and investor relations. Key highlights include successful boric acid and lithium extraction, finalization of electrical engineering work, positive commercial discussions, government support, and marketing initiatives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by 5E Advanced Materials regarding their operational progress and commercial operations timeline is a positive signal for market stakeholders. The company's move towards initiating production at the 5E Boron Americas Complex is notable as it aligns with the increasing demand for critical materials like boron and lithium, which are essential for clean energy technologies. The successful running of production wells and the transition towards commercial-grade product validation signifies a reduction in operational risks and lays the groundwork for revenue generation.Additionally, the engagement with potential off-take partners suggests a proactive approach in securing sales channels, which is critical for the company's cash flow post-production commencement. The company's employment growth, particularly from local communities, may also have a favorable impact on regional economies and stakeholder sentiment. Financial Analyst The update from 5E Advanced Materials could be a precursor to future financial performance, as the initiation of production has direct implications for the company's revenue streams and cost structure. Investors should note the company's strategic positioning within the critical materials sector, which could potentially lead to preferential funding opportunities, especially with the involvement of federal agencies like the DOD and DOE. However, the capital expenditures associated with the ramp-up to full production and the ongoing need for funding proposals highlight the importance of liquidity management for the company.The inclusion of boron in the Critical Minerals List could have significant financial implications, potentially unlocking government support and subsidies, which would be beneficial for the company's long-term financing strategy. It's crucial to monitor the company's ability to maintain its timeline for commercial operations, as any delays could impact investor confidence and the stock's performance. Legal Expert The regulatory landscape for mining critical materials like boron and lithium is complex, involving various federal and state agencies. 5E Advanced Materials' designation as a U.S. government Critical Infrastructure entity and its active engagement in government affairs could facilitate smoother regulatory processes and access to incentives. The company's public support for legislative changes, such as the inclusion of boron in the Critical Minerals List, underscores the strategic importance of aligning business operations with government policy objectives. This alignment can mitigate legal and regulatory risks, providing a more stable operating environment for the company.Investors should be aware of the potential regulatory shifts and their impact on the company's operations. For instance, changes in environmental regulations or shifts in critical minerals policies could alter operational costs or create barriers to entry for competitors, affecting the company's competitive landscape. 02/25/2024 - 05:30 PM Measurable progress continues towards near-term plant completion Company remains on track to commence commercial operations in CY Q2 2024 at the 5E Boron Americas Complex in California HESPERIA, Calif., Feb. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 5E Advanced Materials, Inc. (Nasdaq: FEAM) (ASX: 5EA) (5E or the Company), a boron and lithium company with U.S. government Critical Infrastructure designation for its 5E Boron Americas Complex, provided an update on mining operations and related activities as it moves closer to initial production at the Company’s 5E Boron Americas Complex. “This is an exciting time for all stakeholders of the Company as we finalize a number of initiatives that will see us commence initial production next quarter,” commented Susan Brennan, Chief Executive Officer of 5E Advanced Materials. “Our operations team is working diligently to transition our facility to operational status, and we are concurrently ramping up our commercial and marketing activities in order to leverage the value of our boron and lithium with potential customers. I cannot emphasize enough the importance 5E will represent in the U.S. in the coming months as a new and secure producer of critical materials needed for clean energy economies.” Operational Development Updates Boric Acid and Lithium Product Since the launch of mining operations last month at the 5E Boron Americas Complex, the Company has been successfully running all four of its production wells to extract boric acid and lithium. Initial head grade and recovery rates are in line with historical expectations, with the wells continuing to be conditioned to achieve final operational profile. Extracted solution from the Company’s initial production wells has produced boric acid after laboratory crystallization. This boric acid has been sent to an independent laboratory for analysis to validate commercial grade quality. Facility Operations Significant progress has been made with respect to the finalization of final electrical engineering work, which is now nearly complete. The personnel required to run the plant are already in place, and final appointments are being made for fully staffed status ahead of final plant commissioning. 5E remains on track to begin operating the plant commercially, starting in CY Q2 2024. The Company now employs 51 professionals and is pleased to be employing talent from local communities. Figure 1: Photo of 5E lab assistant testing boric acid head-gradeFigure 2: Photo of wellfield DCS Feb 2024 Market Engagement Updates Customers Commercial discussions continue to move in a positive direction, as the Company works with various potential off-take partners. 5E intends to use product from initial production next quarter to complete product validation, which will be focused on product acceptance within a variety of boric acid consumers. Government The Company’s Government Affairs program also continues to drive progress in its effort to gain increased support for large-scale production of boric acid and lithium at Fort Cady. The Company is currently engaged in several funding proposals with various federal government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE). The Company recently announced its public support of a congressional push to include boron into the upcoming Critical Minerals List, administered by the United States Geological Society, under the Department of the Interior (DOI). As this program continues to evolve and progress, it will underpin the Company’s longer-term financing strategy. Investor Engagement 5E is currently focused on deploying several marketing initiatives designed to increase engagement across all market stakeholders. This includes analyst briefings, institutional and fund investor meetings, conferences, and targeted industry trade shows. The Company attended the Mines and Money conference last week in Miami and will be attending the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) event in March. A targeted retail strategy is also underway with the Company to support broader awareness and digital campaigns to retail and institutional investors.

Negative None. 02/25/2024 - 08:11 PM Operations to Continue Uninterrupted, With No Impact to Customers, Employees or Vendors KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (OTC Pink: CORR, CORRL) (“CorEnergy” or the “Company”) today announced that it has reached an agreement with certain of its noteholders on a comprehensive financial restructuring that will reduce debt and restructure its balance sheet. The Ad Hoc Group of Noteholders, whose members hold approximately 90% of CorEnergy’s 5.875% Unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Senior Notes”), has entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “RSA”) with the Company. “Restructuring our debt will help to right-size our capital structure for the smaller scale of the enterprise following the MoGas and Omega sale, building on our efforts to increase liquidity through a combination of asset sales and tariff increases,” said Dave Schulte, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CorEnergy. Schulte continued, “As we move through the reorganization process, we intend to continue to meet all obligations to our valued customers, employees, vendors and partners, and we expect Crimson Pipeline will also continue to operate normally. Our case for rate relief before the California Public Utilities Commission must be resolved favorably to ensure the future viability of the Crimson Pipeline assets, which continue to provide a critical service to shippers in that state.” To implement the RSA, CorEnergy has filed a voluntary chapter 11 proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Missouri. Neither Crimson Pipeline, in which CorEnergy holds a noncontrolling joint interest, nor any other CorEnergy subsidiary has filed for bankruptcy. Both the Company and Crimson Pipeline expect to have sufficient liquidity to continue operating without interruption during and after CorEnergy’s restructuring process. The case is being filed on a prearranged basis to allow for rapid implementation of the RSA, with the RSA parties already having agreed to support the Company’s Plan of Reorganization. The proceeding is intended to facilitate a restructuring of the Company’s capital structure only, with no plans for trade impairment or other contract rejections. Consistent with the terms of the RSA, the Plan provides for the treatment for each creditor class as follows: Senior Notes: The Senior Notes will be exchanged for cash, $45 million in new secured debt with a five-year term and a 12.0% coupon and approximately 89% of the equity in a reorganized CorEnergy, subject to dilution from the management incentive plan and adjustment based on final cash available upon emergence. General unsecured claims (including trade claims): Paid in full in cash. Existing preferred equity: Holders of CorEnergy’s existing preferred equity and securities that are convertible into preferred equity will receive the remaining approximately 11% of the equity of the reorganized CorEnergy, also subject to dilution from the management incentive plan and adjustment based on final cash available upon emergence. Common stock: All outstanding common stock will be cancelled. The Company aims to complete this restructuring process and emerge from bankruptcy in the second quarter of 2024 as a real estate investment trust. The RSA parties share a common commitment to strong corporate governance and robust disclosure that will facilitate the reorganized company’s plan to pursue trading on the OTC following emergence, providing enhanced liquidity to owners while reducing overhead expenses to a level commensurate with the reorganized company’s smaller size. Additional information on the RSA will be filed on a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or purchase any securities, which would be made only pursuant to definitive documents and an applicable exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This press release does not constitute a solicitation to vote on the bankruptcy Plan, and all parties entitled to vote should rely solely upon any disclosure statement approved by the Bankruptcy Court. CorEnergy has retained Husch Blackwell LLP as legal counsel, Teneo Capital LLC as its financial advisor and Miller Buckfire as its investment banker. The Ad Hoc Group of Noteholders has retained Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP as its legal counsel and Perella Weinberg Partners and TPH&Co., the energy business of Perella Weinberg Partners, as its investment bankers. Court filings and information about the Chapter 11 case is available on a separate website (https://cases.stretto.com/corenergy) administered by CorEnergy’s claims agent, Stretto.

Next-Level Productivity Unleashed: Explore the Brilliant Powerhouse of the ThinkPad T Series Laptops The ThinkPad T series is one of Lenovo’s most successful business laptops, and the new ThinkPad T series laptops reinforce the importance of a very popular workhorse laptop built for discerning business users who seek high performance and durable devices with access to the latest features designed to improve and enhance everyday productivity. The latest generation ThinkPad T14, T14s, and T16 incorporate the premium design feature of the elegant Communications Bar that houses a 5MP camera, noise cancelling microphones, and also acts as an easy one-handed lip for opening and closing the device. Furthermore, the communications bar allows for narrower bezels thereby increasing the screen-to-body ratio that results in a more refined thinner and lighter design. In addition, embracing the inclusive user experience focus of Lenovo’s Product Diversity Office, ThinkPad T series will integrate the tactile markings announced on the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 and ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Gen 9. These additional tactile cues are designed to increase accessibility and aid users who are visually impaired to navigate the keyboard. Furthermore, the frequently used CTRL key has been swapped with the Fn key to be more readily accessible on the left edge of the keyboard. Additional user-centric innovations continue to enhance end user experiences, such as: Double tapping the TrackPoint opens the TrackPoint Quick Menu allowing users to customize common features such as microphone or camera settings. Lenovo View application, that runs on the Intel Core Ultra NPU to save processor load, provides video enhancing tools for the camera including a new Low Light Enhancer that can brighten and denoise video in low light environments. 3M™ Optical Film solution is available on optional WUXGA displays on ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 and T14s Gen 5. The embedded optical film increases the brightness of the display from 300 nits to 400 nits while using up to 16% less power4, thereby reducing energy consumption. New ThinkPad T14 and T16 designs integrate enhanced repairability features. New ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 will also be available powered by AMD Ryzen™ 8040 series processors with built-in AMD Ryzen™ AI, giving customers a broader choice of high-performance CPUs. Innovating for Sustainability and Repairability Lenovo is transitioning to a circular economy by innovating in the supply chain, product design, and services and is focusing on a ""design, use, return, re-use"" model and promoting disassembly and recycling. Lenovo integrates closed-loop recycled plastic into their products and aims to recycle 800 million pounds of end-of-life products by 2025-2026. They also aim to use 300 million pounds of post-consumer recycled content plastics in their products and improve packaging sustainability5. Lenovo's commitment to a more sustainable future is evident in its ThinkPad line, highlighting dedication to the circular economy. ThinkPad laptops prioritize sustainability from design to end-of-life management. Recycled materials are used in manufacturing, promoting responsible sourcing and minimizing waste. Additionally, ThinkPad laptops are designed for longevity, allowing for simpler repair and upgradability, extending their product lifespan. ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 and T16 Gen 3, with insights from the iFixit Solutions team, have been designed to be more repair-friendly, not only extending customer replaceable parts (CRU) to include the battery with a cable-free connector in addition to a fully socketed DIMM design, SSD and WWAN replacement, but also adding visual indicators for easier repairs. With support from the iFixit team, Lenovo created new repair guides including video procedures for all CRU parts as well as making those parts easier to order. This extends the product lifecycle, reduces electronic waste and offers cost-saving advantages for businesses and individuals. As a result of these improvements, ThinkPad T14 Gen 5 and T16 Gen 3 achieved a provisional iFixit repairability score of 9.3 out of 10. ""This is a major step forward for Lenovo and the technology industry. Making laptops that stand the test of time is essential to building a sustainable electronics industry. It's not easy, and Lenovo is demonstrating that repairability and innovation go hand-in-hand,"" said Kyle Wiens, CEO at iFixit.

The study showed treatment with Xolair increased the amount of peanuts, milk, egg, wheat and tree nuts (cashew, hazelnut and walnut) that it took to cause moderate to severe allergic reactions in multi-food allergic people as young as 1 year. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profile of Xolair across its approved indications and in previous clinical trials.4 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the expanded use of Xolair in children and adults with IgE-mediated food allergies based on the OUtMATCH data. “Over the past 35 years, I have seen how debilitating food allergies can be for patients and their loved ones, as they are consumed by the fear of accidental exposure,” said Robert Wood, M.D., director of the Eudowood Division of Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, and principal investigator of the OUtMATCH study. “While allergic reactions to exposures are common and often severe, there have been limited treatment advancements for food allergy. The results of the OUtMATCH study showed that anti-IgE therapy could significantly reduce the occurrence of allergic reactions across multiple foods in the event of an accidental exposure.” “Living with food allergies has a profound impact on patients and their families, causing significant stress and requiring constant vigilance,” said R. Sharon Chinthrajah, M.D., associate professor of medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research and OUtMATCH co-lead study investigator. “The OUtMATCH study demonstrated that anti-IgE therapy increased most patients’ threshold for an allergic reaction. This presents an important new treatment option for patients and families in its potential to reduce the risk of allergic reactions from accidental exposures they may face in day-to-day life.” One hundred eighty patients ages 1 to 55 years old entered Stage 1 of the OUtMATCH study unable to tolerate up to 100 mg of peanut protein (equivalent to about one third of a peanut), and up to 300 mg of at least two other food proteins among milk, egg, cashew, walnut, hazelnut and wheat. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges (including a placebo ingredient) to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Results showed that, compared to placebo, a statistically significant (p<0.001) higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were able to consume at least 600 mg of peanut protein and at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg and cashew protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Additionally, compared to placebo, a higher proportion of patients receiving Xolair were also able to consume at least 1,000 mg of walnut, hazelnut and wheat protein without experiencing moderate to severe allergic reactions. Detailed results are included in the table below. OUtMATCH Primary and Secondary Endpoints Results in Paediatric Population (n=177)Percentage of Patients Successfully Consuming Predefined Threshold Dose of Seven Foods Approximate Equivalents5 Xolair Treated Patients Placebo Treated Patients Number of Patients Primary Endpoint Peanut (≥600 mg) 95% CI for difference: 47 to 70; p<0.001 2.5 peanuts or 1/2 teaspoon of regular peanut butter 67% 7% 177 Key Secondary Endpoints Cashew (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 19 to 52; p<0.001 3.5 cashews 41% 3% 99 Egg (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 46 to 79; p<0.001 1/4 of an egg 67% 0% 71 Milk (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 30 to 74; p<0.001 2 tablespoons of 1% milk 66% 10% 62 Additional Secondary Endpoints Walnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 27 to 68 3 walnut halves 64% 13% 78 Hazelnut (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: -2 to 78 4.5 hazelnuts 65% 14% 24 Wheat (≥1,000 mg) 95% CI for difference: 13 to 88 3.5 saltine crackers 75% 13% 20 Additionally, out of three adult OUtMATCH participants, two completed Stage 1 of the study; the adult who received Xolair met the primary endpoint compared to the placebo-enrolled adult patient. Adverse event rates in the study were similar between Xolair and placebo. The most common adverse event in Xolair-treated children and adolescents was injection site reaction (9%). “The Phase III OUtMATCH results represent a major advance and reinforce our commitment to addressing critical gaps in care for conditions like food allergy,” said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche’s Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. “Now recently FDA-approved, Xolair provides a new way to help manage food allergies for children and adults who live with the constant fear of life-threatening allergic reactions.” While efficacy cannot be established from uncontrolled, open-label studies, for 38 children who continued Xolair for 24-28 weeks in an open-label extension, the percentage of patients who were able to consume 600 mg or more of peanut protein and 1,000 mg or more of egg, milk and/or cashew protein without moderate to severe dose-limiting symptoms was maintained. About 3.4 million children and 13.6 million adults in the U.S. will have been diagnosed with IgE-mediated food allergies, based on estimates for 2024.1,2 Food allergy prevalence has been on the rise for the past 20 years.6 There are 160 different foods that cause IgE-mediated food allergy.7 Allergic reactions can range from mild to moderate, including hives and swelling, to severe and life-threatening, such as anaphylaxis.3 More than 40% of children and more than half of adults with food allergies have experienced a severe reaction at least once, and it is estimated that food-related anaphylaxis results in 30,000 medical events treated in emergency rooms in the U.S. each year.1-3 On 16 February, 2024, the FDA approved Xolair for the reduction of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods in adult and paediatric patients aged 1 year and older with IgE-mediated food allergy. People taking Xolair for food allergies should continue to avoid all foods they are allergic to (commonly referred to as “food allergen avoidance”). Xolair should not be used for the emergency treatment of any allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Xolair is the first and only FDA-approved medicine to reduce allergic reactions in people with one or more food allergies. In the U.S., Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. About the OUtMATCH StudyThe Omalizumab as Monotherapy and as Adjunct Therapy to Multi-Allergen Oral Immunotherapy in Food Allergic Children and Adults (OUtMATCH; NCT03881696) study is an NIH-sponsored, three-stage, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating Xolair safety and efficacy in patients aged 1 to 55 years who are allergic to peanuts and at least two other common foods. Stage 1 included 180 patients (177 children and adolescents; 3 adults) who were randomly assigned to receive placebo or Xolair injections either every two weeks or every four weeks for 16 to 20 weeks. The Xolair dose and dosing interval were determined by total serum IgE level and body weight at baseline. After 16 to 20 weeks of treatment with Xolair or placebo, each participant completed four separate blinded food challenges where they were given gradually increasing amounts of peanut protein, two other food proteins they were allergic to, and a placebo ingredient. The food challenges were conducted in a carefully controlled setting with investigators looking for signs and symptoms of allergic reaction to assess patients’ ability to consume a single dose of at least 600 mg of peanut protein (primary endpoint), and a single dose of at least 1,000 mg of milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut protein (secondary endpoints) without experiencing dose-limiting symptoms, which were defined as moderate to severe allergic reactions, including skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. The OUtMATCH study is being sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Consortium for Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) at 10 clinical sites across the U.S. led by Johns Hopkins Children's Center and co-led by Stanford School of Medicine. The study is also supported by Genentech and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About Xolair Xolair is the only approved antibody designed to target and block immunoglobulin E (IgE). By reducing free IgE, down-regulating high-affinity IgE receptors and limiting mast cell degranulation, Xolair minimises the release of mediators throughout the allergic inflammatory cascade. About Roche in Immunology The Roche Group’s immunology medicines include: Actemra®/RoActemra® (tocilizumab) for rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) and for the treatment of severe or life-threatening chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS); Rituxan®/MabThera® (rituximab) for rheumatoid arthritis granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis and for pemphigus vulgaris (PV); Xolair® (omalizumab) for allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU); Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa) for cystic fibrosis; and Esbriet® (pirfenidone) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

Market Research Analyst The announcement of Faraday Future's updated master plan 1.1 and its strategic positioning for growth in 2024 indicates a significant development phase for the company. The company's entry into revenue generation in 2023 and its closed-loop operation from user acquisition to delivery are pivotal in assessing its market potential. The emphasis on the EV company's ability to pass US homologation requirements places it alongside established players like Tesla and Lucid, which could resonate positively with investors. The disclosed investment of $3 billion to develop its EV platform and the filing of 660 patents suggests a robust intellectual property portfolio and technological advancement, which are critical in the competitive EV industry.Furthermore, the company's expansion into international markets, including the Middle East and its partnership with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office highlight strategic moves to diversify market presence and tap into emerging TechLuxury segments. The focus on cash flow breakeven rather than scaling production too quickly is a prudent strategy that may appeal to investors concerned with sustainable growth. The strategic positioning in less crowded market segments at higher price points could offer a competitive advantage in terms of profitability margins. Financial Analyst Faraday Future's financial updates reflect a strategic approach to capital management and cost reduction. The company's efforts to secure additional funding and tighten restrictions on convertible note holders demonstrate a proactive stance on strengthening its financial position. The suspension of the ATM program and ELOC, along with measures to reduce monthly cash burn, suggest a disciplined approach to expense management. The company's strategy to prioritize cash flow breakeven at a lower production volume compared to competitors could mitigate risks associated with overexpansion. The substantial savings achieved by insourcing a key component of the vehicle, leading to a $50,000 reduction in the Bill of Materials, exemplifies effective cost optimization strategies that could improve profit margins. Investors would likely find the detailed execution plan for 2024 and beyond, with a clearer projection of profitability, reassuring for the company's financial trajectory. Automotive Industry Analyst The technical specifications and AI capabilities of the FF 91 2.0 highlight Faraday Future's commitment to innovation in the EV space. The vehicle's tri-motor powertrain with 1050 hp and a reported 381 miles EPA range place it in direct competition with luxury performance vehicles.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFIE) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today released an open letter from Matthias Aydt, Global CEO of FF, to share an updated master plan 1.1 for the growth of Faraday Future in 2024. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240225201526/en/Faraday Future Announces Updated Master Plan 1.1 to Strategically Position Itself for Growth in 2024. (Photo: Business Wire) Opportunities and Accomplishments I’m issuing this letter to align expectations as to where FF stands today and where we hope to lead FF in 2024. FF has made great strides in the past 12 months, under limited funding and strong headwinds from the markets, including the changing landscape of the EV business. FF entered the revenue generation phase in 2023 and established a closed-loop operation from user acquisition and delivery to user operations while launching the process of adding industry leaders and partnering with our first users and Co-Creation Officers. There were significant changes in FF’s business foundation, including the addition of a new management team that we believe collectively boasts the strongest capabilities in the history of FF. We believe that during this critical period for business growth, the Company is now structurally best positioned for the next development phase since its inception. FF is only one of five new EV companies globally that has passed US homologation requirements, others include Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, and Fisker. $3 billion invested capital to date to create an industry leading EV platform, I.A.I. technology, product development and manufacturing capabilities. 660 patents filed or issued utility and design patents for both EV and I.A.I. technology competitiveness. 10,000 capacity - future potential annual production capacity at FF's self-operated manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with $200+ million invested. Dual Home Deep cultural roots in both the US and China provide competitive advantage across two of the largest EV markets with anticipated movement into the Middle East Markets in 2024. High-profile vehicle owners and Co-Creation Officers such as Chris Brown, Motev and others, demonstrating strong brand power. Direct sales online with anticipated targeted in-person experience centers and FF partner stores across target markets such as the US, China, Europe, and the Middle East. Phase Two of the Company's Three-Phase Delivery Plan for the Company’s FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance launched in the third quarter 2023. FF also signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) to unleash generative AI and advanced EVs for Abu Dhabi's SAVI cluster. Abu Dhabi’s SAVI cluster builds on the strength of Abu Dhabi’s industrial base and supports the UAE’s target of half of all cars on the roads being electric by 2050. The Middle East market presents exciting opportunities for smart and autonomous vehicles and is well aligned with FF product technology and brand positioning. We look forward to this being our first of many future endeavors and collaborations in the Middle East. We believe that the FF 91 2.0 is a vehicle uniquely positioned to provide new markets representing a new generation of aiEV users with a fully integrated, optimized software and hardware architecture to create a true All-Ability Hypercar. This vehicle includes full connectivity and personalized AI services and features. Key Deliverables Since Previous Announcement of FF’s Master Plan on October 2023 Gradually evolving the corporate orientation and direction towards a continuous operation with similar priorities in regard to production and sales as well as enhancing the product power of the product palette. Actively managing costs and expenses and focusing on improving Company-wide efficiency. Expanding our market presence into TechLuxury markets beyond the U.S with adequate volumes. Focusing on cashflow breakeven and next growth steps. Continuous product and technology enhancements to maintain unique position in the market. Took action to investigate short selling to protect shareholder interest. Have resulted in: A lean and flat organization dedicated to Product Definition, Product Execution, Product Delivery, User Operation, Corporate Development and supporting functional areas. Manufacturing, supply chain and product quality improvements. Reasonable cost structure and optimized costs and expenses. A successful market launch in one of the most important TechLuxury markets, the UAE. Confirmation of a solidified execution plan for 2024 and 2025 and beyond with clearer projection of profitability. A start of definition and conceptualization of the next generation revolutionizing product enhancement. Communications with various securities brokers regarding our short selling analysis. Product and Technology FF 91 comes from our disruptive approach to innovation across intelligent technology, user-centric design, and EV propulsion. It is a user-centric experience designed for people with many talents, many obligations and many goals in life. FF has addressed these complex needs in a single vehicle that combines the luxury of an intelligent connected space, with the capabilities of a hyper-dynamic EV powertrain and predictive AI architecture. Together, these elements work to elevate a user’s potential, and provide them the ultimate freedom to do what they want, when they want and how they want. The FF 91 has tri-motor powertrain capability, 1050 hp, is faster than Lamborghini Urus, and has a reported 381 miles EPA. It is also the first AI capable car able to run Zoom, ChatGPT, livestream, has a strong computing capacity with self-designed software and hardware platform including Nvidia chips and 5G*3 access point connectivity. As we recently announced, we continuously keep our product at the forefront through over-the-air (OTA) upgrades. These OTA upgrades significantly enhance the interaction between the user’s smartphone and their vehicle, making functions more intuitive and user-friendly. In addition to supporting conventional functions like unlocking doors, air conditioning, and charging, it also enables comprehensive control of in-car screens, enhancing the experience of in-car entertainment and work activities. Beyond the outstanding performance, technology, and agility of our product we have discussed in the past, we would request that everyone who has the chance to get into our car should take that opportunity to be amazed by the experience. Financial Updates We are continuing to make progress on future funding and believe we will successfully close on an additional round of capital from strategic and financial investors. We are currently also working to tighten restrictions to convertible note holders for their conversion and paused both our ATM program and ELOC. We are succeeding in reducing our monthly cash burn by cutting back on spending that is no longer necessary given our more advanced stage of development while continuing to balance investments into the business that are critical to moving the Company forward. We are prioritizing cash flow breakeven over volume to avoid scaling production too quickly, which has been an issue for many competitors. As such, we believe we will be cash flow breakeven at a lower vehicle production/delivery figure than that of our competitors. Additionally, our market (in terms of price point) is far less crowded. Cost Reduction: Bill of Materials (BoM) Significant reduction in cost - some of this is coming naturally with improvements in manufacturing efficiency but we are also targeting specific elements of the BoM, switching suppliers, and/or insourcing the production where available and cost effective. This is yielding meaningful, fruitful results – one example was taking a key component of the vehicle bringing the production in-house, this led to approximately $50,000 savings on a single element of the BoM. We are working on various other opportunities and low-hanging fruit that still exists in terms of continuously and meaningfully reducing the BoM in the near term. Next Steps 1. Operations: Operation optimization and upgrade to achieve sustainability in the near future. Cost reduction and spending efficiency, including daily operation and FF91 material cost. Continue product deliveries to celebrities and opinion leaders. Achieve industry-leading advantages in product and technology powers and “Ultimate AI TechLuxury” Top Brand momentum through the FF Co-Creation model. Focus on U.S, China Dual Home market & Middle East 3rd Pole. Achieve industrial implementation in the Middle East, access and localization of products and technologies, and establishment of a user ecosystem. 2. Product and technology: Continuously enhance the product and technology powers of the FF 91 2.0. Middle East product planning and implementation: Launch FF 91 2.0 aiFalcon this year. Research and develop the next-generation product FF 92, maintaining FF's leading edge in product and technology powers. Focus on the application research and development of AI technology, continue to lead in the vertical application of generative AI in the mobility field. 3. Manufacturing/Supply Chain: Progress the equipment commissioning and upgrading of FF ieFactory to lay the foundation for increased production. Comprehensively improve the factory manufacturing system and promote the continuous upgrade of the production and manufacturing quality system. Promote global supply chain integration and establish a global strategic supplier system. Further promote supplier quality and capacity enhancement and improve the supply chain quality performance system and cost reduction. 4. Funding and Finance: Continue and accelerate current plans to bring strategic investors. Globally optimize and upgrade the Company's financial system in the three regions, improve financial efficiency, and establish healthy and sustainable cash management. We believe that FF has the foundations to support future growth, subject to obtaining additional needed funding. We've triumphed over the challenging moments many times in our past, and FF has been bolstered by many achievements. Since the start of deliveries in 2023, and leading into 2024, the Company has consistently taken measures to reduce operational and supply chain costs in support of our strategic objectives. We believe that these steps will only help us succeed moving forward. With our unique DNA and the support of our global employees, our present and future users, and our many stakeholders, we remain steadfast in our belief that we stand on the cusp of an extraordinary surge of energy and success!

The service reaches over 150 countries, providing security-rich, reliable access to IoT devices and applications. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The introduction of Kyndryl's multi-IMSI SIM service is a strategic move to address the increasing demand for seamless connectivity in an era where the Internet of Things (IoT) and remote operations are becoming ubiquitous. The service's ability to dynamically switch between private LTE/5G and public mobile networks is pivotal for ensuring continuous connectivity, which is critical for industrial operations that cannot afford interruptions. This technology can reduce the risk of network outages, which in turn can prevent costly downtime for businesses relying on constant data flow for their operations.From a telecommunications perspective, the integration of global carriers to reach over 150 countries is a significant logistical achievement that could streamline operations for multinational corporations. This global reach ensures that enterprises can maintain consistent network performance across international borders, which is essential for businesses with a global workforce or supply chain. Furthermore, the service's focus on security-rich private IP network access is a response to the growing concerns about data breaches and cyber threats, particularly for mission-critical infrastructure. IT Infrastructure Expert Kyndryl's unified SIM service appears to be a robust solution for the challenges faced by the hybrid workforce and Industry 4.0 environments. The ability to make corporate applications and tools available anywhere and on any device is a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure. This flexibility is crucial for supporting a workforce that is increasingly mobile and dispersed, a trend accelerated by the pandemic and the shift towards remote work.The service's compatibility with SD-WAN/SASE is particularly noteworthy, as these are emerging as key technologies for secure and efficient network management. SD-WAN allows for the creation of a virtual network that is agile and can be easily controlled, while SASE combines network security functions with WAN capabilities to support the dynamic, secure access needs of organizations. The end-to-end encryption to any public cloud is a critical feature for customers seeking to protect their data in transit.The potential reduction in network redundancy and operational costs, alongside the optimization of network services, could have a significant financial impact on businesses. By minimizing downtime and improving network efficiency, companies could see an improvement in their bottom line. The mention of Kyndryl Bridge as an open-integration technology services platform suggests a move towards interoperability and ease of management, which are key factors for businesses looking to simplify their IT operations and reduce complexity. Cybersecurity Specialist Advanced security capabilities are a core component of Kyndryl's unified SIM offering, addressing the critical need for secure data connectivity in today's threat landscape. The emphasis on security-rich connectivity for IoT devices and machinery tracking is of paramount importance as these devices often operate within critical infrastructure sectors.

The partnership aims to reduce energy intensity by 50% by 2030. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The collaboration between Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and TELUS represents a significant advancement in the deployment of 5G technology, particularly with the implementation of Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) architecture. Open RAN is a transformative approach that disaggregates the hardware and software components of the radio access network, allowing for a more flexible and cost-effective network infrastructure. This is crucial as the telecommunications industry moves towards more software-driven solutions, which can potentially lower capital expenditure and operating costs for telecom operators like TELUS.Furthermore, the deployment of HPE ProLiant DL110 Gen11 servers as the foundation for Distributed Units (DUs) is a strategic move to enhance the performance and efficiency of TELUS's 5G network. DUs are essential for processing user data and preparing it for transmission over the 5G network. By leveraging HPE's servers, TELUS can expect improved interoperability and scalability, which are vital for the anticipated increase in network traffic driven by 5G applications. The energy-efficient features of these servers align with TELUS's commitment to reducing energy intensity, which is an increasingly important consideration for both corporate responsibility and operational cost savings. Environmental Sustainability Expert TELUS's commitment to reducing energy intensity per terabyte of data by 50% by 2030 is a notable environmental pledge that aligns with global sustainability goals. The use of HPE's AI-enabled servers that can dynamically adjust power consumption based on utilization is a prime example of how technology can be leveraged to achieve sustainability targets. This capability is particularly important given the projected tripling of network traffic by 2028 due to 5G expansion. The environmental impact of such a vast increase in data flow is a critical concern and the energy-saving features of the HPE infrastructure could serve as a benchmark for other telecom operators looking to minimize their carbon footprint while expanding their 5G networks. Market Research Analyst The potential impact of TELUS's 5G Open RAN network on both urban and rural communities in Canada should not be underestimated. Access to high-speed, reliable 5G services can significantly contribute to economic growth by enabling new business models and improving productivity. For rural areas, which have traditionally faced challenges in accessing advanced telecommunications services, the deployment of 5G could facilitate the growth of IoT systems and AI-driven applications, thereby narrowing the digital divide.

JSC Kaspi.kz Announces Notice of Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs,2024-02-26T07:45:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz Announces Intention to Cancel London Stock Exchange Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs,"JSC Kaspi.kz Announces Notice of Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Joint Stock Company Kaspi.kz Announces Intention to Cancel London Stock Exchange Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The decision by Kaspi.kz to delist its ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) appears to be a strategic move to consolidate its trading activities primarily on the Nasdaq, where it anticipates higher liquidity for its securities. This shift can be seen as a response to the observed low trading volumes on the LSE and the desire to streamline regulatory and administrative overheads. It's important to note that such a move could potentially reduce the company's global investor exposure, as delisting from a major exchange like the LSE might limit the accessibility for certain international investors. However, the company's presence on the Nasdaq might offset this by attracting a larger pool of U.S.-based investors. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the cancellation of the London listing could lead to cost savings for Kaspi.kz by eliminating the expenses associated with regulatory compliance and administrative duties required for maintaining the listing on the LSE. These savings could then be redirected towards other areas of the business to drive growth. Investors should monitor the stock's performance post-delisting to assess the impact on trading volumes and price. It's also prudent to consider the implications for liquidity, as the consolidation of trading venues could affect the ease with which shares can be bought and sold. Legal Expert The process of delisting involves regulatory nuances, as indicated by the adherence to Listing Rule 5.2.8R, which requires a minimum notice period before delisting can occur. For shareholders and potential investors, understanding the legal ramifications of transferring securities between markets and the regulatory environments of different exchanges is crucial. The company's adherence to these regulations, as well as its efforts to facilitate a smooth transition for investors, underscores the importance of legal compliance in such corporate actions. 02/26/2024 - 02:45 AM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF THAT JURISDICTION.

Pursuant to Listing Rule 5.2.8R, the Company is required to give at least twenty business days' notice of the intended cancellation of listing of its ADSs and its Rule 144A GDRs. Accordingly such cancellation is expected to occur by no later than 25 March 2024.Background and Reasons for CancellationBy way of background, the ADSs (formerly Regulation S GDRs) and the Rule 144A GDRs have been admitted to trading on the Main Market since 15 October 2020. The Company recently announced the completion of its initial public offering of ADSs in the United States. The ADSs began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (""Nasdaq"") on 19 January 2024, and the Company now expects the majority of trading in the ADSs to occur on Nasdaq.The Company has applied for the cancellation of the admissions to listing and trading of its ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs in London due to the low volumes being traded on the main market of the LSE. The Company believes that, given its Nasdaq listing and the limited liquidity of the ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs in London, the costs and ongoing regulatory compliance and administrative burden of maintaining the admission to listing of the ADSs and the Rule 144A GDRs on the FCA's Official List and the admission to trading on the main market of the LSE are disproportionate to the benefits of such admissions.The cancellation of the London listing of the ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs is not expected to have an impact on ADS holders who hold their ADSs in brokerage accounts in The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") for trading on Nasdaq. However, should you have any questions in relation to the cancellation of the London listing of the ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs or if you wish to realign your position in the ADSs from a custodian account in Euroclear/Clearstream into a custodian account in DTC for trading on Nasdaq, the Company recommends that you consult your broker.

The buyback agreement will run from February 26, 2024, to May 24, 2024, with shares purchased under the Program to be cancelled. The purchases will comply with regulations, including the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Share buyback programs often signal a company's confidence in its own financial health and future prospects. In the case of Tenaris S.A., the announcement of a $1.2 billion buyback program represents a significant capital allocation decision. By opting to cancel the acquired shares, Tenaris is effectively reducing its shares outstanding, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially enhance shareholder value. The timing of buyback programs can be critical, as they are often executed when management believes the shares are undervalued. The non-discretionary agreement with the financial institution ensures that the buyback is conducted without Tenaris's influence, which is designed to prevent potential market manipulation and adhere to regulatory compliance.From a financial perspective, the market will often react positively to such news, as it may imply that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. It is also an indication that the company is generating enough cash flow to fund significant share repurchases without compromising its operational capabilities or investment opportunities. However, investors should consider the opportunity cost of such a program, as the capital used for share repurchases could alternatively be used for expansion, debt reduction, or other investments that might also drive long-term growth. Market Research Analyst It is essential to understand the broader market implications of Tenaris's share buyback program. The steel pipe manufacturing industry is influenced by global demand for energy, as Tenaris's products are primarily used in the oil and gas sector. With the cyclical nature of these industries, Tenaris's decision to engage in a buyback program could reflect an internal analysis that anticipates stable or increasing demand for its products. Moreover, buybacks can be a tool for adjusting capital structure and improving financial ratios, which may make the company more attractive in the eyes of investors and analysts.Additionally, the market will monitor the execution of this buyback program closely, as the timing and volume of share repurchases can affect stock price dynamics. If the Bank executing the buyback operates during market downturns or periods of low liquidity, it could provide a floor for the stock price. However, it is also important for investors to scrutinize the long-term effects on the company's balance sheet and whether the buyback aligns with broader strategic initiatives that include investment in innovation and market expansion. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding share buybacks is complex and highly regulated to ensure fair market practices. Tenaris's compliance with the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014 and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 is crucial to maintain the integrity of the financial markets. These regulations are designed to prevent insider trading and market manipulation by stipulating strict rules on how and when a company can repurchase its own shares. The non-discretionary nature of the agreement with the Bank ensures that Tenaris remains at arm's length from the decision-making process related to the timing of the share purchases.This legal framework provides a safeguard for investors, ensuring that the buyback is conducted in a manner that is both transparent and compliant with the law. The fact that Tenaris can continue to purchase shares during closed periods, as allowed under the Regulations, indicates the robustness of the compliance measures in place. Investors should take comfort in the company's adherence to these regulations, which helps to mitigate legal risk and uphold market confidence. 02/25/2024 - 11:55 AM LUXEMBOURG, Feb. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tenaris S.A.

Further value is expected to be delivered by the introduction of conservative levels of leverage through debt. Once scale has been achieved, strong cash generation is expected to support an attractive dividend policy, providing investors with a desirable mix of inflation protection, growth and income.This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

VAALCO's CEO highlights the company's focus on operational excellence, asset productivity, and cash return to shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst VAALCO Energy's announcement of a quarterly cash dividend is a significant indicator of the company's current financial health and future outlook. The consistency in dividend payments, with an increment from $0.13 per share in 2022 to $0.25 per share in 2023 and maintaining the same rate in 2024, reflects a stable and potentially growing income stream for investors. This can be seen as a sign of confidence by the management in the company's cash-generating abilities, despite the volatile nature of the energy sector.However, it's crucial to analyze the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio ensures that the company retains enough capital to fund future growth while rewarding shareholders. In the context of VAALCO, with over $120 million in cash reserves as of the end of 2023, the declared dividend appears to be well-covered, suggesting prudent financial management and the possibility of continued or increased shareholder returns going forward. Market Research Analyst The dividend declaration by VAALCO Energy can have implications for investor sentiment and stock performance. Dividends are often seen as a sign of a company's reliability and may attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for VAALCO's stock. This effect can be particularly pronounced in the energy sector, where companies face significant risks from fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory changes.It is also important to consider the competitive landscape. VAALCO's dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the latest dividend payment and dividing by the stock price, should be compared with peers to assess relative attractiveness. A higher-than-average yield could attract investors, but it is essential to balance yield with growth prospects and the overall health of the company. Economist From an economic perspective, VAALCO Energy's dividend policy and cash position must be evaluated in the context of the broader macroeconomic environment. In a low-interest-rate environment, dividends may be more attractive relative to fixed-income securities, potentially leading to a reallocation of funds from bonds to dividend-paying stocks. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the attractiveness of dividends may diminish.Moreover, the energy sector is subject to geopolitical risks and environmental policies that can affect profitability. VAALCO's ability to maintain a robust dividend in such a climate suggests operational resilience and efficient capital allocation. This resilience is critical for long-term value creation and can serve as a buffer against market volatility, providing a degree of stability for shareholders. 02/26/2024 - 02:00 AM HOUSTON, Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VAALCO Energy, Inc.

Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. George Maxwell, VAALCO’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our ongoing focus on operational excellence and enhancing the productivity of our diverse asset base has allowed us to continue returning cash to our shareholders through a dividend.

The collaboration aims to fulfill the MPN vision by offering crucial capabilities for carriers and enterprises, enabling customized connectivity solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Analyst The partnership between Alef and Casa Systems signifies a strategic move in the telecommunications sector, particularly for the deployment of Mobile Private Networks (MPNs). The collaboration is aimed at addressing the current limitations of MPNs by offering a solution that is more aligned with enterprise IT requirements. The emphasis on a lightweight, scalable and IT-integrated MPN solution could potentially disrupt the market by making 5G technology more accessible and practical for enterprise use.From a technical perspective, the integration of Casa's cloud-native 5G Expansion Suite with Alef's enterprise-focused authentication and policy management is noteworthy. This hybrid approach could help overcome the traditionally high costs and inflexibility of MPNs by leveraging cloud-native technologies for scalability and cost efficiency. Furthermore, the focus on data residency and sovereignty is particularly relevant in today's market, where data privacy regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. Market Research Analyst With the GSMA's projection of a $109.4 billion revenue opportunity for 5G MPNs by 2030, the market potential for Alef and Casa's solution is significant. The ability to offer a cost-effective and enterprise-friendly MPN solution could accelerate adoption among businesses, which have been hesitant to deploy MPNs due to cost and complexity concerns. The ease of management and deployment, akin to Wi-Fi networks, could be a game-changer for enterprises looking to leverage 5G for use cases such as AR/VR training, supply chain management and mission-critical communications.The enterprise sector's scaled adoption of this solution could lead to increased demand for 5G infrastructure and services, potentially impacting the stock performance of companies involved in the 5G supply chain. Stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate post-launch to gauge the long-term impact on the market. Cybersecurity Expert The integration of advanced security and policy management into the MPN solution addresses a critical aspect of enterprise connectivity—cybersecurity. With enterprises increasingly concerned about data breaches and cyber threats, a solution that offers robust security features while simplifying policy management could be highly attractive. The single pane management and visibility feature is particularly important, as it allows for better control and monitoring of network activities, potentially reducing the risk of security incidents.The focus on authentication and authorization policies within the MPN solution could also resonate with enterprises that are subject to regulatory compliance requirements. By ensuring that data residency and sovereignty needs are met, Alef and Casa are positioning their solution as not only technologically advanced but also compliant with evolving legal frameworks. 02/26/2024 - 02:00 AM Tight Integration of Capabilities Ushers in New Era of Simple, Cost-Effective MPN with Enterprise-Friendly Authentication, Security and Policy ManagementNEW YORK and ANDOVER, Mass., Feb. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alef, a leader in mobile connectivity solutions, and Casa Systems, provider of cloud-native network solutions serving communications services providers (CSPs) worldwide, have partnered to introduce a groundbreaking Mobile Private Network (MPN) solution. This innovative collaboration delivers CSPs a redefining MPN solution to drive scaled adoption throughout the enterprise sector. Out with the Old: Overcoming Traditional MPN Challenges The GSMA recently estimated that 5G MPNs represent a $109.4 billion revenue opportunity by 2030. With the high speed, reliability, customization, and security MPNs offer, enterprises can enable a variety of use cases for mission-critical communications, supply chain management, AR/VR training and more. But since the debut of 5G, the high costs and inflexible nature of current MPN solutions coupled with poor integration into enterprise IT systems have hindered progress of MPN deployments. The Alef-Casa solution eliminates legacy challenges and embraces individualized enterprise requirements. The solution also combines Casa's cloud-native 5G Expansion Suite, a 5G standalone (SA)-compliant solution that complements the CSP’s existing core network, with Alef’s authentication, authorization policy, and management capabilities. The result is a cost-effective enterprise MPN solution that addresses data residency/sovereignty and IT policy management needs while providing all the advantages of 5G mobile connectivity with the management simplicity of a Wi-Fi network. Colin Kincaid, CPO of Casa Systems, said, ""By integrating Alef’s enterprise-centric authentication, authorization policy, and management with Casa’s cloud-native 5G Expansion Suite and in-building radio access products, we can deliver a differentiated mobile connectivity solution that works seamlessly with enterprise network authentication and policy frameworks–all with the deployment and management simplicity of Wi-Fi.""

Revenue decreased to R136.3 billion, with EBIT at R15.9 billion, 34% lower than the prior period. Impairments of R5.8 billion were recorded. Dividends were reduced, and key metrics like earnings per share and dividend per share also declined. Positive None. Negative Revenue declined to R136.3 billion due to lower chemical product prices. EBIT decreased by 34% to R15.9 billion compared to the prior period. Impairments of R5.8 billion were recognized, impacting the financial performance. Dividends decreased significantly, with earnings per share and dividend per share also declining. Financial Analyst The reported earnings and financial metrics for Sasol indicate a significant downturn in performance, with a 34% decrease in EBIT and similar reductions in headline earnings and basic earnings per share. This downturn is reflective of the broader challenges faced by the energy and chemicals sectors, including fluctuating oil prices, inflationary pressures and unstable product demand. The substantial drop in the interim dividend, from 700 cents to 200 cents per share, signals a cautious approach by the board amidst liquidity and solvency considerations.Investors may view these results as a red flag, potentially leading to a decrease in share price as market confidence wanes. The impairments recorded, particularly in the Secunda liquid fuels refinery, suggest a strategic reassessment may be necessary to align with the evolving macroeconomic landscape. The focus on liquidity and solvency in the announcement also highlights the company's priority to maintain financial stability in a challenging environment. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Sasol's performance metrics provide insight into the broader petrochemical industry dynamics. The decrease in chemical product prices across all regions is indicative of a global downturn in demand, likely tied to a weaker global growth outlook. This could signal a trend for similar companies in the sector, potentially impacting the commodity price index and investor sentiment towards the industry.Moreover, the impairments in the Chlor-Alkali & PVC and Polyethylene CGUs suggest a structural shift in market demand, possibly due to advancements in alternative materials or sustainability trends. This could have long-term implications for the industry, prompting companies to innovate and diversify their product offerings to stay competitive. Economist Analyzing the broader economic implications, Sasol's financial results may be symptomatic of a slowing global economy. The company's reference to a weaker global growth outlook and its impact on business performance has implications for GDP growth forecasts and commodity-based economies. The inflationary pressures cited are a concern for monetary policy, potentially influencing interest rate decisions by central banks in affected regions.The operational challenges linked to state-owned enterprises in Sasol's value chain could also reflect systemic issues within the South African economy, such as infrastructure inefficiencies or governance concerns. These factors can contribute to investor apprehension about the region's economic stability and attractiveness for foreign direct investment. 02/26/2024 - 12:59 AM JOHANNESBURG, Feb. 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Earnings performance Sasol's performance for the first six months of 2024 continued to be negatively impacted by the continued volatile macroeconomic environment, with weaker oil and petrochemical prices, unstable product demand and continued inflationary pressure. Despite some operational improvements in South Africa, persistent underperformance of the state-owned enterprises involved in Sasol's value chain and the weaker global growth outlook continue to impact Sasol's business performance. Revenue of R136,3 billion is lower than the prior period of R149,8 billion, mainly as a result of the lower chemical product prices across all regions. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of R15,9 billion is R8,3 billion (34%) lower than the prior period. The variance to the prior period is mainly due to lower revenue and lower gains on the valuation of financial instruments and derivative contracts, offset by lower chemical feedstock prices in Europe, Asia and the United States of America (US). The current period includes remeasurement items of R5,8 billion mainly due to: Impairments of the Secunda liquid fuels refinery cash generating unit (CGU) of R3,9 billion driven by a further deterioration assumed of the macroeconomic outlook, including Brent crude oil and electricity prices, resulting in the full amount of capital expenditure incurred during the period being impaired; andImpairments of the Chemicals Africa Chlor-Alkali & PVC and Polyethylene CGUs of R1,2 billion due to lower selling prices associated with reduced market demand.The prior period included impairments of R6,4 billion mainly due to the Secunda liquid fuels refinery CGU (R8,1 billion), Chemicals SA Wax CGU (R0,9 billion), China Essential Care Chemicals CGU (R0,9 billion), offset by a reversal of the US Tetramerisation CGU impairment (R3,6 billion).

The legal implications of this deal extend to the potential for Thomson Reuters to act as a trusted advisor, helping clients navigate the intricacies of global trade and indirect tax laws.Furthermore, the legal expertise of both companies will be crucial in ensuring a smooth transition and integration of services, which could include the harmonization of data privacy and security standards—a critical consideration in today's digital economy. 02/26/2024 - 01:30 AM Accelerating the companies' joint vision for a connected suite of e-invoicing and indirect tax solutions for customers across the globe.

BARCELONA, Spain--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intel (Nasdaq: INTC): What’s New: At MWC 2024, Intel announced its new Edge Platform, a modular, open software platform enabling enterprises to develop, deploy, run, secure, and manage edge and AI applications at scale with cloud-like simplicity. Together, these capabilities will accelerate time-to-scale deployment for enterprises, contributing to improved total cost of ownership (TCO). “The edge is the next frontier of digital transformation, being further fueled by AI. We are building on our strong customer base in the market and consolidating our years of software initiatives to the next level in delivering a complete edge-native platform, which is needed to enable infrastructure, applications and efficient AI deployments at scale. Our modular platform is exactly that, driving optimal edge infrastructure performance and streamlining application management for enterprises, giving them both improved competitiveness and improved total cost of ownership.” – Pallavi Mahajan, Intel corporate vice president and general manager of Network and Edge Group Software Why It Matters: The amount of compute happening at the edge is growing fast because that is where data is generated. In addition, many edge computing deployments are incorporating AI. At the edge, businesses need to automate for many reasons: to achieve pricing competitiveness, to relieve the effects of labor shortages, to expand innovation, to add efficiency, to improve time to market and to deliver new services. However, working at the edge is often complex and challenging for a variety of reasons: Difficulty building performant edge AI solutions with high return on investment (ROI) across a range of use cases in a specific industry. The diversity of hardware, software and even power requirements at the edge. Lack of secure and cost-effective methods to move and utilize high data volumes required by AI at the edge while maintaining low latency. Increasingly complex operations management of distributed edge devices and applications at scale. Use cases – with examples including defect detection and preventive maintenance in industrial facilities, frictionless checkout and inventory management in retail, and traffic management and emergency safety in smart cities/transportation – typically require advanced networking and AI analytics at the edge with low latency, locality and cost requirements to meet stringent real-world needs. Additionally, a mix of on-premises analytics with aggregation and placement of some AI processing in the cloud to manage global deployment locations is common. These hybrid AI scenarios require a software platform built to handle them. And while custom solutions to challenges are available today, they are often built on closed systems and specialized hardware.

Uncertainty regarding Equatorial Guinea production due to safety issues with the drilling rig, impacting the 2024 guidance. Kosmos estimates net share of recoverable damages up to $160.0 million related to subsea expenses at Torture Phase 1. Financial Analyst The financial results of Kosmos Energy Ltd. demonstrate a solid performance with a reported net income of $22 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. The adjusted net income of $149 million, which excludes certain non-recurring items, presents a more robust profitability metric for stakeholders. This figure, coupled with a 12% year-over-year production growth, signals a positive trajectory for the company's operational efficiency and financial health. The 104% reserve replacement ratio is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests the company is effectively replenishing the reserves it extracts, a critical factor for long-term sustainability in the energy sector.However, the reported net capital expenditure overshoot and the expected capital expenditures for 2024, primarily due to accelerated equipment purchases and higher subsea expenses, may raise concerns about cost management and its potential impact on future profitability. The net debt position of approximately $2.3 billion, despite a reasonable liquidity cushion, warrants attention as it may affect the company's financial flexibility. Investors would benefit from monitoring Kosmos' leverage and its ability to manage debt levels while pursuing growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst Kosmos Energy's strategic moves, such as assuming operatorship and increasing working interest in Yakaar-Teranga, align with Senegal's 'Gas-to-Power' and 'Gas-to-Industry' initiatives, indicating an alignment with regional energy goals. This could strengthen Kosmos' position in the region and potentially lead to long-term partnerships and contracts. The Tiberius ILX oil discovery in the Gulf of Mexico adds an attractive short-cycle oil development to the company's portfolio, which may appeal to investors looking for companies with immediate growth prospects in proven regions.The company's emphasis on maintaining a AAA rating with MSCI suggests a strong focus on sustainability and governance, which is increasingly important to socially conscious investors. The planned developments and project startups, such as Jubilee Southeast and Winterfell, may serve as catalysts for future growth, provided they are executed effectively and within budget. The emphasis on a just and orderly energy transition also positions Kosmos favorably in a market that is increasingly valuing environmental responsibility. Energy Sector Analyst The operational updates from Kosmos Energy, including the advancements in the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim project and the expected production increases from the Jubilee field, reflect the company's strong foothold in key strategic areas. The 1P and 2P reserves-to-production ratios of around 12 and over 20 years, respectively, indicate a substantial reserve base, providing a degree of assurance regarding the company's output capabilities in the medium to long term.However, the impairment charges of $222.3 million for the TEN Fields due to negative reserve revisions and reduced development scope highlight the risks associated with oil and gas exploration and production. Such impairments can affect investor confidence and reflect the volatility inherent in the sector. The proactive steps to recover damages from a subsea contractor that failed to perform contractual obligations show Kosmos' commitment to mitigating project risks and protecting shareholder value. 02/26/2024 - 02:00 AM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kosmos Energy Ltd. (“Kosmos” or the “Company”) (NYSE/LSE: KOS) announced today its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter of 2023. For the quarter, the Company generated a net income of $22 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. When adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results, the Company generated an adjusted net income(1) of $149 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2023. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 HIGHLIGHTS 4Q Net Production(2): ~66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), representing ~12% growth year over year; Net sales of ~73,000 boepd 4Q Revenues: $508 million, or $75.64 per boe (excluding the impact of derivative cash settlements) 4Q Production expense: $104 million, or $15.46 per boe 4Q Capital expenditures: $281 million 1P reserves of ~280 mmboe as of December 31, 2023, representing a 104% replacement rate ratio Assumed operatorship and a greater working interest at Yakaar-Teranga offshore Senegal Tiberius infrastructure-led exploration (ILX) oil discovery offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico Maintained AAA rating with MSCI Commenting on the Company’s 2023 performance, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew G. Inglis said: “In 2023, we continued to advance our key development projects, which aim to deliver around 50% production growth from the second half of 2022. The start-up of Jubilee Southeast was a major step toward achieving this goal and, in the coming months, we expect production to begin at Winterfell in the Gulf of Mexico followed by first gas at Greater Tortue Ahmeyim offshore Mauritania and Senegal. “Beyond advancing our development projects, we also strengthened our portfolio of low cost, lower carbon investment opportunities. We delivered a significant oil discovery at Tiberius in the Gulf of Mexico, which added an attractive short-cycle oil development to our portfolio. Kosmos also assumed operatorship and a larger working interest at Yakaar-Teranga, which is a key asset in Senegal’s ‘Gas-to-Power’ and ‘Gas-to-Industry’ initiatives. “As we pursue these operated developments, as well as other projects in our organic portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver growth through the decade while generating strong cash flow. This is expected to strengthen our balance sheet, help us achieve our leverage targets, while providing flexibility around future capital allocation opportunities including returns to shareholders. “Kosmos is well-positioned to create value for shareholders. We have a clear strategy, top-quality assets with greater than 20 years of 2P reserves/production life, multiple growth catalysts, and an important role in enabling a just and orderly energy transition in the countries where we work.” FINANCIAL UPDATE Kosmos exited the fourth quarter of 2023 with approximately $2.4 billion of total long-term debt and approximately $2.3 billion of net debt(1) and available liquidity of approximately $0.7 billion. The Company generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $294 million and free cash flow(1) of approximately $(27) million in the fourth quarter. Net capital expenditure for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $281 million, higher than expected primarily due to the accelerated timing of long-lead equipment purchases for the Equatorial Guinea infill and ILX drilling program. Net capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately $700-$750 million, weighted towards the first half of the year as the Ghana drilling campaign concludes and the Winterfell and Tortue projects progress to startup. Our 2024 guidance reflects higher than anticipated subsea expenses at Torture Phase 1 following the replacement of the previous subsea contractor that failed to perform its contractual obligations. BP, on behalf of the partner group, has initiated the process under its agreement with the original subsea contractor to recover the losses incurred. The partnership will seek to recover the maximum recoverable damages in binding arbitration. We estimate Kosmos’ net share of the recoverable damages to be up to $160.0 million. RESERVES UPDATE At year-end 2023, Kosmos had 1P reserves of approximately 280 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), representing a 1P reserves to production ratio of around 12 years and a reserve replacement ratio of 104%, primarily as a result of increased reserve recognition at Jubilee. 2P reserves as of year-end 2023 are approximately 520 million boe, representing a 2P reserves-to-production ratio of over 20 years. 2P reserves do not include any recognition for the Tiberius and Yakaar-Teranga discoveries with changes being driven by 2023 production as well as reduced future activity on TEN. Kosmos’ year-end reserves on all assets have been independently evaluated by Ryder Scott. OPERATIONAL UPDATE Production Total net production(2) in the fourth quarter of 2023 averaged approximately 66,000 boepd representing a ~12% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Production during the quarter was impacted by reduced water injection at Jubilee, which has since been resolved. Production is expected to rise through the year with additional wells at Jubilee coming online and the startup of the Winterfell and Tortue LNG projects. The Company exited the quarter in a net overlift position of approximately 0.2 million barrels. Ghana Production in Ghana averaged approximately 43,300 boepd net in the fourth quarter of 2023. Kosmos lifted four cargos from Ghana during the quarter, in line with guidance. At Jubilee (38.6% working interest), oil production in the fourth quarter averaged approximately 92,400 bopd gross with two water injection wells brought online. In 2024, one new producer well and one injector well were brought online in early 1Q with three additional wells expected online in the coming months before we expect the current rig contract to end. FPSO reliability remains high at approximately 99% year to date and water injection is currently at record levels of approximately 285,000 barrels of water per day (bwpd). This compares with ~150,000 bwpd in the fourth quarter and ~160,000 bwpd over 2023. At current water and gas injection rates, we expect 100% voidage replacement in 2024, providing the necessary pressure support to maintain elevated production levels. At TEN (20.4% working interest), production averaged approximately 18,500 bopd gross for the fourth quarter in line with expectations. The partnership has submitted a draft amended plan of development (“PoD”) for a high-graded activity set at TEN and a combined gas sales agreement for Jubilee and TEN to the Government of Ghana for approval. An interim gas sales agreement for Jubilee associated gas has been extended through May 2024 at a price of $2.95/mmbtu while discussions are ongoing on a longer-term agreement. In the fourth quarter, Ghana gas production net to Kosmos was approximately 5,800 boepd. As a result of negative proved oil and gas reserve revisions at TEN, driven by a reduction in the partnership’s development work scope for the TEN Fields and well performance, we recorded impairment charges of $222.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The impairment charges resulted in a full impairment of the remaining book value of TEN reducing the carrying value of the TEN Fields to zero. Jubilee 1P reserve additions more than offset the downward revision to TEN 1P reserves during the period. U.S. Gulf of Mexico Production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico averaged approximately 13,900 boepd net (~81% oil) during the fourth quarter, in line with guidance. The Winterfell development continues to progress with the first of three wells completed in the fourth quarter and the second well completed in the first quarter of 2024. First production is expected early in the second quarter of 2024 with the third well to follow later this year. As announced in October 2023, the Tiberius ILX well in Keathley Canyon, block 964, encountered approximately 250 feet (~75 meters) of net oil pay in the primary Wilcox target. The Tiberius well is located in approximately 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) of water and was drilled to a total vertical depth of approximately 25,800 feet (7,800 meters). Initial fluid and core analysis supports the production potential of the Tiberius development wells, with characteristics analogous with similar nearby discoveries in the Wilcox trend. Kosmos is now working with partners on subsea development options with a sanction decision for a phased tie-back development targeted later this year. The discovery is located approximately 6 miles southeast of the Lucius production facility (operated by Occidental, a partner in Tiberius) enabling a short tie-back. In the Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 261, Kosmos and Occidental were awarded three blocks nearby to Tiberius, including an existing oil discovery, Logan. The Odd Job subsea pump project, planned to sustain long-term production from the field, was ~90% complete at quarter end. The project remains on track to be in service by mid-2024. At Kodiak, workover plans for the Kodiak 3 well have been developed and are expected to commence around the middle of 2024. Equatorial Guinea Production in Equatorial Guinea averaged approximately 24,800 bopd gross and 8,700 bopd net in the fourth quarter. Kosmos lifted one cargo from Equatorial Guinea during the quarter, in line with guidance. The 2023 Ceiba Field and Okume Complex development rig campaign commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023. The campaign initially completed one production well workover. However, as a result of safety issues with the drilling rig, the operator terminated the rig contract in early February 2024. The partnership is seeking to secure an alternative rig and drilling contractor to resume the work, which is planned to include the drilling of infill production wells in Block G and the Akeng Deep prospect in Block S. Given uncertainty on the timing of procuring a rig, we have not included production related to the drilling program in our 2024 guidance, although the partnership is eager to complete the campaign and drill the Akeng Deep ILX well as soon as possible in a safe, reliable, and environmentally sound manner. Mauritania & Senegal On Greater Tortue Ahmeyim, the project continues to make good progress. The following milestones have been achieved: Drilling: The operator has successfully drilled and completed all four wells with expected production capacity significantly higher than what is required for first gas. Hub Terminal: Construction work is complete, and handover to operations was completed in August 2023. Subsea: Significant progress has been made on the installation of the infield flowlines and subsea structures. Work re-commenced in the fourth quarter with completion expected at the end of the second quarter of 2024. FLNG: Construction was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the vessel arrived on location offshore Mauritania/Senegal in the first quarter of 2024. Hookup work is now underway. FPSO: The vessel is currently in a shipyard in Tenerife for inspection and repair of the fairleads. Completion of this work and transit to the project site is expected early in the second quarter ahead of final hookup and commissioning. The critical path to first gas, expected in the third quarter of 2024, continues to be through the arrival, hookup and commissioning of the FPSO. Timely execution of this workstream is expected to allow for first LNG in the fourth quarter. In November 2023, Kosmos assumed operatorship and increased its working interest in Yakaar-Teranga to 90% (from 30%), with government approvals received in January 2024. Kosmos is working closely with Senegal's national oil company (PETROSEN) on pre-FEED work that prioritizes cost-competitive gas to the rapidly growing domestic market, combined with an offshore liquefied natural gas facility targeting exports into international LNG markets. Post completion of pre-FEED, Kosmos plans to farm down its interest in the second half of 2024 to around 33% working interest while retaining operatorship of the project.

First significant delivery volumes are expected to begin in the first half of 2024 and continue throughout the year. Ayvens was created in May 2023 when ALD Automotive acquired LeasePlan, one of the world’s leading fleet management and mobility companies. Now ranked #1 global multi-brand and multi-channel car leasing player, Ayvens is leveraging its scale and capabilities to support its broad client base of corporate, SME and private individual clients. Ayvens and its customers will benefit from an attractive choice of vehicles from Stellantis award-winning brands including Alfa Romeo, Citroën, DS Automobiles, FIAT, Jeep®, Lancia, Opel, Peugeot, and Vauxhall. Brand availability can be extended in the future to cover the entire Stellantis brand portfolio. One of the shared priorities will be integrating Stellantis’ innovative range of sustainable vehicles to support Ayvens’ multi-brand strategy. Deliveries to Ayvens will include a variety of vehicle classes, ranging from city cars to SUVs and vans (including 7- and 9-seaters), featuring the latest software, infotainment and connectivity tech. Specific order quantities, compositions and delivery dates beyond the volumes already planned for 2024 can be flexibly agreed between the two companies, taking into consideration fleet requirements and demand. Carlos Tavares, CEO of Stellantis: “I am thrilled to announce a new ground-breaking agreement with Ayvens, which will aid the progressive transition of Ayven’s client base to choosing more sustainable mobility options. With our renowned and electrified brands, we offer a vehicle tailored to meet every need, budget and lifestyle. This collaboration empowers both current and prospective Stellantis brand customers to experience our latest innovations first-hand, from advanced propulsion to seamless connectivity and unparalleled comfort.

This commercial partnership will allow us to work closely together with Stellantis to ensure more competitive pricing for our clients and perfectly illustrates our capacity to leverage our new scale and buying power to achieve better value and synergies for all of our stakeholders. The mobility industry is structurally a high-growth market which is underpinned by clients’ shifting from ownership to usership, their requirement for full-service leasing solutions, their need for visibility over their costs and their commitment to reduce their carbon footprint. We play a critical role in creating an efficient and robust ecosystem with our partners in order to deliver the best value and benefits to our clients as they transition to sustainable mobility. Our goal is to lead this transition and shape the future of our industry as the leading global sustainable mobility player.” Both companies are dedicated to making mobility more sustainable.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The share repurchase program executed by the company represents a strategic financial decision with direct implications on shareholder value and market perception. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the company is effectively increasing the earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This can lead to a higher stock price due to the perceived increase in value per share. Additionally, the repurchase signals to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued, which can instill confidence in investors and potentially attract new interest.However, the capital used for share repurchases is capital not invested in other areas such as business expansion or R&D, which could have other long-term benefits. The impact on the company's financial leverage should also be considered, as the repurchase was likely funded by existing cash reserves or debt. The reduction in cash reserves or increase in debt can affect the company's financial flexibility. It's important to monitor the company's subsequent financial statements to evaluate the long-term effects of this buyback on its balance sheet and income statement. Market Research Analyst Share buyback programs are often well-received by the market, as they can be indicative of a company's strong financial health and management's confidence in the business. In the context of the industry, companies in the hospitality sector like InterContinental Hotels Group PLC may engage in such practices to manage their capital structure effectively, especially when facing industry-specific challenges such as fluctuating demand and intense competition.It's important to analyze the timing of the buyback. The company has chosen to execute the purchase after obtaining shareholder approval, which demonstrates a planned approach to capital management. The market's reaction to such news typically depends on the context in which the buyback is announced, the size of the buyback relative to the company's market capitalization and the company's historical performance. Tracking the stock's performance in the days following the announcement can provide insights into investor sentiment regarding the buyback. Corporate Governance Expert A share repurchase program must be evaluated within the framework of corporate governance. The decision to buy back shares should be in alignment with the company's long-term strategic goals and must be communicated transparently to shareholders. The program's execution through a reputable financial institution like Goldman Sachs International adds a layer of credibility and ensures that the process adheres to market regulations.The cancellation of the purchased shares is a definitive action that permanently reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can affect voting power distributions among remaining shareholders. It is crucial for the company to maintain a balance between delivering immediate shareholder value and preserving the ability to capitalize on future growth opportunities. The governance implications of such a transaction are significant and should be scrutinized to ensure they align with the best interests of the stakeholders. 02/26/2024 - 02:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / February 26, 2024 / The Company announces that on 23 February 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").
