We look at this customary metric to better assess and understand the performance of the business. Please refer to the table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.Full Year Financial ResultsTotal revenues for 2023 were $34.1 million compared with $28.7 million for 2022, an increase of approximately 19%, primarily driven by a higher volume of Ameluz sales and a higher average Ameluz selling price.Total operating expenses were $56.7 million for 2023 compared with $47.3 million for 2022. Cost of revenues increased to $17.4 million for 2023 from $15.2 million in 2022 primarily driven by increased Ameluz sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2023 were $39.1 million compared with $35.9 million for 2022, an increase of about 9% compared with the prior year, primarily driven by personnel-related expenses and higher legal expenses.The net loss for 2023 was $20.1 million, or $(13.02) per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $0.6 million, or $(0.61) per share, for 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was negative $19.5 million for 2023 compared with negative $18.1 million for 2022.

Medical Research Analyst The FDA approval of XHANCE nasal spray for chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps represents a significant advancement in the treatment landscape for a condition that affects a considerable segment of the adult population in the U.S. The clinical trial data showcasing a statistically significant reduction in symptoms and inflammation, as well as a decrease in acute exacerbations, is noteworthy. These exacerbations often lead to antibiotic prescriptions, which have implications for antibiotic resistance and healthcare costs. The introduction of XHANCE could potentially reduce the reliance on antibiotics and surgeries, which are currently prevalent in managing this chronic condition.Furthermore, the proprietary Exhalation Delivery System utilized by XHANCE allows for targeted delivery of the steroid to inflamed areas within the nasal cavity, addressing a key limitation of standard nasal sprays. This targeted approach could improve patient outcomes and quality of life, which is particularly relevant given the chronic nature of sinusitis and its comparable impact on quality of life to conditions like COPD and migraines. The safety profile consistency with the currently labeled safety profile is also a positive aspect, minimizing concerns for new adverse effects. Healthcare Economist Chronic sinusitis without nasal polyps constitutes a substantial burden on the healthcare system, accounting for millions of outpatient visits and a significant number of surgeries annually. The economic implications of XHANCE's FDA approval are multifaceted. On one hand, the drug-device combination could alleviate some of the direct medical costs associated with chronic sinusitis by reducing the need for surgeries and potentially curbing antibiotic usage. On the other hand, indirect costs related to lost productivity and quality of life could also see improvement.However, the pricing strategy for XHANCE and its adoption by ENT specialists will play a important role in determining its economic impact. If priced competitively and covered by insurance plans, XHANCE could see widespread use, which might lead to overall cost savings for the healthcare system. Conversely, if the drug is priced at a premium without clear cost-benefit advantages over existing treatments, its impact could be limited. Long-term studies on healthcare resource utilization and patient-reported outcomes post-adoption will be instrumental in assessing the true economic impact of this new treatment option. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Optinose's FDA approval for XHANCE could position the company to capture a significant share of the chronic sinusitis treatment market, especially since there is currently no approved medication for the majority of patients who do not have nasal polyps. The market potential is underscored by the estimated 30 million adults in the U.S. suffering from this condition. The company's stock performance and by extension investor interest, will likely be influenced by the commercial rollout of XHANCE, market adoption rates and the competitive response from other pharmaceutical companies with interests in the ENT space.Investors will be monitoring prescription trends, insurance coverage decisions and real-world efficacy and safety data. Optinose's ability to effectively market XHANCE to both ENT specialists and primary care physicians will be critical, as will the company's supply chain and distribution capabilities. As XHANCE becomes integrated into standard care practices for chronic sinusitis, its long-term impact on Optinose's financial health and market valuation will become clearer. 03/15/2024 - 03:34 PM ReOpen was the first ever large placebo-controlled clinical trial program to demonstrate statistically significant reduction of symptoms in chronic sinusitis patients without nasal polyps Clinical trial program also showed reduction in sinus inflammation and in acute exacerbations, which frequently result in use of antibiotics XHANCE uses the proprietary Exhalation Delivery System to enable deposition of a proven steroid in target areas of inflammation deep in the nose not typically reached by standard nasal sprays Chronic sinusitis affects approximately 30 million adults in the U.S. YARDLEY, Pa., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Optinose (NASDAQ:OPTN), a pharmaceutical company focused on patients treated by ear, nose and throat (ENT) and allergy specialists, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved XHANCEÂ® (fluticasone propionate) nasal spray for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps in patients 18 years of age and older. Chronic sinusitis (also called âchronic rhinosinusitisâ or âCRSâ) is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting approximately 30 million adults in the United States. Research shows that the disease impairs quality of life to a similar degree as other serious chronic conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sciatica, or migraine. Chronic sinusitis is also one of the most common diagnoses in adult outpatient medicine. Chronic sinusitis is diagnosed in approximately 10 million outpatient visits, of which approximately 70% result in antibiotic prescriptions, and leads to more than 600,000 surgeries annually. Although there are FDAâapproved medications to treat nasal polyps, including XHANCE, no medication had ever been approved for the more than two-thirds of chronic sinusitis patients who do not have nasal polyps â until today.1 âThe FDA approval of XHANCE for the treatment of CRS without nasal polyps is an important milestone,â said Rick Chandra, M.D., Professor of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Endowed Director, Roland âRonâ Eavey, MD, SM Endowed Directorship in Leadership and Education, Service Chief, Rhinology and Skull Base Surgery, Vanderbilt University. âUntil today, we have been forced to use unproven therapies to try and alleviate the symptoms that these patients suffer. While we often resort to using nasal steroid sprays in this patient population, they have never been shown to be effective in large placebo-controlled clinical studies. XHANCE, which uses the Exhalation Delivery System to enable delivery of an established topical steroid to the areas of the nasal cavity and sinuses we know to be extensively inflamed, is now proven to be effective in treating our CRS patients both with and without nasal polyps.â âPeople who donât suffer from chronic sinusitis may not appreciate how burdensome the condition can be. More than 80% of patients with chronic sinusitis report frustration with symptom relief when using a standard-delivery nasal steroid sprays, and patients commonly use multiple unproven over the counter medications in an effort to find symptom relief.â said Ramy Mahmoud, MD, MPH, CEO of Optinose. âAlthough chronic sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses in outpatient physician visits, and surgery is available, there has never been a prescription medication approved by the FDA as safe and effective to treat the millions of patients without nasal polyps suffering from this debilitating disease. We are thrilled to now be able to offer new hope to these patients and believe XHANCE has the potential to become part of the standard of care for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.â The approval was based on data from the ReOpen program evaluating XHANCE for treatment of adults with chronic sinusitis. A drug-device combination product, XHANCE uniquely combines a widely used nasal steroid with the Exhalation Delivery Systemâ¢, an innovative delivery system designed to target the sites where inflammation occurs, especially difficult-to-access sinuses and sinonasal drainage tracts not typically reached by standard-delivery nasal sprays. The safety profile and tolerability of XHANCE for patients in the ReOpen trials was generally consistent with its currently labeled safety profile. The most common adverse reactions (incidence â¥ 3%) in the ReOpen program were epistaxis, headache, and nasopharyngitis.

About XHANCEXHANCEÂ® is a drug-device combination product that uses the Exhalation Delivery Systemâ¢ (also referred to as the EDSÂ®) designed to deliver a topical steroid to the high and deep regions of the nasal cavity where sinuses ventilate and drain. XHANCE is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (with and without nasal polyps) in patients 18 years of age or older. About the ReOpen ProgramThe ReOpen program comprised two global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of one or two sprays of XHANCE in each nostril twice daily, over 24 weeks, in patients suffering from chronic sinusitis. In ReOpen1, the first of the two trials, 332 chronic sinusitis patients either with or without concurrent nasal polyps were treated. In ReOpen2, 222 chronic sinusitis patients who did not have polyps in the nasal cavity were treated. The co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in symptoms, as measured by composite symptom score (nasal congestion, facial pain or pressure, and nasal discharge) at the end of week 4, and change in inflammation inside the sinus cavities, as measured by CT scans (change in the average of the percentages of volume occupied by disease in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses) at week 24. The ReOpen trial program is a landmark research program that included the first ever large, placebo-controlled trials we are aware of to demonstrate that any nasal medication produces significant improvement in both symptoms and inflammation inside the sinuses for patients with chronic sinusitis, regardless of whether or not nasal polyps are present, and to show reduction in the number of acute exacerbations.1 IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to any ingredient in XHANCE. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS: Local nasal adverse reactions, including epistaxis, erosion, ulceration, septal perforation, Candida albicans infection, and impaired wound healing, can occur. Monitor patients periodically for signs of possible changes on the nasal mucosa. Avoid use in patients with recent nasal ulcerations, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma until healing has occurred.Glaucoma and cataracts may occur with long-term use. Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ocular symptoms or use XHANCE long-term.Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, contact dermatitis, rash, hypotension, and bronchospasm) have been reported after administration of fluticasone propionate. Discontinue XHANCE if such reactions occur.Immunosuppression and infections can occur, including potential increased susceptibility to or worsening of infections (e.g., existing tuberculosis; fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection; ocular herpes simplex). Use with caution in patients with these infections. More serious or even fatal course of chickenpox or measles can occur in susceptible patients.Hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may occur with very high dosages or at the regular dosage in susceptible individuals. If such changes occur, discontinue XHANCE slowly.Assess for decrease in bone mineral density initially and periodically thereafter. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps: The most common adverse reactions (incidence â¥3%) are epistaxis, headache, and nasopharyngitis.Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps: The most common adverse reactions (incidence â¥3%) are epistaxis, nasal septal ulceration, nasopharyngitis, nasal mucosal erythema, nasal mucosal ulcerations, nasal congestion, acute sinusitis, nasal septal erythema, headache, and pharyngitis. DRUG INTERACTIONS: Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole): Use not recommended. May increase risk of systemic corticosteroid effects.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS: Hepatic impairment. Monitor patients for signs of increased drug exposure.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The liquidation of the Subversive Decarbonization ETF, Subversive Food Security ETF and Subversive Mental Health ETF represents a significant strategic shift for Subversive Capital Advisor LLC. This decision likely stems from a comprehensive analysis of fund performance, investor demand and market trends. In the ETF space, competition is fierce and investor preferences often gravitate towards funds with a proven track record or lower fees.From an investment perspective, the liquidation may impact the market by altering the availability of niche investment products. Investors seeking exposure to these specific emerging sectors will have to look elsewhere, potentially affecting the sectors' capital inflow. For the company, the liquidation could result in a temporary decrease in assets under management, which may affect revenue. However, this move might also free up resources to focus on more profitable or promising areas.Regarding the timing, the announcement provides a clear deadline for investors to exit positions, which could lead to increased trading volume as the date approaches. The mention of customary brokerage charges and tax implications suggests that investors should plan their exit strategy carefully to minimize financial impact. Tax Advisor The liquidation of these ETFs necessitates a closer look at the tax consequences for shareholders. The automatic redemption of shares for cash will trigger a taxable event. If shareholders have gains on their investments, they will incur capital gains taxes. Conversely, if they're at a loss, they may be able to use those losses to offset other gains.It's important for shareholders to consult with tax professionals to understand the specific implications, such as whether the gains are considered short-term or long-term, which are taxed at different rates. Additionally, shareholders may need advice on tax-loss harvesting strategies if applicable. The timing of the liquidation, being within the same tax year, simplifies the tax reporting process but does not diminish the importance of understanding the tax impact.Shareholders should also be aware of any potential state-level tax consequences, which can vary and add another layer of complexity to their tax situation. This event underscores the importance of tax planning as an integral part of investment decision-making. Market Research Analyst The decision to liquidate these ETFs sheds light on the broader market trends within the ETF industry. It indicates that while there is interest in mission-driven investment strategies, such as those focused on decarbonization, food security and mental health, the demand within the US market is not strong enough to sustain these funds. This could point to a larger trend of investors favoring traditional, broad-market ETFs or those with longer track records.The liquidation also highlights the challenges faced by new and niche ETFs in gathering assets. It's essential for ETF providers to have a clear value proposition and marketing strategy to attract and retain investors. The case of Subversive Capital Advisor LLC might prompt other ETF providers to reassess their offerings, especially those with lower assets under management or those that cater to very specific or emerging sectors.Long-term, this could lead to a consolidation in the ETF market, with fewer but larger funds dominating the landscape. This might benefit investors by reducing complexity and potentially leading to more competitive fees, but it could also limit the diversity of investment options available. 03/15/2024 - 07:01 PM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Subversive Capital Advisor LLC (the ""Advisor"" or the ""Company""), a Registered Investment Advisor primarily focused on different mission-driven emerging sectors, announced today that it has recommended, and the Board of Trustees of Series Portfolios Trust (the ""Trust"") has approved, the termination and liquidation of the Subversive Decarbonization ETF (""DKRB""), Subversive Food Security ETF (""KCAL""), and Subversive Mental Health ETF (""SANE""), collectively (the ""Funds"") effective immediately after the close of business on March 28, 2024.

Cooper. Each Fund's last day of trading will be March 27, 2024, which will also be the final day for creation unit orders by authorized participants.

FDA review ongoing with no set action date yet.,"FDA Advisory Committee Votes in Favor of Bristol Myers Squibbâs and 2seventy bioâs Abecma for Triple-Class Exposed Multiple Myeloma in Earlier Lines of Therapy Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio announced positive FDA committee vote for Abecma in multiple myeloma treatment. Abecma's favorable benefit/risk profile was recognized based on KarMMa-3 study results. FDA review ongoing with no set action date yet. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent vote by the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) in favor of Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) for multiple myeloma patients is a significant development in cancer treatment. As an oncologist, the potential of CAR T cell therapies like Abecma represents a noteworthy advancement, particularly for triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, a patient group that traditionally has limited treatment options and poor prognoses.The endorsement by ODAC, based on the Phase 3 KarMMa-3 study, underscores the therapy's efficacy and safety profile, which could result in improved survival rates for these patients. The clinical implications are profound, as earlier access to such therapies could alter treatment algorithms and patient outcomes significantly. However, it's essential to monitor post-approval for real-world effectiveness and manage expectations around accessibility and cost. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the positive ODAC vote and subsequent approvals in Japan and Switzerland enhance Bristol Myers Squibb's and 2seventy bio's market positioning. The expansion of Abecma's indications could potentially increase its market share in the oncology segment, especially given the lack of effective standard care for this patient population.Investors should note the potential for increased revenue streams for the companies involved, but also consider the broader market dynamics, including competition from other emerging therapies and the complex pricing landscape of CAR T cell treatments. The long-term financial impact will hinge on the FDA's final decision, reimbursement policies and the drug's adoption rate by healthcare providers. Medical Research Analyst The clinical data from the KarMMa-3 study, which supports the sBLA for Abecma, is pivotal in understanding the drug's value proposition. The focus on overall survival as a key secondary endpoint is particularly relevant, as it directly relates to a patient's quality of life and long-term prognosis.Analyzing the data, it's clear that the therapy could be a game-changer for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. The research community will be keen on post-marketing studies that could further validate the treatment's effectiveness and safety profile, which in turn could influence future research and development in the field of hematology-oncology. 03/15/2024 - 06:27 PM The supplemental Biologics License Application for Abecma in this indication remains under review with the FDA; Abecma has been approved in Japan and Switzerland and received a positive CHMP Opinion by the European Medicines Agency based on KarMMa-3 PRINCETON, N.J. & CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and 2seventy bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSVT) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted positively (8-3) that Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 KarMMa-3 study, including the key secondary endpoint of overall survival. The recommendation from the ODAC will be considered by the FDA during its ongoing review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Abecma for this patient population. The FDA has not yet assigned a new target action date for review of the sBLA. âWe are extremely pleased with the positive outcome of the ODAC meeting, which recognizes the favorable benefit/risk profile of Abecma, and based on results from the KarMMa-3 study, we are confident in the significant clinical benefit that Abecma delivers for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, an incurable disease with no clear effective standard of care in earlier lines of therapy,â said Anne Kerber, senior vice president, head of Late Clinical Development, Hematology, Oncology and Cell Therapy, Bristol Myers Squibb. âWe look forward to working with the FDA as it completes review of our sBLA in order to bring this potentially transformative therapy to more patients in need.â âThe favorable and supportive outcome of the ODAC meeting brings us another step closer to expanding the benefits of Abecma to myeloma patients earlier in their treatment course,â said Anna Truppel-Hartmann, senior vice president, Clinical Research and Development, 2seventy bio. âWe believe in the strength of the KarMMa-3 data and remain committed to increasing treatment options and improving outcomes for patients living with multiple myeloma.â The positive vote from the ODAC followed discussion of the interim overall survival data from the KarMMa-3 study which was presented at the 2023 American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2023. âWith patients becoming triple-class exposed earlier in the multiple myeloma treatment paradigm, it is critical that new treatment options with the potential to improve long-term outcomes are available as early as possible,â said Sagar Lonial, MD, FACP, professor and chair, Department of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, chief medical officer, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. âWe are thankful that todayâs ODAC vote recognizes this unmet need and helps to advance ide-cel, a novel treatment option with demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit, for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.â Abecma was recently approved in Japan and Switzerland for patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody based on the KarMMa-3 study, making it the first CAR T cell therapy to receive regulatory approval for use in earlier lines of therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Abecma also received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the extension of indication to include the treatment of patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after at least two prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. About Abecma Abecma is a CAR T cell therapy that recognizes and binds to the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. Abecma is the first-in-class BCMA-directed CAR T cell immunotherapy approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Please see the Important Safety Information section below, including Boxed WARNINGS for Abecma regarding CRS, neurologic toxicities, Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome and Prolonged Cytopenia. Abecma is being jointly developed and commercialized in the U.S. as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion, and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio. Abecma is also approved in the European Union, Switzerland, Japan, the United Kingdom and Israel for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after three to four or more prior lines of therapy. Bristol Myers Squibb assumes sole responsibility for Abecma drug product manufacturing and commercialization outside of the U.S. The companiesâ broad clinical development program for Abecma includes ongoing and planned clinical studies (KarMMa-2, KarMMa-9) for patients with multiple myeloma. For more information visit clinicaltrials.gov. U.S. Important Safety Information BOXED WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, AND PROLONGED CYTOPENIA Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. Do not administer ABECMA to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Neurologic Toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA, including concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with ABECMA. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS) including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with ABECMA. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities. Prolonged Cytopenia with bleeding and infection, including fatal outcomes following stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA in 85% (108/127) of patients. Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in 9% (12/127) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in one (0.8%) patient. The median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 - 23 days) and the median duration of CRS was 7 days (range: 1 - 63 days). The most common manifestations included pyrexia, hypotension, tachycardia, chills, hypoxia, fatigue, and headache. Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and HLH/MAS. Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. Fifty four percent (68/127) of patients received tocilizumab (single dose: 35%; more than 1 dose: 18%). Overall, 15% (19/127) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. All patients that received corticosteroids for CRS received tocilizumab. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of CRS and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. Neurologic Toxicities: Neurologic toxicities, which may be severe or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with ABECMA in 28% (36/127) of patients receiving ABECMA, including Grade 3 in 4% (5/127) of patients. One patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 - 42 days). CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 92% (33/36) of patients with a median time to resolution of 5 days (range: 1 - 61 days). The median duration of neurotoxicity was 6 days (range: 1 - 578) in all patients including 3 patients with ongoing neurotoxicity. Thirty-four patients with neurotoxicity had CRS with onset in 3 patients before, 29 patients during, and 2 patients after CRS. The most frequently reported manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy, tremor, aphasia, and delirium. Grade 4 neurotoxicity and cerebral edema in 1 patient, Grade 3 myelitis, and Grade 3 parkinsonism have been reported with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma. Monitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion and treat promptly. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): HLH/MAS occurred in 4% (5/127) of patients receiving ABECMA. One patient developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS and another patient developed fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with contributory HLH/MAS. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA with a median onset of 7 days (range: 4 - 9 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Two patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and cytopenia. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines. ABECMA REMS: Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at www.AbecmaREMS.com or 1-888-423-5436. Hypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA. Infections: ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 70% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 23% of patients. Overall, 4 patients had Grade 5 infections (3%); 2 patients (1.6%) had Grade 5 events of pneumonia, 1 patient (0.8%) had Grade 5 bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and 1 patient (0.8%) had cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 16% (20/127) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care. Viral Reactivation: CMV infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Prolonged Cytopenias: In the clinical study, 41% of patients (52/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 49% (62/127) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. In 83% (43/52) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 65% (40/62) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 2.1 months. Three patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. Two of the three patients died from complications of prolonged cytopenia. Monitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support. Hypogammaglobulinemia: Hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 21% (27/127) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dl after infusion in 25% (32/127) of patients treated with ABECMA. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dl. Manage appropriately per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or after ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA. Secondary Malignancies: Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. If a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-888-805-4555 to obtain instructions on patient samples to collect for testing of secondary malignancy of T cell origin. Effects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Due to the potential for neurologic events, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period. Adverse Reactions: The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions include CRS, infections â pathogen unspecified, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, hypogammaglobulinemia, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, viral infections, encephalopathy, edema, pyrexia, cough, headache, and decreased appetite.

Market Research Analyst The recent conclusion of the MOGO Collegiate Championship by Mobile Global Esports Inc. (NASDAQ: MGAM) represents a significant event in the Indian esports sector. The involvement of over 500 players from more than 200 universities highlights the deep penetration of esports into the Indian youth demographic. The prize pool of Rs 3 Lakh, while not monumental, is indicative of growing corporate sponsorships in this space.Esports is a rapidly expanding industry globally and India's large and youthful population presents a ripe market for growth. The participation of top players and the live streaming of matches on YouTube suggest that MOGO is effectively leveraging digital platforms to engage with a wider audience. This strategy could lead to increased brand recognition and potentially attract further investment into the company.Furthermore, the promise of contracts for top players in the Valorant collegiate championship and the creation of the Mogo Winfinity League, an IPL-style Esports league, indicate a structured approach to professionalizing esports in India. This could have a ripple effect on the industry, leading to more structured investments and potentially driving up the company's stock as it becomes a more significant player in the esports domain. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the successful execution of the MOGO Collegiate Championship by Mobile Global Esports could be a positive signal to investors. Esports is a high-growth industry and MOGO's positioning as a leading organization within India's esports landscape could enhance its attractiveness to investors seeking exposure to this market.While the direct financial impact of the championship's prize pool is limited, the strategic implications are broader. The event serves as a marketing tool that could drive user engagement and increase the viewership base, which in turn can be monetized through advertising and sponsorships. The involvement of top esports casters and the live streaming of events are likely to improve viewer experience and retention, which are key metrics for attracting advertising revenue.The company's stock performance may benefit from these developments if they translate into higher revenue streams or if they indicate a potential for market leadership. However, investors should consider the competitive landscape and regulatory environment, as well as the company's ability to sustain and scale such initiatives in the long term. Esports Industry Analyst Looking at the broader esports ecosystem, the MOGO Collegiate Championship and the upcoming Mogo Winfinity League represent a strategic move to formalize and institutionalize esports in India. The transition from casual gaming to structured leagues mirrors the evolution seen in other regions, which has been a precursor to substantial industry growth.Such events serve not only as a platform for talent discovery but also as a means to cultivate a dedicated fan base, which is essential for long-term viability. The attention given to popular games like BGMI and Valorant signals an awareness of market trends and consumer preferences. The potential contracts for top players could lead to the development of a professional career path in esports, which is a key factor in sustaining player and viewer interest.As the industry matures, the impact on MOGO's business could be multifaceted. It could lead to strategic partnerships, merchandising opportunities and increased bargaining power with sponsors and advertisers. These factors could ultimately influence the company's market position and financial health, making it a noteworthy development for stakeholders in the esports industry. 03/15/2024 - 05:38 PM WESTPORT, CT and MUMBAI, INDIA / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Mobile Global Esports Inc.

Financially, the company exceeded production targets, reported revenue growth, and secured a significant investment. Positive Transitioned from reporting under IFRS to U.S. GAAP for full-year 2023 results Produced 6,825 tonnes of black mass in 2023, surpassing 2022 production by 1.5 times Exceeded annual guidance range of 5,500 to 6,500 tonnes Total revenue of $18.3 million in 2023, marking an 11% increase from 2022 Product and recycling revenue of $23.6 million in 2023, a 34% rise from 2022 Received a $75.0 million strategic investment from Glencore Negative None. Financial Analyst The transition from IFRS to U.S. GAAP for the company's financial reporting could be seen as a strategic move to align with U.S. standards, potentially attracting a broader investor base and increasing transparency. The significant production increase to 6,825 tonnes represents operational efficiency and could signal a growing demand for the company's black mass, a key component in battery recycling. This operational milestone, surpassing the upper end of the guidance range, often serves as a positive indicator to investors about the company's capabilities and market positioning.Revenue growth of 11% year-over-year and more notably a 34% increase in product and recycling revenue when excluding non-cash fair value adjustments, suggests a strengthening core business. The exclusion of non-cash items provides a clearer view of operational performance, which is essential for evaluating the company's true growth trajectory. The strategic investment from Glencore not only infuses capital but also could indicate confidence in the company's long-term prospects and may lead to synergistic partnerships. Market Research Analyst The reported figures, particularly the 1.5x increase in production, reflect a growing market for recycled battery materials, driven by the surge in electric vehicle (EV) production and the associated environmental concerns. The company's performance and the strategic investment suggest a favorable outlook for the battery recycling sector. Investors might interpret this as the company gaining a competitive edge in a rapidly expanding industry.Moreover, the investment by a major player like Glencore could imply potential for future collaboration or integration within Glencore's supply chain, which might enhance market reach and operational efficiencies for the company. This development could be a significant differentiator in the competitive landscape, as partnerships and scale become increasingly important in the recycling and materials sector. Economist The reported financial results and strategic investment are reflective of broader economic trends, such as the transition towards sustainable energy and circular economies. The increase in production and revenue indicates that the company is capitalizing on these trends effectively. However, it is important for stakeholders to consider the macroeconomic environment, including commodity prices and regulatory changes that could impact the profitability and sustainability of such operations in the long term.The strategic investment also has implications beyond the immediate cash infusion. It could be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's business model and growth potential, potentially leading to a revaluation of the company's stock. However, investors should be mindful of the risks associated with the volatility of commodity markets and the execution risks of scaling operations. 03/15/2024 - 05:30 PM Highlights Reported full-year 2023 results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, transitioning from IFRS; Produced 6,825 tonnes of black mass and equivalents in 2023, 1.5x 2022 production level and exceeding the top end of annual guidance of 5,500 to 6,500 tonnes provided in November; Posted total revenue of $18.3 million in 2023, a 11% increase over 2022; excluding non-cash fair value pricing adjustments, posted $23.6 million of product and recycling revenue in 2023, a 34% increase over 2022; Announced $75.0 million strategic investment from Glencore; expected closing on or about March 25, 2024; Continuing to work closely with the U.S. Department of Energy on the conditional commitment for a loan of up to $375.0 million; and Hosting a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, March 19, 2024 at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time to provide a business update including a review of financial results. TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LICY) (""Li-Cycle"" or the âCompany""), a leading global lithium-ion battery resource recovery company, today announced financial results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Webcast and Conference Call Information On Tuesday, March 19, 2024, at 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time, Company management will host a webcast and conference call to provide a business update including a review of these results. The related presentation materials for the webcast and conference call will be made available on the investor section of the Li-Cycle website: https://investors.li-cycle.com/overview/default.aspx Investors may listen to the conference call live via audio-only webcast or through the following dial-in numbers: Domestic: (800) 579-2543 International: (203) 518-9814 Participant Code: LICYQ423 Webcast: https://investors.li-cycle.com A replay of the conference call/webcast will also be made available on the Investor Relations section of the Companyâs website at https://investors.li-cycle.com. Financial Reporting Transition to US GAAP from IFRS Li-Cycle previously qualified as a âforeign private issuerâ under applicable U.S. securities laws and on January 1, 2024, became subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to U.S. domestic issuers, including the requirement to report its financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (âU.S. GAAPâ). As a result, Li-Cycleâs annual consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, October 31, 2022, and October 31, 2021 and consolidated financial statements for the two-month period ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Review of Financial Results On December 31, 2022, the Board approved a change of Li-Cycleâs fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31 to better align with peer group companies. The change resulted in a transition period of November 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The Company has calculated the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 and has provided a comparison to the year ended December 31, 2023 below. Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue from product sales and recycling services were $23.6 million, a 34% increase versus the $17.6 million generated in 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher value product sales mix and increased recycling service revenue, partially offset by the reduced market prices of cobalt and nickel. Recycling service revenue increased by 338% year-over-year to $5.7 million, driven by new service contracts. Total revenues were $18.3 million versus $16.5 million in 2022, which included an unfavorable non-cash fair market value (""FMV"") pricing adjustment of $5.3 million versus $1.1 million in the prior year. Cost of sales increased to $81.8 million versus $55.2 million in 2022. Variable and fixed costs related to black mass and shredded metal products sold were $29.1 million, compared to $23.2 million in 2022, due to an increase in raw material acquisition costs and other production costs. Fixed and other costs for the Spoke network expensed were $34.9 million, compared to $16.9 million in 2022 driven by higher Spoke costs including personnel costs, leases, and depreciation. Fixed and other costs for the Rochester Hub expensed as incurred were $7.4 million compared to $2.6 million in 2022. Prior to the construction pause and comprehensive review of the Rochester Hub project, Li-Cycle hired operations personnel and incurred costs in anticipation of the Hub commissioning. The balance of $10.4 million, compared to $12.5 million in 2022, was comprised primarily of overhead costs required for operations. Selling, general & administrative (""SG&A"") expenses increased to $93.4 million versus $81.3 million in 2022, primarily driven by higher personnel costs, insurance costs, IT expenses, professional fees, leases, depreciation, and fixed asset write downs coupled with one-time severance costs resulting from a workforce reduction plan. This was partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation of $6.3 million. Research & development costs increased to $5.7 million versus $2.7 million in 2022 primarily related to personnel costs and professional fees incurred for initial research and development for the Portovesme Hub. Other income was $24.7 million, a decrease of $27.2 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in fair value gains on the revaluations of the conversion feature of our convertible debt. Net loss was approximately $138.0 million, including $22.1 million of fair value gains on financial instruments, compared to $70.8 million in 2022. This was driven by higher cost of sales and SG&A partially offset by higher revenue. Adjusted EBITDA1 loss was approximately $156.4 million, compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $118.5 million in 2022. This was largely driven by higher cost of sales and SG&A related to the growth and expansion of the business. The primary difference between Adjusted EBITDA and net loss is the exclusion of fair value gains and losses on financial instruments. Balance Sheet Position As of December 31, 2023, Li-Cycle had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $70.6 million. The Company incurred capital expenditures of $334.9 million in the period, primarily comprising purchases of equipment and construction related activities for the Rochester Hub project and the Germany Spoke in addition to net cash outflows for operating activities of $99.8 million. The Companyâs primary need for liquidity is to fund the working capital requirements of its business during its comprehensive review of the Rochester Hub project and go-forward strategy in addition to funding the projectâs existing and remaining capital commitments. Exemption from Filing Restated Interim Financial Reports Pursuant to subsection 4.3(4) of National Instrument 51-102 â Continuous Disclosure Obligations (âNI 51-102â), in connection with filing its annual financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Li-Cycle is also required to file with the Ontario Securities Commission restated interim financial reports under U.S. GAAP for the 2023 interim periods (the âRestated Interim Financial Reportsâ). Li-Cycle was granted an exemption from the Ontario Securities Commission providing Li-Cycle with an additional 45 days to file the Restated Interim Financial Reports from the deadline otherwise applicable under NI 51-102. Li-Cycle anticipates filing the Restated Interim Financial Reports and related MD&As on or before April 29, 2024.

Li-Cycle reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âU.S. GAAPâ). The Company makes references to certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA (loss). These measures are not recognized measures under U.S. GAAP, do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those U.S. GAAP measures by providing a further understanding of the Companyâs results of operations from managementâs perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the analysis of the Companyâs financial information reported under U.S. GAAP. Li-Cycle defines adjusted EBITDA (loss) as earnings (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense (income), income tax expense (recovery), and fair value (gain) loss on financial instruments.

Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs are a signal to the market about a company's liquidity and confidence in its own stock. Millicom's recent activity, where they repurchased a specific number of SDRs, indicates a strategic move to manage capital structure and potentially boost shareholder value. The repurchase at varying prices over several days reflects both market conditions and the company's approach to timing their buybacks. Investors often view repurchase activities as a positive sign, as it may suggest that the company believes the stock is undervalued.However, it is essential to consider the overall impact on the company's financial health. The repurchase uses the company's cash reserves, which could have been allocated to other growth opportunities or debt reduction. The long-term benefits of such programs depend on the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow to offset the cost of these buybacks. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the key figures to analyze in Millicom's share repurchase are the total repurchase amount and the average price paid. These details offer insights into the company's capital allocation decisions. Investors should look at the repurchase in the context of the company's overall market capitalization and compare it to the industry average to gauge the scale of the buyback.Additionally, the repurchase's effect on earnings per share (EPS) is noteworthy. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, EPS may increase, which can be attractive to investors. However, it's important to scrutinize whether this EPS growth is supported by actual operational performance or merely a financial engineering effect. Legal Expert The execution of Millicom's share repurchase program within the bounds of Article 5 of MAR and the Safe Harbour Regulation is crucial. These regulations are designed to prevent market abuse and ensure transparency in financial transactions. Compliance with these rules is important for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal repercussions. Investors should be reassured by Millicom's adherence to these regulations, as it reflects the company's commitment to lawful and ethical business practices. 03/15/2024 - 05:30 PM Millicom (Tigo) share repurchase activity Luxembourg, March 15, 2024 â Pursuant to the share repurchase program announced on December 15, 2023, Millicom repurchased 30,128 of its Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs) between March 11, 2024 and March 15, 2024, as detailed in the table below.

However, there was an increase in book value and book value per share. The company's President and CEO, Duncan Bates, is optimistic about the future despite the challenges faced in 2023. Positive None. Negative Net revenue, income from operations, net income, and basic earnings per share decreased in 2023 compared to 2022. Market Research Analyst The reported decrease in net revenue for Legacy Housing Corporation points to a contraction in sales or output, which is significant considering the 26.4% year-over-year decline. This drop is indicative of a potential market retraction or increased competition. Investors may interpret this as a red flag, warranting a closer look at the company's market strategy and competitive positioning. Despite the revenue downturn, the increase in book value suggests a solid asset base, which could be a buffer in challenging times. However, the growth in book value must be analyzed in context with the revenue decline to understand the underlying asset efficiency and potential for future earnings. Financial Analyst Legacy's earnings per share (EPS) decline is a critical metric for shareholders, reflecting a direct impact on shareholder value. A 19.7% decrease in EPS is substantial and may affect investor confidence and stock valuation. On the other hand, the company's ability to manage expenses and increase book value per share amidst declining revenues could signal strong operational control and potential for margin improvement. Investors should weigh the short-term earnings dip against the long-term asset growth to assess the company's financial health and sustainability. Economist The financial results of Legacy Housing Corporation might be reflecting broader economic trends such as a slowdown in the housing market or shifts in consumer spending. The management's note on improving market conditions for 2024 could indicate an expected economic recovery or a response to strategic changes within the company. It is important for stakeholders to consider macroeconomic indicators alongside the company's performance to gauge the potential for rebound or continued struggle. The interplay between the company's internal strategies and external economic forces will be important in determining its trajectory. 03/15/2024 - 05:25 PM BEDFORD, Texas, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Legacy Housing Corporation (the ""Companyâ or âLegacy"", NASDAQ: LEGH) today announced its financial results for the full year end December 31, 2023.

Management CommentaryâI'm incredibly proud of our performance in 2023, highlighted by key wins across all aspects of the business,"" said George Archos, Verano Founder and Chief Executive Officer. ""As excitement and anticipation builds in the industry, 2024 has the potential to be a game-changing year, and Verano is well positioned to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities both in the current regulatory environment and from any state or federal reform. While weâve never been dependent on legislation to drive sustained growth, with adult use imminent in Ohio, on the horizon in Florida and Pennsylvania, and the growing anticipation of a federal rescheduling decision, there is limitless potential for Verano. Iâm thankful for all that our team accomplished in 2023, and believe the sky is the limit for what we can achieve in 2024 and beyond.â Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial OverviewRevenue for the fourth quarter 2023 was $237 million, up 5% from $226 million for the fourth quarter 2022, and down 1% from $240 million for the third quarter 2023. The increase in revenue for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the fourth quarter 2022 was driven primarily by strength from wholesale adult use sales in New Jersey, in addition to growth in Maryland and Florida retail. Gross profit for the fourth quarter 2023 was $118 million or 50% of revenue, up from $103 million or 46% of revenue for the fourth quarter 2022, and down from $133 million or 55% of revenue for the third quarter 2023. The increase in gross profit for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the fourth quarter 2022 was driven primarily by increased vertical mix and revenue growth. SG&A expense for the fourth quarter 2023 was $86 million or 36% of revenue, up from $81 million or 36% of revenue for the fourth quarter 2022, and flat with $86 million or 36% of revenue for the third quarter 2023.

The decrease in net loss for the fourth quarter 2023 compared to the fourth quarter 2022 was due to a $229 million impairment charge in the prior year period. Excluding the impacts from impairments, net loss for the fourth quarter 2023 was primarily driven by the increase in provision for income taxes as the Company increased income from operations versus the fourth quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA2 for the fourth quarter 2023 was $73 million or 31% of revenue. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter 2023 was $32 million, up from $29 million for the fourth quarter 2022.

The increase in gross profit for full year 2023 compared to full year 2022 was driven primarily by increased vertical mix and revenue growth. SG&A expense for full year 2023 was $332 million or 35% of revenue, down from $357 million or 41% of revenue for full year 2022. The decrease in SG&A expense was driven primarily by a decrease in stock based compensation.

The decrease in net loss for full year 2023 compared to the full year 2022 was due to a $229 million impairment charge in the prior year period.

It is derived from U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, which is also its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, and is defined in this news release in the section below titled âNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.â The reconciliation of free cash flow to U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities is set forth below in the tables included in this news release.2 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. It is derived from EBITDA, another non-U.S. GAAP financial measure, and is defined in this news release in the section below titled âNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.â The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to U.S. GAAP net income (loss) is set forth below in the tables included in this news release. Non-U.S. GAAP Financial MeasuresVerano uses non-U.S. GAAP financial information to evaluate the performance of the Company. The terms âEBIT,â âEBITDA,â âadjusted EBITDA,â and âfree cash flowâ do not have any standardized meaning prescribed within U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, this non-U.S. GAAP financial information is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company calculates EBIT as net income (loss) before interest expense and income tax expense; EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization; adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and also excludes certain one-time extraordinary items; and free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. The calculations of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures used in this news release and the reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial numbers are included in the tables below. Management believes that this non-U.S. GAAP financial information is useful as a supplement to comparable U.S. GAAP financial information because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP information to supplement their GAAP results. Management reviews these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures on a regular basis and uses them, together with financial measures included in the Companyâs financial statements, to evaluate and manage the performance of the Companyâs operations. These measures should be evaluated only in conjunction with the comparable U.S. GAAP financial numbers reported by the Company. About VeranoVerano Holdings Corp.

"RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. Announces Non-Transferable Rights Offering",2024-03-15T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (RSF) announces a rights offering to purchase additional shares of common stock.

Announces Non-Transferable Rights Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (RSF) announces a rights offering to purchase additional shares of common stock. The offering will issue non-transferable rights to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2024, allowing the purchase of new shares at a subscription price determined by net asset value or market price. The subscription period expires on April 22, 2024. The Fund aims for a high level of current income and had approximately $56.9 million of net assets and 3.4 million shares outstanding as of February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund regarding a rights offering to existing shareholders presents a strategic capital raising initiative. This move allows the fund to potentially increase its net asset value by issuing new shares at a discount to either the net asset value or market price, whichever is higher. The decision to offer the rights non-transferable ensures that current shareholders are the ones who benefit, potentially reducing the dilutive effect on their holdings.From a financial perspective, the offering price set at 90% of the net asset value or 95% of the market price is designed to incentivize participation while maintaining value for the existing shareholders. Investors should note that the new shares will not be entitled to distributions for March or April 2024, which could influence the timing of their investment decisions. The possibility of an over-subscription and the proportional allocation of additional shares add an element of potential upside for participating investors.It is also important to consider the Fund's performance and investment strategy, particularly its focus on high current income and investments in Alternative Credit Instruments, which carry a high degree of risk. The Fund's closed-end structure and secondary market trading can lead to price discrepancies between the market value and net asset value, which investors should monitor closely. Market Research Analyst The rights offering by RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund can have implications for market dynamics, particularly for the closed-end fund sector. The fund's choice of a rights offering, a relatively less common method of capital raising compared to secondary public offerings, suggests a targeted approach to raise funds while attempting to minimize shareholder dilution and maintain stock liquidity.Investors and market participants should be attentive to the fund's net asset value and market price leading up to the expiration of the rights offering, as these will determine the subscription price. The market's reaction to the rights offering could influence the fund's share price volatility in the short term. Additionally, the fund's ability to increase the number of shares offered by up to 100% provides flexibility in capital raising, which could be a response to investor demand or market conditions.The closed-end fund's performance is subject to interest rate fluctuations and general economic conditions, which are particularly relevant given the current environment of rising interest rates. This could affect the attractiveness of the offering and the fund's future income-generating capabilities. Legal Expert The rights offering is subject to regulatory compliance and RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund's adherence to SEC regulations is crucial. The offering is made under an effective shelf registration statement, which allows for a more expedited process. However, the final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus must be filed and disseminated to potential investors for the offering to proceed legally.Investors should be aware that the rights offering is non-transferable, which has legal implications for their liquidity and tradability. Additionally, the lack of entitlement to distributions for the first two months post-issuance may have contractual implications that should be reviewed in the prospectus supplement.The legal structure of investments in Alternative Credit Instruments is complex and the Fund's limited recourse in the event of borrower default should be a consideration for risk assessment. The disclosure that platforms generally do not verify borrower information underscores the importance of legal due diligence in understanding the risks associated with these investments. 03/15/2024 - 05:00 PM WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: RSF) (the âFundâ) announces that its Board of Directors (the âBoardâ) has authorized and set the terms of an offering to the Fundâs stockholders of rights to purchase additional shares of common stock of the Fund. In this offering, the Fund will issue non-transferable rights (the âRightsâ) to its stockholders of record as of April 1, 2024 (the âRecord Dateâ and such stockholders, âRecord Date Stockholdersâ) allowing the holder to subscribe for new shares of common stock of the Fund (the âPrimary Subscriptionâ). Record Date Stockholders will receive one Right for each share of common stock held on the Record Date. For every three Rights held, a holder of Rights may buy one new share of common stock of the Fund. The number of Rights to be issued to a Record Date Stockholder will be rounded up to the nearest number of Rights evenly divisible by three. Fractional shares will not be issued upon the exercise of the Rights. Accordingly, new Common Shares may be purchased only pursuant to the exercise of Rights in integral multiples of three. Record Date Stockholders who exercise their Rights will not be entitled to distributions payable during March or April 2024 on shares issued in connection with the rights offering, but they will be entitled to distributions payable during May 2024 on these shares. Record Date stockholders who fully exercise their Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional shares of common stock (âOver-Subscription Sharesâ), subject to the limitations set forth in the prospectus supplement. The Over-Subscription Shares will be allocated pro rata to stockholders who over-subscribe based on the number of Rights originally issued to them. The Fund may increase the number of shares of common stock subject to subscription by up to 100% of the shares available pursuant to the Primary Subscription. The Rights are non-transferrable and, therefore, may not be purchased or sold. The shares of common stock issued pursuant to the rights offering will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ) under the ticker: RSF. The subscription price per share of common stock will be determined based upon a formula equal to 90% of the reported net asset value or 95% of the market price per share of common stock, whichever is higher on the Expiration Date (as defined below). Market price per share of common stock will be determined based on the average of the last reported sales price of a share of common stock on the NYSE for the five trading days preceding (and not including) the Expiration Date. The subscription period will expire on April 22, 2024, unless extended by the Board (the âExpiration Dateâ). The rights offering will be made pursuant to the Fundâs currently effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ) and only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus. A final prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus will be filed with the SEC but has not been filed as of the date of this release. The Company expects to mail subscription certificates evidencing the subscription rights and a copy of the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus for the rights offering shortly following the Record Date. The securities described in this release may not be sold nor may offers to purchase be accepted prior to the time the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus are filed with the SEC. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy. RiverNorth Capital and Income Fund, Inc. The investment objective of the Fund is to seek a high level of current income. Fund had approximately $56.9 million of net assets and 3.4 million shares of common stock outstanding as of February 29, 2024. The Fund is a closed-end fund and does not continuously issue stock for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell stock need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market value. Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in any investment company security involves risk, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before investing in the shares of common stock, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in the prospectus, annual report, and semi-annual report. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. See the Prospectus for a more detailed description of Fund risks. The profitability of specialty finance and other financial companies is largely dependent upon the availability and cost of capital funds and may fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates, as well as changes in general economic conditions. If the borrower of Alternative Credit (as defined below) in which the Fund invests is unable to make its payments on a loan, the Fund may be greatly limited in its ability to recover any outstanding principal and interest under such loan, as (among other reasons) the Fund may not have direct recourse against the borrower or may otherwise be limited in its ability to directly enforce its rights under the loan, whether through the borrower or the platform through which such loan was originated, the loan may be unsecured or under collateralized, and/or it may be impracticable to commence a legal proceeding against the defaulting borrower. Substantially all of the Alternative Credit in which the Fund invests will not be guaranteed or insured by a third party. In addition, the Alternative Credit Instruments in which the Fund may invest will not be backed by any governmental authority. Prospective borrowers supply a variety of information regarding the purpose of the loan, income, occupation, and employment status (as applicable) to the lending platforms. As a general matter, platforms do not verify the majority of this information, which may be incomplete, inaccurate, false, or misleading. Prospective borrowers may misrepresent any of the information they provide to the platforms, including their intentions for the use of the loan proceeds. Alternative Credit Instruments are generally not rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (âNRSROsâ). Such unrated instruments, however, are considered to be comparable in quality to securities falling into any of the ratings categories used by such NRSROs to classify ""junk"" bonds (i.e., below investment grade securities). Accordingly, the Fundâs unrated Alternative Credit Instrument investments constitute highly risky and speculative investments similar to investments in âjunkâ bonds, notwithstanding that the Fund is not permitted to invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment. Although the Fund is not permitted to invest in loans that are of subprime quality at the time of investment, an investment in the Fundâs Shares should be considered speculative and involving a high degree of risk, including the risk of loss of investment. There can be no assurance that payments due on underlying loans, including Alternative Credit, will be made. Diversification does not ensure a profit or a guarantee against loss. The Fundâs investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The Fundâs prospectus and most recent periodic reports contain this and other important information about the investment company and may be obtained by visiting rivernorth.com/literature or by calling 844.569.4750.

Positive progress in Phase 3 clinical studies for various treatments. Renegotiation of LSA agreement and cost improvements for future growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Biofrontera Inc. show a significant increase in total revenues, which is a positive indicator for investors, reflecting a growing demand for the company's dermatological products. The 19% revenue growth year-over-year is a strong signal of the company's market penetration and effectiveness of its sales and marketing strategies. However, the increase in total operating expenses, particularly the $2.0M in one-time legal expenses, presents a concern as it impacts the net profitability of the company. The restructured organization, designed to reduce operating expenses, demonstrates prudent management which should be closely monitored for its effectiveness in the following quarters.The strategic account strategy and the sNDA submission for Ameluz are notable for potentially solidifying the company's competitive position and expanding its market share. The renegotiation of the LSA agreement to reduce the transfer price of Ameluz is a significant move to improve cost management, which may positively impact future margins and profitability. The shift to in-house management of US clinical trials could streamline operations and expedite FDA approvals, potentially enhancing the company's ability to bring new products to market more efficiently. Medical Research Analyst The FDA approval for an improved formulation of Ameluz without propylene glycol and the progress in clinical studies for sBCC and AK treatment, are pivotal developments for Biofrontera. These advancements not only enhance the company's product portfolio but also demonstrate its commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in dermatology. The increased maximum use of Ameluz and the development of a new portable PDT lamp could lead to broader therapeutic applications and increased accessibility for patients, potentially driving future sales growth.However, it is critical to consider the PDUFA date set for October 2024, as any delays or negative outcomes could impact investor expectations and the company's stock performance. The successful completion of patient enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical study is a step forward, but the actual market impact will depend on the study results and subsequent regulatory approvals. Market Research Analyst The dermatological market is highly competitive and Biofrontera's focus on expanding its medical and reimbursement teams could enhance its ability to meet the needs of dermatologists and patients, potentially leading to increased market share. The record placement of RhodoLED lamps indicates a growing acceptance of the company's photodynamic therapy system, which could translate into higher recurrent revenues from the sale of Ameluz tubes used with these lamps.Investors should consider the long-term benefits of the company's strategic moves, such as the patent acquisitions and R&D agreements for new PDT technology, as these could open up additional revenue streams and partnerships. The emphasis on cost optimization and the pursuit of break-even status are essential for financial sustainability and could be a deciding factor in the company's ability to continue its growth trajectory without the need for significant additional capital. 03/15/2024 - 04:56 PM Conference call begins at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on Monday, March 18, 2024WOBURN, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Biofrontera, Inc.

Approximately, $2.0M of this increase was driven by one-time legal expenses.Achieved 4% increase in revenues for fourth quarter 2023 compared with 2022 despite more than doubling sales in third quarter.Restructured organization to align with business needs including expanding medical and reimbursement teams, contributing to 8% decrease in operating expenses for fourth quarter 2023 compared to 2022.Initiated a comprehensive strategic account strategy leading to deeper partnerships and multiple annual contracts.Submitted sNDA to increase maximum use to 3 tubes of AmeluzÂ® in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) on the face and scalp with photodynamic therapy (PDT) using the RhodoLEDÂ® XL lamp with PDUFA date of October 4, 2024.Completed patient enrollment in Phase 3 clinical study evaluating AmeluzÂ®-PDT with BF-RhodoLEDÂ® lamp for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (sBCC).Received approval from the FDA, through our partner Biofrontera Biosciences GmbH, for an improved formulation of AmeluzÂ® without propylene glycol.Acquired patents and entered into an R&D agreement to develop a new, low-cost portable photodynamic therapy lamp for use with AmeluzÂ®.Announced first patient dosing in Phase 3 multicenter clinical study of safety and efficacy of AmeluzÂ® and RhodoLEDÂ® XL for treatment of AK on the extremities, neck and trunk.""I am pleased to announce 2023 was a record year for revenues,"" said Hermann Luebbert, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Biofrontera. ""Our strategy as I took over as CEO in 2023 was to focus on holistic sales and marketing that included continuing to have a strong sales organization and strengthening our medical and reimbursement capabilities so we can provide dermatologists with the most effective support. Our sales growth reflects the strength and commitment of our organization and the partnerships we have.We have also made progress in key areas in the early part of 2024 to position ourselves for future success. The restructuring of our LSA agreement with our supplier, Biofrontera GmbH, to reduce the transfer price of Ameluz to 25% for 2024 and 2025 will allow us to manage our costs more closely, Transferring the management of US clinical trials in-house will lead to greater efficiency and efficacy of these activities, potentially leading to earlier FDA approvals for future indications. We also believe the cost improvements and reallocation of spend made over the last year will allow us to continue to grow while improving the value for our investors.""""We had a strong 2023. We achieved a record high revenue number and sales volume, placed a record number of RhodoLED lamps, cleaned up our balance sheet, and continued to optimize our cost structure. The renegotiation of the LSA and securing of additional capital have been transformational events to our goal toward break even,"" added Fred Leffler, Chief Financial Officer of Biofrontera.Fourth Quarter Financial ResultsTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $10.6 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or ~4%, compared with $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth reflects the continued adoption of Ameluz but was impacted more than anticipated by strong buy-in prior to the price increase at the beginning of the quarter.Total operating expenses were $14.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $15.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. Cost of revenues was $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $5.3 million for the prior-year quarter, driven by higher Ameluz product revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with $10.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, with the decrease primarily driven by lower personnel costs.The net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 improved by $6.3 million to $3.5 million, or $1.65 per share, from a net loss of $2.8 million, or $(2.16) per share, for the prior-year quarter, with all per-share figures on a split-adjusted basis.Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was negative $3.2 million compared with negative $4.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher revenues partially and decreased Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income or loss excluding interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain other non-recurring or non-cash items. We look at this customary metric to better assess and understand the performance of the business. Please refer to the table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.Full Year Financial ResultsTotal revenues for 2023 were $34.1 million compared with $28.7 million for 2022, an increase of approximately 19%, primarily driven by a higher volume of Ameluz sales and a higher average Ameluz selling price.Total operating expenses were $56.7 million for 2023 compared with $47.3 million for 2022. Cost of revenues increased to $17.4 million for 2023 from $15.2 million in 2022 primarily driven by increased Ameluz sales volume. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2023 were $39.1 million compared with $35.9 million for 2022, an increase of about 9% compared with the prior year, primarily driven by personnel-related expenses and higher legal expenses.The net loss for 2023 was $20.1 million, or $(13.02) per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $0.6 million, or $(0.61) per share, for 2022.Adjusted EBITDA was negative $19.5 million for 2023 compared with negative $18.1 million for 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by the commercial team expansion that took place in the first quarter of 2023.

The distribution is not considered effectively connected income for U.S. federal tax purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Granite Real Estate Investment Trust regarding its monthly distribution is a routine declaration for a company operating within the REIT sector. The distribution amount of CDN $0.275 per stapled unit is a figure that investors closely monitor, as it reflects the company's current cash flow and its ability to generate income from its real estate assets. This distribution rate is a key factor in the total return calculation for REIT investors, who typically seek stable and predictable income streams.For stakeholders, the consistency of these distributions can be an indicator of operational stability and financial health. It's important to compare this distribution against historical payouts and industry averages to assess its competitiveness. The confirmation that no portion of the distribution constitutes effectively connected income for U.S. federal tax purposes is also significant for U.S. investors, as it implies that the income may not be subject to certain U.S. taxes, potentially enhancing the after-tax return for these unitholders. Tax Expert The detail regarding U.S. federal tax implications is noteworthy for cross-border investors. Granite's stipulation that the distribution does not constitute effectively connected income under U.S. tax regulations means that non-U.S. entities or individuals will not be subject to U.S. income tax on this distribution, assuming they do not have other U.S. business activities. This is aligned with the United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4, which outlines withholding tax obligations related to distributions made to foreign investors.

CURO Group Holdings Corp. Enters Forbearance Agreement Amendments and Waiver Amendment to Allow for Continued Constructive Discussions with Lenders and Stakeholders,2024-03-15T20:52:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"CURO Group Holdings Corp. announces extension of forbearance agreements and waiver amendment with lenders until March 25, 2024, to address default events under credit agreements.","CURO Group Holdings Corp. Enters Forbearance Agreement Amendments and Waiver Amendment to Allow for Continued Constructive Discussions with Lenders and Stakeholders Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CURO Group Holdings Corp. announces extension of forbearance agreements and waiver amendment with lenders until March 25, 2024, to address default events under credit agreements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The extension of the forbearance agreements and the waiver amendment signifies a important juncture for CURO Group Holdings Corp., as it reflects the company's current liquidity and solvency challenges. The agreement by the lenders to refrain from exercising remedies until March 25, 2024, provides CURO with a temporary reprieve, allowing the company to potentially restructure its debts, seek refinancing options, or improve its operational performance to meet its obligations. This development is particularly significant for investors and creditors, as it may influence the company's credit rating and the value of its bonds. The identical 7.500% interest rate on both the Senior 1.5 Lien Secured Notes and Senior Secured Notes underscores the high-yield nature of these debt instruments, often associated with higher risk and potential for default.Stakeholders should monitor CURO's subsequent financial statements and management discussion for insights into the company's turnaround strategy and operational efficiency improvements. The forbearance period could be a double-edged sword, providing necessary breathing room but potentially leading to further financial strain if the underlying issues are not adequately addressed. Investors may also consider the broader implications for the consumer finance sector, where companies often face high default risks and regulatory challenges. Legal Expert The legal implications of the Amendments to the Forbearance Agreements and the Waiver Amendment are substantial. Forbearance agreements are typically negotiated when a borrower is experiencing financial distress but the creditors believe there is a reasonable prospect of recovery. The terms and conditions attached to such agreements are critical as they often include covenants or milestones the borrower must achieve. Failure to meet these can lead to acceleration of debt repayment or enforcement of security interests.For CURO and its affiliates, the extension until March 25, 2024, provides a shield against immediate legal actions such as foreclosure or seizure of assets. However, this is a temporary measure and does not equate to debt forgiveness. The company's ability to navigate through this period without triggering the terms that would end the forbearance is pivotal. Stakeholders should pay close attention to the full text of the Waiver Amendment as disclosed in the Form 8-K for any additional covenants or conditions that could affect the company's operations or financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CURO's announcement is an indicator of stress within the consumer finance industry, which may be experiencing headwinds such as increased default rates or regulatory pressures. The fact that the company has entered into forbearance agreements suggests a need to closely examine the consumer credit market for similar patterns of distress. The extension of the waiver may have a stabilizing effect on the company's stock in the short term, as it alleviates immediate concerns of default or bankruptcy. However, the long-term market sentiment will likely hinge on CURO's ability to address its financial challenges and the overall health of the consumer finance sector.Investors should consider the potential impact of CURO's situation on similar companies within the industry, as it could signal wider market trends. For instance, if CURO's financial difficulties are symptomatic of a larger credit issue, other consumer finance companies might also be at risk. Conversely, CURO's successful navigation through this period could serve as a positive benchmark for the sector. 03/15/2024 - 04:52 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CURO Group Holdings Corp.

Market Research Analyst POET Technologies Inc.'s recent financial disclosure highlights several strategic financial maneuvers, including equity offerings and partnerships with key industry players. The capital raised through public and private offerings indicates a proactive approach to securing funding in a challenging equity market for smaller tech stocks. The partnership with ZKTel, a supplier to top-tier companies, is a testament to POET's product viability in competitive markets like China.Investors may view these developments as a positive signal of management's confidence in the company's long-term technology projects, such as the 800G module and 200G/lane solutions. The emphasis on AI networks and high-speed communications could position POET favorably in a sector with increasing demand for advanced optical solutions. However, the reliance on equity financing could dilute current shareholders' value, a common concern for investors in growth-phase companies. Financial Analyst The financial results and equity offerings by POET Technologies offer a mixed bag for financial analysis. The gross proceeds of $6.2 million from equity offerings provide a cushion for ongoing R&D and operational costs, which is important for a tech company in the growth stage. However, the offering prices and warrant exercise prices warrant attention, as they may reflect market sentiment about the company's valuation and future prospects.Investors should consider the potential for share price volatility around warrant exercise periods and monitor the company's cash burn rate against the progress in product development and market penetration. The ability to convert technological advancements into revenue-generating products will be key to the company's financial health and stock performance. Technology Industry Analyst The optical communications industry is rapidly evolving, with increasing demand for high-speed data transfer in AI and data center applications. POET Technologies' focus on developing Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) and high-speed optical modules places them at the forefront of a critical technological frontier.The mention of 800G modules and 200G/lane solutions indicates POET's alignment with industry trends towards higher bandwidth capabilities. The upcoming OFC conference could be a pivotal moment for the company to showcase its innovations and potentially secure additional partnerships or customer interest. The success of these products in the market will be a significant determinant of POET's business trajectory and, by extension, its stock performance. 03/15/2024 - 04:51 PM TORONTO, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- POET Technologies Inc.

Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary AMCON Distributing Company (DIT) acquires Burklund Distributors, Inc., expanding its reach to 7,400 locations in 32 states. The acquisition aims to continue the legacy of the third-generation family business and enhance customer service. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Burklund Distributors by AMCON Distributing Company represents a strategic expansion of AMCON's distribution footprint in the consumer products sector. By integrating Burklund's operations, which have a strong regional presence in Illinois, AMCON effectively increases its service locations to approximately 7,400 across 32 states. This move not only enhances AMCON's market penetration but also diversifies its customer base and strengthens its supply chain capabilities.The synergy between AMCON's customer-centered services and Burklund's commitment to community and customer service suggests potential for operational efficiencies and increased customer loyalty. The acquisition could provide AMCON with additional leverage in negotiating with vendors due to increased volume, which may result in better terms and cost savings. However, there are potential risks such as integration challenges and the possibility that anticipated synergies may not materialize as expected.For stakeholders, the acquisition's success will hinge on the effective management of the integration process and the ability to maintain the high level of service that Burklund's customers expect. Over the long term, this expansion could bolster AMCON's competitive position in the market and contribute to revenue growth, provided the transition is managed smoothly and the combined entity can capitalize on the strengths of both companies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition of Burklund by AMCON is a significant event that may influence AMCON's financial metrics and stock valuation. Investors will be closely monitoring the impact of this acquisition on AMCON's revenue growth, profit margins and earnings per share. The deal could lead to economies of scale, potentially improving margins through cost reductions in procurement, logistics and distribution.However, the cost of acquisition and the investments needed for integration will likely affect AMCON's short-term financials. It is important for investors to consider the acquisition price, funding methods and any debt incurred, as these factors will influence the company's balance sheet and liquidity position. Additionally, if the integration process encounters difficulties, it could lead to unexpected costs and disruptions that might negatively impact financial performance.Investors should also assess the cultural fit between the two companies and the potential for retaining key personnel from Burklund, as these elements can significantly affect the success of the merger and, consequently, the long-term financial outlook for AMCON. 03/15/2024 - 04:50 PM OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMCON Distributing Company (âAMCONâ) (NYSE American: DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska-based consumer products company is pleased to announce the acquisition of Burklund Distributors, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures In this release, the Company presents certain financial measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). Specifically, the Company is presenting distributable earnings, which constitutes a non-GAAP financial measure within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K and is net income under GAAP. While we believe the non-GAAP information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing our results, and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. The methods of calculating non-GAAP financial measures may differ substantially from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Distributable Earnings Distributable Earnings is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as GAAP net income (loss) attributable to holders of common stock computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation, (ii) depreciation and amortization, (iii) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for that applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss) or net income (loss), and (iv) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items after discussions with the Company's board of directors and approved by a majority of the Company's independent directors. Distributable Earnings mirrors how we calculate Core Earnings pursuant to the terms of our management agreement between our manager Lument Investment Management, LLC (""Manager"") and us, or our management agreement, for purposes of calculating the incentive fee payable to our Manager. While Distributable Earnings excludes the impact of any unrealized provisions for credit losses, any loan losses are charged off and realized through Distributable Earnings when deemed non-recoverable. Non-recoverability is determined (i) upon the resolution of a loan (i.e. when the loan is repaid, fully or partially, or in the case of foreclosures, when the underlying asset is sold), or (ii) with respect to any amount due under any loan, when such amount is determined to be non-collectible. We believe that Distributable Earnings provides meaningful information to consider in addition to our net income (loss) and cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe Distributable Earnings is a useful financial metric for existing and potential future holders of our common stock as historically, over time, Distributable Earnings has been a strong indicator of our dividends per share of common stock. As a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, and therefore we believe our dividends are one of the principal reasons stockholders may invest in our common stock. Furthermore, Distributable Earnings help us to evaluate our performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of our current loan portfolio and operations and is a performance metric we consider when declaring our dividends. Distributable Earnings does not represent net income (loss) or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss), or an indication of GAAP cash flows from operations, a measure of our liquidity, or an indication of funds available for our cash needs.

The amount of quarterly distributions may vary, depending on a number of factors. As portfolio and market conditions change, the rate of distributions on the common shares may change. There can be no assurance that the Funds will be able to declare a distribution in each period. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The following information is required under each Fundâs managed distribution policy and sets forth an estimate of the sources of each Fundâs distribution paid January 16, 2024 and distributions paid fiscal year-to-date.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: You should not draw any conclusions about each Fundâs investment performance from the amount of each distribution or from the terms of the Fundsâ Plan. Each Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Funds is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect each Fundâs investment performance and should not be confused with âyieldâ or âincome.â The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Section 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon each Fundâs investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Each Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance quoted represents past performance. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The market price of Fund shares may vary from net asset value based on factors affecting the supply and demand for shares, such as Fund distribution rates relative to similar investments, investorsâ expectations for future distribution changes, the clarity of the Fundâs investment strategy and future return expectations, and investorsâ confidence in the underlying markets in which the Fund invests.

Certain statements made on behalf of the Fund in this release are forward-looking statements. The Fundâs actual future results may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including but not limited to a decline in value in equity markets in general or the Fundâs investments specifically.

(TISI) received a notice from the NYSE stating non-compliance with listing standards due to low market capitalization and shareholders' equity. The company plans to submit a compliance plan within 45 days to rectify the situation.","Team, Inc. Receives Continued Listing Standard Notice From NYSE Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Team, Inc. (TISI) received a notice from the NYSE stating non-compliance with listing standards due to low market capitalization and shareholders' equity. The company plans to submit a compliance plan within 45 days to rectify the situation. Positive None. Negative The company's non-compliance with NYSE listing standards poses a risk to its continued listing on the exchange, potentially impacting investor confidence and share value. Financial Analyst Team, Inc.'s notification from the NYSE regarding non-compliance with continued listing standards due to market capitalization and shareholders' equity deficiencies is a significant red flag for investors and stakeholders. Market capitalization is a critical measure of a company's value as perceived by the stock market and is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the number of outstanding shares. A drop below $50 million over a sustained period indicates waning investor confidence and potential liquidity issues. Shareholders' equity represents the net value of a company and is a gauge of its financial health. Falling below the $50 million threshold can signal to investors that the company's assets are not sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long term. The company's plan to regain compliance is a key aspect to monitor. The success of such a plan could stabilize the stock and potentially restore investor confidence. However, failure to do so may result in delisting, which would likely reduce the stock's liquidity and visibility, potentially leading to a decline in share value. Investors should closely watch the company's strategic decisions during this period, as they will be critical in determining the future financial health and stock performance of Team, Inc. Market Research Analyst When assessing the broader implications of Team, Inc.'s situation, it's important to consider industry benchmarks. Typically, companies in a similar market tier strive to maintain compliance with listing standards to ensure investor trust and access to capital markets. A failure to meet these standards can result in a negative perception of the company's stability and growth prospects, which can, in turn, affect its competitive position. Furthermore, the stock's continued trading on the NYSE provides a temporary reprieve, allowing the management to explore strategic options such as raising capital, restructuring, or seeking mergers and acquisitions to bolster financials. The company's ability to navigate this challenge will be indicative of management's strategic acumen and could influence investor sentiment across the sector. The outcome will also provide insights into the effectiveness of the NYSE's regulatory mechanisms in maintaining market order and investor confidence. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the Notice from the NYSE does not constitute a breach of Team, Inc.'s material debt or other contractual agreements. This is a important distinction for the company's immediate operational future. However, the potential ramifications of non-compliance, should the company fail to regain its standing, include more stringent financial covenants, higher borrowing costs, or difficulties in securing future financing. The company's proactive communication with the NYSE and its intention to submit a compliance plan are positive steps, but the uncertainty of approval adds an element of risk. Investors should be aware that while the Notice does not affect the immediate trading of Team, Inc.'s shares, the long-term consequences of non-compliance could be substantial. The company's legal team will likely be evaluating all options to protect shareholder interests, including potential equity offerings, asset sales, or other financial instruments to improve the balance sheet. The legal intricacies of such maneuvers require careful scrutiny to ensure they align with shareholder interests and regulatory requirements. 03/15/2024 - 04:45 PM SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Team, Inc. (NYSE: TISI) (""TEAM"" or the ""Company"") today announced that on March 14, 2024, it received notice (the ""Notice"") from the New York Stock Exchange (âNYSEâ) that it is not in compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01B of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual due to the fact that the Company's average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50 million and, at the same time, its shareholders' equity was less than $50 million. In accordance with NYSE procedures, the Company intends to notify the NYSE that it plans to submit a plan within 45 days of receipt of the Notice advising the NYSE of definitive action it has taken, or is taking, to bring it into compliance with Section 802.01B within 12 months of receipt of the Notice. Any plan submitted by the Company to regain compliance would be subject to NYSE approval. The Notice has no immediate impact on the listing of the Company's common stock, which will continue to trade on the NYSE during the applicable cure period, and does not result in a default under the Company's material debt or other agreements. The Company is considering all available options to regain compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. The Company can provide no assurances that it will be able to satisfy any of the steps outlined above and maintain the listing of its shares on the NYSE. About Team, Inc.

C3IS INC.

The company appeals the decision and will continue trading under the symbol 'CISS' during the appeal process.,"C3IS INC. Announces Receipt of Nasdaq Delisting Determination; Appeal Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary C3is Inc. receives a delisting notice from Nasdaq due to its common stock trading below $0.10 for ten consecutive days. The company appeals the decision and will continue trading under the symbol 'CISS' during the appeal process. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The notice of delisting received by C3is Inc. from Nasdaq due to the sustained low bid price of its common stock is a significant red flag for investors and stakeholders. The sub-dollar trading level is a clear indicator of market sentiment that the company is facing substantial challenges. This situation often leads to reduced investor confidence and can trigger a sell-off, further impacting the stock price negatively.While the company has the option to appeal, which it is pursuing, the appeal process itself does not address the underlying issues causing the low stock price. The consideration of a reverse stock split is a common strategy to bring the per-share price above the minimum threshold required by Nasdaq, but it is often viewed as a cosmetic fix that does not solve operational or financial issues. Investors should closely monitor the company's next steps and the outcome of the hearing, as well as any strategic measures the company may implement to address its performance issues. Market Research Analyst The dry bulk and crude oil tanker sectors are highly cyclical and sensitive to global economic trends, geopolitical events and supply-demand imbalances. C3is Inc.'s struggle to maintain its Nasdaq listing could be symptomatic of broader industry pressures or company-specific operational challenges. Investors should consider the overall health of the shipping industry, including freight rates, fleet utilization and competition, to contextualize the company's performance.Furthermore, the ongoing trading of C3is Inc.'s stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market during the appeal process does not guarantee stability in its price. The market's reaction to the delisting notice and potential reverse stock split will be telling of the investor sentiment towards the company's future prospects. Stakeholders should evaluate market trends and peer performance to make informed decisions. Legal Expert The procedural aspects of C3is Inc.'s appeal to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel are important for the company's continued listing. The stay on delisting provides a temporary reprieve, but the company's non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement poses a serious threat to its listing status. Investors should be aware of the legal implications of delisting, which include decreased liquidity and potential loss of access to capital markets.The company's acknowledgment of non-compliance with another Nasdaq rule concerning the minimum bid price over an extended period is an additional concern. It suggests that the company has been grappling with stock price issues for some time. The outcome of the hearing and the company's ability to present a viable plan to regain compliance will be critical factors in determining its future on the stock exchange. 03/15/2024 - 04:45 PM ATHENS, Greece, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- C3is Inc. (Nasdaq: CISS) (the âCompanyâ), a ship-owning company providing dry bulk and crude oil tanker seaborne transportation services, announced today that it has received a staff determination letter, dated March 15, 2024, from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (âNasdaqâ) notifying the Company that the Companyâs common stock had a closing bid price of $0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days, through March 14, 2024, and that, consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(iii), the Staff has determined to delist the Companyâs common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market.

In response, the Company is appealing the Nasdaq Staff Determination by requesting a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5800 Series procedures.

Throughout this process, the Companyâs common stock will continue trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol âCISS.â In addition, as previously announced, the Company has also been in non-compliance with Nasdaq Rule 5550(a)(2), triggered by the closing bid price of its Common Shares remaining below $1.00 per share for thirty consecutive trading days for which it had been granted a grace period to regain compliance with such rule. The Company will consider various alternatives, including a reverse stock split. ABOUT C3IS INC. C3is Inc. is a ship-owning company providing dry bulk and crude oil seaborne transportation services.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of quarterly cash dividends by Ready Capital Corporation is a tangible reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to return value to shareholders. The consistency and size of the dividend payments can be seen as an indicator of stability and a commitment to shareholder interests. From a financial analysis standpoint, the dividend yield, which can be calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock's current price, becomes a key metric for investors seeking income-generating investments.Furthermore, the payment of dividends on both common and preferred stock suggests a tiered approach to satisfying investor groups with different risk profiles. Preferred shareholders, given the higher dividend rates and priority over common stock in cases of liquidation, might represent a more risk-averse segment. The slight increment in dividend rates for the preferred stocks could also be reflective of market conditions where higher rates are required to attract capital.Investors will often look at dividend announcements as a signal of confidence from management in the company's future earnings potential. However, it is important to assess the sustainability of these dividends by reviewing the company's payout ratio, cash reserves and long-term earnings forecast. Market Research Analyst Ready Capital Corporation's dividend announcement can have implications for the stock's market perception. Dividends are often factored into the total return analysis of a stock, which includes both capital appreciation and income received. As such, consistent dividends can make the stock more attractive to a segment of the investment community that prioritizes steady income, such as retirees or institutional investors focused on income funds.It is also important to consider the signaling effect of dividend announcements. A steady or increasing dividend can be perceived as a sign of corporate health and management's confidence in the business model, which may positively influence investor sentiment. Conversely, a cut or omission of dividends might signal financial distress or a shift in strategy towards reinvesting earnings into growth initiatives.Market analysts would also monitor the stock's performance following the ex-dividend date, as stocks typically drop by an amount approximately equal to the dividend paid. This is a critical period for technical analysis, as it may influence short-term trading strategies. 03/15/2024 - 04:43 PM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ready Capital Corporation (NYSE:RC) (the âCompanyâ) announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock and Operating Partnership unit for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Announces Closing of US$6 Million Registered Direct Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary NaaS Technology Inc. announces the closing of a direct offering of 4,761,905 ADSs with warrants, generating approximately US$6 million in gross proceeds. The offering aims to support EV charging network expansion, R&D activities, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent direct offering by NaaS Technology Inc. reflects a strategic move to bolster its financial position and expand its operations. The capital raised, amounting to approximately $6 million, is earmarked for the expansion of the EV charging network, R&D and general corporate purposes. This decision is aligned with the growing demand for EV infrastructure, which is being propelled by the global shift towards electric vehicles. The investment in R&D could potentially lead to technological advancements that may improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of EV charging services, thus enhancing NaaS's competitive edge in the market.However, the issuance of warrants alongside the ADS could dilute existing shareholders' value when exercised, albeit at a higher price of $1.49 per ADS. This could indicate a positive outlook from the company on its future stock performance, as warrants are often used to attract investment by offering potential upside at a later date. Investors should monitor the adoption rates of EVs in China and government policies that could influence the growth trajectory of the EV charging market. Financial Analyst The offering's structure, combining ADS and warrants, is a common method to raise capital while providing an incentive for investors through the warrants. The exercise price set at $1.49 suggests confidence in the company's future valuation. The six-month lock-up period before the warrants can be exercised provides a short-term safeguard against immediate dilution. Long-term, the company's stock could experience volatility around the time the warrants become exercisable, depending on the prevailing market conditions and the company's performance.Investors should evaluate the use of proceeds in the context of NaaS's financial health and the EV charging industry's capital intensity. The $6 million raised may seem modest compared to the capital requirements for substantial network expansion and R&D in this sector, possibly indicating a need for further capital raises in the future. Careful scrutiny of the company's burn rate and subsequent financial statements will be necessary to assess the effectiveness of the capital allocation. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this transaction is crucial, as it is conducted under an effective shelf registration statement. This mechanism allows companies to prepare for offerings quickly without having to navigate the SEC registration process each time. The mention of the prospectus supplement is significant because it provides transparency and detailed information regarding the use of proceeds and the risks involved. It's important for the stakeholders to understand that such offerings, while beneficial for the company's growth, carry regulatory compliance obligations that must be meticulously followed to avoid legal complications.The disclaimer in the press release is a standard regulatory requirement, emphasizing that the securities are not being offered or sold where it would be unlawful. This highlights the importance of jurisdictional regulations in securities offerings and the need for companies and investors to be aware of and comply with different securities laws. 03/15/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NaaS Technology Inc.

CARVYKTIÂ® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) Receives Recommendation from the U.S. FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for Earlier Treatment of Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma,2024-03-15T19:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Legend Biotech's CARVYKTI Receives Positive FDA ODAC Vote for Multiple Myeloma Treatment,"CARVYKTIÂ® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) Receives Recommendation from the U.S. FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee for Earlier Treatment of Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Legend Biotech's CARVYKTI Receives Positive FDA ODAC Vote for Multiple Myeloma Treatment Positive FDA ODAC voted 11 to 0 in favor of CARVYKTI for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Positive risk-benefit assessment based on Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study data. CARVYKTI recommended for patients refractory to lenalidomide after prior therapy. Supplemental BLA under FDA review with PDUFA date set for April 5, 2024. Results from CARTITUDE-4 study supported positive EMA opinion for CARVYKTI. CARVYKTI is a BCMA-directed T cell therapy for heavily pretreated myeloma patients. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The unanimous recommendation by the FDA's ODAC for CARVYKTIÂ® in the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma represents a significant advancement in oncology, particularly for patients who have limited options after failing previous lines of therapy. The positive evaluation from a Phase 3 study suggests that this CAR T-cell therapy could offer a substantial improvement in patient outcomes compared to current standards of care.As an oncologist, the safety profile is a critical aspect to consider. CAR T-cell therapies are known for potentially severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicities. The availability of tocilizumab, a medication to treat CRS and the implementation of a REMS program to manage these risks are important measures to ensure patient safety. It is also noteworthy that the therapy is being evaluated for use earlier in the treatment regimen, which may impact overall survival and quality of life for patients. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the CARTITUDE-4 study's impact on the field of immunotherapy is noteworthy. The study's design, comparing CARVYKTIÂ® to other treatments like pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone, or daratumumab combinations, indicates a rigorous approach to establishing the therapy's efficacy. The data supporting the EMA's CHMP positive opinion further solidifies the clinical relevance of the treatment.Additionally, the potential for CARVYKTIÂ® to induce long-term remission could shift the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. However, the risks of secondary hematological malignancies post-treatment are a concern that requires ongoing surveillance in the post-marketing phase to fully understand the long-term implications of the therapy. Market Research Analyst For investors and stakeholders in the biotech sector, the ODAC's support is a positive signal that could influence Legend Biotech's market position. The stock market typically responds favorably to such regulatory milestones, especially for therapies that address high unmet medical needs. The therapy's potential approval and earlier use in the treatment sequence could expand the addressable market, enhancing the company's revenue prospects.It is important to monitor the company's capacity to scale up production and manage the complex logistics associated with CAR T-cell therapies. Additionally, payer acceptance and reimbursement policies will be critical factors in determining the commercial success of CARVYKTIÂ®. The competitive landscape, including other CAR T-cell therapies and emerging treatments, will also play a role in shaping the market dynamics. 03/15/2024 - 03:15 PM FDA ODAC votes 11 to 0 supporting favorable risk-benefit assessment of CARVYKTI based on results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study SOMERSET, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ: LEGN) (Legend Biotech), a global leader in cell therapy, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommended CARVYKTIÂ® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel, cilta-cel) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) and are refractory to lenalidomide. The positive recommendation follows the committeeâs evaluation of efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study. The committee voted unanimously in favor of CARVYKTI (11 to 0) finding the risk-benefit assessment of cilta-cel for the proposed indication as favorable. A supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) supported by the CARTITUDE-4 study is currently under review by the FDA with a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date of April 5, 2024. âThe advisory committeeâs positive recommendation for CARVYKTIÂ® brings us one step closer to helping more patients fighting relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma,â said Ying Huang, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Legend Biotech. âWe are committed to improving the lives of patients with multiple myeloma, and weâre excited by the prospect of bringing our innovative therapy to patients earlier in the course of their disease.â The committee reviewed results from the CARTITUDE-4 study (NCT04181827), the first randomized Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTIÂ® versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in the treatment of patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy.1 Outcomes from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study were first presented at the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. These study results also supported the recent European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) positive opinion for CARVYKTIÂ® in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor (PI) and an immunomodulatory agent (IMiD), have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy and are refractory to lenalidomide. The ODAC is assembled upon request from the FDA to review and evaluate safety and efficacy data of human drug products for use in the treatment of oncologic diseases. The committee provides non-binding recommendations based on its evaluation; final decisions on approval of the drug are made by the FDA. CARVYKTIÂ® INDICATIONS AND USAGE CARVYKTIÂ® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapy indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNING: CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME, NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, HLH/MAS, PROLONGED and RECURRENT CYTOPENIA, and SECONDARY HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Do not administer CARVYKTIÂ® to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Treat severe or life-threatening CRS with tocilizumab or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), which may be fatal or life-threatening, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®, including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. Monitor for neurologic events after treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Provide supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Parkinsonism and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and their associated complications resulting in fatal or life-threatening reactions have occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (HLH/MAS), including fatal and life-threatening reactions, occurred in patients following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. HLH/MAS can occur with CRS or neurologic toxicities. Prolonged and/or recurrent cytopenias with bleeding and infection and requirement for stem cell transplantation for hematopoietic recovery occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Secondary hematological malignancies, including myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, have occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. CARVYKTIÂ® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTIÂ® REMS Program. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS) including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ® in 95% (92/97) of patients receiving ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Grade 3 or higher CRS (2019 ASTCT grade) occurred in 5% (5/97) of patients, with Grade 5 CRS reported in 1 patient. The median time to onset of CRS was 7 days (range: 1-12 days). The most common manifestations of CRS included pyrexia (100%), hypotension (43%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (22%), chills (15%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (14%) and sinus tachycardia (11%). Grade 3 or higher events associated with CRS included increased AST and ALT, hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, pyrexia, hypoxia, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhage, HLH/MAS, angina pectoris, supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia, malaise, myalgias, increased C-reactive protein, ferritin, blood alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Identify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS. One patient with CRS and suspected HLH/MAS developed a fatal retroperitoneal hemorrhage in the setting of thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and anticoagulation in another ongoing study of CARVYKTIÂ®. Sixty-nine of 97 (71%) patients received tocilizumab and/or a corticosteroid for CRS after infusion of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Forty-four (45%) patients received only tocilizumab, of whom 33 (34%) received a single dose and 11 (11%) received more than one dose; 24 patients (25%) received tocilizumab and a corticosteroid, and one patient (1%) received only corticosteroids. Ensure that a minimum of two doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of CARVYKTIÂ®. Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTIÂ® infusion at a REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of CRS. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after infusion. At the first sign of CRS, immediately institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab, or tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time. NEUROLOGIC TOXICITIES, which may be severe, life-threatening, or fatal, occurred following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Neurologic toxicities included ICANS, neurologic toxicity with signs and symptoms of parkinsonism, Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome, immune mediated myelitis, peripheral neuropathies, and cranial nerve palsies. Counsel patients on the signs and symptoms of these neurologic toxicities, and on the delayed nature of onset of some of these toxicities. Instruct patients to seek immediate medical attention for further assessment and management if signs or symptoms of any of these neurologic toxicities occur at any time. Overall, one or more subtypes of neurologic toxicity described below occurred following ciltacabtagene autoleucel in 26% (25/97) of patients, of which 11% (11/97) of patients experienced Grade 3 or higher events. These subtypes of neurologic toxicities were also observed in two ongoing studies. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS): Patients may experience fatal or life-threatening ICANS following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®, including before CRS onset, concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS. ICANS occurred in 23% (22/97) of patients receiving ciltacabtagene autoleucel including Grade 3 or 4 events in 3% (3/97) and Grade 5 (fatal) events in 2% (2/97). The median time to onset of ICANS was 8 days (range 1-28 days). All 22 patients with ICANS had CRS. The most frequent (â¥5%) manifestation of ICANS included encephalopathy (23%), aphasia (8%) and headache (6%). Monitor patients at least daily for 10 days following CARVYKTIÂ® infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs and symptoms of ICANS. Rule out other causes of ICANS symptoms. Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of ICANS for at least 4 weeks after infusion and treat promptly. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Parkinsonism: Of the 25 patients in the CARTITUDE-1 study experiencing any neurotoxicity, six male patients had neurologic toxicity with several signs and symptoms of parkinsonism, distinct from immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Neurologic toxicity with parkinsonism has been reported in other ongoing trials of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Patients had parkinsonian and non-parkinsonian symptoms that included tremor, bradykinesia, involuntary movements, stereotypy, loss of spontaneous movements, masked facies, apathy, flat affect, fatigue, rigidity, psychomotor retardation, micrographia, dysgraphia, apraxia, lethargy, confusion, somnolence, loss of consciousness, delayed reflexes, hyperreflexia, memory loss, difficulty swallowing, bowel incontinence, falls, stooped posture, shuffling gait, muscle weakness and wasting, motor dysfunction, motor and sensory loss, akinetic mutism, and frontal lobe release signs. The median onset of parkinsonism in the 6 patients in CARTITUDE-1 was 64 days (range 14-914 days) from infusion of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of parkinsonism that may be delayed in onset and managed with supportive care measures. There is limited efficacy information with medications used for the treatment of Parkinsonâs disease, for the improvement or resolution of parkinsonism symptoms following CARVYKTIÂ® treatment. Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome: A fatal outcome following Guillain-BarrÃ© Syndrome (GBS) has occurred in another ongoing study of ciltacabtagene autoleucel despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Symptoms reported include those consistent with Miller-Fisher variant of GBS, encephalopathy, motor weakness, speech disturbances and polyradiculoneuritis. Monitor for GBS. Evaluate patients presenting with peripheral neuropathy for GBS. Consider treatment of GBS with supportive care measures and in conjunction with immunoglobulin and plasma exchange, depending on severity of GBS. Immune Mediated Myelitis: Grade 3 myelitis has occurred 25 days following treatment in another ongoing study. Symptoms reported included hypoesthesia of the lower extremities and the lower abdomen with impaired sphincter control. Symptoms improved with the use of corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin. Myelitis was ongoing at the time of death from other cause. Peripheral Neuropathy: Seven patients in CARTITUDE-1 developed peripheral neuropathy. These neuropathies presented as sensory, motor, or sensorimotor neuropathies. Median time of onset of symptoms was 66 days (range 4-914 days), median duration of peripheral neuropathies was 138 days (range 2-692 days) including those with ongoing neuropathy. Patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy also experienced cranial nerve palsies or GBS in other ongoing trials of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. Cranial Nerve Palsies: Three patients (3.1%) experienced cranial nerve palsies in CARTITUDE-1. All three patients had 7th cranial nerve palsy; one patient had 5th cranial nerve palsy as well. Median time to onset was 26 days (range 21-101 days) following infusion of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Occurrence of 3rd and 6th cranial nerve palsy, bilateral 7th cranial nerve palsy, worsening of cranial nerve palsy after improvement, and occurrence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with cranial nerve palsy have also been reported in ongoing trials of ciltacabtagene autoleucel. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of cranial nerve palsies. Consider management with systemic corticosteroids, depending on the severity and progression of signs and symptoms. HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS (HLH)/MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION SYNDROME (MAS): Fatal HLH occurred in one patient (1%), 99 days after ciltacabtagene autoleucel. The HLH event was preceded by prolonged CRS lasting 97 days. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia with diffuse alveolar damage, coagulopathy, cytopenia, and multi-organ dysfunction, including renal dysfunction. One patient with Grade 4 HLH/MAS developed fatal intracerebral and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the setting of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia 12 days after treatment in another ongoing study. Patients who develop HLH/MAS have an increased risk of severe bleeding. Monitor hematological parameters in patients with HLH/MAS and transfuse per institutional guidelines. HLH is a life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized and treated early. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional standards. CARVYKTIÂ® REMS: Because of the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, CARVYKTIÂ® is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the CARVYKTIÂ® REMS. Further information is available at https://www.carvyktirems.com or 1-844-672-0067. PROLONGED AND RECURRENT CYTOPENIAS: Patients may exhibit prolonged and recurrent cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and CARVYKTIÂ® infusion. One patient underwent autologous stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged thrombocytopenia. In CARTITUDE-1, 30% (29/97) of patients experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 41% (40/97) of patients experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Day 30 following ciltacabtagene autoleucel infusion. Recurrent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and anemia were seen in 63% (61/97), 19% (18/97), 60% (58/97), and 37% (36/97) after recovery from initial Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia following infusion. After Day 60 following ciltacabtagene autoleucel infusion, 31%, 12% and 6% of patients had a recurrence of Grade 3 or higher lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively, after initial recovery of their Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Eighty-seven percent (84/97) of patients had one, two, or three or more recurrences of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias after initial recovery of Grade 3 or 4 cytopenia. Eight and 12 patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively, at the time of death. Monitor blood counts prior to and after CARVYKTIÂ® infusion. Manage cytopenias with growth factors and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines. INFECTIONS: CARVYKTIÂ® should not be administered to patients with active infection or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after CARVYKTIÂ® infusion. Infections (all grades) occurred in 57 (59%) patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 21% (20/97) of patients; Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15%, viral infections in 7%, bacterial infections in 1%, and fungal infections in 1% of patients. Overall, 5 patients had Grade 5 infections: lung abscess (n=1), sepsis (n=3) and pneumonia (n=1). Grade 5 infections reported in other studies include bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and CMV colitis (with HSV-1 hepatitis). Another patient developed mycotic aneurysm due to cerebral aspergillosis and died of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after CARVYKTIÂ® infusion and treat patients appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to the standard institutional guidelines. Febrile neutropenia was observed in 10% of patients after ciltacabtagene autoleucel infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care, as medically indicated. In a randomized controlled study of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (CARTITUDE-4), patients treated with ciltacabtagene autoleucel had an increased rate of fatal COVID-19 infections compared to the standard therapy arm. Counsel patients on the importance of prevention measures. Follow institutional guidelines for the vaccination and management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19. Viral Reactivation: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure and death, can occur in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. Perform screening for Cytomegalovirus (CMV), HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or any other infectious agents if clinically indicated in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice. HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA was reported as an adverse event in 12% (12/97) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dL after infusion in 92% (89/97) of patients. Monitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with CARVYKTIÂ® and administer IVIG for IgG <400 mg/dL. Manage per local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions and antibiotic or antiviral prophylaxis. Use of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or following CARVYKTIÂ® treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during CARVYKTIÂ® treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS have occurred in 5% (5/97) of patients following ciltacabtagene autoleucel infusion. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in CARVYKTIÂ®. Patients should be carefully monitored for 2 hours after infusion for signs and symptoms of severe reaction. Treat promptly and manage appropriately according to the severity of the hypersensitivity reaction. SECONDARY MALIGNANCIES: Patients treated with CARVYKTIÂ® may develop secondary malignancies. Myeloid neoplasms (five cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, three cases of acute myeloid leukemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome followed by acute myeloid leukemia) occurred in 10% (10/97) of patients in CARTITUDE-1 study following treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasms was 485 days (range: 162 to 1040 days) after treatment with CARVYKTIÂ®. Nine of these 10 patients died following the development of myeloid neoplasms; four of the 10 cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia have also been reported in the post marketing setting. Monitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Janssen Biotech, Inc., at 1-800-526-7736 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples. EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status, seizures, neurocognitive decline, or neuropathy, patients are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following CARVYKTIÂ® infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery during this initial period, and in the event of new onset of any neurologic toxicities. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common non-laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20%) are pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, hypotension, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, infections of unspecified pathogen, cough, chills, diarrhea, nausea, encephalopathy, decreased appetite, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, tachycardia, dizziness, dyspnea, edema, viral infections, coagulopathy, constipation, and vomiting. The most common laboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 50%) include thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, aminotransferase elevation, and hypoalbuminemia. Please read full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning, for CARVYKTIÂ®. ABOUT CARVYKTIÂ® (CILTACABTAGENE AUTOLEUCEL; CILTA-CEL) Ciltacabtagene autoleucel is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, which involves reprogramming a patientâs own T-cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that identifies and eliminates cells that express BCMA. The cilta-cel CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domain antibodies designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells.2 In December 2017, Legend Biotech entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), a Johnson & Johnson company, to develop and commercialize cilta-cel. In February 2022, cilta-cel was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the brand name CARVYKTIÂ® for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In May 2022, the European Commission (EC) granted conditional marketing authorization of CARVYKTIÂ® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In September 2022, Japanâs Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) approved CARVYKTIÂ®. Cilta-cel was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in the U.S. in December 2019 and in China in August 2020. In addition, cilta-cel received a PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation from the European Commission in April 2019. Cilta-cel also received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. FDA in February 2019, from the European Commission in February 2020, and from the Pharmaceuticals and Medicinal Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan in June 2020. In March 2022, the European Medicines Agencyâs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recommended by consensus that the orphan designation for cilta-cel be maintained on the basis of clinical data demonstrating improved and sustained complete response rates following treatment. ABOUT CARTITUDE-4 CARTITUDE-4 (NCT04181827) is an ongoing, international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of cilta-cel versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in adult patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an IMiD. The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival.3 ABOUT MULTIPLE MYELOMA Multiple myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that starts in the bone marrow and is characterized by an excessive proliferation of plasma cells.4 In 2024, it is estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and more than 12,000 people will die from the disease in the U.S.5 While some patients with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone problems, low blood counts, calcium elevation, kidney problems or infections.6 ABOUT LEGEND BIOTECH Legend Biotech is a global biotechnology company dedicated to treating, and one day curing, life-threatening diseases.

An 8% year-over-year revenue growth and a 12% increase in gross profit are notable, particularly in the context of a cannabis industry that has seen significant volatility. The company's ability to maintain consistent salary costs as a percentage of revenue, alongside a reduction in general and administrative expenses, suggests effective cost control measures. This is further exemplified by the 90% year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA and an improved margin, which is significant in assessing the company's operational efficiency and profitability.From a market perspective, High Tide's claim of being the second-largest cannabis retailer in North America by store count, along with its growing market share in key Canadian provinces, positions it as a strong player in the industry. The expansion of its ELITE loyalty program and the record income from its Cabanalytics platform demonstrate a diversified revenue stream, which can be appealing to investors looking for companies with multiple growth avenues. However, the challenge remains in sustaining these growth rates in a competitive and regulatory environment that is constantly evolving. Financial Analyst The financial results of High Tide Inc. reflect a solid performance in terms of free cash flow, which is a important indicator of a company's financial strength and liquidity. Generating $3.6 million in free cash flow in the quarter, despite a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, is a strong sign of operational cash generation. The breakeven net income compared to a loss in the previous fiscal year's first quarter is also a positive sign, particularly for a company in the cannabis sector where profitability has been elusive for many players.Investors may view the 16th consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA as a sign of stability and consistent management execution. However, it is essential to consider the underlying drivers of this performance and whether it is sustainable in the long term. The company's focus on organic growth and cost control, as opposed to growth through acquisition, may be seen as a conservative strategy that could pay off in maintaining financial health but may limit rapid expansion compared to competitors who choose a more aggressive acquisition strategy. Legal Expert High Tide's financial results have implications beyond just numbers; they reflect the company's ability to navigate a complex legal and regulatory landscape. The cannabis industry is subject to stringent regulations, which can impact both the cost structure and revenue potential of companies operating within it. High Tide's reported increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin suggests that the company is effectively managing these challenges. Additionally, the company's strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile may provide it with the flexibility to adapt to potential regulatory changes or capitalize on new market opportunities as they arise.It is also worth noting that the company's expansion plans and market share goals must align with provincial and federal regulations, which can vary significantly across jurisdictions. The ability to achieve a 15% market share while expanding to 300 retail stores will depend on navigating these legal complexities effectively. Investors should monitor regulatory developments as they can have a material impact on the company's operations and financial performance. 03/15/2024 - 04:01 PM First Quarter Results Include Revenue of $128.1 Million, Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4 Million, and $3.6 Million of Free Cash Flow This news release constitutes a ""designated news release"" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated August 31, 2023, to its short form base shelf prospectus dated August 3, 2023.

While there has been industry-wide softening of Canadian cannabis sales in the post-holiday months and having made essentially no acquisitions in over a year, I am proud to report that our Company continues to grow organically and has never had a sequential decline in revenue since going public in 2018. Our focus on responsible growth is leading to robust free cash flow generation, which has totalled over $13 million during the past three quarters. Due to our strong cost controls, we have generated significant increases in our Adjusted EBITDA margin as shown by achieving a level of 8.1% this quarter versus 4.7% in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. Given our size and scale, we are seeing the positive impact of operating leverage. For instance, while revenue increased by 1% sequentially, we were able to increase Adjusted EBITDA by 25%, resulting in a record Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4 million. While CCAA filings continue in the Canadian cannabis sector, our balance sheet remains strong, supported by our free cash flow profile,"" said Raj Grover, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of High Tide. ""Our ELITE program continues to be the biggest differentiator in our innovative discount club model and is yielding results ahead of our expectations. We welcomed new ELITE members at the fastest pace since inception, and our Cabana Club now includes approximately 32,000 paid members as part of the overall membership base, which now exceeds 1.32 million members and growing. Accordingly, we see a tremendous opportunity to continue upgrading many more base members to ELITE. We have reached over 10% market share across the five provinces where we operate. Our long-term goal is to reach 15% market share while operating approximately 300 retail stores across Canada. I look forward to announcing a number of new exciting Ontario Canna Cabana locations in the coming weeks. We are also very excited about our announcement this morning related to our agreement to acquire Queen of Bud, an innovative and well-established Canadian cannabis brand with a particularly strong appeal amongst female cannabis connoisseurs. This acquisition will help bolster our roster of in-house brands, which will also deliver premium, higher-margin white-label product offerings to our ELITE and Cabana Club members. Finally, alongside the enormous growth opportunities in front of us in Canada, we continue to closely monitor developments in Germany, where legislative changes could enable Canna Cabana to participate in cannabis bricks-and-mortar retail by mid-2025. I would like to thank our hard-working team and our loyal customers for another fantastic quarter, and I remain very enthusiastic for what lies ahead,"" added Mr. Grover.

These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are, therefore, unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Non-IFRS measures provide investors with a supplemental measure of the Company's operating performance and, therefore, highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures. Management uses non-IFRS measures in measuring the financial performance of the Company.

The most directly comparable financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. It should not be viewed as a measure of liquidity or a substitute for comparable metrics prepared in accordance with IFRS. Outlook High Tide continues to lead the Canadian cannabis retail landscape as the largest non-franchised retailer across Canada, with 165 locations. The Company's rapid progress can be attributed to the success of its innovative discount club model, which includes the ELITE paid membership program and the Cabana Club supported by its online global customer base. ELITE memberships are on the rise having grown at its fastest pace since inception over the past quarter. The Company's Cabana Club loyalty program has also shown impressive increases, with membership now exceeding over 1.32 million. Given the Company's goal to add 20-30 new Canna Cabana locations during this calendar year, the Company anticipates new Cabana Club members will continue to join its loyalty program throughout the year. Currently, ELITE offerings make up 12% of SKUs, which is up from 2% a year ago, and the Company continues to lay the groundwork to reach its communicated goal of 20-30% of in-store inventory cater towards ELITE. As we continue to scale up these exclusive ELITE product offerings, we expect membership numbers to continue rising. The Company currently holds an average of over 10% market share in dollars across the provinces where it operates. The Company anticipates reaching 15% market share in Canada, driven by organic store openings, as well as strategic and accretive M&A to reach its target of 300 Canna Cabana locations in the long term. The Company currently has 120 stores equipped with its Fastendr technology. The Company anticipates completing this rollout in the remainder of its store portfolio prior to the end of this fiscal year. With the recently announced acquisition of the Queen of Bud brand, the Company looks forward to developing and launching innovative high-margin cannabis and consumption accessory offerings to its ELITE and Cabana Club membership base. The Company has generated over $13.3 million in free cash flow during the past three quarters and intends to remain free cash flow positive through fiscal 2024, although the quantum of free cash flow generation could vary in any given quarter, depending on the nature of working capital requirements needed to launch and ramp up new locations to maturity. A robust balance sheet, coupled with strong cost controls, should enable High Tide to take full advantage of opportunities to expand its network of Canna Cabana retail stores across Canada, focused on Ontario.

Negative None. 03/15/2024 - 04:00 PM BOCA RATON, Fla., March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Greenlite Ventures, Inc. (OTC-PINK: GRNL) has announced the signing of Agreements with Woodway USA, Inc. and its owner, Doug Bayerlein, that call for the parties to work in partnership for the sale of simulated altitude chambers, as well as other joint venture opportunities. Woodway is the largest specialized treadmill manufacturer in the USA, and has a client list that includes every NFL, NBA, and MLB team along with an extensive list of NHL teams, international soccer clubs, major colleges, and top government agencies. The Agreements were brought about by GRNL Consultant, Dave Vincent, who is the founder and CEO of Sporting Edge UK, a global leader in the sale of simulated altitude and extreme environmental chambers. Last year, GRNL acquired the exclusive North America rights for all Sporting Edge's patents and products and has now passed those rights onto Woodway in exchange for an ongoing top-line royalty covering all related sales. Vincent has been working with Woodway on various projects for over 5 years and will play a lead role in the rollout of Woodway Altitude Chambers across the Americas. The parties are also working together to open the first altitude fitness center featuring all Woodway products which is currently being built-out inside the renowned Impact Zone in New Jersey. The Impact Zone is one of the world's largest fitness/training facilities and is the training center for many top professional athletes from all sports. The new unit will utilize two lines of Woodway Treadmills and Watt Bikes inside a Woodway simulated altitude chamber and will likely serve as the flagship unit for a planned altitude franchise roll-out. Woodway's Doug Bayerlein said, ""I am really pleased to be back working with Dave Vincent as we strive to make altitude training as big in the States as Dave has made it in Europe. This new Partnership gives me the opportunity to fully leverage the Woodway brand in market sectors many times larger than treadmills, while also leveraging GRNL's strong franchising and fitness center connections. I look forward to making Woodway a household name on a number of new levels through our extraordinary Partnership with GRNL."" Russ Elbaum, GRNL's Chairman concluded, ""It was obvious from the outset that Doug and I share the same vision for our joint altitude efforts and potential franchise partnership. Just the altitude sales alone that Woodway can make to just a small fraction of their unparalleled customer base can bring GRNL a substantial income stream for years to come. It is truly an honor for all of us at Greenlite to partner with Doug Bayerlein and his iconic Woodway brand.""

(OCCI) provided an estimate of its net asset value (NAV) per share for February 29, 2024, ranging between $7.48 and $7.58. The company highlighted potential impacts on its financial condition due to various global events and economic factors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The estimated NAV per share provided by OFS Credit Company offers a snapshot of the company's financial position as of a specific date. It is important to note that this is an unaudited estimate and may not fully capture the financial health of the company. Investors should be aware that the final audited NAV could be materially different.When considering the impact of external factors such as interest and inflation rates, geopolitical tensions and banking system instability, it becomes clear that the valuation of CLO equity and debt securities could be volatile. These securities are sensitive to changes in market conditions and any adverse developments could affect the company's investment income and underlying asset values.Investors should also consider the broader implications of a potential recession or government shutdown, as these could lead to increased market volatility and impact the performance of financial instruments like CLOs. The company's mention of these risks suggests a cautious outlook on future financial conditions. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, the company's disclosure highlights several key areas of concern that could affect its portfolio. Elevated interest rates typically increase the cost of borrowing, which can affect the performance of loan obligations. Similarly, inflation can erode the real returns on investments.The mention of geopolitical conflicts and their potential to impact financial markets is a reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. Such events can lead to credit downgrades or defaults within the CLO space, which would directly impact OFS Credit's portfolio.Additionally, the instability in the banking system and the risk of recession are factors that could lead to tighter credit conditions and reduced liquidity. This could affect the company's ability to manage its portfolio effectively and could lead to a revaluation of its assets. Market Research Analyst For investors, the long-term trends in the CLO market are just as important as the current NAV estimate. While the immediate estimate provides a near-term valuation reference, the potential for adverse impacts from various macroeconomic and geopolitical risks must be factored into any investment decision.Investors should consider the historical performance of CLOs during similar periods of economic stress. Past performance can offer insights into how these securities might behave under current market conditions. It's also essential to monitor the actions of central banks and governments as their policies could have significant implications for interest rates and inflation, which in turn affect the CLO market.In the context of the ongoing conflicts and potential economic downturns mentioned by OFS Credit, investors would do well to keep a close eye on the company's portfolio management strategies and how they might adapt to a rapidly changing economic landscape. 03/15/2024 - 04:00 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFS Credit Company, Inc.

The year ended with increased revenues but a net loss. The balance sheet showed cash and cash equivalents of $90.3 million, securities available for sale of $44.6 million, and total assets of $674.2 million. Positive None. Negative The financial results for Q4 and the year ended December 31, 2023, showed a decrease in revenues and a net loss compared to the previous year. The diluted loss per share for both Q4 and the year ended December 31, 2023, was significant compared to the previous year. Despite having cash and cash equivalents of $90.3 million, the company reported a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Analyst BBX Capital's financial results for Q4 2023 show a stark contrast to the previous year, with a significant shift from profitability to a loss. The reported net loss of $(12.9) million compared to a net income of $15.4 million in Q4 2022 indicates a substantial downturn. The diluted loss per share of $(0.88) is a key figure for shareholders, as it directly affects the value of their investments. This performance may trigger a review of the company's valuation, investment risk profile and future earnings potential. The year-over-year revenue increase to $401.3 million suggests that while the company is growing its top line, it struggles to translate this into bottom-line profitability, possibly due to increased costs or inefficiencies.On the balance sheet, a healthy cash position and securities available for sale provide liquidity, which could cushion operational setbacks and support strategic initiatives. However, the prepayment of the note receivable from Bluegreen Vacations in January 2024, after the reporting period, will affect liquidity and should be monitored for its impact on cash flows. The increase in total assets and a stable shareholders' equity position are positive signs but must be weighed against the loss-making performance.Investors should consider these figures in light of the company's sectors of operation, such as real estate and consumer goods, which may face industry-specific challenges. The fully diluted book value per share of $21.59 provides a snapshot of the company's net worth from a shareholder's perspective, but the recent losses may affect investor confidence and the stock's market performance. Market Research Analyst The financial downturn reported by BBX Capital could be indicative of broader market trends or sector-specific headwinds. The company's segments, including BBX Capital Real Estate, BBX Sweet Holdings and Renin, operate in markets that may be susceptible to economic fluctuations, consumer spending patterns and interest rate changes. The decline in net income year-over-year suggests that the company may not be adequately hedged against these factors or may be experiencing operational inefficiencies.An in-depth analysis of the company's business operations and investments, as detailed in their Annual Report, is essential to understand the root causes of the reported losses. Stakeholders should assess the company's strategic response to these challenges, such as cost management, product diversification and market expansion strategies. The impact of these financial results on BBX Capital's stock will depend on investor sentiment, which in turn is influenced by the company's ability to articulate and implement a clear path to profitability.Given the competitive landscape of the industries BBX Capital operates in, it is important for the company to benchmark its performance against peers and industry averages. This will provide a clearer picture of whether BBX Capital's financial results are an outlier or in line with sector performance. Such comparative analysis can inform investment decisions and strategic planning. 03/15/2024 - 04:04 PM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BBX Capital, Inc.

Please refer to the Presidentâs letter and footnotes in the 2023 Annual Report for relevant management discussion and analysis. C. The Company successfully terminated two defined benefit pension plans on December 18, 2023; only a small SERP plan remains. The Company annually contributed an average of $4.7 million to these plans during 2018â2022, a use of cash that will not be required in the future. The 2023 termination of these plans required an additional cash contribution of $11.1 million and resulted in a non-cash reduction of pretax earnings of $41.8 million. This non-cash settlement charge resulted in a 2023 net loss of $9.9 million. Excluding this settlement charge, net income would have been a record of $21.0 million. D. The pre-tax results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were favorably affected by a $0.5 million decrease in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, were unfavorably affected by a $83,000 increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the three months ended December 31, 2022, were unfavorably affected by a $0.4 million increase in the LIFO reserve. The pre-tax results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were unfavorably affected by a $4.8 million increase in the LIFO reserve. E. The consolidated financials are affected by the euro to dollar exchange rate when consolidating Mueller B.V., the Dutch subsidiary. The month end euro to dollar exchange rate was $1.07 for December, 2022 and $1.10 for December, 2023, respectively.

All statements regarding future performance growth, conditions, or developments are forward-looking statements.

Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent. The company plans to use the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement concluded by Gaxos.ai signifies a strategic move to bolster its working capital and support general corporate functions. The decision to issue both common stock and series A and B warrants reveals a multifaceted approach to financing, which could appeal to a diverse pool of investors. The exercise price of $5.50 for the warrants, set below the purchase price, might incentivize early exercise, potentially leading to an influx of funds but also to dilution of existing shares.It's noteworthy that the gross proceeds stand at $3.5 million. This figure, in relation to the company's market cap and operational burn rate, could offer insights into the sufficiency of the capital raised. Investors should monitor the subsequent deployment of these funds into the company's AI development initiatives to gauge the effectiveness of this capital infusion. Legal Expert The offering's compliance with Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D is important for legal validity, as it allows the company to bypass the lengthy public offering process. The private placement nature of the deal restricts the sale of securities to accredited investors, which could limit market liquidity and impact the stock's volatility. The commitment to file a resale registration statement is also significant, as it obligates Gaxos to facilitate the future liquidity of these securities, a move that's generally well-received by the market. Market Research Analyst Gaxos.ai's focus on AI applications across various sectors positions it within a high-growth industry. However, the relatively modest size of the offering compared to industry giants suggests that Gaxos is still in the growth phase of its business cycle. The market's response to this offering will likely hinge on confidence in Gaxos's future revenue streams and its ability to convert AI research into profitable products. The presence of H.C. Wainwright & Co. as the placement agent adds a layer of credibility to the transaction, which may influence investor sentiment. 03/15/2024 - 04:01 PM Roseland, NJ, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gaxos.ai Inc.

The series A warrants and short-term series B warrants have an exercise price of $5.50 per share and are exercisable immediately upon issuance. The series A warrants expire five and one-half years from the date of issuance and short-term series B warrants expire twenty-four months from the date of issuance. H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.

(NYSE: FF) (âFutureFuelâ), a manufacturer of custom and performance chemicals and biofuels, today issued the following update with respect to its $2.50 per share special cash dividend approved by FutureFuelâs Board of Directors and previously announced on March 14, 2024 (the âSpecial Dividendâ). The rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the âNYSEâ) require that special dividends representing 25% or more of the stock price of a listed security, such as the Special Dividend, be subject to an ex-dividend date of one business day after the payment date. Accordingly, as the payment date for the Special Dividend is April 9, 2024, the NYSE has set the ex-dividend date for the Special Dividend to be April 10, 2024. In addition, FutureFuel understands that trades of FutureFuelâs common stock entered into during the period (the âdue bill periodâ) beginning March 25, 2024 (the business day before the record date for the Special Dividend) and through April 9, 2024 will have a due bill attached for the Special Dividend. Due bills obligate sellers of FutureFuel common stock to deliver the Special Dividend to the buyer. This means that persons who purchase FutureFuel common stock during the due bill period (even if the trade will settle after the due bill period) are entitled to receive the Special Dividend, and persons who sell the stock during the due bill period (even if the trade will settle after the due bill period) are not entitled to the Special Dividend. Accordingly, if an investor wishes to receive the Special Dividend, the investor will need to hold the securities through and including the payment date of April 9, 2024. The due bill obligations are settled customarily between the brokers representing the buyers and sellers of the stock. Buyers and sellers of FutureFuel common stock should consult with their broker before trading to ensure they understand the effect of NYSEâs due bill procedures. FutureFuel has no obligations for either the amount of the due bill or the processing of the due bill.

(NBH) declares a distribution of $0.03774 per share of common stock, payable on April 15, 2024. The Fund aims to provide tax-exempt income, subject to federal alternative minimum tax. Investors should note Section 19 compliance and the breakdown of distribution components. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Neuberger Berman Municipal Fund Inc. regarding the distribution of $0.03774 per share represents a routine action for closed-end funds, designed to provide shareholders with regular income. The distribution's tax-exempt status aligns with the fund's objective to deliver federal income tax-exempt earnings, appealing to investors seeking tax-efficient income streams.However, the potential applicability of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a vital consideration for investors, as it can affect the net benefit of the distribution. The mention of a Section 19 notice indicates transparency in reporting and an effort to inform shareholders of the composition of distributions, which is essential for accurate tax planning and assessment of investment performance.From a market perspective, the distribution amount and its consistency are factors that can influence the fund's attractiveness and, consequently, its stock price. Regular and predictable distributions can lead to a stable investor base, while variability might signal changes in the fund's income-generating ability. The long-term impact of such distributions on the fund's net asset value (NAV) and stock market performance should be monitored, as substantial return of capital could indicate a depletion of assets, potentially affecting future income. Tax Expert The tax implications of the Neuberger Berman Municipal Fund's distributions are significant for individual investors. The fund's focus on income exempt from regular federal income tax is a strategic advantage for those in higher tax brackets. However, the mention of the distribution's potential subjectivity to the federal AMT underscores the complexity of tax planning for investors.Investors must evaluate their AMT exposure, as this could diminish the tax benefits typically associated with municipal bond investments. The distribution's composition, which may include net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, will ultimately determine the tax obligation. The return of capital, for instance, is not immediately taxable but reduces the shareholder's cost basis, potentially resulting in higher capital gains taxes upon sale of the shares.Understanding the nuances of these tax characteristics is essential for investors to accurately calculate their expected after-tax return and make informed investment decisions. The fund's commitment to providing a Section 19 notice is a proactive step in aiding shareholders' tax planning efforts. 03/15/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Neuberger Berman Municipal Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NBH) has announced a distribution declaration of $0.03774 per share of common stock. The distribution announced today is payable on April 15, 2024, has a record date of March 28, 2024, and has an ex-date of March 27, 2024. The Fund seeks to provide income that is exempt from regular federal income tax. Distributions of the Fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for some stockholders. In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. The notice would be for informational purposes and not for tax reporting purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of the year.

Virax Biolabs Announces Receipt of NASDAQ Notification Letter Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency,2024-03-15T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Virax Biolabs Group  (NASDAQ: VRAX) received a notice from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The company has 180 days to regain compliance or face potential delisting.,"Virax Biolabs Announces Receipt of NASDAQ Notification Letter Regarding Minimum Bid Price Deficiency Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Virax Biolabs Group (NASDAQ: VRAX) received a notice from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The company has 180 days to regain compliance or face potential delisting. Positive None. Negative The non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement poses a risk of potential delisting if not rectified within the specified timeframe. Financial Analyst The notification received by Virax Biolabs from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is a significant indicator of the company's market valuation struggles. From a financial perspective, consistently trading below $1 suggests a bearish sentiment among investors and may be indicative of underlying financial or operational challenges the company is facing. It is imperative to monitor the company's stock price movements closely in the coming months as they attempt to regain compliance.For shareholders, the risk of delisting can be concerning as it often leads to reduced liquidity and investor interest. However, the 180-day grace period provides a window for the company to address the issue, potentially through strategic initiatives such as a reverse stock split or improving financial performance to boost investor confidence. The additional grace period, if needed and granted, could offer further reprieve but also signals a protracted period of uncertainty. Market Research Analyst Delisting warnings are not uncommon in volatile sectors like biotechnology, where companies often face significant R&D costs and uncertain revenue streams. The market typically reacts to such notifications with increased volatility in the affected company's stock. Investors and potential investors should consider the broader industry trends, including the success rate of biotech firms in overcoming similar challenges. The ability of Virax Biolabs to navigate through this compliance issue will serve as a bellwether for their operational resilience and strategic planning.Furthermore, examining peer companies that have faced similar notices could offer insights into potential outcomes and strategies that Virax might employ. The company's response to the notice will be critical in maintaining its listing status and could involve measures that may affect its capital structure or market perception. Legal Expert The legal implications of a Nasdaq delisting notice are procedural yet significant for Virax Biolabs. The company must adhere to the regulatory framework set by Nasdaq to avoid delisting, which includes maintaining a minimum bid price. The notice serves as a formal warning and sets in motion a timeline for compliance that the company must follow.It is important to understand the legal processes involved in regaining compliance, such as the possibility of appealing a delisting decision or requesting an extension of the grace period. Additionally, the company's disclosures to shareholders regarding this notice and their plans to address it will be closely scrutinized for regulatory compliance and potential impact on shareholder value. 03/15/2024 - 04:30 PM LONDON, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Virax Biolabs Group Limited (NASDAQ: VRAX) (""Virax"" or the ""Company""), an innovative biotechnology company focused on the detection of immune responses and diagnosis of viral diseases, announced that it received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") dated March 13, 2024, notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as set forth under NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2)(the ""Minimum Bid Price Rule"") for continued listing on the NASDAQ.

In the event the Company does not regain compliance by September 9, 2024, the Company may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day grace period.

Receives Nasdaq Notifications Regarding Market Value of Listed Securities and Market Value of Publicly Held Shares Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Psyence Biomedical (PBM) received deficiency notifications from Nasdaq regarding its Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) and Market Value of Publicly Held Shares (MVPHS) being below required minimums. The company has 180 days to regain compliance by increasing its market values. Failure to comply may lead to delisting. Positive None. Negative The company's market values have been below the required minimums for 30 consecutive business days, indicating financial challenges. There is uncertainty regarding the company's ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards within the given timeframe. Market Analyst The notification received by Psyence Biomedical Ltd. regarding its non-compliance with Nasdaq's Market Value of Listed Securities and Market Value of Publicly Held Shares standards is a significant indicator of the company's current market perception and financial health. A company's market value is often reflective of its operational efficiency, growth prospects and investor confidence. Falling below the minimum threshold for Nasdaq listing not only puts the company at risk of being delisted, which can severely limit its access to capital and increase the cost of funding, but also sends a negative signal to the market.Investors and stakeholders should monitor how the company plans to address this issue. Strategies may include financial restructuring, strategic partnerships, or other measures to enhance value and investor interest. The company's ability to regain compliance will be important in maintaining its listing status and providing reassurance to investors. The 180-day grace period gives the company time to implement these measures, but it also creates a time-bound pressure to show tangible improvements. Investment Strategist For investors, the notices from Nasdaq serve as a cautionary tale about the liquidity and stability of Psyence Biomedical's stock. The MVLS and MVPHS are critical metrics because they reflect not only the company's capitalization but also the breadth and depth of its investor base. A low MVPHS, in particular, suggests that a significant portion of the company's shares are potentially concentrated in the hands of a few stakeholders, which can exacerbate volatility and reduce market liquidity.The company's next steps, including any potential equity offerings or strategic actions to boost its share price and market value, could lead to dilution of existing shareholders' interests. While the pursuit of compliance is vital for the company's continued listing, it's important for investors to assess the potential impact of any corrective measures on their holdings. Long-term investors might view a successful turnaround strategy positively, but there is also a risk of short-term turbulence as the market reacts to the company's efforts to regain compliance. Corporate Governance Advisor Psyence Biomedical's situation underscores the importance of robust corporate governance and proactive management in addressing market compliance issues. The company's response to the Nasdaq notices will be telling of its governance quality. Transparent communication with shareholders about the steps being taken to regain compliance is key. Additionally, the board of directors should be involved in reviewing the company's strategic options, ensuring that any decisions made are in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.Shareholders should look for signs of strong leadership and a clear strategic vision during this period. The management's track record in dealing with past compliance or financial challenges can also provide valuable context for current actions. It is not uncommon for companies in similar situations to explore options such as reverse stock splits or asset sales to increase their market value. These decisions will have to be weighed carefully for their potential to either stabilize the company's market position or, conversely, to create further disruption. 03/15/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Psyence Biomedical Ltd.

(RDN) announced the redemption price of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2025. The principal amount outstanding is $525,000,000, with a total redemption amount of $527,079,000. The Notes will cease to accrue interest after March 19, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The redemption of Radian Group Inc.'s 6.625% Senior Notes due 2025 represents a strategic financial maneuver that could be indicative of the company's liquidity and debt management strategy. By redeeming these notes at slightly above par value, Radian is potentially signaling a healthy cash position, allowing them to return capital to note holders. This action may also suggest that Radian is optimizing its capital structure, possibly reducing interest expenses if the redeemed debt carries a higher cost compared to current market rates.Investors should consider the impact on the company's interest expense going forward, as the cessation of interest accrual post-redemption could improve net income in subsequent quarters. However, it is important to assess the source of funds used for this redemption, as utilizing cash reserves could affect the company's financial flexibility. Conversely, if the redemption is financed through new debt issuance, the terms of the new debt relative to the redeemed notes will be of interest. Debt Market Analyst The redemption of the 6.625% Senior Notes by Radian Group Inc. is a noteworthy event in the debt market, as it may influence the company's bond yield and credit spread. By redeeming the notes at a premium, the company is providing a slight gain to bondholders, which could positively affect market perception and potentially improve the terms on which Radian can issue new debt in the future.Market participants should monitor the response of credit rating agencies to this redemption, as it could lead to an adjustment in Radian's credit rating. A positive reassessment could lower borrowing costs and enhance the company's ability to raise capital. It is also important to analyze the redemption's timing and rationale in the context of the broader interest rate environment and the company's operational performance. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the redemption of senior notes by Radian Group Inc. can be interpreted as a signal of the company's broader strategic intentions. This move may reflect Radian's confidence in its future cash flows and operational stability. It could also be a preemptive step in response to anticipated changes in the economic landscape, such as interest rate fluctuations or shifts in the housing market, which is closely tied to Radian's core mortgage insurance business.Analyzing the company's past redemption activities and comparing them with industry peers can provide insights into Radian's financial management practices. Stakeholders should consider how this redemption aligns with the company's long-term financial planning and whether it suggests a shift towards a more conservative or aggressive financial policy. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM WAYNE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Radian Group Inc.

(AHR) declares a quarterly distribution of $0.25 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, payable on April 19, 2024. Shareholders of common stock, Class T common stock, and Class I common stock as of March 28, 2024, will receive the distribution. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly distribution of $0.25 per share by American Healthcare REIT, Inc. is a reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to return capital to shareholders. This distribution is particularly significant as it represents a direct impact on shareholder value. Investors often look at dividend yields and distribution rates as indicators of a company's stability and profitability.From a financial perspective, the consistency and sustainability of dividend payments are key factors. If the distribution amount is in line with previous quarters, it suggests stability; however, if there has been a significant increase or decrease, it might indicate a change in the company's earnings or capital allocation strategy. In the case of REITs, the distribution is also a tax consideration, as they are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually.It's important to analyze the distribution in the context of the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high might not be sustainable in the long run, whereas a low ratio could suggest that the company is retaining earnings for growth. The impact of this distribution on the company's stock performance will depend on how it aligns with market expectations and the perceived sustainability of these payments. Market Research Analyst Announcements of distributions can influence investor sentiment and stock market performance. For instance, a distribution announcement by American Healthcare REIT, Inc. may attract income-focused investors, potentially increasing demand for the stock. This can be particularly true for sectors like REITs, which are known for providing regular income streams.However, the market's reaction can also be influenced by the broader economic context, including interest rate trends and the health of the real estate market. In a low-interest-rate environment, REIT distributions can be more attractive relative to fixed-income alternatives, potentially boosting the stock's appeal. Conversely, in a rising interest rate environment, the relative attractiveness might diminish.Furthermore, the specific segment of healthcare real estate must be considered. Factors such as demographic trends, healthcare policy changes and the overall state of the healthcare industry can impact the performance of healthcare REITs. Investors would do well to consider how these macroeconomic and sector-specific factors might influence the performance of American Healthcare REIT, Inc. following the distribution announcement. 03/15/2024 - 04:22 PM IRVINE, Calif., March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Healthcare REIT, Inc.

The collaboration aims to optimize swine production globally.,"FarmSee Ltd Announces the Completion of a Minority Investment in its Swine Monitoring Platform Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FarmSee partners with MSD Animal Health to integrate AI-based weighing technology for swine monitoring. The collaboration aims to optimize swine production globally. Positive None. Negative None. Agricultural Technology Analyst The partnership between FarmSee and MSD Animal Health represents a significant advancement in the agricultural technology sector, particularly within the precision livestock farming niche. The integration of AI-driven solutions into animal health and monitoring systems is increasingly seen as pivotal for improving production efficiency and animal welfare. FarmSee's computer vision technology, which facilitates the continuous and precise monitoring of individual swine weight, is expected to enable swine producers to make more informed decisions regarding feed management, health interventions and overall herd management.From a financial perspective, this collaboration could potentially lead to increased revenue streams for both FarmSee and MSD Animal Health by broadening their product offerings and enhancing their competitive edge in the market. The investment from MSD Animal Health in FarmSee's A round also underscores the growing interest and capital influx in AgTech innovations that promise to optimize agricultural operations. However, the success of this venture will depend on the technology's adoption rate, its integration into existing farm infrastructures and the tangible benefits realized by end-users in terms of cost savings and productivity gains. Livestock Production Expert Integrating advanced AI solutions into the swine production process can lead to several transformative outcomes. Firstly, the ability to monitor weight continuously allows for the early detection of health issues, potentially reducing mortality rates and the need for antibiotics, aligning with the broader industry trend towards sustainable and responsible farming practices. Furthermore, precise weight monitoring is important for optimizing feed conversion ratios, a key factor in profitability for swine producers. By tailoring feeding programs to the individual animal's needs, producers can significantly reduce feed waste and improve growth performance.However, the adoption of such technology raises questions about the required investment in terms of cost and the potential need for training personnel to interpret and act on the data provided.

Shareholders can access it online or request a hard copy for free. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The filing of Globus Maritime Limited's annual report on Form 20-F is a significant disclosure, as it offers a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health for the past fiscal year. Investors and analysts scrutinize such documents for insights into the company's profitability, asset management and cash flow status. Notably, the dry bulk shipping industry is sensitive to global economic conditions and these reports can shed light on how companies are navigating challenges such as fluctuating demand, fuel prices and regulatory changes.One key aspect to examine is the company's revenue and profit margins. In a sector where operational costs can be highly variable, the ability to maintain or improve profit margins is indicative of effective management. Additionally, the balance sheet details are critical, especially the debt-to-equity ratio, which can signal the company's financial leverage and risk profile. Shareholders and potential investors should also pay attention to the cash flow statement, as it reveals the company's liquidity and its ability to fund operations, pay dividends, or invest in fleet expansion. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market trends is essential when analyzing the impact of Globus Maritime's financial results. The dry bulk shipping market is largely driven by international trade volumes, particularly in commodities like iron ore, coal and grains. Any shifts in these markets can have a direct impact on shipping rates and, consequently, on a shipping company's performance. For instance, a slowdown in construction activity in major economies can reduce the demand for iron ore and coal, affecting the bottom line for dry bulk shippers.Additionally, the environmental regulations are becoming increasingly stringent in the maritime industry, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) imposing lower sulfur emissions standards. Companies that have invested in newer, more efficient fleets or retrofitted their ships to comply with these regulations may have a competitive advantage. It's also important to consider the state of the global fleet and the supply-demand balance; an oversupply of ships can depress rates, while a tight supply can lead to higher earnings. 03/15/2024 - 04:21 PM GLYFADA, Greece, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Globus Maritime Limited (""Globus,"" the âCompany,"" âwe,â or âourâ), (NASDAQ: GLBS), a dry bulk shipping company, announced today that the Companyâs annual report on Form 20-F that contains the Companyâs audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and may be found on the Companyâs website at www.globusmaritime.gr under Investor Relations.

(STWD) declares a dividend of $0.48 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, payable on April 15, 2024. Stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024, will receive the dividend. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a $0.48 per share dividend by Starwood Property Trust, Inc. is a tangible return to its shareholders and indicates the company's current cash flow status. Dividends are often a sign of a company's financial health and its ability to generate cash. Investors typically view regular and consistent dividends as a positive signal, suggesting stability and a shareholder-friendly policy.However, it's essential to compare this dividend declaration with the company's previous payouts, payout ratio and earnings. If the current dividend represents an increase, it may suggest that the company is experiencing growth in earnings or has a positive outlook for future earnings. Conversely, if the dividend has decreased or remained stagnant over time, it could raise questions about the company's growth prospects or earnings stability.Additionally, the payout ratio (the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends) is critical. A ratio that is too high may not be sustainable in the long run, while a ratio that is too low may indicate that the company is retaining more earnings for reinvestment. In the context of the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry, which Starwood Property Trust operates within, a high payout ratio is common due to the requirement to distribute at least 90% of taxable income to shareholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the declaration of a dividend can have several implications. For one, it can attract income-focused investors who are looking for steady income streams, particularly in a volatile market. This can potentially increase the demand for the company's stock. Additionally, the ex-dividend date, which in this case is prior to March 29, 2024, is important for investors, as they must own the stock before this date to be eligible for the dividend payment.It's also worth noting the yield, which is the dividend expressed as a percentage of the current share price. The yield provides a measure of the income return on an investment and is an important metric for comparing the attractiveness of different dividend-paying stocks. If Starwood's yield is competitive relative to industry peers and other investment opportunities, it could bolster the stock's appeal in the eyes of investors seeking income. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Understanding the specific context of REITs is essential when analyzing dividend announcements. REITs are known for offering higher dividends than many other sectors due to their structure, which requires them to distribute a significant portion of income to shareholders. This distribution is often in the form of dividends. For Starwood Property Trust, a key factor would be the quality of its real estate portfolio, the occupancy rates and the stability of its rental income, as these are direct indicators of the company's ability to maintain or increase its dividend in the future.Investors also look at the funds from operations (FFO), a key metric for REITs that measures the cash generated by their operations. A strong FFO can support ongoing dividend payments and potential increases. Conversely, a declining FFO may signal trouble ahead for dividend sustainability. Therefore, while the dividend announcement is positive, a deeper dive into Starwood's operational metrics and real estate market trends would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the company's long-term dividend-paying capacity. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM GREENWICH, Conn., March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Starwood Property Trust, Inc.

(SAFE) declares common stock dividends of $0.177 per share for Q1 2024, with an annualized rate of $0.708 per share, payable on April 15, 2024.","Safehold Declares First Quarter 2024 Common Stock Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Safehold Inc. (SAFE) declares common stock dividends of $0.177 per share for Q1 2024, with an annualized rate of $0.708 per share, payable on April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a dividend by Safehold Inc. is a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. Dividends are a portion of a company's earnings that are distributed to shareholders. In this case, the announced quarterly dividend of $0.177 per share equates to an annualized rate of $0.708 per share. This figure is important for investors as it provides insight into the company's current profitability and its ability to generate cash flow. Furthermore, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividend per share by the stock's current price, is a key metric for comparing the income-generating potential of different stocks.Investors typically view regular and consistent dividends as a sign of a company's financial health and stability. A steady dividend can attract income-focused investors and potentially stabilize the stock price. However, it's important to consider the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid out as dividends. A payout ratio that is too high may not be sustainable in the long run, while a too low ratio might indicate that the company is reinvesting most of its earnings into growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Safehold Inc.'s dividend announcement could be interpreted as a signal of confidence by the company's management in its financial position and outlook. Dividends are often seen as a transparent way for companies to return value to shareholders and they can enhance the attractiveness of a stock in a portfolio, especially in a low-interest-rate environment where alternative income sources may be limited.It's also important to analyze the dividend in the context of the company's industry and historical performance. For example, real estate investment trusts (REITs) typically distribute a higher percentage of their income as dividends due to their structure and tax considerations. Comparing Safehold Inc.'s dividend yield and growth to its peers can provide a deeper understanding of its competitive position. Additionally, the timing of dividend payments and the record date are essential for investors to ensure they qualify for the upcoming distribution. 03/15/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Safehold Inc.

This niche area of cancer treatment has been gaining traction and Calidi's focus on developing treatments for metastatic ovarian cancer and high-grade glioma positions it within a significant market segment with unmet medical needs. The $5.3 million award earmarked for preclinical and clinical trial design advances is a critical step in bringing these innovative therapies closer to market.Calidi's reported net loss for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023, while not uncommon for clinical-stage biotech companies, does raise questions about the company's runway and its ability to sustain operations without additional capital infusion. The increased R&D expenses reflect the company's investment in its pipeline but also put pressure on its financial resources. Investors should monitor the company's capital-raising efforts and the outcomes of its upcoming clinical trials to assess the potential for future value creation.The issuance of a new U.S. patent covering the SuperNova technology platform suggests a strategic emphasis on building a robust intellectual property portfolio, which is vital for competitive advantage in the biotech industry. However, the practical implications of this patent for revenue generation remain to be seen, as the clinical trial for the platform is not expected to commence until the second half of 2024. Financial Analyst Calidi Biotherapeutics' financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023 indicate a significant increase in both R&D and G&A expenses, which is reflective of the company's growth phase and strategic investments in its product pipeline. However, the net loss widening year-over-year, coupled with a relatively modest cash position, suggests the need for careful financial management and possibly additional capital raises in the near future.The increase in share count, as implied by the lower loss per share despite a higher net loss, may suggest that the company has been issuing more shares to raise funds, which can lead to dilution for existing shareholders. The cash reserves, while improved from the previous year, still indicate a limited runway, necessitating a close watch on the company's burn rate and funding strategies.Investors should consider the risks associated with the biotechnology sector, where long development timelines and regulatory hurdles can impact the stock's performance. The anticipation of clinical trial updates can drive volatility in the stock price and positive results could provide catalysts for value appreciation. Conversely, any setbacks in the trials could have a detrimental effect on investor sentiment. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The strategic collaboration with City of Hope and the investment from CIRM in Calidi Biotherapeutics underscores the potential of oncolytic virotherapy as a promising avenue in cancer treatment. The focus on metastatic ovarian cancer and high-grade glioma, both of which are cancers with high mortality rates and limited effective treatments, suggests that Calidi is targeting areas of significant unmet medical need, which could translate to substantial clinical impact if their therapies prove to be effective.The development of the RTNova systemic delivery approach reflects an innovative step in making oncolytic virotherapy more accessible and potentially more effective for patients with advanced solid tumors. The ability to shield the viral payload from the immune system is a key challenge in this field and Calidi's preclinical success with the SuperNova platform could represent a major advancement, though the true test will come with clinical trial results.Given the complexity of oncolytic virotherapy, the upcoming interim clinical updates will be important in evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of Calidi's treatments. The long-term impact on the oncology treatment landscape will depend on these clinical outcomes, as well as the company's ability to navigate the regulatory pathway and eventually bring these treatments to market. 03/15/2024 - 04:05 PM City of Hope, a leader in cancer research and treatment, was awarded $5.3 million from California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) to develop a treatment for metastatic ovarian cancer using Calidiâs licensed lead asset, NeuroNova (CLD-101) Announced novel systemic enveloped oncolytic virotherapy platform, RTNova, designed to target diverse tumor types Strengthened team with the appointment of three new members to Scientific and Medical Advisory Board and one member to Board of Directors Issued new U.S. patent covering novel SuperNova (CLD-201) technology platform SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Calidi Biotherapeutics Inc. (NYSE American: CLDI) (âCalidiâ), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a new generation of targeted immunotherapies, today reported its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 operating and financial results and reviewed recent business highlights. âCalidi continues to make great progress across our development programs while continuing to innovate and expand our industry-leading position in cell-based immunotherapies,â said Allan Camaisa, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Calidi Biotherapeutics. âWe anticipate reporting an interim clinical update from our Phase 1 trial evaluating CLD-101 in high-grade glioma patients in collaboration with City of Hope in the second quarter of this year assuming we are successful in raising additional capital, and we were thrilled to recently strengthen our collaboration with City of Hope to evaluate CLD-101 for the treatment of ovarian cancer with the support of CIRM.

(NASDAQ: SOND) announces a delay in releasing its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results due to accounting errors. The company identified errors related to the valuation and impairment of operating lease right of use assets for fiscal years 2022 and 2023. The restatements are expected to increase the net loss and loss per share for the impacted periods. Sonder also provided estimated financial highlights for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Positive None. Negative The delay in announcing financial results due to accounting errors may lead to a loss of investor confidence. Restating financial statements can be time-consuming and costly for the company. The increase in net loss and loss per share could impact the company's stock performance negatively. Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow show significant negative figures for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The amount of Total Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash may raise concerns about the company's liquidity position. Financial Analyst The disclosure by Sonder Holdings Inc. concerning the delay in announcing its financial results due to accounting errors is a significant concern for investors and analysts. The restatement of financials often leads to increased volatility in a company's stock as it undermines investor confidence. The non-cash nature of the errors related to operating lease right of use assets means that while there is no immediate cash impact, the adjustments will inflate reported net losses, potentially affecting valuation multiples and investor sentiment.Additionally, the preliminary revenue and occupancy rates indicate a stable demand for Sonder's services, but the negative operating and free cash flow figures raise questions about the company's cash burn and sustainability of its business model. The substantial amount of restricted cash also implies that not all of the company's liquidity is readily available for operational needs, which could be a red flag for liquidity risk assessment. Investors will be closely monitoring the restated financials for any signs of deeper underlying issues that could affect future performance. Accounting Expert From an accounting perspective, the valuation and impairment of operating lease right of use assets are critical areas that require meticulous attention, as they can significantly affect a company's balance sheet and financial ratios. The identification of errors for two consecutive fiscal years suggests a possible weakness in Sonder's internal controls over financial reporting, which may necessitate a more in-depth review by auditors and regulators. It is essential for stakeholders to understand the magnitude of these errors and the company's plans to strengthen its accounting practices to prevent future discrepancies.The reported unaudited figures, such as Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) and occupancy rates, provide a snapshot of operational performance, yet the restatements could lead to adjustments in these metrics. Investors should also be cautious of the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures like free cash flow excluding certain costs, as these can sometimes provide a rosier picture than GAAP measures and may not be directly comparable to other companies in the industry. Hospitality Industry Analyst In the hospitality sector, metrics like RevPAR and occupancy rates are key indicators of a company's performance. Sonder's reported figures suggest competitive performance in these areas, which is encouraging given the industry's recovery from the pandemic. However, the negative cash flow metrics indicate that despite strong demand, the company may be facing challenges with cost management or capital expenditures, which are important for long-term sustainability in this capital-intensive industry.The reference to 'Live Units' and 'Total Portfolio' suggests expansion in Sonder's property offerings, which can be a double-edged sword. While growth is positive, it must be balanced against the costs of acquiring and maintaining these properties. The company's strategy and execution in scaling its operations while managing expenses will be critical in determining its ability to achieve profitability and deliver value to shareholders. 03/15/2024 - 04:07 PM SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Sonder Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SOND, âSonderâ or the âCompanyâ), a leading next-generation hospitality company that is redefining the guest experience through technology and design, today announced that it will delay the announcement of its fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. The Company recently identified accounting errors related to the valuation and impairment of operating lease right of use assets and related items for the fiscal years 2022 and 2023. The Company requires additional time to restate 2022 and 2023 financial statements (âAffected Financial Statementsâ) for certain previously disclosed periods (âNon-Reliance Periodsâ) as described in the Companyâs Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 15, 2024. The foregoing operating lease right of use assets and related item errors are non-cash in nature and will not impact the Companyâs reported cash balances or statements of cash flows for the Non-Reliance Periods. The Company expects that the restatements will increase the Companyâs overall net loss and loss per share in the impacted periods. The Company intends to file its restated Affected Financial Statements as soon as practicable. Today, Sonder also announced the following estimated and unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2023 highlights: Revenue was approximately $164 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $603 million for the full year 2023 RevPAR was approximately $150 for the fourth quarter and approximately $151 for the full year 2023 Occupancy Rate was 82% for the fourth quarter and 82% for the full year 2023 Bookable Nights were 1,092,000 for the fourth quarter and 3,995,000 for the full year 2023 Operating Cash Flow1 was approximately $(34) million for the fourth quarter and approximately $(108) million for the full year 2023 Free Cash Flow (excluding restructuring costs and lease termination costs)2 was approximately $(35) million for the fourth quarter and approximately $(119) million for the full year 2023 Total Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash was approximately $136.5 million, which included approximately $40.7 million of restricted cash as of December 31, 2023 Live Units were 12,200 as of December 31, 2023 Total Portfolio was 16,000 as of December 31, 2023 The Company currently expects that its final results of operations and other data will be consistent with the estimates set forth above, but such estimates are preliminary and its actual results of operations and other data could differ materially from these estimates due to the completion of its financial closing procedures, final adjustments, the restatement, and other developments that may arise between now and the time its audited consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company will issue a further press release when a date and time for its fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings release and investor conference call has been determined. 1 Operating Cash Flow includes the impact of restructuring and other charges related to reductions in force as well as the impact of charges related to lease terminations. Operating Cash Flow is equivalent to cash used in operating activities. 2 This is a Non-GAAP Financial Measure.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Reconciliation of Cash Used in Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (âFCFâ) (in thousands) Quarter ended December 31, 2023 Year ended December 31, 2023 Cash used in operating activities $ (33,610 ) $ (107,648 ) Cash used in investing activities (2,381 ) (14,486 ) FCF, including restructuring costs and lease termination costs (35,991 ) (122,134 ) Cash paid for restructuring costs - 2,150 Cash paid for lease termination costs 1,026 1,026 FCF, excluding restructuring costs and lease termination costs $ (34,965 ) $ (118,958 ) Definitions Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow (âFCFâ) is defined as cash used in operating activities plus cash used in investing activities adjusted to exclude restructuring costs and lease termination costs. Free Cash Flow is a supplemental measure that is not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (âGAAPâ). The most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are cash used in operating activities when combined with cash used in investing activities. The Company believes FCF, which as presented excludes restructuring costs and lease termination costs, is meaningful to investors as it is a primary liquidity measure that the Company focuses on internally to evaluate its progress towards delivering sustainable positive free cash flow. Sonderâs FCF may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies due to different methods of calculation. Presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this measure may not provide a complete understanding of the Companyâs cash flow as a whole. As such, these measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the Companyâs GAAP cash flow. RevPAR Revenue Per Available Room (âRevPARâ) represents the average revenue earned per available night, and is calculated either by dividing revenue by Bookable Nights, or by multiplying Average Daily Rate by Occupancy Rate. Average Daily Rate (âADRâ) represents the average revenue earned per night occupied and is calculated as revenue divided by Occupied Nights. Occupancy Rate is defined as Occupied Nights divided by Bookable Nights, expressed as a percentage. Bookable Nights represent the total number of nights available for stays across all Live Units. This excludes nights lost to full building closures of greater than 30 nights. Occupied Nights represent the total number of nights occupied across all Live Units. Live Units & Total Portfolio Total Portfolio represents Live Units plus Contracted Units. This includes any unit that has a signed real estate contract, regardless of whether or not the unit is available for guests to book. This excludes any units that have been exited (i.e., the lease was terminated or allowed to expire). Live Units are defined as units which are available for guest bookings on Sonder.com, the Sonder app and other channels. Sonder pays rent (or utilizes pre-negotiated abatement) and is able to generate revenue from these units. Contracted Units are units for which Sonder has signed real estate contracts, but are not yet available for guests to book. Sonder is not yet able to generate revenue from these units. Certain signed leases have contingencies or conditions that must be satisfied before Sonder takes over the units, and from time to time, the Company excludes some of these leases from its Contracted Units total based on its judgment about the likelihood that the contingencies or conditions will be satisfied.

Azitra engaged in discussions with Bayer for a license agreement, demonstrating potential for strategic partnerships. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by Azitra, Inc. indicates a strategic progression in their pipeline, particularly with the completion of their initial public offering (IPO), which has injected $7.5 million in gross proceeds into the company. This capital infusion is pivotal for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, as it provides the necessary funds to advance their clinical trials and research initiatives. The initiation of a Phase 1b clinical trial for ATR-12, targeting Netherton syndrome, signifies a move towards therapeutic innovation in dermatology, a field that has seen increased investor interest due to the high prevalence of skin conditions.Furthermore, the collaboration with Bayer, a leading pharmaceutical company, through a Joint Development Agreement and potential license agreement discussions, could be indicative of the therapeutic potential of Azitra's pipeline. The strengthening of their intellectual property portfolio with a new U.S. patent issuance is another positive indicator for investors, as it may provide long-term competitive advantage and potential revenue streams through licensing deals or market exclusivity for their treatments. Medical Research Analyst Azitra's focus on precision dermatology and their recent IND clearance for ATR-12 is a significant milestone. Netherton syndrome is a rare and severe skin disorder and the development of targeted therapies can address a significant unmet medical need. The advancement of ATR-04 into IND-enabling studies also highlights the company's commitment to expanding its dermatological portfolio. The strategic selection of clinical research organizations and initial clinical sites for ATR-12 underscores the company's readiness to expedite the clinical trial process.The implications for stakeholders are multifaceted. For patients, the progress in clinical trials could mean access to new, potentially life-altering treatments. For investors, the company's advancements and strategic partnerships might forecast a promising return on investment, particularly if the therapies prove effective and secure regulatory approval. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials, including potential for failure to meet efficacy or safety benchmarks, should be factored into any evaluation of the company's prospects. Patent Attorney The issuance of a U.S. patent for treating skin diseases with recombinant microorganisms represents a important legal and competitive milestone for Azitra. Intellectual property rights are the bedrock of biotech firms, providing them with the necessary legal protections to safeguard their innovations. This patent not only secures Azitra's position in the market for ichthyosis vulgaris but also potentially extends to a broader range of skin conditions.From a legal standpoint, the patent can deter competition by preventing other companies from entering the market with similar technologies. It can also serve as a bargaining chip in negotiations with potential partners or licensees. For investors, a robust IP portfolio is often seen as an indicator of a company's valuation and future revenue potential. The long-term benefits include sustained market presence and the possibility of royalty income from licensing agreements. However, the cost of maintaining patents and potential legal battles to defend IP rights are considerations that must be weighed against these benefits. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM BRANFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Azitra, Inc.

Market Research Analyst The wearable technology sector is experiencing a surge in interest and growth potential and Wearable Devices Ltd.'s recent financial announcement reflects this trend. The company's strategic focus on both B2B and B2C markets, with the introduction of the Mudra Developer Kit (MDK) and the shipment of the Mudra Band, indicates a diversified approach to capturing market share. The collaboration with Qualcomm is particularly noteworthy as it aligns Wearable Devices with a reputable industry leader, potentially enhancing product credibility and market penetration.However, the reported increase in net loss and significant investments in research, development, sales and marketing point to an aggressive growth strategy that has yet to yield profitability. The inventory buildup also suggests confidence in future sales, but it presents a risk if the anticipated demand does not materialize. Investors should monitor the company's ability to convert these strategic moves into sustainable revenue streams, especially given the competitive nature of the tech industry. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the rising R&D and sales and marketing expenses at Wearable Devices Ltd. could be seen as a double-edged sword. On one hand, these investments are essential for innovation and gaining market traction. On the other hand, the corresponding increase in net loss and the depletion of cash reserves could raise concerns about the company's runway and its ability to continue funding operations without seeking additional capital.Investors should consider the company's current cash position in relation to its burn rate. The increased inventory levels suggest that the company is preparing for a sales ramp-up, which could improve the cash position if successful. However, this strategy also increases the company's exposure to inventory obsolescence or write-downs if sales projections are not met. The stock market response will likely hinge on the company's near-term ability to demonstrate a path to profitability and manage its cash flow effectively. Technology Industry Analyst Wearable Devices Ltd. is carving out a niche in the AI-powered wearable space, which is a segment with high growth prospects. The company's focus on touchless control technology, as evidenced by the patent application for pinch-to-zoom technology and the introduction of spatial depth control, places it at the forefront of innovation within the industry.The strategic partnerships and expansion into Silicon Valley are positive indicators of the company's commitment to growth and its efforts to stay connected with key industry players. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on the company's ability to deliver on the technology's promise and integrate it effectively into user experiences. The market's reception of the Mudra Band and the MDK, as well as the company's influence in industry groups like Open XR and Kronos Group, will be critical factors in assessing the company's competitive edge and long-term viability in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM 2023 Achievements Position Wearable Devices for Growth in 2024YOKNEâAM ILLIT, Israel, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wearable Devices Ltd.

Asher Dahan, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Wearable Devices, commented, â2023 was characterized by strategic capital allocation and the execution of our growth strategy as we successfully completed delivery of our first manufacturing batch of the Mudra Band for Apple Watch, and entered into several partnerships with companies and contractors at the forefront of their respective industries. Our net loss increased in pursuit of these milestones, mainly due to strategic investments primarily in sales and marketing and research and development as we continue to innovate and showcase our technology, as well as an enhanced focus on business development on the B2B side of our business. âPartnerships represent a key part of our business, and we expect our B2B offerings to be a significant driver of revenue for us as we grow. At the beginning of 2024, we launched the B2B Mudra Developer Kit, or MDK, providing our B2B customers with enhanced capabilities and additional features that improve on our traditional Mudra Inspire B2B offering. The MDK allows OEMs to design new, customized gestures along with existing hand and wrist signals to create a user interface specifically tailored to their needs. Subsequent to the end of the year, we announced a collaboration agreement with Qualcomm, a Fortune 500 company, for the development of products using the Qualcomm Snapdragon Spaces XR Developer Platform, and we announced an agreement at the end of 2023 with a leading global defense company to design neural gesture technology for situations where silent activation is crucial. We anticipate interest in our B2B product to grow as the market for wearable devices and AI-based technology expands, with more and more customers recognizing the value that our products can add to their operations. âOur B2C product, the Mudra Band, is an award-winning aftermarket band for the Apple Watch that allows for touchless control of multiple Apple products. Weâre seeing considerable interest in the Mudra Band, and during 2023 we commenced shipment of our first manufacturing batch to preorder customers. We continue to receive orders for the product and have seen demonstrated interest at leading trade shows like CES and MWC, where this technology has been documented and recognized as a leading innovation in the tech field. Weâre intently focused on increasing our production capacity to meet anticipated demand for the Mudra Band, and we look forward to the continued innovation of this product as our technology and capabilities improve.â Mr. Dahan concluded, âWe have a comprehensive strategy with innovative B2B and B2C offerings to maximize our presence in what we believe to be a market that is poised for tremendous growth. We are very encouraged by the progress that we made in 2023 and believe that Wearable Devices is positioned for a transformative year in 2024 as we continue to invest in our operations, bring innovative products to market, and showcase the breadth and depth of our technology.â 2023 and Recent Business Highlights Signed collaboration agreement with Qualcomm to elevate XR experiences with Mudra neural technology Showcased neural input technology at leading industry conferences, including CES 2024, MWC 2024, SPIE AR VR MR 2024, Tiny ML Summit 2023, and XR Fair Tokyo 2023 Opened new U.S.-based office in Silicon Valley to expand the Companyâs presence and foster relationships in the tech and wearables markets Released MDK for B2B customers allowing OEMs to create a user interface specifically tailored to their operational needs Successfully delivered first manufacturing batch of the Mudra Band for Apple Watch Filed patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for touchless pinch-to-zoom technology for augmented and virtual reality Expanded marketing and sales effort with the launch of new Mudra Band website Completed first stage of deployment testing for a leading XR glasses OEM, satisfying criteria outlined in memorandum of understanding Introduced revolutionary spatial depth control allowing for depth navigation that adds another dimension to user interaction Received purchase order from a leading Japanese industrial automation company for the MDK Joined Open XR and Kronos Group as a voting member to help influence and drive industry growth Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights: Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses increased 46% to $3.3 million in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 as the Company continued to focus on creating disruptive, industry leading technology that leverages AI and proprietary algorithms, software and hardware. Sales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses increased 47% to $2.0 million in the full year of 2023 compared to the full year of 2022 related to the Company driving awareness of its technology and products across various channels including participation at multiple leading industry conferences. Net Loss: Net loss increased to $(7.8 million), or $(0.48) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a net loss of $(6.5 million), or $(0.53) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fundâs investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.

The company achieved a combined ratio of 85.9% for the year, driven by improved underwriting results. Net investment income also saw a substantial increase. Earnings per share improved to $0.32 for the quarter, showcasing a positive trend in profitability. The company's management remains optimistic about future prospects and shareholder returns. Positive Direct written premiums increased by 16.2% to $102.4 million in 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. Net earned premiums rose by 4.6% to $88.6 million in 2023 compared to the prior year quarter. Combined ratio improved to 85.9% for the year, showing better underwriting results across all segments. Net investment income surged to $10.5 million compared to $7.8 million in the previous year. Earnings per share increased to $0.32 for the quarter, indicating a positive shift towards profitability. The company repurchased 548,549 shares of common stock during the year, totaling $7.2 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in direct written premiums by NI Holdings, Inc. is a strong indicator of the company's growth in the insurance sector. This metric is critical as it reflects the total amount of insurance policies sold before reinsurance, which can directly impact future earnings. The growth in premiums, particularly in the Non-Standard Auto and Private Passenger Auto segments, suggests that the company is expanding its market share or experiencing increased demand for its products.An improved combined ratio, which is a key performance indicator in the insurance industry, signifies better underwriting discipline and profitability. The substantial decrease from the previous year points to effective cost control and possibly a more favorable claims environment. However, a full-year combined ratio of over 100% indicates that there are still areas where the company is paying out more in claims and expenses than it earns in premiums, which is not sustainable in the long term. Market Research Analyst NI Holdings' strategic underwriting and rate adjustments appear to be paying off, as evidenced by the positive shift in their earnings per share (EPS). The EPS improvement from $0.04 to $0.32 for the quarter is noteworthy. However, the full-year loss per share of $0.26, while an improvement from the previous year's $2.49, warrants attention from investors. It is indicative of the challenges the company faced throughout the year, including the inflationary pressures that have affected reserve strengthening in certain segments.The stock repurchase program, where the company bought back shares at an average price of $13.15, reflects management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company. This action can often be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and support for the stock price. Economist The macroeconomic context, particularly the inflationary environment, has had a palpable influence on NI Holdings' operations. Inflation impacts loss costs and reserve requirements, as seen in the company's need for reserve strengthening. The increase in net investment income and gains, driven by higher fixed income reinvestment rates and favorable equity market conditions, also reflects broader economic trends, such as interest rate changes and stock market performance.Looking forward, the company's ability to navigate inflationary pressures and adapt to economic conditions will be important for maintaining profitability and delivering returns to shareholders. The management's optimism about the future suggests they have strategies in place to mitigate these economic risks. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM FARGO, N.D., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NI Holdings, Inc.

Alexander, President, and Chief Executive Officer. âOur improved results were driven by our Private Passenger Auto and Home and Farm segments, which benefited from favorable weather conditions and the significant underwriting and rate actions implemented during the year. We were able to balance this profitability with continued growth during the quarter, with all segments reporting higher year-over-year direct written premiums. Our high-quality investment portfolio once again positively contributed to our earnings, driven by higher reinvestment rates earned throughout the year in our fixed income portfolio. âThroughout 2023, we made notable progress toward our goal of returning the company to profitability while improving our overall risk profile.

Principal Risk Factors: Risks are inherent in all investing. Certain risks applicable to the Fund are identified below, which includes the risk that you could lose some or all of your investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the Fund's annual shareholder reports. The order of the below risk factors does not indicate the significance of any particular risk factor. The Fund also files reports, proxy statements and other information that is available for review. Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Market risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Investments held by the Fund are subject to market fluctuations caused by real or perceived adverse economic conditions, political events, regulatory factors or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation, government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund and its investments. Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Because the Fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors. Investments in securities of MLPs involve certain risks different from or in addition to the risks of investing in common stocks. The number of energy-related MLPs has declined since 2014. The industry is witnessing the consolidation or simplification of corporate structures where the MLP sleeve of capital is being eliminated. As a result of the foregoing, the Fund's MLP investments could become less diverse and the Fund may increase its non-MLP investments consistent with its investment objective and policies. Changes in tax laws or regulations, or interpretations thereof in the future, could adversely affect the Fund or the MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utility companies in which the Fund invests. The Fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance as to what portion of the distributions paid to the Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend income. To the extent a fund invests in floating or variable rate obligations that use the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") as a reference interest rate, it is subject to LIBOR Risk. LIBOR has ceased to be made available as a reference rate and there is no assurance that any alternative reference rate, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), will be similar to or produce the same value or economic equivalence as LIBOR. The unavailability or replacement of LIBOR may affect the value, liquidity or return on certain fund investments and may result in costs incurred in connection with closing out positions and entering into new trades. Any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on a fund or on certain instruments in which a fund invests is difficult to predict and could result in losses to the fund. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses. The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder reports and other regulatory filings. The information presented is not intended to constitute an investment recommendation for, or advice to, any specific person. By providing this information, First Trust is not undertaking to give advice in any fiduciary capacity within the meaning of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code or any other regulatory framework.

The dividends will be paid on April 24, 2024, to all eligible stockholders and unit holders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a quarterly dividend by City Office REIT, Inc. reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders, which is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and cash flow stability. By maintaining a dividend, particularly in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector, City Office is signaling confidence in its ability to generate consistent rental income from its properties. The dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the share price, becomes a critical factor for income-focused investors when evaluating the attractiveness of REIT stocks compared to other income-generating assets.However, it's important to assess the sustainability of these dividends in relation to the company's earnings and operational cash flow. A payout ratioâdividends as a percentage of net incomeâbeyond industry norms can indicate potential risk. In the case of preferred stock dividends, the fixed rate of 6.625% is relatively high, which can be attractive to investors seeking stable income, but it also suggests a higher cost of capital for the company. Investors should consider the implications of these dividends on the company's financial leverage and its ability to fund operations and growth initiatives. REIT Analyst The specifics of the dividend declaration by City Office REIT, Inc. provide insight into the company's capital allocation strategy. The distribution of $0.10 per share for common stockholders and $0.4140625 per share for preferred stockholders indicates a tiered approach to shareholder compensation. This tiered structure is typical in REITs, where preferred shares often carry a higher dividend rate due to their seniority in the capital structure, offering greater protection in case of liquidation but typically with less capital appreciation potential compared to common shares.When evaluating REITs, it's essential to consider the Funds From Operations (FFO), a key metric that adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings, as real estate generally appreciates over time. This figure provides a clearer picture of the REIT's performance and its ability to cover dividend payments. A stable or growing FFO can indicate a healthy property portfolio with potential for both asset appreciation and dividend growth. Conversely, a declining FFO may signal underlying issues with property occupancy rates, rental income, or increased competition. 03/15/2024 - 04:05 PM VANCOUVER, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- City Office REIT, Inc.

(NYSE: MITT) declares a dividend of $0.18 per common share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on April 30, 2024.

(NYSE: MITT) declares a dividend of $0.18 per common share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on April 30, 2024. Shareholders of record as of March 29, 2024, will receive the dividend. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a dividend payout, such as the one declared by AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc., is a tangible reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. Dividends are often seen as a sign of corporate stability and maturity and they can influence investor perception. The declared dividend of $0.18 per common share provides a quantifiable return to shareholders and could be a positive signal to the market, potentially affecting the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors.However, it is important to scrutinize the sustainability of such dividends. One must look at the company's payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. If this ratio is too high, it may suggest that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its operations, which could impede future growth. Conversely, a lower payout ratio could indicate that the company has room to grow its dividend or reinvest in its business. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the sector in which AG Mortgage Investment Trust operates â real estate investment trusts (REITs) â traditionally offers higher dividend yields compared to other sectors. Investors often turn to REITs for consistent income, particularly in low-interest-rate environments. Therefore, the dividend announcement may reinforce the company's position within its sector and appeal to a specific segment of the market.It is also essential to compare the announced dividend yield with the industry average to evaluate its competitiveness. A significantly higher or lower yield could indicate an adjustment in the company's strategy or a response to market conditions. Moreover, historical dividend trends and the company's financial performance relative to its peers could provide deeper insights into the long-term viability of its dividend program. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AG Mortgage Investment Trust, Inc.

The redemption date is set for April 15, 2024, utilizing cash on hand and credit facility capacity for funding. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by CoreCivic to redeem its outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2026 ahead of maturity is a significant financial move. The decision to pay a premium of 104.125% on the principal amount reflects a strategic approach to manage the company's debt portfolio. This early redemption could indicate that the company is optimizing its capital structure, potentially taking advantage of lower interest rates or improving its debt-to-equity ratio. Investors should monitor how this redemption affects CoreCivic's financial leverage and interest expense savings, as these factors could influence future profitability and cash flow. Credit Analyst CoreCivic's choice to redeem its 2026 Notes using a mix of cash and credit facility resources suggests confidence in liquidity management. The redemption price, which includes a premium over the principal amount, also implies that the company is willing to incur immediate costs for long-term benefits. Credit analysts would assess the impact on the company's creditworthiness, considering that early debt retirement can lead to improved credit ratings. However, it's important to evaluate the terms of the revolving credit facility and the potential increase in short-term liabilities. The balance between liquidity and leverage is key for maintaining financial stability. Market Research Analyst CoreCivic's redemption of its 2026 Notes can be viewed within the context of the broader corrections facility industry's financial strategies. The move might signal a change in the industry's approach to capital management, possibly driven by regulatory changes, shifts in market interest rates, or operational efficiencies. It's essential to compare this action with peers and industry trends to understand its implications fully. The company's ability to use available credit also reflects on its market position and perceived financial health, which could impact its competitiveness and attractiveness to investors. 03/15/2024 - 04:15 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoreCivic, Inc.

ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Value Line, Inc. (VALU) reported strong financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. Retained earnings and shareholders' equity showed significant increases compared to the previous period. Net income for both the nine months and three months ended January 31, 2024, also demonstrated growth. The Company's Form 10-Q has been filed with the SEC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The retained earnings growth of 6.6% for Value Line, Inc. signals a positive retention of profits which can be indicative of the company's operational efficiency and strategic reinvestment capabilities. The increase in shareholders' equity by 6.7% is also a positive sign, reflecting the company's ability to grow its net worth and potentially its investment attractiveness.Furthermore, the reported net income growth of 1.4% year-over-year for the nine-month period and more notably, a 12.2% increase for the three-month period, suggests that Value Line, Inc. has experienced improved profitability. This could be due to increased revenue, cost management, or a combination of both. The earnings per share (EPS) increase from $1.48 to $1.51 for the nine months and from $0.55 to $0.62 for the three months indicates improved earnings on a per-share basis, which is a key metric for investors assessing the value of a company.However, it's important to consider the broader market context and industry benchmarks when evaluating these figures. For instance, if the industry average for earnings growth is significantly higher, Value Line's performance might not be as strong as it appears in isolation. Conversely, if the industry is facing headwinds and Value Line is outperforming its peers, this would be a testament to the company's resilience and strategic positioning. Market Research Analyst An analysis of the market's reaction to Value Line's financial results could provide insights into investor sentiment and expectations. A 12.2% increase in quarterly net income is substantial and could lead to positive movements in the stock price if the results exceed market expectations. On the other hand, if the results were already anticipated by the market, the stock price reaction might be muted.It's also valuable to look at the company's performance in the context of its historical financial results and future outlook. Consistent growth in earnings and equity can be a sign of a company's strong position in the market, but investors will also be looking at future guidance and potential risks that could affect the company's financial health.Additionally, the market will consider the company's valuation multiples in relation to its earnings growth. If the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is low relative to the earnings growth, the stock may be considered undervalued. Conversely, a high P/E ratio might suggest that the stock is overvalued, unless the future growth prospects justify the premium. Economist From an economic perspective, the financial health of a company like Value Line, Inc. can be a microcosmic indicator of broader economic trends, especially within the financial services sector. The growth in retained earnings and shareholders' equity suggests that the company is not only generating profit but is also effectively allocating capital, which is a positive signal for economic productivity.Moreover, the company's ability to increase its net income during a nine-month period and more significantly in the latest quarter could reflect well on the economic environment, indicating potential consumer and business confidence, which often translates to higher demand for financial information and services provided by companies like Value Line.However, it is important to analyze these results in the context of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and economic growth rates. These factors can greatly influence the performance of the financial sector and should be taken into account when assessing the long-term sustainability of Value Line's financial performance. 03/15/2024 - 02:55 PM New York, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Value Line, Inc., (NASDAQ: VALU) reported financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024.

"Scilex Holding Announces Issuance of Halal Certification for its ZTlidoÂ® product by Circle H International, Inc.",2024-03-15T18:45:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Scilex Holding Company (SCLX) obtains Halal Certification for ZTlido, opening access to Islamic markets globally. The certification enhances the company's global expansion strategy, focusing on the Middle East and North Africa region.","Scilex Holding Announces Issuance of Halal Certification for its ZTlidoÂ® product by Circle H International, Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Scilex Holding Company (SCLX) obtains Halal Certification for ZTlido, opening access to Islamic markets globally. The certification enhances the company's global expansion strategy, focusing on the Middle East and North Africa region. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The receipt of Halal Certification for Scilex's ZTlido product represents a strategic move to penetrate markets with significant Muslim populations. The certification, which ensures that products comply with Islamic law, is particularly relevant for health care companies looking to expand in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. This is an area where consumers place a high value on Halal compliance and it can be a differentiator in market acceptance.The certification can potentially lead to increased market share and revenue for Scilex, as it opens up access to countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which are known for their stringent regulatory environments. The emphasis on non-opioid, non-addictive pain management solutions aligns with global trends towards safer pain management therapies and could resonate well in these new markets. The Halal certification may also serve as a mark of quality and ethical production, which can enhance brand reputation and customer trust.However, the actual impact on the company's financial performance will depend on the execution of market entry strategies, local partnerships and the ability to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. It is also essential to consider the competitive environment in these regions and whether there are existing players with established Halal-certified products. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Specialist Obtaining Halal Certification is a significant regulatory milestone for Scilex, as it indicates compliance with a set of standards that are critical for entering Islamic markets. The certification process often involves rigorous assessment of the production process, ingredients and supply chain to ensure they meet Islamic dietary laws. This can sometimes require changes to manufacturing processes or sourcing, which can have cost implications for the company.For Scilex, the certification by Circle H International, a body recognized by prominent Islamic institutions, could facilitate smoother entry into MENA markets by potentially easing the regulatory approval process. It is indicative of the company's commitment to meeting diverse cultural and religious needs, which can be an advantage when dealing with health authorities in these regions.From a regulatory perspective, the certification could also preempt certain barriers to market entry and may reduce the time to market for Scilex's products. However, the company must remain vigilant about maintaining the certification standards, as any deviation could lead to revocation of the certification and damage to the company's reputation. Global Business Development Expert The strategic focus on the UAE and Saudi Arabia as initial targets for Scilex's expansion is informed by the size and potential of these markets. Both countries have been investing heavily in healthcare infrastructure and are increasingly open to innovative medical solutions. The Halal Certification aligns with the cultural and religious practices in these regions and is likely a calculated move to appeal to local demographics.Business development efforts will need to be culturally sensitive and tailored to the unique business environments of these countries. Partnerships with local entities could be key in navigating the business landscape and Scilex will need to assess whether its current business model is adaptable to the local context. For example, considerations around pricing, distribution channels and marketing strategies will be essential to capture the full potential of these markets.It is worth noting that while the certification opens doors, sustained success will require ongoing engagement with local stakeholders, continuous market research and possibly even product adaptation to meet local preferences and regulatory requirements. 03/15/2024 - 02:45 PM The certification has the potential to open access to Islamic markets globally, expanding potential markets for Scilexâs innovative FDA approved non-opioid therapies and pipeline candidate products.The certification is an important prerequisite for health care and covers health and wellness as well as non-addictive pain management products.Announcement advances the global expansion strategy for Scilex with plans for growing its presence in the Middle East and North Africa region with an initial focus on the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

The Halal certification was issued under the authority of Circle H International, Inc. (âCircle Hâ) and offers the Company the opportunity to provide ZTlido to Islamic markets globally. This announcement supports the global expansion strategy for Scilex, which Scilex anticipates will include a presence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region with an initial priority focus on the UAE and Saudi Arabia. âObtaining the broadly inclusive Halal Certification is a critical and important milestone in Scilexâs plan to expand to potential Islamic markets for our innovative non-opioid non-addictive pain management therapeutic pipeline candidates and FDA approved products. With the global Muslim population representing over 25% of the worldâs population, according to Statista, this certification facilitates our ability to grow and expand in international markets,"" said Jaisim Shah, Chief Executive Officer and President of Scilex.

Eligible institutional accredited investors can lend up to $100 million with certain restrictions. The syndication period runs from March 15 to March 28, 2024.","Enviva Announces Court Approval of DIP and the Commencement of the DIP Syndication Process Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Enviva Inc. (NYSE: EVA) secures $500 million debtor-in-possession financing, offering Common Stock holders the opportunity to participate in syndication. Eligible institutional accredited investors can lend up to $100 million with certain restrictions. The syndication period runs from March 15 to March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Enviva Inc.'s announcement regarding its $500 million debtor-in-possession financing indicates a critical juncture in the company's restructuring efforts. The approval by the bankruptcy court suggests that Enviva is in a complex financial situation, which typically occurs when a company is facing insolvency and is attempting to reorganize its debts. The DIP Facility is a form of bridge financing that allows the company to continue operations during bankruptcy proceedings.The introduction of the syndication opportunity for institutional accredited investors and certain stockholders is a strategic move to involve existing stakeholders in the company's recovery plan. However, the restriction to institutional accredited investors excludes a significant portion of potential investors, which is a common practice to mitigate risk and comply with securities regulations.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include the potential dilution of shares, changes in the company's control and the restructuring of its debt. Long-term implications hinge on the company's ability to effectively utilize the DIP financing to maintain operations and successfully restructure. This situation bears monitoring as it unfolds, given its significant impact on the company's financial health and future prospects. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of Enviva's DIP Facility Agreement and its approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court signify a structured approach to debt reorganization under the oversight of the judiciary. The DIP Facility, not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, relies on exemptions typically used in such financial instruments to expedite the process and avoid the lengthy registration process.Eligible Holders' participation is subject to specific restrictions, such as voting and information rights, which are standard in such agreements to protect the debtor's ability to reorganize without undue influence from creditors. The structured syndication process and the involvement of an information agent indicate a methodical and transparent approach to this complex financial maneuver.Interested parties need to be aware of the legal ramifications of participating in such a financing structure, including the implications of the securities not being registered, which may limit their liquidity and the legal recourse available to investors. Market Research Analyst Enviva's position as a leading producer of sustainably sourced wood-based biomass is at stake given the current financial restructuring. The DIP Facility could provide the necessary liquidity to keep the company operational, which is essential for maintaining its market position. However, the biomass industry is highly competitive and sensitive to regulatory changes, making the company's long-term viability uncertain.Market dynamics, such as demand for renewable energy sources, will play a significant role in Enviva's recovery. The company's ability to emerge from bankruptcy and continue to fulfill its business objectives will be closely watched by competitors and investors alike. The success of the DIP Facility syndication could signal market confidence in Enviva's restructuring plan and its future in the biomass industry. 03/15/2024 - 02:36 PM BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enviva Inc.

The survey, including 1,000 women ages 25 to 65 with a total household income of $75,000 and above, reveals a significant shift toward financial empowerment among women, specifically within younger generations.

By 2030, around $30 trillion is set to transition into women's control, driven by the transfer of assets from Baby Boomers,"" explains Bell.

The Offers are contingent upon the closing of a merger with APA Holders can receive the Total Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of Notes tendered, including a Consent Fee. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from Callon Petroleum Company regarding the cash tender offers for its high-interest Senior Notes due in 2028 and 2030, in conjunction with a merger condition, is a strategic financial move with significant implications for both the company's capital structure and its stock valuation. By repurchasing debt with a high-interest rate, the company aims to reduce its interest expenses, which can lead to an improvement in net income margins over time. The fixed spread and consent fee offered indicate an attractive premium over the current market rates, which is likely to incentivize note holders to participate in the tender offer.Furthermore, the successful execution of this offer is contingent upon the completion of a merger with APA Corporation, which suggests a transformative event for the company with potential synergies and enhanced market competitiveness. However, investors should be cautious as mergers can also entail integration risks and may lead to short-term volatility in the stock price. The long-term benefits to shareholders will depend on the effective integration of the two entities and the realization of projected cost savings and revenue synergies. Debt Market Analyst The tender offer details provided by Callon Petroleum, specifically the fixed spreads and consent fees, reflect the current credit market conditions and investor sentiment towards corporate debt. The yields on the Senior Notes are set above the U.S. Treasury Reference Securities, indicating a risk premium that investors demand for holding Callon's debt, which is typical for a company with a higher credit risk profile.Investors in the fixed income market might view this tender offer as an opportunity to realize a gain on their investment, especially if they anticipate interest rates to rise or have concerns about the oil and gas sector's volatility. The consent solicitation aspect, which seeks to remove restrictive covenants, is a notable point as it could potentially increase the risk for remaining noteholders by providing the company with more operational flexibility, which might not always align with creditors' interests. Mergers & Acquisitions Expert The merger condition attached to the tender offer suggests a strategic maneuver by Callon Petroleum to streamline its financial obligations ahead of a significant corporate event. Mergers, particularly in the energy sector, require thorough due diligence on the financial stability and debt profiles of both companies involved. By addressing its high-yield debt, Callon is likely preparing for a smoother consolidation process with APA Corporation.An important aspect for stakeholders to consider is the potential for changes in the company's operational strategy post-merger. This could include asset divestitures, re-allocation of capital expenditure, or shifts in production targets. The merger's success will be measured not only by the immediate financial metrics but also by the long-term value creation for shareholders, which will be influenced by the global energy market dynamics and the combined entity's ability to adapt and execute its business strategy effectively. 03/15/2024 - 01:07 PM HOUSTON, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Callon Petroleum Company (NYSE: CPE) (""Callon"" or the ""Company"") today announced the pricing terms of its previously announced cash tender offers (the ""Offers"") for any and all of its 8.000% Senior Notes due 2028 (the ""2028 Notes"") and any and all of its 7.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the ""2030 Notes"" and, together with the 2028 Notes, the ""Notes"").

Forward-Looking Information Cautionary Notice Teledyneâs investor presentation contains forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, with respect to managementâs beliefs about the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Teledyne in the future. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, are based on the current expectations of the management of Teledyne and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Forward-looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as âprojectsâ, âintendsâ, âexpectsâ, âanticipatesâ, âtargetsâ, âestimatesâ, âwillâ and words of similar import that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All statements made in this communication that are not historical in nature should be considered forward-looking. By its nature, forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance or results and involves risks and uncertainties because it relates to events and depends on circumstances that will occur in the future. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Many factors could change anticipated results, including: changes in relevant tax and other laws; foreign currency exchange risks; rising interest rates; risks associated with indebtedness, as well as our ability to reduce indebtedness and the timing thereof; the impact of semiconductor and other supply chain shortages; higher inflation, including wage competition and higher shipping costs; labor shortages and competition for skilled personnel; the inability to develop and market new competitive products; inherent uncertainties involved in the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of financial statements and the providing of estimates of financial measures, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and related standards; disruptions in the global economy; the ongoing conflict in Israel and neighboring regions, including related protests and the disruption to global shipping routes; the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including the impact to energy prices and availability, especially in Europe; customer and supplier bankruptcies; changes in demand for products sold to the defense electronics, instrumentation, digital imaging, energy exploration and production, commercial aviation, semiconductor and communications markets; funding, continuation and award of government programs; cuts to defense spending resulting from existing and future deficit reduction measures or changes to U.S. and foreign government spending and budget priorities triggered by inflation, rising interest costs, and economic conditions; impacts from the United Kingdomâs exit from the European Union; uncertainties related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential election; the imposition and expansion of, and responses to, trade sanctions and tariffs; the continuing review and resolution of FLIRâs trade compliance and tax matters; escalating economic and diplomatic tension between China and the United States; threats to the security of our confidential and proprietary information, including cybersecurity threats; risks related to artificial intelligence; natural and man-made disasters, including those related to or intensified by climate change; and our ability to achieve emission reduction targets and decrease our carbon footprint. Lower oil and natural gas prices, as well as instability in the Middle East or other oil producing regions, and new regulations or restrictions relating to energy production, including those implemented in response to climate change, could further negatively affect our businesses that supply the oil and gas industry. Weakness in the commercial aerospace industry negatively affects the markets of our commercial aviation businesses. Ongoing issues with Boeingâs 737 MAX product line could result in manufacturing delays and lower sales of our products to Boeing. In addition, financial market fluctuations affect the value of the companyâs pension assets. Changes in the policies of U.S. and foreign governments, including economic sanctions, could result, over time, in reductions or realignment in defense or other government spending and further changes in programs in which the company participates. While the companyâs growth strategy includes possible acquisitions, we cannot provide any assurance as to when, if or on what terms any acquisitions will be made. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, such as, among others, our ability to integrate acquired businesses, retain key management and customers and achieve identified financial and operating synergies. There are additional risks associated with acquiring, owning and operating businesses internationally, including those arising from U.S. and foreign government policy changes or actions and exchange rate fluctuations. Additional factors that could cause results to differ materially from those described above can be found in Teledyneâs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as in other documents, all of which are on file with the SEC and available in the âInvestorsâ section of Teledyneâs website, teledyne.com, under the heading âInvestor Information.â The Company assumes no duty to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or otherwise.

AerCap Holdings N.V. Announces Registered Exchange Offer for 6.450% Senior Notes due 2027,2024-03-15T14:32:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"AerCap Holdings N.V. announces an Exchange Offer for $1.5 billion of Senior Notes due 2027, replacing unregistered notes with registered ones under the Securities Act of 1933. The Exchange Offer expires on April 15, 2024, with terms outlined in the Prospectus.","AerCap Holdings N.V. Announces Registered Exchange Offer for 6.450% Senior Notes due 2027 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AerCap Holdings N.V. announces an Exchange Offer for $1.5 billion of Senior Notes due 2027, replacing unregistered notes with registered ones under the Securities Act of 1933. The Exchange Offer expires on April 15, 2024, with terms outlined in the Prospectus. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The exchange offer initiated by AerCap Holdings N.V. to swap unregistered senior notes for registered ones is a strategic financial maneuver, likely aimed at improving the liquidity of these securities. By transitioning to registered notes, the company is adhering to the Securities Act of 1933, which could potentially widen the pool of investors by including those who prefer or are mandated to hold registered securities. This move may also reduce the cost of future capital for AerCap by creating a more active secondary market for the notes.It is also noteworthy that the terms of the new notes are substantially identical to the old ones, with the exception of the registration status. This implies that the intrinsic value of the notes and the company's obligation remain unchanged, which should reassure current investors. However, the impact on the stock market may be limited as this is a debt instrument exchange rather than an equity change. Still, the company's proactive approach to compliance and liquidity could be viewed positively by the market. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, AerCap's exchange offer is a significant compliance step. The registration of securities is a process overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which aims to provide investors with full and fair disclosure about financial securities. By registering the exchange notes, AerCap is ensuring that these notes comply with the regulatory requirements, which can help prevent legal issues related to securities laws in the future.Moreover, the removal of transfer restrictions and the elimination of the clause for payment of additional interest in case of non-registration suggest a lessening of legal and financial risk for the note holders. This could incentivize the participation in the exchange offer, as it removes certain contingencies that might have been seen as deterrents by potential investors. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market implications of such an exchange offer involves recognizing the broader context in which AerCap operates. As a leading aircraft leasing company, AerCap's financial health is closely tied to the aviation industry's performance. The exchange of unregistered notes for registered ones may be interpreted as a signal of financial prudence, possibly reflecting a strategic response to the industry's volatility.Investors and analysts will likely monitor the uptake of this offer closely, as a high rate of exchange could suggest confidence in AerCap's financial stability and growth prospects. Conversely, a tepid response might raise questions about investor sentiment towards the company. The timing and success of this exchange offer could provide valuable insights into market perceptions of AerCap's creditworthiness and the aviation sector's current risk profile. 03/15/2024 - 10:32 AM DUBLIN, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AerCap Ireland Capital Designated Activity Company and AerCap Global Aviation Trust (together, the ""Issuers""), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of AerCap Holdings N.V.

(CPSS) reported pretax income of $9.8 million for Q4 and $61.1 million for 2023, with revenues of $92.0 million for Q4 and $352.0 million for 2023. Net income was $45.3 million for 2023, with new contract purchases of $1.358 billion in 2023. The company achieved its largest managed portfolio balance of $3.2 billion in history. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results indicate a mixed picture for Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (CPS). While the company experienced a revenue increase of 10.8% for the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the full year, this was overshadowed by a significant rise in total operating expenses, leading to a reduced pretax income year-over-year. Notably, the annualized net charge-offs have increased, suggesting potential credit quality issues within their loan portfolio. This uptick in charge-offs, coupled with the rise in delinquencies, may signal a need for more conservative risk assessment or an adjustment in credit policies.Investors should also consider the growth in the company's managed portfolio to a record $3.2 billion, which reflects an expansion of CPS's asset base and could imply future revenue growth. However, the increased portfolio size comes with greater risk exposure, especially in light of the higher delinquencies. The new contract purchases have declined compared to the previous year, potentially indicating a tightening market or a strategic shift in origination practices. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, CPS's performance must be contextualized within the broader economic environment and the consumer finance sector. The increase in delinquency rates may reflect broader economic pressures on consumers, such as rising interest rates or inflation, which can affect borrowers' ability to repay loans. The auto finance industry, where CPS operates, is sensitive to economic cycles and the company's financials may be an early indicator of consumer distress.Moreover, the stock market reaction to such earnings reports can be influenced by expectations and sentiment. If the market anticipated better performance or is particularly risk-averse due to macroeconomic conditions, CPS's stock could see volatility. Conversely, the demonstrated ability to grow revenues and manage a larger portfolio might be viewed positively if investors believe the company can effectively manage the associated risks. 03/15/2024 - 02:00 PM Pretax income of $9.8 million for the fourth quarter and $61.1 million for 2023Revenues of $92.0 million for the fourth quarter and $352.0 million for 2023Net income of $45.3 million, or $1.80 per diluted share for 2023New contract purchases of $1.358 billion for the full year 2023Largest managed portfolio balance in company history, $3.2 billion LAS VEGAS, NV, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc.

About Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. is an independent specialty finance company that provides indirect automobile financing to individuals with past credit problems or limited credit histories. We purchase retail installment sales contracts primarily from franchised automobile dealerships secured by late model used vehicles and, to a lesser extent, new vehicles. We fund these contract purchases on a long-term basis primarily through the securitization markets and service the contracts over their lives. Forward-looking statements in this news release include the Company's recorded figures representing allowances for remaining expected lifetime credit losses, its estimates of fair value (most significantly for its receivables accounted for at fair value), its provision for credit losses, its entries offsetting the preceding, and figures derived from any of the preceding. In each case, such figures are forward-looking statements because they are dependent on the Companyâs estimates of losses to be incurred in the future. The accuracy of such estimates may be adversely affected by various factors, which include the following: possible increased delinquencies; repossessions and losses on retail installment contracts; incorrect prepayment speed and/or discount rate assumptions; possible unavailability of qualified personnel, which could adversely affect the Companyâs ability to service its portfolio; possible increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Companyâs rights to collect payments from its portfolio; other changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; possible declines in the market price for used vehicles, which could adversely affect the Companyâs realization upon repossessed vehicles; and economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated. Any or all of such factors also may affect the Companyâs future financial results, as to which there can be no assurance. Any implication that the results of the most recently completed quarter are indicative of future results is disclaimed, and the reader should draw no such inference. Factors such as those identified above in relation to losses to be incurred in the future may affect future performance.

The acquisition enhances Mercer's capabilities and expertise, offering clients access to a broad range of investment resources and talent. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Vanguard's OCIO business by Mercer represents a strategic move to enhance its position in the investment management services sector. This move is likely to have a positive effect on Mercer's market share and competitive edge within the US, particularly in the not-for-profit and institutional investor segments.The integration of approximately 120 Vanguard professionals into Mercer's workforce could lead to an infusion of new ideas and approaches, potentially boosting innovation and efficiency. However, the success of this acquisition will largely depend on the smooth transition of these employees and the retention of Vanguard's client base, which may pose integration risks that need to be managed carefully.For investors, the key factors to monitor would be the retention rate of Vanguardâs clients post-acquisition and the synergy realization in terms of cost savings and enhanced service offerings. The markets generally react favorably to acquisitions that are likely to create shareholder value in the long run, but it's important to keep an eye on the post-acquisition performance metrics to validate this thesis. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Mercer's acquisition of Vanguard's OCIO business can be multi-fold. For Marsh McLennan, Mercer's parent company, this acquisition is set to potentially increase its revenue streams and diversify its offerings in the investment management space.Investors should consider the acquisition cost and how it aligns with Marsh McLennan's overall financial strategy. The deal could lead to economies of scale and a stronger bargaining position with third-party investment managers. Additionally, the expansion of Mercerâs asset under management (AUM) could result in higher management fees, which is a direct contributor to revenue growth.However, it's important to evaluate the acquisition's impact on the balance sheet, particularly in terms of goodwill and intangible assets that may arise. Investors should also assess the return on investment and payback period of the acquisition to determine its financial viability. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the acquisition of Vanguard's OCIO business by Mercer must have undergone rigorous due diligence to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The transfer of client accounts and proprietary investment strategies entails careful navigation of privacy laws and intellectual property rights.Additionally, the contractual obligations of Vanguard's OCIO business to its clients will now fall under Mercer's purview, requiring a meticulous review to prevent any legal disputes that could arise from the transition. It is also vital to consider any antitrust implications, as the consolidation of services in the investment management sector might attract scrutiny from regulators.Investors should be aware of the potential legal costs associated with the integration and any contingent liabilities that could impact financial projections. The long-term success of the acquisition may hinge on Mercer's ability to manage these legal complexities without incurring significant costs or reputational damage. 03/15/2024 - 10:30 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mercer, a global investments leader and a business of Marsh McLennan (NYSE: MMC), today announced the completion of its acquisition of Vanguardâs Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) business that provides investment management services for not-for-profit organizations and other institutional investors in the United States. The acquisition, announced in December of last year, expands Mercerâs capabilities and expertise across investment solutions in the US. Commenting on the acquisition, Marc Cordover, Mercerâs US Investments and Retirement Leader, said: âToday, we welcome Vanguard OCIO clients and colleagues to Mercer. The talented investment professionals joining us strengthen our perspective and our ability to help a range of institutional investors stay ahead of the curve and pursue returns.â Jen Kruse, Mercerâs US Investments Chief Client Officer, said: âThrough this acquisition, weâre able to offer our clients the best of our organizations â specialized knowledge and experience, purpose-led and engaged teams and global capabilities.â Incoming clients can elect to keep the same investment approach and team they enjoyed at Vanguard. They can now also choose to broaden their investment strategy through access to Mercerâs extensive global resources, including its deep bench of investment talent, world-class thought leadership and solutions from third-party investment managers across a spectrum of asset classes, from public equities and fixed income to alternative investments like infrastructure and private credit. Approximately 120 Vanguard colleagues join Mercer today. They will be based in Mercerâs offices in King of Prussia, PA, and Phoenix, AZ. About Mercer Mercer believes in building brighter futures by redefining the world of work, reshaping retirement and investment outcomes, and unlocking real health and well-being.

Historical selected financial data related to all operations: Quarter Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31, (In thousands) (In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Revenue $ 18,960 $ 20,464 $ 55,746 $ 55,093 Operating Income $ 3,795 $ 3,385 $ 8,531 $ 9,012 Net Income $ 2,382 $ 1,977 $ 8,052 $ 5,091 Total Assets $ 113,279 $ 111,077 $ 113,279 $ 111,077 Long-term liabilities $ 38,141 $ 43,172 $ 38,141 $ 43,172 Stockholders' Equity $ 49,912 $ 46,446 $ 49,912 $ 46,446 Weighted Average Shares - Diluted 69,634 76,664 70,985 76,634 Earnings Per Share $ 0.03 $ 0.03 $ 0.11 $ 0.07 New Product Research and Development Cost $ 845 $ 703 $ 2,184 $ 2,335 Management Comments Fiscal quarter three ended January 31, 2024 was positive. Company earnings were $ 0.03 per share. Professional Services experienced an increase in revenue while the Aerospace Segment revenue decreased primarily due to timing of completed projects compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue decreased 7% to $19.0 million in the three months ended January 31, 2024, as compared to $20.5 million in the three months ended January 31, 2023. The decrease in revenue reflects a decrease of 17% in Aerospace Products revenue and an increase of 4% in Professional Services revenue. Our Aerospace Products segment continues to recruit new and expand existing relationships that result in the aircraft modification opportunities in both the domestic and international markets. A number of opportunities result in work programs for new Federal Aviation Administration supplemental type certificates (""STCs""). Sports wagering highlighted the Professional Services segment with $1.5 million of quarterly revenue. Third quarter fiscal 2024 net income was $2.4 million compared to a net income of $2.0 million in the third quarter fiscal 2023. Third quarter fiscal 2024 operating income was $3.8 million compared to $3.4 million in third quarter fiscal 2023. We continue training, hiring and upgrading at the New Century facilities to accommodate additional aircraft modifications in addition to making wage adjustments to remain competitive. We also continue to review operational processes and methods to control general and administrative expenses. During the three months ended January 31, 2024, we invested approximately $845 in the development and acquisition of new products. This expenditure for design and development engineering, testing, and certification of new products is necessary to remain competitive and adapt for technology changes for Aerospace Products. STC development is essential to our long-term revenue and profits. As noted during the Annual Shareholder Meeting, design for manufacturing of the King Air Cargo Door project continues. ""Business is good and the receipt of orders from Aerospace Segment customers continues. We are pleased with the $ 0.03 per share earnings for the quarter. With continued favorable gaming activity, production and the flow of orders, Butler National should have a positive end to fiscal 2024. From an internal perspective, our Aircraft Modification business is growing. Currently, we have more than 20 active projects. While we are excited about the growth, it also brings about challenges. Our focus with modifications is to optimize processes and continue training to further develop our team, particularly at New Century, Kansas. We are working diligently with KC Machine to supply a significant amount of modification parts to allow shipments of modification kits and more effectively free the Avcon fabrication team to produce newly designed parts for certification projects and custom modifications. Program management and efficiency for work in process are priorities â this should yield improved quality and timeliness. Developing the modification experience level at New Century to the Newton standard is our objective. The experience enhancement should materially impact on the bottom line. We have also enhanced our communications outreach with website updates and a more active media presence for our subsidiaries. Additionally, customer demand for aircraft modifications, gun control units and ruggedized cabling is strong. The backlog remains high at $30.4 million. The relationship with our contracted platform for online/interactive sports wagering for Kansans on behalf of the Kansas Lottery continues to be a significant revenue source for the Professional Services Segment. The DraftKings branded sportsbook located in the Boot Hill Casino & Resort is attracting crossover play for traditional casino games. Moreover, our Boot Hill Casino Team continues to diligently promote tourism, our quality Firesides Restaurant offering and player development to attempt to facilitate increased patronage for traditional gaming. In summary, management and employees continue working on new products, new STCs, quality staffing, production and cost management. We continue our commitment to customers and to increasing shareholder value,"" commented Chris Reedy, President and CEO.

About GT-02287 Gain Therapeuticsâ lead drug candidate, GT-02287, is in clinical development for the treatment of GBA1 Parkinsonâs disease (GBA1-PD). The orally administered, brain-penetrant small molecule is an allosteric protein modulator that restores the function of the lysosomal protein enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) which becomes misfolded and impaired due to a GBA1 gene mutation, the most common genetic abnormality associated with PD. In preclinical models of PD, GT-02287 restored GCase enzymatic function, reduced aggregated Î±-synuclein, neuroinflammation and neuronal death, increased dopamine levels and improved motor function. Additionally, GT-02287 significantly reduced plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, an emerging biomarker for neurodegeneration. Gainâs lead program in Parkinsonâs disease has been awarded funding support from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinsonâs Research (MJFF) and The Silverstein Foundation for Parkinsonâs with GBA, as well as from the Eurostars-2 joint program with co-funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and Innosuisse â Swiss Innovation Agency. About GBA1 Parkinsonâs Disease GBA1 Parkinsonâs disease is caused by mutations in the GBA1 gene, found in up to 15% of patients with Parkinsonâs disease and making it the primary genetic risk factor. The mutation causes dysfunctional misfolding of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), reducing its activity in the brain and leading to the subsequent accumulation of Î±-synuclein and degeneration of dopamine-containing nerve cells. Patients with GBA1-PD tend to have earlier onset and faster symptom progression than those with sporadic PD, a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a motor syndrome consisting of bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity, resting tremors, and postural instability. With current therapies treating only the symptoms of Parkinsonâs disease without affecting the underlying progression of the disease, there is an unmet need to develop novel disease-modifying therapies such as GT-02287 that have the potential to slow or stop disease progression and help improve outcomes in this patient population. About Gain Therapeutics, Inc. Gain Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leading the discovery and development of next generation allosteric therapies. Gainâs lead drug candidate GT-02287 for the treatment of GBA1 Parkinsonâs disease, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Leveraging AI-supported structural biology, proprietary algorithms and supercomputer-powered physics-based models, the companyâs Magellanâ¢ drug discovery platform can identify novel allosteric binding sites on disease-implicated proteins, pinpointing pockets that cannot be found or drugged with current technologies. Magellanâ¢ is the next generation of Gainâs original SEE-TxÂ® (Site-Directed Enzyme Enhancement Therapy) platform, which was enhanced and expanded with new AI and machine-learning tools and virtual screening capabilities to access the emerging on-demand compound libraries covering vast chemical spaces of over 50 billion compounds. Gainâs unique approach enables the discovery of novel, allosteric small molecule modulators that can restore or disrupt protein function. Deploying its highly advanced platform, Gain is accelerating drug discovery and unlocking novel disease-modifying treatments for untreatable or difficult-to-treat disorders including neurodegenerative diseases, rare genetic disorders and oncology.

FEMSA Announces Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement,2024-03-15T14:22:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"FEMSA announces an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $400 million of its American Depositary Shares, enhancing capital returns to shareholders.","FEMSA Announces Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary FEMSA announces an accelerated share repurchase agreement to repurchase $400 million of its American Depositary Shares, enhancing capital returns to shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement is a significant financial maneuver that can have a direct impact on a company's stock price and perceived market value. By repurchasing $400 million of its ADS, FEMSA is effectively signaling confidence in its own financial health and future prospects. This move is typically viewed favorably by investors as it suggests that the company believes its stock is undervalued.From a financial standpoint, the repurchase will reduce the number of shares outstanding, potentially increasing the earnings per share (EPS) and the return on equity (ROE), both of which are key metrics that investors use to gauge a company's profitability and financial performance. However, it's also important to consider the opportunity cost of this capital allocation. The funds used for the ASR could have been invested in growth initiatives or used to pay down debt, which might offer a higher long-term return.Moreover, the initial delivery of approximately 20% of the ADS implies that the agreement includes a certain amount of leverage, which can amplify both the positive and negative outcomes of the repurchase. The final impact on the company's financials will depend on the average price of the repurchased shares and the market's reaction to the ASR. Market Research Analyst The impact of FEMSA's ASR on the market can be multifaceted. For one, it may create a temporary upward pressure on the stock price due to the reduced supply of shares and the increased demand created by the repurchase itself. This can benefit current shareholders, including institutional investors who may see a near-term appreciation in their holdings.However, investors will also be scrutinizing the timing and the rationale behind the ASR. If the repurchase is seen as a move to artificially inflate stock prices or mask underlying performance issues, the market's reaction could be less favorable. Additionally, the size of the repurchase relative to the company's market capitalization and liquidity will be evaluated to assess the potential for market distortion.It's also worth noting that while ASRs are common in the United States, they are less so in other markets, including Mexico. This could influence the perception of international investors and analysts who follow FEMSA, potentially affecting the stock's performance on both the NYSE and BMV. Economist When examining the broader economic implications of FEMSA's ASR, one must consider the current economic climate and monetary policy environment. In a period of low interest rates, companies may find it more advantageous to finance share repurchases through debt, which can be a cheaper source of capital than equity. However, if interest rates are rising, the cost of such leverage increases, which could affect the long-term financial stability of the company.The $400 million repurchase is a substantial investment back into the company and reflects upon its capital allocation strategy. This strategy must balance shareholder returns with sustainable growth. If executed properly, the ASR can be a tool for efficient capital distribution, but if mismanaged, it could lead to an over-leveraged balance sheet and reduced financial flexibility.Additionally, such financial decisions can have a ripple effect on the industry, influencing peer companies to consider similar actions. This can lead to a trend of share buybacks, which might impact the overall market dynamics, including capital flows and investment patterns. 03/15/2024 - 10:22 AM MONTERREY, Mexico, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fomento EconÃ³mico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (âFEMSAâ or the âCompanyâ) (NYSE: FMX; BMV: FEMSAUBD, FEMSAUB) today announced that, consistent with its capital allocation framework and commitment to enhance capital returns to shareholders, it has entered into a derivative instrument known as an accelerated share repurchase (âASRâ) agreement with a financial institution in the United States of America, to repurchase the Companyâs shares through the acquisition of American Depositary Shares (âADSâ). Under the terms of the ASR agreement, FEMSA has agreed to repurchase from such financial institution an aggregate amount of USD $400 million of its ADS1. The ASR contemplates an initial delivery of approximately 20% of the ADS on or about March 19, 2024. The total number of ADS ultimately repurchased under the ASR agreement will be based on the daily volume-weighted average price of the Companyâs ADS during the term of the agreement, subject to certain limitations. The final settlement of the ASR agreement is expected to be completed no later than the third quarter of 2024.

(NYSE: UA, UAA) announced today that it has signed University of South Carolina guard MiLaysia Fulwiley to a multi-year NIL (name, image, and likeness) partnership with Curry Brand. As the first collegiate athlete to sign with Curry Brand at an Under Armour school, Fulwiley will wear Curry Brand footwear on the court throughout the remainder of her college career at the University of South Carolina. Off the court, she will be a brand ambassador, expanding the Curry Brand's reach and commitment to change the game for good across the collegiate and women's basketball landscape. Fulwiley will also collaborate with the Curry Brand team on player exclusives, highlighting the best of the brand and showcasing her personality and style. ""We are thrilled to have MiLaysia officially join the Curry Brand family,"" said Ryan Drew, the GM of Curry Brand. ""MiLaysia embodies the type of athlete with whom we love to partner: she is a highly motivated, talented and community-driven young athlete who works every day to compete at the highest level. As we continue to grow and diversify the Curry Brand, we are excited to partner with her and deepen our roots in the collegiate athlete community."" Before coming to this partnership, Curry Brand was a part of Fulwiley's life and basketball journey. A native of Columbia, SC, where she now plays collegiately, Fulwiley played her final season of AAU basketball for Team Curry, the AAU team sponsored by Stephen Curry and Curry Brand based in Charlotte, NC. A longtime brand fan, Fulwiley honed her skills over the years by wearing various Curry Brand shoes, and her brand loyalty has continued at the University of South Carolina, an Under Armour school. ""When it comes to the ability to change the game for good, nobody can speak to that more than MiLaysia,"" said Stephen Curry, President of Curry Brand. ""She's changing the women's game on the fly with how she plays and moves on the court. She has a unique style and flow to her game that I don't think many people have seen in a long time. She was a part of Curry Camp, is a Team Curry alumni, and is currently playing at an Under Armour school, so there are just so many great tie-ins to the Under Armour family, and partnering with her and Curry Brand is such a special opportunity. I'm humbled that she is now a part of the family."" Fulwiley's connection to Curry also shows up in her game, bringing energy, quickness, and flare to every possession, much like Stephen Curry himself. And she has a history of winning, just like Stephen Curry. Fulwiley, who played six seasons of varsity high school basketball because she was pulled up early due to her skill, won four high school state championships in South Carolina and racked up over three thousand career points and numerous national honors during high school. In her freshman year playing for women's basketball powerhouse, the University of South Carolina, she has averaged 11 points and 2.9 rebounds a game, contributing significantly to their perfect regular season record and earning herself a spot on the SEC's All-Freshman Team. This past weekend, Fulwiley became the first freshman in South Carolina history to be awarded the SEC Tournament MVP. ""MiLaysia is a generational player, an artist who is expanding her understanding of how to marry all aspects of her game every day,"" said Dawn Staley, Head Coach of the University of South Carolina women's basketball team. ""We are learning things from each other about how to maximize her game, and it has been incredible to work with her on that process."" In addition to her accomplishments on the court, Fulwiley continues to have a presence in her local community of Columbia, South Carolina, where she is still involved with her high school team and grassroots basketball. Aligned with the Curry Brand's mission to change the game for good, Fulwiley, Curry Brand, and Under Armour will work together in the coming years to grow the game of basketball and support the next generation of athletes in her hometown and beyond. ""It feels incredible to be picked to represent Curry Brand,"" said Fulwiley. ""Knowing that I can be a role model for other young girls to come out here and do exactly what I did is amazing."" Last year, Curry Brand made history by becoming the first brand to add an active NBA player, Sacramento Kings guard De'Aaron Fox, to another active NBA player's brand. Building off the momentum of that signing, Curry Brand plans to launch Fox's first signature shoe at the end of the calendar year. Additionally, Curry Brand continues expanding its product offering with a new golf collection to be released this summer, featuring women's apparel for the first time. In December 2021, Stephen Curry brought in the brand's first NIL partnership with UConn guard Azzi Fudd via her wide-ranging deal with Stephen's Thirty Ink. Fulwiley will debut as a Curry Brand athlete in this year's NCAA Tournament.

The acquisitions will cater to the growing customer base with expanded self-storage units, vehicle storage spaces, and additional moving supplies. The company plans to introduce U-Box warehouses and climate-controlled options at both locations, aiming to provide convenient and sustainable solutions to the community. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of two self-storage properties by U-Haul in Pueblo County represents a strategic expansion in a growing market. The addition of these facilities is likely to enhance U-Haul's competitive edge by increasing its capacity to serve the local demand for storage and moving services. This move could potentially lead to increased revenue streams from both storage unit rentals and auxiliary moving services. By expanding in an area where the company has an established presence, U-Haul is also reinforcing brand loyalty and reducing the risk associated with entering new markets.From a market research perspective, the emphasis on adding climate-controlled units and U-Box warehouses indicates an adaptation to consumer trends favoring more secure and versatile storage solutions. Furthermore, the investment in sustainability initiatives, such as the Adaptive Reuse program, not only appeals to environmentally conscious consumers but may also result in long-term cost savings through reduced resource consumption and potential tax incentives for green business practices. Financial Analyst The financial implications of U-Haul's property acquisition must be evaluated in terms of capital expenditure, expected return on investment (ROI) and impact on the company's balance sheet. Given U-Haul's position as an industry leader, the capital allocation for these purchases is likely a calculated move to leverage economies of scale and boost operational efficiency. It's essential to monitor how these acquisitions contribute to the company's asset base and overall financial health. This includes assessing the occupancy rates of the new storage units, the utilization of rental equipment and the uptake of new services like the U-Box warehouses.Investors should note the timing of these acquisitions, as they could indicate a strategic move to capitalize on specific market conditions, such as increased demand for storage in Pueblo County. The long-term value generated by these assets will depend on their integration into U-Haul's existing network and the company's ability to optimize their operations for maximum profitability. Sustainability Consultant U-Haul's commitment to sustainability through initiatives such as truck and trailer sharing, Adaptive Reuse and the U-Box Load Share program, which recently received an award, is noteworthy. The shared-use business model not only reduces the environmental footprint but also aligns with current consumer expectations for eco-friendly business practices. This approach can serve as a differentiator in the market, potentially attracting customers who prioritize sustainability when choosing service providers.However, the effectiveness of these green initiatives must be quantified to understand their true impact on the environment and on the company's brand reputation. It is also important for the company to transparently report on the progress and outcomes of these initiatives to maintain credibility with stakeholders. The long-term benefits of such programs can include cost savings, improved customer loyalty and alignment with global sustainability goals, which may positively influence investor sentiment and the company's social responsibility profile. 03/15/2024 - 01:44 PM PUEBLO, Colo., March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- U-HaulÂ® announced its purchase of two former Freedom Self Storage properties in Pueblo County.

(BZH) completes a $250 million offering of 7.500% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 to finance the repurchase of 6.750% Senior Notes due 2025. Positive None. Negative The offering of senior unsecured notes indicates a potential increase in debt for the company, which could lead to higher interest expenses in the future. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Beazer Homes USA, Inc. about the completion of their $250 million offering of 7.500% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 is a significant financial maneuver. The company's strategic move to finance the repurchase of its 6.750% Senior Notes due 2025 before their maturity indicates a proactive approach to debt management. This decision to refinance existing debt could potentially reduce interest costs and extend the debt maturity profile, which is often viewed favorably by investors as it may improve the company's financial flexibility.However, the higher interest rate on the new notes compared to the old ones might raise concerns about the company's cost of capital and its impact on future earnings. The use of any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes is a common practice, but it lacks specificity and could lead to questions about the company's strategic priorities and operational plans. It is essential to monitor how this capital restructuring will affect the company's leverage ratios and overall financial health in the coming quarters. Debt Market Analyst Beazer Homes USA's issuance of the 7.500% Senior Unsecured Notes is a noteworthy event in the debt market, particularly due to the private offering nature and the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S for the offering highlights a targeted approach towards qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, which is a common strategy for companies seeking to access capital without public registration.The interest rate of 7.500% reflects the current market conditions and investor demand for corporate debt, especially considering the unsecured status of the notes, which typically commands a higher interest rate due to the increased risk. The successful completion of this offering suggests investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness, despite the inherent risks of unsecured debt. This transaction may also serve as a bellwether for similar issuances in the homebuilding industry and the broader unsecured debt market. 03/15/2024 - 10:25 AM ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Beazer Homes USA, Inc. (NYSE: BZH) (the âCompanyâ) announced today the completion of its previously-announced offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2031 (the âNotesâ). The Notes were offered in a private offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the âSecurities Actâ). The net proceeds of the offering will be used to finance the repurchase of the Companyâs 6.750% Senior Notes due 2025 (the â2025 Notesâ), of which $197.9 million in aggregate principal amount is currently outstanding and which mature on March 15, 2025, with any remaining proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes.

Unless so registered, the Notes cannot be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.

(AREB) announces a Regulation A+ equity financing of up to $19,999,995 through a Public Offering of Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. Investors can purchase 2.6+ million shares at $7.50 per share, with a 8.53% annual yield. The offering includes perks like hats, koozies, and VIP experiences. The company also launches America's Patriotic beer. CEO Andy Ross emphasizes the brand's patriotism and customer relationships. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of Regulation A+ equity financing by American Rebel Holdings, Inc. is a strategic move to diversify its capital structure and engage a broader investor base. The offering of 8.53% Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock is notable for its relatively high dividend yield, which stands above the average preferred stock dividend rates, typically ranging between 4% and 6%. This could indicate an aggressive approach to attract investors, possibly due to the company's specific capital needs or to fund growth initiatives.From a financial perspective, the conversion feature allowing preferred stock to be turned into common stock at a ratio of 5:1 could potentially dilute the value of existing common shares. However, it also presents an opportunity for investors to participate in the equity upside. The impact on the company's stock price will depend on the market's perception of this balance between dilution risk and growth potential.Furthermore, the use of perks to incentivize investment is an unusual tactic that may appeal to the company's target demographic. While this may not have a direct financial impact, it could foster brand loyalty and enhance customer-investor engagement. Market Research Analyst Launching a new product, American Rebel Light Beer, alongside the equity financing, suggests a synergistic marketing strategy aimed at cementing the company's brand identity. By aligning the product launch with patriotic themes, the company is targeting a niche demographic, which could potentially lead to a strong customer base if the branding resonates with the intended audience.However, the beverage market is highly competitive and the success of the new beer line will rely on effective differentiation. Given that the company is leveraging its brand's patriotic appeal, it will be important to monitor consumer reception and sales data post-launch to assess the efficacy of this strategy.It is also worth noting that while the thematic branding may attract a specific segment of consumers, it could also limit the brand's appeal to a broader market. This could have implications for the long-term scalability of the product line. Legal Expert The utilization of Regulation A+ allows American Rebel Holdings to raise capital from non-accredited investors, expanding the potential investor pool. This democratization of investment opportunities aligns with the company's branding of inclusivity and patriotism. However, it also introduces regulatory complexities that the company must navigate.Investors should be aware that Regulation A+ offerings are subject to certain limitations and risks, including less stringent disclosure requirements compared to traditional public offerings. It is important for potential investors to thoroughly review the offering circular and understand the terms of the preferred stock, including conversion rights and dividend payments.The offering's success will largely hinge on the company's ability to communicate the value proposition to potential investors and comply with the ongoing reporting obligations required under Regulation A+. 03/15/2024 - 10:22 AM Nashville, TN, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Rebel Holdings, Inc.

QVC's dedication to inclusive fashion and NYDJ's top-selling status at QVC make this collaboration significant, catering to the 5.5 million wheelchair users in the U.S. Positive None. Negative None. Fashion Industry Analyst The introduction of the Marilyn Straight Adapt-Denimâ¢ jean by NYDJ, in collaboration with QVC, represents a significant step in the fashion industry's journey towards inclusivity. This product expansion caters to the estimated 5.5 million wheelchair users in the U.S., as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, potentially opening up a new market segment for the brand. The adaptive clothing market has been growing, with Grand View Research estimating it could reach USD 400 billion by 2026. By being one of the first major denim brands to offer such a product, NYDJ could establish itself as an early leader in this niche but expanding market.From a business perspective, the exclusive partnership with QVC leverages the platform's vast reach and could drive significant sales volume given QVC's established customer base and live video commerce expertise. This strategic move may not only boost NYDJ's sales but also enhance QVC's brand as a diverse and inclusive shopping destination. The long-term impact could see competitors following suit, leading to a broader industry shift towards adaptive fashion offerings. Market Research Analyst Expanding into adaptive fashion aligns with consumer trends favoring brands that prioritize social responsibility and inclusivity. This launch could positively affect brand perception and customer loyalty for both NYDJ and QVC. The decision to adapt one of NYDJ's bestsellers, the Marilyn Straight jean, rather than creating a new, untested product, minimizes the risk while leveraging the existing popularity of the product.However, the success of this initiative will depend on effective marketing and the ability to reach the target demographic. The partnership with QVC provides a built-in audience, but additional outreach efforts will be necessary to ensure that the product reaches those who can benefit from it. The impact on the stock market or the companies' financial results will be contingent upon the sales performance of the new line and the operational costs associated with its production and marketing. Disability Inclusion Consultant The launch of the NYDJ Marilyn Straight Adapt-Denimâ¢ jean is more than just a business move; it's a statement on corporate social responsibility and the importance of inclusivity. The collaboration with the disability community in the product's development is a commendable approach that ensures the final product meets the actual needs of wheelchair users. This could set a precedent for how fashion brands approach design for people with disabilities.While the financial implications are important, the social impact and potential brand loyalty generated through such initiatives can be substantial. Companies that are seen as pioneers in inclusivity may enjoy a 'halo effect,' benefiting from positive consumer sentiment. In the long run, this can translate into a stronger market position and potentially influence stock performance as investors increasingly value companies with strong social credentials. 03/15/2024 - 10:00 AM The popular denim brand will launch an adaptive wheelchair-fit option of the bestselling Marilyn Straight jean, exclusively with QVC WEST CHESTER, Pa., March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- QVCÂ®, world leader in live video commerce (""vCommerce""), announced today that it has collaborated with NYDJ to launch the brand's first wheelchair-fit design jean, exclusively for QVC.

Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking information with respect to the Business Combination, which may not be included in future public filings or investor guidance. Certain statements in this press release may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about future events or LLPâs, TWOAâs or Pubcoâs future financial or operating performance. For example, statements regarding the benefits of the Business Combination, and the anticipated timing of the completion of the Business Combination are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as âpro forma,â âmay,â âshould,â âcould,â âmight,â âplan,â âpossible,â âproject,â âstrive,â âbudget,â âforecast,â âexpect,â âintend,â âwill,â âestimate,â âanticipate,â âbelieve,â âpredict,â âpotentialâ or âcontinue,â or the negatives of these terms or variations of them or similar terminology. These forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future results of LLP, Pubco and TWOA are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industry in which LLP operates, as well as the beliefs and assumptions of LLPâs management. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors beyond LLPâs, Pubcoâs or TWOAâs control that are difficult to predict because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. They are neither statements of historical fact nor promises or guarantees of future performance. Therefore, LLPâs and Pubcoâs actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements and LLP, Pubco and TWOA therefore caution against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by LLP and its management, TWOA and its management, and Pubco and its management, as the case may be, are inherently uncertain and are inherently subject to risks variability and contingencies, many of which are beyond LLPâs, TWOAâs or Pubcoâs control. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to: (i) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of any definitive agreements with respect to the Business Combination (the âBusiness Combination Agreementâ); (ii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against LLP, TWOA, Pubco or others following the announcement of the Business Combination and any definitive agreements with respect thereto; (iii) the inability to complete the Business Combination due to the failure to obtain consents and approvals of the shareholders of TWOA, to obtain financing to complete the Business Combination or to satisfy other conditions to closing, or delays in obtaining, adverse conditions contained in, or the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals required to complete the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement; (iv) changes to the proposed structure of the Business Combination that may be required or appropriate as a result of applicable laws or regulations or as a condition to obtaining regulatory approval of the Business Combination; (v) LLPâs and Pubcoâs ability to manage growth; (vi) the ability to meet stock exchange listing standards in connection with, and following, the consummation of the Business Combination; (vii) the risk that the Business Combination disrupts current plans and operations of LLP as a result of the announcement and consummation of the Business Combination; (viii) the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of Pubco or LLP to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain key relationships and retain its management and key employees; (ix) costs related to the Business Combination; (x) changes in applicable laws, regulations, political and economic developments; (xi) the possibility that LLP or Pubco may be adversely affected by other economic, business and/or competitive factors; (xii) LLPâs estimates of expenses and profitability; and (xiii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the filings by TWOA or Pubco with the SEC. There may be additional risks that neither LLP nor TWOA presently know or that LLP and TWOA currently believe are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of LLP, TWOA or Pubco speak only as of the date they are made. None of LLP, Pubco or TWOA undertakes any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in their respective expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

(NYSE: AGR), a leading sustainable energy company and a member of the Iberdrola Group, announced today that it is enhancing customer service at several of its electric and natural gas utilities by launching bill explainer videos. This new educational tool will be available for customers of United Illuminating (UI) in Connecticut, Central Maine Power (CMP) in Maine, and New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG) and Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) in New York. âCustomer education is an important facet of how we serve our more than 3.3 million electric and natural gas customers across the northeast,â said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. âWe understand that energy bills can be frustratingly complex with supply and delivery charges, taxes, and public policy costs. Our new bill explainer videos will clarify all of this so that our customers can review their monthly bills and feel empowered to make informed choices about their energy use.â In Connecticut, the new bill explainer video is a customer education resource to break down the newly redesigned UI electric bill, which launched in February 2024 following four years of collaboration between UIâs Customer Service Team and the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) Office of Education, Outreach, & Enforcement (EOE). The video explains the four components of the UI electric bill: Supply, which encompasses UIâs payments to electricity generating companies for the energy they produce; Transmission, which pays for the interstate network of high-voltage electric lines carrying electricity from generating facilities to UIâs distribution network; Local Delivery, which funds UIâs poles, wires, substations, and workforce; and Public Benefits, which encompass the costs of public policy programs that state policymakers require UI to implement. In Maine, CMP launched its first-ever animated bill explainer video last year on digital, web, and social platforms. Having already received 45,000 views, the video is the beginning of a multi-video series that addresses some of the most frequently asked questions CMP receives in a new, innovative and approachable way. In our first video, we explore the different parts of a customerâs power bill, like electric supply, delivery, and public policy charges and how these pieces come together to make up one number each month. New Yorkâs new bill explainer video is a customer education resource to illustrate the components of NYSEG and RG&Eâs electric and gas bills. The video explains the components of NYSEG and RG&Eâs electric and gas bills: Supply, which clarifies the companiesâ costs from electricity generating companies for the energy they produce and fluctuates because of global market conditions; Local Delivery, which funds the companiesâ infrastructure, grid, meters, and part of the cost of delivery of service; Also under Delivery are public policy charges â NYSEG and RG&E are required to collect these charges from customers to assist New York state in meeting clean energy goals.

The company unveils future concepts for K1 Super Tower, K10 Patrol, and K15 Tactical during Innovation Week. CEO William Santana Li hosts a virtual Town Hall to conclude the event. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Knightscope's announcement of a 128% increase in estimated revenues to $12.8 million is a substantial growth indicator, reflecting the company's expansion and potential market traction. This performance could signal to investors both the company's operational effectiveness and the market's increasing acceptance of AI and robotics solutions in public safety. However, the lack of audited financials and the explicit disclaimer that the figures are preliminary and unaudited suggests caution. Investors should consider the risks associated with potential adjustments that might arise from the final financial closing procedures.Moreover, the unveiling of future concepts like the K1 Super Tower and K10 Patrol indicates ongoing innovation, which could be a positive sign for long-term growth. However, it is essential to differentiate between product announcements and actual market-ready products. The impact on the stock will depend on the company's ability to convert these concepts into revenue-generating products. The market's response to these announcements could be mixed, as forward-looking statements about product development can lead to volatility in the stock price. Market Research Analyst The public safety sector is increasingly integrating technology solutions and Knightscope's focus on robotics and AI positions it well within this trend. The K1 Super Tower, K10 Patrol and K15 Tactical are likely designed to address specific market needs in surveillance and security. The company's strategy to innovate could help it capture a larger market share if these products resonate with customer needs and comply with industry regulations.However, the actual impact on the business will hinge on the company's execution of its go-to-market strategy and the competitive landscape. It will be critical for Knightscope to not only develop these products but also to effectively market them and secure contracts. The announcement during Innovation Week is a marketing move to generate buzz, but the proof will be in the sustained interest from potential clients and the conversion of that interest into sales. Technology Industry Analyst Knightscope's focus on innovation within the AI and robotics domain is noteworthy, considering the tech industry's rapid evolution. The development of the K1 Super Tower, K10 Patrol and K15 Tactical suggests an emphasis on specialized, tactical applications of technology. The AI-driven Mission Control component indicates an integration of AI not just in individual units but also at the strategic command level, which could be a key differentiator in the market.However, the adoption of such advanced technologies by public safety agencies and private security firms is contingent on factors like cost, reliability and regulatory compliance. As the company progresses from concept to deployment, it will need to navigate these challenges. The technology's sophistication and the promise of enhancing public safety are potentially transformative, but the path from concept to widespread adoption is often fraught with technical and market-based hurdles. 03/15/2024 - 09:35 AM Technology Innovator Unveils Future Concepts for K1 Super Tower, K10 Patrol and K15 Tactical MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Knightscope, Inc.

The company plans to file a technical report within 45 days of the announcement.","Osisko Development Announces Mineral Resource Update for the Trixie Deposit, Tintic Project Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Osisko Development Corp. announces an updated mineral resource estimate for its Trixie deposit in Utah, showing measured, indicated, and inferred resources of gold and silver. The 2024 Trixie MRE reflects changes in geologic interpretation and lower estimated grades, impacting contained gold ounces. The company plans to file a technical report within 45 days of the announcement. Positive None. Negative None. Mining Analyst The updated mineral resource estimate (MRE) for Osisko Development's Trixie deposit presents a mixed picture for stakeholders. On one hand, the decrease in measured, indicated and inferred gold ounces by 29% and 79% respectively, due to lower grade estimates, could raise concerns about the deposit's profitability and longevity. This revision reflects a more conservative and possibly more accurate representation of the deposit's potential, following extensive exploration and test mining.On the other hand, the company's acknowledgment of significant precious metal potential at depth and in parallel structures suggests that the current MRE may only represent a portion of the deposit's total value. The mention of copper-gold porphyry potential and polymetallic carbonate replacement potential indicates a diversification of mineral prospects, which could mitigate the impact of the reduced gold estimates.The technical aspects, such as the use of a stope optimizer algorithm and the assumption of underground longhole stoping mining methods, suggest a sophisticated approach to resource estimation. However, the reliance on gold equivalent grade calculations and the assumption of metallurgical recoveries must be carefully scrutinized to ensure they reflect realistic operational outcomes. Geologist The revised geological model and the updated MRE suggest a more nuanced understanding of the Trixie deposit's geology. High sulphidation epithermal mineralization and the structural context of the deposit are critical in determining the economic viability of the mining project. The shift in interpretation from stockwork to distinct high-grade structures could have significant implications for mining strategy and ore extraction techniques.The mention of native Au and Au-Ag rich telluride minerals indicates the presence of high-value ore, but the discontinuity of high-grade structures within the T4 Zone raises questions about the predictability and consistency of ore grades. The mapping of the 40 fault over considerable strike length and depth, however, provides a promising target for future exploration.Investors should be aware that the accuracy of the MRE is dependent on the quality of the data and the interpretative skills of the geologists. The involvement of independent qualified persons from Micon International Limited adds credibility to the MRE, but market confidence will ultimately hinge on the conversion of resources to reserves and the demonstration of economic viability. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the updated MRE for Osisko Development are multifaceted. The reduction in gold ounces could potentially lead to a downward adjustment in the company's asset valuation and possibly its stock price in the short term. However, the company's long-term prospects may be bolstered by the potential for additional high-grade targets and the expanded mineralization scope.The technical report to be filed will provide further detail on the economic assumptions used in the MRE, which are essential for financial modeling and valuation. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t Au, based on a gold price of US$1,750/oz, reflects a conservative gold price assumption that provides a buffer against price volatility. Yet, the actual economic viability will depend on the company's ability to extract and process the ore cost-effectively.Investors should consider the broader exploration strategy and the company's ability to finance and execute its exploration and development plans when assessing the impact of the MRE on the company's financial health and growth trajectory. 03/15/2024 - 09:32 AM Measured resources of 119,847 tonnes grading 27.36 grams per tonne (""g/t"") gold (""Au"") and 61.73 g/t silver (""Ag""), for a total of 105,437 ounces (""oz"") Au and 237,868 oz Ag.Indicated resources of 124,743 tonnes grading 11.17 g/t Au and 59.89 g/t Ag, for a total of 44,811 oz Au and 240,211 oz Ag.Inferred resources of 201,603 tonnes grading 7.80 g/t Au and 48.55 g/t Ag, for a total of 50,569 oz Au and 314,678 oz Ag. MONTREAL, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Osisko Development Corp. (NYSE: ODV, TSXV: ODV) (""Osisko Development"" or the ""Company"") announces an updated mineral resource estimate (""MRE"") for its 100%-owned underground Trixie deposit (the ""2024 Trixie MRE""), within the Company's wider Tintic Project (""Tintic"" or the ""Tintic Project""), located in the historic East Tintic Mining District in central Utah, U.S.A. The 2024 Trixie MRE incorporated an additional 1,674 underground chip samples over 1,678 meters (""m"") (5,507 feet (""ft"")) of underground development, and 7,385 m of drilling (24,229 ft) in 122 holes completed by the Company since the release of the initial Trixie MRE (the ""2023 Trixie MRE""), with an effective date of January 10, 2023. Relative to the 2023 Trixie MRE, contained gold ounces in measured and indicated resources decreased by 29% and inferred resources decreased by 79% primarily due to lower estimated grades that incorporated an updated geologic model interpretation and conversion of inferred resources. Drill results and underground mapping from the 2023 exploration program improved the knowledge of the extent and distribution of mineralization, resulting in modeling improvements to both mineralization and the historical mine shape model. Chris Lodder, President, stated, ""The 2024 Trixie MRE incorporates changes to our interpretation of the main mineralized structures and reflects better understanding of the structural controls of the deposit and realistic mining parameters following our exploration and test mining work in 2023. To date exploration and mining occurred on less than 10% of known mineralized structures in the west Tintic district and thus, we see significant precious metal potential at depth, on parallel structures to Trixie, along the Trixie and Sioux Ajax faults to the north and south, as well as around all historic high-grade gold mines in the West Tintic District. These high-grade gold targets, combined with the copper-gold porphyry potential where drilling is underway, and a large area of polymetallic carbonate replacement potential, illustrate that we have only scratched the surface in understanding the overall metal endowment potential of the Tintic district.""

San Martin, MAusIMM(CP), of Micon International Limited (i) has reviewed and validated the 2024 Trixie MRE, (ii) is considered to be independent of the Company for purposes of Section 1.5 of National Instrument 43-101 â Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101""), and (iii) is a ""qualified person"" within the meaning of NI 43-101.The mineral resources were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining (""CIM""), Metallurgy and Petroleum's ""CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves"" adopted by the CIM council.Mineral resources are reported when they are within potentially mineable shapes derived from a stope optimizer algorithm, assuming an underground longhole stoping mining method with stopes of 6.1 m x 6.1 m x minimum 1.5 m dimensions.Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.Geologic modelling was completed by Osisko Development modeling geologist Jody Laing, P.Geo, using Leapfrog Geo software. The 2024 Trixie MRE was completed by Osisko Development chief resource geologist, Daniel Downton, P.Geo using Datamine Studio RM 2.0 software. William Lewis and Alan J. San Martin of Micon International Limited independently reviewed and validated the mineral resource model.The estimate is reported for an underground mining scenario and with USD assumptions. The cut-off grade of 4.32 g/t Au was calculated using a gold price of US$1,750/oz, a CAD:USD exchange rate of 1.30; total mining, processing and G&A costs of US$168.04/imperial ton; a refining cost of US$2.65/ounce; a combined royalty of 4.50%; and an average metallurgical gold recovery of 80%.The stope optimizer algorithm evaluated the resources based on a gold equivalent grade which incorporates the silver grade estimate and assumes a silver price of US$23/oz and metallurgical silver recovery of 45%.The 2024 Trixie MRE is comprised of six zones within the greater Trixie area: T2, T3, T4, Wild Cat, 40 Fault and 75-85.Average bulk density values in the mineralized domains were assigned to the T2 (2.955 T/m3), T3 (2.638 T/m3), T4(2.618 T/m3), Wild Cat, and 40 Fault (2.621 T/m3), and 75-85 (2.617 T/m3) domains.Inverse Distance Squared interpolation method was used with a parent block size of 1.2 m x 2.4 m x 2.4 m.The Company intends to file a technical report (the ""Technical Report"") in respect of the 2024 Trixie MRE in accordance with NI 43-101 on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on EDGAR (www.sec.gov) under Osisko Development's issuer profile within 45 days of the date of this news release.The 2024 Trixie MRE results are presented in-situ. Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes, g/t). The number of tonnes is rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects.Neither the Company nor Micon International Limited is aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate other than disclosed in this news release.Technical information in this news release differs from similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. See below under ""Cautionary Statement to U.S. Investors"". TRIXIE MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE The 2024 Trixie MRE comprises six mineralized zones within the greater Trixie deposit, including T2, T3, T4, Wild Cat, 40 Fault and 75-85 over a strike length of 530 m, a maximum width of 105 m and to a maximum depth of 195 m for the deposit and is 350 m from surface (see cross section Figure 1). These dimensions are for the overall size of the mineralized zone structures, with the 2024 Trixie MRE blocks contained within a smaller 440 m strike length, 60 m total width and 195 m depth footprint.Gold mineralization is associated with high sulphidation epithermal mineralization, structurally controlled and hosted within the quartzites. Mineralization consists of native Au, and rare Au-Ag rich telluride minerals with quartz and quartz-barite-sulphosalt stockwork veining.The T2 Zone is the highest-grade structure within the overall deposit. In 2023, a total of 4,637 oz were recovered from processing mineralized material with an overall feed grade of 35.61 g/t Au. The 2023 drill program also converted ounces from inferred to indicated, and drilling at depth indicated a transition from high-grade gold to anomalous copper, which prompted the testing of the deep porphyry target at Trixie West.The T4 Zone envelops the T2, 40 fault, and Wild Cat domains. Within the T4 domain, there are discrete sub-vertical high-grade gold structures, defined on multiple levels and sections. However, these structures appear to be more discontinuous and less disseminated in the broader area than had been previously estimated. In 2023, mapping and modeling modified the interpretation from a stockwork to distinct high-grade structures. As a result, the model now incorporates tight search parameters around these structures, increasing confidence within the zone, while also including the quartz-barite-sulphosalt disseminated stockwork mineralization. A mineralized fault structure known as the 40 fault, is mapped over 230 m strike length and 80 m at depth and is about 1 m wide. This fault is a mineralized domain within the T4 and offsets vertically dipping epithermal Au-Ag structures.The Wildcat domain, a discrete structure within the T4, is steeply dipping to the east and strikes for 237 m and terminates at the 40 fault.The T1 Zone, previously described in the 2023 Trixie MRE, has been incorporated into the T4 Zone. The T1 Zone was previously an envelope on the contacts of both the 75-85 and T2 Zones. The T1 Zone had similar high-grade fissure zones as described in the T4 Zone, that are constrained within the T4 envelope. Additional drilling in this area also reduced the estimated contained gold above cut-off. The 75-85 Zone is a moderately west dipping silica sulphide cemented breccia zone. Drilling along strike to the south suggests that the 75-85 Zone truncates both the T2 structure and T4 zone. Mine development in 2023 intersected previously unknown stopes within the modelled 75-85 Zone and high-grade assays were less continuous at depth, although increasing down plunge.

TRIXIE AND GREATER TINTIC CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In 2023, the Company completed a total of 6,028 m (19,776 ft) of underground drilling in 73 diamond drill holes at Trixie. Assays were finalized up to hole TRXU-DD-23-069 and were included in the 2024 Trixie MRE.The new drilling, mapping and historical data compilation improved the interpretation and revealed that there is significant potential for parallel high-grade gold fissure zones similar to T2 and adjacent to the existing mine development. Much of the Trixie area remains unexplored.At Trixie, exploration potential remains highly prospective at depth near historical stopes that ceased mining at the water table. The Trixie deposit remains open to the north, along strike of T2, down dip below the historical 756, down plunge to the Survey Vein and additional, parallel structures are highly possible within the epithermal system.The Company continues to explore for additional high-sulphidation epithermal Au and Ag targets along the 4 km strike length of historical mines and has identified at least a dozen new drill ready targets from extensive data compilation and regional field work in 2023. Further work is recommended to test these targets (see Figure 3 for property wide historical deposits and exploration targets). PORPHYRY TARGET DRILLING Copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry potential remains an exploration priority for the Company. One diamond drill rig is currently active at surface testing a porphyry target at Big Hill and is at a current depth of 1,180 m (3,872 ft). Assays are pending for this drillhole.One drill hole tested a copper-gold-porphyry target below Trixie and was drilled to a depth of 759.6 m (2,492 ft) when it crossed the Eureka Lily Fault to the east and out of the prospective alteration zone. Further drill testing of a copper-gold porphyry target at depth below the Trixie deposit is recommended to the west.The development of the 1,390 m decline ramp at Trixie, completed in September 2023, significantly improving access to the underground workings for exploration development and drilling beyond the 625 level.The Company has advanced rehabilitation at the 750 level to allow for further underground diamond drilling to test for the down dip extent of the 756 zone and the porphyry target below Trixie.

Each QP is independent of Osisko Development within the meaning of NI 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the content in this news release. Quality Assurance (QA) â Quality Control (QC) All drill core and exploration samples are dispatched to ALS Geochemistry or SGS Canada for offsite sample preparation and analysis. Both labs are ISO/IEC 17025 certified, and ALS Geochemistry is also ISO 9001 certified. Samples are assigned a unique sample ID. All geological and sampling information is entered into a Datamine Fusion database. Core is sawn in half and half is sampled. Certified standards and blanks are inserted into all sample dispatches. Samples are collected by Old Dominion Transportation and dispatched to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, British Columbia or ALS Geochemistryâs laboratories in Elko, Nevada or Twin Falls, Idaho. Sample submission forms accompany the samples, and digital copies are emailed to the destination lab. Core sample preparation is completed by ALS Geochemistry or SGS Canada, including drying, crushing, and pulverizing of samples. Analytical assays include gold by 30-gram fire assay with AAS finish, and gold overlimits by fire assay with gravimetric finish. Screen metallic analyses are performed on selected samples. Multielement analysis (including silver) is by four-acid digest with ICP-AES/ICP-MS finish. The pulps are returned to Osisko Development and coarse rejects are disposed after 90 days. Assays are reported to Osisko Development and then loaded into Datamine Fusion. Quality Assurance-Quality Control samples are checked, and assays are merged with sample information for future reporting. Underground face samples are collected by Company geologists from each of the active mining faces, with samples transported by the geologists from Trixie to the on-site Company laboratory located at the Burgin administrative complex. Underground samples are dried, crushed to <10 mm and a 250 g split is taken. The split is pulverized, and a 30 g Fire Assay with gravimetric finish is completed to determine gold and silver grades, reported in oz/short ton and g/t. The Company's Burgin laboratory is not a certified analytical laboratory, but the facility is managed by a qualified laboratory manager with annual auditing by technical staff. The laboratory has been independently audited by Qualitica Consulting and Micon International Limited's QP with recommendations implemented. Inter-laboratory check assays using ALS Geochemistry as a third-party independent analysis of samples is routinely carried out as part of ongoing QA/QC work. Certified OREAS QC standards and blanks are inserted at regular intervals in the sample stream to monitor laboratory performance. True width is estimated to be approximately 0.5 m - 3 m (1.6 - 10 ft) for all fissure veins and discrete structures (T2, T3, 75-85, Wildcat and 40 Fault) and the T4 zone is modelled at an average width of 90 m (300 ft) and encompasses disseminated mineralization and discontinuous veins ranging from several cm to 1 m (3 ft). ABOUT OSISKO DEVELOPMENT CORP. Osisko Development Corp. is a North American gold development company focused on past-producing mining camps located in mining friendly jurisdictions with district scale potential. The Company's objective is to become an intermediate gold producer by advancing its 100%-owned Cariboo Gold Project, located in central B.C., Canada, the Tintic Project in the historic East Tintic mining district in Utah, U.S.A., and the San Antonio Gold Project in Sonora, Mexico. In addition to considerable brownfield exploration potential of these properties, that benefit from significant historical mining data, existing infrastructure and access to skilled labour, the Company's project pipeline is complemented by other prospective exploration properties. The Company's strategy is to develop attractive, long-life, socially and environmentally sustainable mining assets, while minimizing exposure to development risk and growing mineral resources.

The Company cautions that historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. Small scale test-mining at Trixie was suspended in December 2022 and resumed in the second quarter of 2023. Even with the resumption of small-scale test-mining at Trixie, there is no guarantee that production will continue as anticipated or at all or that anticipated production costs will be achieved. The failure to continue production may have a material adverse impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flow to fund operations. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs may have a material adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and potential profitability. In continuing current operations at Trixie, the Company has not based its decision to continue such operations on a feasibility study, or reported mineral resources or mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. Cautionary Statement to U.S. Investors The Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the applicable Canadian securities laws and, as a result, reports information regarding mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources, including the information in its technical reports, financial statements, MD&A and this news release, in accordance with Canadian reporting requirements, which are governed by NI 43-101. As such, such information concerning mineral properties, mineralization and estimates of mineral reserves and mineral resources, including the information in its technical reports, financial statements, MD&A and this news release, is not comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The re-order of high-quality wood-based activated carbon by CN Energy Group's subsidiary signifies a continued customer satisfaction and trust in the company's product. This is reflective of the company's ability to meet industry standards and maintain product quality over time. Activated carbon plays a important role in water purification, which is a market with increasing demand due to global water pollution concerns. The company's focus on using forest wastes and agricultural residues aligns with the rising trend of sustainable and eco-friendly products.As they expand internationally, the ability to maintain quality while being cost-competitive will be key. The global activated carbon market is competitive and CN Energy's strategy to enhance quality consistency and price competitiveness could help it gain a larger market share. However, it's important to monitor how the company manages the scaling of operations and entry into new markets, which often come with regulatory and logistical challenges. Environmental Sustainability Expert Utilizing advanced physical pyrolysis to convert forest waste and agricultural residues into activated carbon is a significant contribution to environmental sustainability. This process not only provides a use for what would otherwise be waste materials but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with the production of activated carbon. CN Energy Group's approach supports the circular economy and could appeal to environmentally conscious investors and customers.However, the environmental impact of scaling up production and entering new markets should be considered. The company's commitment to high technical specifications should ideally extend to environmental performance metrics, ensuring that growth does not come at the cost of sustainability. The long-term success of CN Energy in the water purification industry could hinge on balancing economic growth with environmental stewardship. Financial Analyst The announcement of a re-order from an existing customer is a positive sign for CN Energy Group's revenue stability and potential for growth. Repeat orders indicate a reliable revenue stream, which is favorable for the company's financial health. Additionally, the company's intent to penetrate international markets could open up new revenue channels and diversify its customer base, which is a positive indicator for investors looking for growth potential.However, investors should consider the costs associated with market expansion, such as increased marketing, regulatory compliance and potential tariff impacts. The company's financials should be scrutinized for its ability to fund these activities without negatively affecting its profitability. The stock market response to this news will likely hinge on the company's past performance in managing costs and its future projections in light of its expansion plans. 03/15/2024 - 09:30 AM LISHUI, China, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CN Energy Group.

Positive Total revenue for Q4 2023 was $7.1 million, a 37% decrease from Q4 2022. GAAP loss from operations in Q4 2023 was $5.3 million, primarily due to impairment of intangibles and goodwill. Full year 2023 revenue was $33.2 million, a 28% decrease from 2022. HCTI secured new contracts with leading life sciences and biopharmaceutical companies. The company launched initiatives in ransomware protection and AI-driven healthcare processes. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Negative Revenue declined in Q4 2023 and full year 2023 compared to previous periods. GAAP loss from operations increased in Q4 2023 and full year 2023 due to impairment of intangibles and goodwill. Financial Analyst The reported decline in revenue by Healthcare Triangle, Inc. is a significant concern for investors, as it indicates a contraction in the company's business operations. The 37% decrease in quarterly revenue year-over-year, coupled with a 28% annual revenue decline, suggests that the company may be facing challenges in maintaining its market position or adapting to industry changes. Furthermore, the impairment of intangibles and goodwill contributing to an increased GAAP loss from operations suggests that the company has had to adjust the value of certain assets, which can be indicative of underlying issues such as decreased future cash flow projections or a reevaluation of the company's growth prospects.Investors should also note the increase in net loss per share, despite an increase in weighted-average shares outstanding, which dilutes individual share value. The report mentions securing new contracts and initiatives, which may be positive signs for future growth, but it is essential to monitor whether these can offset current revenue losses and lead to profitability. The company's cash position is relatively low, which could raise concerns about its ability to sustain operations without additional financing. Overall, the financial results suggest caution and a need for close monitoring of Healthcare Triangle's strategic initiatives and their impact on financial health. Market Research Analyst Healthcare Triangle's focus on ransomware protection and AI-driven healthcare solutions aligns with current industry trends, where cybersecurity and data analytics are becoming increasingly important. The launch of new initiatives like the ransomware protection program and the medical document automation solution, readabl.ai, indicates the company's commitment to innovation and staying relevant in a competitive market. The healthcare sector's digital transformation is accelerating and the company's positioning in this space is strategic.However, the effectiveness of these initiatives in generating revenue and achieving market penetration needs to be assessed over time. The company's participation in conferences and educational webinars is a positive step towards brand visibility and customer acquisition, but the real test will be converting this into tangible financial results. With the healthcare AI market projected to reach $53 billion by 2024, Healthcare Triangle's success will largely depend on its ability to capture a significant market share and translate its technological capabilities into scalable solutions that meet the evolving demands of healthcare providers. Medical Technology Analyst Healthcare Triangle's investment in AI data processing and cloud enablement services is a forward-looking strategy, considering the growing importance of AI and cloud computing in the healthcare and life sciences industries. The company's efforts to provide HITRUST-certified Cloud DevOps Managed Services are commendable, as HITRUST certification is widely recognized in the industry for its rigorous security standards, which could make their services more attractive to potential clients concerned with data security.However, the financial results show that despite these strategic moves, the company has yet to see a positive impact on its bottom line. The multi-year contracts and subscription agreements mentioned are promising, but it's critical to evaluate the long-term value and profitability of these contracts. As the company continues to invest in new technology and service offerings, it will be important to balance innovation with cost management and to ensure that investments are driving sustainable growth. Stakeholders should look for evidence of improved operational efficiency and a clear path to profitability in future reports. 03/15/2024 - 09:28 AM PLEASANTON, Calif., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthcare Triangle, Inc.

The company aims to address multiple liver pathologies with a unique mechanism of action. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Patent Analyst The grant of a European patent for the combination therapy of Aramchol and Resmetirom by Galmed Pharmaceuticals represents a strategic move to secure the company's intellectual property rights in key markets. This development is particularly noteworthy as it extends the patent protection of Aramchol until 2039, thereby potentially increasing the product's lifecycle and revenue stream for an extended period. The inclusion of major European countries such as France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom underscores the significance of the patent in safeguarding market share in these territories.From a competitive standpoint, the unique mechanism of action of Aramchol, which targets stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in hepatic stellate cells, could differentiate it in a crowded NASH/MASH treatment landscape. This differentiation is important given the high prevalence and unmet medical need in the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with these conditions. The patent not only protects the combination therapy but also may deter competitors from entering the space with similar mechanisms, potentially resulting in a stronger position for Galmed in negotiations with partners or in attracting acquisition interest. Clinical Research Analyst The recent patent grant for the combination therapy involving Aramchol and Resmetirom highlights Galmed's commitment to addressing NASH/MASH, diseases with significant unmet medical needs. The Open-Label part of the Phase 3 NASH study showing high rates of fibrosis improvement with Aramchol 300mg BID is encouraging and suggests a promising future for the drug if the results are consistent in the larger, blinded cohort of the study. Such clinical outcomes are key in determining the commercial success of a drug, as they directly influence regulatory approvals and market adoption.Moreover, the combination therapy approach aligns with current scientific understanding that NASH is a multifactorial disease, often requiring a multi-modal treatment strategy. By targeting different aspects of the disease pathology, the combination of Aramchol and Resmetirom could potentially offer a more comprehensive treatment option, improving patient outcomes and potentially justifying premium pricing strategies upon market entry. The anticipation of patent approval in the United States and other countries could further bolster Galmed's market position, subject to the demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in ongoing studies. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM TEL AVIV, Israel, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: GLMD) (""Galmed"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company for liver, metabolic and fibrotic diseases announced today the grant of a European patent related to the use of a combination of Aramchol and Resmetirom (MGL-3196, REZDIFFRA) for the treatment of NASH/MASH and liver fibrosis. The patent was granted in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and the approval of the patent in the United States and other countries is pending. With this latest patent, Galmed is strengthening and extending the patent protection of its lead compound, Aramchol, until September 2039. Previously, Galmed reported results from the Open-Label part of its Phase 3 NASH study, which demonstrated that treatment with Aramchol 300mg BID resulted in a high rate of subjects with fibrosis improvement. https://galmedpharma.investorroom.com/2022-04-28-Galmed-reports-interim-results-from-the-Open-Label-part-of-the-ARMOR-study-with-Aramchol-showing-robust-fibrosis-improvement-across-multimodality-histological-assessment Galmed has long believed that the optimum treatment for NASH/MASH will be combination therapy. Aramchol has been shown to down-regulate the expression and activity of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in hepatic stellate cells, resulting in a direct effect on fibrogenesis. Aramchol's unique mechanism of action differs from others in its competitive landscape, positioning it to work as a potent anti-fibrotic compound alongside effective treatments in both approved and pre-approval stages. Allen Baharaff, CEO and President of Galmed Pharmaceuticals mentioned that ""this new patent for the combination of Aramchol and Resmetirom reflects the same spirit of earlier patents which were granted to Galmed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the treatment for hepatic fibrosis."" Mr. Baharaff continued ""It is clear today that NASH is a chronic condition with multiple liver pathologies. Among all pathologies, excessive liver fat, high glycemic index and fibrosis are major treatment challenges. By combining Aramchol and Resmetirom, two distinct and selective compounds with complementary mechanisms, we believe this will provide a perfect treatment for NASH."" About Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of Aramchol for liver and fibro-inflammatory diseases. We have focused almost exclusively on developing Aramchol for the treatment of NASH and are currently developing Aramchol for PSC and exploring the feasibility of developing Aramchol for other fibro-inflammatory indications outside of liver disease. We are also collaborating with the Hebrew University in the development of Amilo-5MER, a 5 amino acid synthetic peptide.

(SAIC) declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock, payable on April 26, 2024, to stockholders of record on April 12, 2024. SAIC plans to continue quarterly dividends, subject to board approval and financial factors. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend of $0.37 per share by Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) is a direct reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate positive cash flow. Dividends are typically a sign of a company's confidence in its ongoing profitability and often attract income-focused investors. The commitment to quarterly dividends can be seen as a signal to the market of SAIC's stable earnings and reliable financial standing.However, it's important to consider the dividend yield and payout ratio in relation to the company's overall financial performance. A high payout ratio could indicate that the company is returning most of its earnings to shareholders, which might limit the amount of capital available for future growth opportunities. Conversely, a modest payout ratio could suggest a balanced approach, supporting both shareholder returns and investment in strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst SAIC's announcement may have implications for investor sentiment and stock market performance. Dividends are often factored into the total return of a stock and as such, they can make a company more attractive to certain segments of the market. Additionally, the consistency of dividend payments can contribute to the perception of SAIC as a potentially lower-risk investment.It's also essential to assess the competitive landscape and how SAIC's dividend policy compares with peers in the industry. If SAIC's dividend yield is competitive, it could draw more attention from dividend investors. However, if competitors offer higher yields or if the industry is moving towards reinvestment rather than cash payouts, SAIC's stock might not benefit as much from the dividend declaration. 03/15/2024 - 09:20 AM RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Science Applications International Corp. (Nasdaq: SAIC) announced today that the companyâs board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.37 per share of the companyâs common stock payable on April 26, 2024 to stockholders of record on April 12, 2024.

Frequency Electronics Issues a Clarification to Yesterdayâs Earnings Call,2024-03-15T13:14:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Frequency Electronics, Inc. (FEIM) reported program charges impacting gross margins in Q4 2023 but expects revenue recovery of $1.2 million in 2024, leading to normal or higher gross margins.","Frequency Electronics Issues a Clarification to Yesterdayâs Earnings Call Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Frequency Electronics, Inc. (FEIM) reported program charges impacting gross margins in Q4 2023 but expects revenue recovery of $1.2 million in 2024, leading to normal or higher gross margins. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The mention of program charges impacting Frequency Electronics' gross margins indicates a notable financial event for the company. This scenario, where costs are recognized upfront while revenue recognition is deferred, is a result of percentage of completion accounting. This accounting method is common in industries where contracts span multiple periods, such as construction or defense contracting, which may be relevant to FEI's operations.Investors should note that the expected recovery of $1.2 million in revenue could provide a positive bump to the company's financial performance within the current calendar year. However, it is important to consider the company's historical margin trends and the nature of the charges to fully understand the potential impact. The assertion that margins will be at or above average upon revenue realization suggests management confidence, but it also hinges on the company's ability to manage costs effectively going forward. Market Research Analyst Understanding the competitive landscape is vital when evaluating the implications of FEI's gross margin fluctuations. If FEI operates in a highly competitive market, temporary setbacks in margin performance can affect its market positioning. Investors should assess whether FEI's margin recovery is in line with industry benchmarks and how this might influence its stock valuation.Furthermore, the company's ability to recover the $1.2 million in revenue and improve gross margins could signal operational resilience. This could potentially lead to a reevaluation of FEI's market prospects, especially if the recovery is faster or more significant than what is common among its peers. An analysis of industry trends and FEI's past performance in similar situations would provide valuable context for stakeholders. Accounting Expert Percentage of completion accounting can often lead to volatility in reported earnings, as seen with FEI's recent earnings call. The temporary reversal of revenue and subsequent conservative cost estimation may reflect an attempt to adhere to the prudence concept in accounting, which dictates that uncertain income should not be recorded until it is realized. This approach can lead to fluctuations in financial reporting from quarter to quarter.Stakeholders should also consider the tax implications of such accounting practices. If FEI is able to recover the revenue within the same fiscal year, the impact on the annual financial statements may be smoothed out, mitigating concerns of investors and analysts. However, if the recovery spans into the next fiscal year, it could result in a more complex financial analysis for both the company and its investors. 03/15/2024 - 09:14 AM MITCHEL FIELD, N.Y., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Frequency Electronics, Inc. (âFEIâ or the âCompanyâ) (NASDAQ-FEIM). On yesterdayâs earnings call, the Company discussed program charges that adversely affected its gross margins for the quarter ended January 31, 2024. As a result of percentage of completion accounting, these charges included a temporary reversal of revenue. The Company expects to recover approximately $1.2 million of this revenue during this calendar year. Because the costs have been conservatively estimated and already charged, when this revenue is realized, the Company estimates that it will be at normal or higher than average corporate gross margins.

(SLS) has announced a registered direct offering and private placement of common stock and warrants with institutional investors. The Offering includes 13,029,316 shares at $1.535 per share and warrants to purchase the same number of shares at $1.41 per share, expiring in 5.5 years. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the direct offering by SELLAS Life Sciences is a strategic move to raise capital, which could be indicative of the company's need for additional funds to progress its clinical trials or expand its operations. The offering price of $1.535 per share, coupled with the immediate exercisability of the warrants at $1.41, suggests a potentially dilutive event for current shareholders, which might lead to short-term bearish sentiment. However, the capital infusion could also be viewed positively if it accelerates the company's pipeline development, leading to long-term value creation.The fact that the warrants are priced slightly below the offering price and are exercisable for over five years provides investors with a longer-term incentive to bet on the company's success. This could attract investors who are willing to take a risk on the company's future performance, potentially leading to increased stock volatility in the near term. It is imperative for investors to consider the company's burn rate and the milestones they aim to achieve with the raised funds. Market Research Analyst Looking at the broader market, the biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive. Companies like SELLAS must continuously invest in research and development to stay relevant. The offering's timing and structure could reflect the company's strategic response to market conditions and investor appetite for risk in the biotech sector. The at-the-market pricing mechanism indicates a move to align with current market valuations, avoiding the potential discounting that often comes with larger capital raises.Investors should assess the impact of this offering on SELLAS's market position, especially how the proceeds will be used to navigate the competitive landscape. If the funds are allocated efficiently towards advancing a promising drug candidate or expanding into new oncology indications, the company could emerge as a stronger player in the long run. However, if the market perceives the move as a sign of financial distress or a lack of better financing options, it could lead to a negative market reaction. Biotech Industry Analyst In the context of the biotech industry, the success of such a capital raise is often contingent upon the perceived potential of the company's drug pipeline. For SELLAS, the funds raised may enable them to reach critical milestones, such as completing late-stage clinical trials or preparing for regulatory submissions. The specific use of proceeds should be scrutinized to gauge the company's strategic priorities and the likelihood of achieving regulatory approval and market penetration.Additionally, the exercise price of the warrants being close to the offering price suggests confidence in the company's valuation and prospects. The extended expiration period of the warrants provides a long-term horizon, which could be appealing to investors who believe in the future success of the company's therapies. It is essential to analyze the company's historical performance in managing its pipeline and bringing therapies to market to inform expectations about the potential return on this investment. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.

LTD. (the ""Target"") pursuant to a share purchase agreement dated March 4, 2024 (the ""Agreement"") with the Target and all of the shareholders of the Target (the ""Vendors""). The Target holds a 100% interest in 13 mining licenses totalling 17,375 Hectares (the ""Property"") which adjoin the Company's Pipestone Project in central Newfoundland.Project Highlights:Increased project size, covers approximately 210 square kilometres of mineralized belt;Avante is the first company to target awaruite (nickel-iron alloy) in this region since 2012;Increased size secures the majority of the nickeliferous Pipestone ultramafic complex;Historical drilling in the north Property area re-assayed up to 0.27% Ni and 0.22% Ni over the entire hole of 87.15 metres (bottomed in mineralization) and remains open in all directions (NFLD/3284);Good infrastructure with existing road access extending onto the Property and a hydroelectric generating station located approximately 15km south of the Property; andMajor expanded regional compilation underway to allow acceleration through early-stage exploration on the Property.Adrian Smith comments, ""We are excited to be moving the Pipestone Project forward at an accelerated pace where we now control the majority of the nickeliferous Pipestone ultramafic complex in central Newfoundland. We believe this project is located in a top tier jurisdiction to develop mining projects and are now well into the process of compiling the significant amount of work that has been completed within the Property area including the sampling from Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (""Cliffs""). Cliffs previously identified the Pipestone belt as a top priority project with the potential to define an awaruite deposit similar to the Decar property owned by FPX Nickel.""The Pipestone Project now covers over 40 kilometers of strike effectively securing the majority of the nickeliferous Pipestone ophiolite ultramafic complex. The project is ideally located in central Newfoundland with road access to the north and south; it also has access to a hydroelectric power station within 15 kilometers south of the Property.Target mineralization within this belt includes bulk tonnage style near surface nickel mineralization within the ultramafic rocks containing a high primary nickel content. The Company is working to define areas within the Property where these rocks have been altered to convert the primary nickel into either a nickel-iron alloy (awaruite) or a nickel-sulphide. Areas of awaruite mineralization represent an opportunity for a ""green"" nickel source. Awaruite deposits such as FPX Nickel's PFS level Baptiste Project have been validated by investment from the Canadian government, Finnish steel producer, Outokumpu, and Japanese JOGMEC.

The study highlights the importance of English fluency for personal and professional growth. Positive None. Negative None. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM Floridians who speak English as a second language focused on reducing AI-related job uncertainty MIAMI, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Pearson (FTSE: PSON.L), the world's leading learning company, today announced the results of a study looking at what motivates professionals across Florida to study a language, finding that concerns include someday losing their job to AI and automation, as well as seeing English fluency as the biggest hindrance to personal and professional success. Titled ""How English Empowers Your Tomorrow: The Life Changing Impact of Learning English on your Career and Beyond,"" the Pearson findings for Florida include: The concern about AI's impact on careers crosses the generations. 52% of Baby Boomers learning English as a second language are motivated to learn English as a strategic move, preparing for potential job shifts due to AI advancements. Even Gen Z (38%), though less concerned, acknowledges the need for language skills to prepare to be potentially moved out of their current career.There's a disconnect between what employees want and what employers provide. While 90% of respondents say on-the-job training of language skills are important, just 31% say their jobs offer anything like that today.Lack of fluency is keeping many immigrants to Florida in jobs below the ones they left at home. 37% of people of Florida immigrants are working in jobs they consider to be lower status than their previous roles, citing lack of language proficiency as the reason for the career step backwards.The report also found second language English speakers report higher job satisfaction with advanced English proficiency, and that fluency helps in social circles too, unlocking opportunities to feel more comfortable and make friends. Additionally, 36% cited proficiency as key to accessing critical services in fields like healthcare and education. ""Our study underscores the transformative power of language proficiency,"" said Paula Sacchini, the Miami-based head of marketing for North America for Pearson. ""As AI continues to shape the workforce, English fluency becomes a critical asset for career resilience and for unlocking your full personal and professional potential."" Pearson chose Florida as a key market to study due to its international diversity, rapid growth and the number of businesses considering Florida for a base of operations in the near future. With reports estimating as many as 1,200 people move to Florida in the average day, the continued prosperity of these new Floridians will continue to require assessment on how to measure and develop the necessary skills to ensure the state's workforce is ready for tomorrow's changing career landscape. Pearson interviewed more than 5,000 speakers of English as a second or additional language from Japan, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Italy, and Florida. Across all regions, the vast majority (80%) believe English skills are directly linked to higher earning potential, while two fifths (40%) think strong English language skills can lead to as much as a 50-80% salary increase. Those with the highest English proficiency are more satisfied with their existing income and jobs. According to the research, three quarters (75%) of advanced English speakers are satisfied with their income, compared with less than half (47%) of beginner English speakers. Nearly 9 in 10 (88%) advanced speakers are satisfied with their job, but this number goes down to fewer than two thirds (64%) among beginners. ""This new research shows the importance of English in helping people lead more fulfilling lives both in and outside of the workplace,"" said Gio Giovannelli, president of Pearson, English Language Learning. ""And yet, many people still struggle with a lack of confidence in their English proficiency, which is having an impact on their ability to perform daily tasks at work, to interact with others, and even to simply engage with the world around them, or on social media. With an AI-dominated future causing job uncertainty, the importance of English as a differentiating skill will only grow, which is why we're encouraging people who want to learn English to act now and boost their skills fast with learning that's personalised to their level."" Pearson commissioned the research in line with its Global Scale of English (GSE) framework. The GSE offers fast language learning by understanding exactly where each individual is on their journey and giving them confidence in their own skills. With the research, Pearson wanted to understand people's reasons for learning English, as well as their current confidence levels when using the language. Globally, the results showed English skills are critical beyond just job and income prospects: 79% of respondents said it's an important skill in their personal lives81% think it will be increasingly necessary in the future.Nearly half said that making progress in English has made them confident across all areas of their life.Motivators for wanting to learn English outside of work included: a desire to travel more (55%),to be able to watch TV, film and online content in English (50%) andto be able to read the English around them (48%).For more information on Pearson and to improve your English skills with the GSE, please visit: The Impact of English - Learners, English Language | Pearson Languages. About the researchPearson's study of more than 5,000 speakers of English as a second or additional language was conducted by PSB Insights at the end of 2023 across Japan, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Italy and Florida. Respondents were aged 18-64, who were not fluent in English, didn't speak it as a first language, and were either: actively learning English, regularly using English at work, professionally motivated to learn English or believed English would make their job easier or improve their job prospects.

About Oncternal TherapeuticsOncternal Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for the treatment of patients with cancers that have critical unmet medical need. Oncternal pursues drug development targeting promising, yet untapped biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression, focusing on hematological malignancies and prostate cancer. ONCT-534 is an investigational dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor (DAARI) with demonstrated preclinical activity in prostate cancer models against both unmutated androgen receptor (AR), and against multiple forms of AR aberration. It is a potential treatment for patients with mCRPC with unmet medical need because of resistance to androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, including those with AR amplification, mutations in the AR ligand binding domain (LBD), or splice variants with loss of the AR LBD. Study ONCT-534-101 (NCT05917470) has dosed patients and continues to enroll patients for treatment with mCRPC. ONCT-808 is an investigational autologous chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy that targets Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-Like Orphan Receptor 1 (ROR1) using the binding domain from zilovertamab. ONCT-808 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models against multiple hematological malignancies and solid tumors and has been shown to be specific for cancer cells expressing ROR1. Oncternal has developed a robust and reproducible manufacturing process that has the potential to reduce the time patients must wait for their individual CAR T therapy to be produced, compared with currently approved CAR T products. Oncternal has dosed patients under Study ONCT-808-101 (NCT05588440) with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including patients who have failed previous CD19 CAR T treatment. Zilovertamab is an investigational monoclonal antibody designed to inhibit the function of ROR1. Zilovertamab has been evaluated in a Phase 1/2 Study CIRM-0001 (NCT03088878) in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), which resulted in 100% progression free survival (PFS) at 42 months in CLL patients expressing a p53 mutation/del(17p), a population underserved by current treatment options. Zilovertamab is also being evaluated in an investigator-initiated Phase 1b study of zilovertamab in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (NCT05156905).

JanOne Regains Compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Requirements,2024-03-15T13:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"JanOne (JAN) has successfully regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq, closing at $1.00 per share or greater for the last 10 consecutive business days.","JanOne Regains Compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Requirements Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary JanOne (JAN) has successfully regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq, closing at $1.00 per share or greater for the last 10 consecutive business days. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a positive signal to investors and can potentially lead to increased investor confidence. For a company like JanOne, which operates in the competitive biopharmaceutical space, maintaining its listing on a major exchange like Nasdaq is essential for visibility and access to capital. The compliance alleviates the immediate risk of delisting, which can have severe consequences such as reduced liquidity and limited access to funding.However, it's important to note that the recovery in stock price must be sustained to ensure long-term stability. Investors should monitor the company's performance and fundamentals to assess whether the improvement in stock price reflects genuine growth prospects or short-term fluctuations. The development of non-addicting painkillers addresses a significant market need, given the ongoing opioid crisis and success in this area could lead to substantial growth for JanOne. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the news of JanOne regaining compliance with Nasdaq's Minimum Bid Price Requirement suggests that the company has managed to improve market sentiment or its financial health to some extent. This development may lead to a reevaluation of the company's stock by analysts and investors. The market often views the avoidance of delisting as a reversal of negative trends, which could result in a more favorable outlook for the company's stock.It's also important for potential investors to consider the volatility of biopharmaceutical stocks, which are often driven by clinical trial results, regulatory approvals and market adoption of new treatments. The long-term impact on JanOne's stock will depend on its ability to capitalize on its regained Nasdaq compliance and continue advancing its product pipeline effectively. Biotech Industry Analyst In the context of the biopharmaceutical industry, JanOne's focus on developing non-addictive painkillers is noteworthy. The opioid epidemic has created a demand for safer pain management therapies and companies that can deliver on this need have the potential for significant market penetration. The regained compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules may provide JanOne with the stability needed to continue its research and development efforts without the overhang of potential delisting.Investors should consider the company's pipeline and the stage of development of its treatments. The regulatory pathway for novel drugs can be long and costly, with no guarantee of success. The company's ability to navigate clinical trials and secure regulatory approval will be critical in determining its future financial performance. The regained compliance is a step in the right direction, but the company's value proposition ultimately hinges on its scientific and commercial achievements. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM LAS VEGAS, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JanOne (Nasdaq: JAN), the biopharmaceutical company focused on developing non-addicting painkillers and novel treatments for the causes of pain, today announced that on March 13, 2024 it received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Company had regained compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the ""Minimum Bid Price Requirement"").

Nasdaq has determined that for the last 10 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company's common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, the Staff informed the Company that it has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and that this matter is closed. About JanOne Inc. â JanOne is a unique Nasdaq-listed company offering innovative, actionable solutions intended to help end the opioid crisis.

American Rebel also introduces America's Patriotic Beer, emphasizing its commitment to patriotism and freedom. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of American Rebel Holdings, Inc.'s Regulation A+ equity financing represents a strategic move to raise capital while engaging directly with the consumer base. The offering of 8.53% Series C Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock at $7.50 per share could appeal to retail investors looking for fixed income, given the relatively high annual yield. The conversion feature into common stock also introduces a potential equity upside.However, the inclusion of branded merchandise and experiences as perks for investment could raise questions about the seriousness of the investment proposition. While this approach might strengthen brand loyalty, it may also suggest a marketing-driven rather than investment-driven strategy, which could affect investor perception.Furthermore, the simultaneous launch of a new beer product leverages the company's brand identity but introduces operational risks. The success of this diversification will depend on the company's ability to effectively manage production, distribution and marketing within a competitive beverage industry. Market Research Analyst Regulation A+ offerings are designed to make it easier for smaller, growth-oriented companies to access capital and American Rebel's decision to utilize this avenue suggests an appeal to a broader, non-institutional investor base. The company's brand positioning as 'America's Patriotic brand' could resonate with a specific demographic, potentially increasing participation rates among like-minded investors.However, the effectiveness of this strategy will hinge on the company's ability to convert brand loyalty into investment behavior. The move might also signal to the market that American Rebel is seeking alternative funding sources, possibly due to difficulties in accessing traditional capital markets. This could be a red flag for some investors, as it may indicate underlying financial or operational challenges. Securities Compliance Expert A Regulation A+ offering, while accessible, still requires the issuer to meet specific SEC requirements, including the filing of an offering statement. Potential investors should scrutinize the offering circular posted on the SEC's website to understand the risks and terms associated with the Series C Preferred Stock. The compliance with these regulations is key for investor confidence and the long-term sustainability of the offering.Additionally, the company's communication strategy, emphasizing its brand identity and offering investment perks, must align with SEC guidelines for promotional materials. Any missteps in regulatory compliance could result in penalties and damage to investor trust, impacting the company's reputation and stock performance. 03/15/2024 - 08:58 AM Nashville, TN, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Rebel Holdings, Inc.

Financial Analyst The reported financials of Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. indicate a significant year-over-year increase in Q4 Net Income, rising from $0.5 million in Q4 2022 to $10.8 million in Q4 2023. This substantial growth in profitability, especially in the context of a volatile Capesize market, demonstrates the company's effective hedging strategies and operational efficiencies. The decline in annual Net Revenues from $125.0 million to $110.2 million alongside a drop in Net Income from $17.2 million to $2.3 million for the full year suggests that while the company navigated Q4 effectively, there were challenges over the 12-month period that impacted overall performance.From an investment perspective, the declaration of a special dividend on top of the regular quarterly dividend is a positive indicator of the company's confidence in its cash flow and commitment to shareholder returns. However, investors should consider the sustainability of such payouts in the context of the company's long-term debt and the capital expenditures required to maintain and grow its fleet. Market Research Analyst Seanergy's strategic moves, including the acquisition of dry bulk vessels and participation in the EU-funded SAFeCRAFT project, suggest a proactive approach to capitalizing on market opportunities and investing in sustainable technologies. The shipping industry is increasingly focused on environmental impact and Seanergy's involvement in SAFs may provide a competitive edge.However, the reduced annual Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA could raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory in the face of a fluctuating Capesize market. The company's fleet expansion and the reported increase in the average daily OPEX per Capesize vessel, albeit marginal, will have implications for operating costs and profitability in future quarters. Economist The shipping industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to global economic conditions. Seanergy's performance, particularly the increased TCE rate in Q4 2023, reflects a stronger Capesize market, which is indicative of broader economic trends, such as commodity demand and trade flows. The company's ability to secure refinancing at improved terms, thereby generating additional liquidity, is a testament to its financial management and market conditions conducive to such arrangements.Looking ahead, the company's financial health will be influenced by macroeconomic factors, including international trade policies and fuel prices. The lack of loan maturities until Q2 2025 provides a buffer against short-term liquidity risks but does not eliminate the need for careful monitoring of leverage and interest rate exposure, especially in a potentially rising rate environment. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM Highlights (in million USD, except EPS) Q4 2023Q4 202212M 202312M 2022Net revenues $39.4$28.5$110.2$125.0Net income $10.8$0.5$2.3$17.2Adjusted net income1 $11.4$0.9$11.9$23.3EBITDA1 $23.3$12.9$51.3$60.5Adjusted EBITDA1 $23.9$13.3$53.0$66.6 Earnings per share Basic1,2 $0.55$0.03$0.12$0.97Earnings per share Diluted1,2 $0.55$0.03$0.12$0.96Adjusted earnings per share Basic1,2 $0.58$0.05$0.64$1.32Adjusted earnings per share Diluted1,2 $0.58$0.05$0.64$1.32 Other Highlights and Developments: Quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share consisting of a regular cash dividend of $0.025 per share for Q4 2023 and a special cash dividend of $0.075 per shareTotal cash dividends of $1.45 per share, or $26.4 million declared since March 2022Acquisition of a 2011-built Newcastlemax dry bulk vessel through a 12-month bareboat charter with a purchase optionAcquisition of a 2013-built Japanese Capesize vessel with estimated delivery in Q2 2024 Completion of $53.8 million in refinancings during 2023 at improved terms generating $15.0 million in additional liquidity; no loan maturities until Q2 2025 The only Greek-based shipping company to participate in the European Union (EU) funded SAFeCRAFT project in partnership with major industry stakeholders to demonstrate the safety and viability of Sustainable Alternative Fuels (SAFs) on existing vessels ATHENS, Greece, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp.

Please see the reconciliation below of TCE rate to net revenues from vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Stamatis Tsantanis, the Companyâs Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, stated: âIn 2023 we delivered another profitable year for Seanergy despite a very volatile Capesize market, building on our robust commercial performance, our hedging activities and the investments we have made in improving our vessels' efficiency over the years. In doing so, we successfully navigated extreme freight rate instability and achieved a healthy mix of fleet growth, accretion and cash dividends. We are executing a clear strategy that includes investing in our fleet to drive growth and efficiencies, delivering durable capital returns to shareholders and maintaining a healthy balance sheet with sustainable debt levels. The actions we have taken to grow our fleet substantially over the past three years with quality assets and further strengthen our balance sheet have us optimally positioned to reap the benefits of what looks like a very strong Capesize market. âIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded net income of $10.8 million as our fleet benefited from the strong Capesize market, while our board of directors approved a special dividend of $0.075 per share in addition to our ordinary quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share. At the same time, we are constantly evaluating the most efficient ways to continue returning capital to our shareholders in the coming quarters consistent with the financial performance of the Company. âIn the fourth quarter, we also fully repaid the remaining portion of our only outstanding convertible note, eliminating the possibility of dilution for our shareholders. Moreover, in 2023 and to date, we have completed $2.5 million in share repurchases, or 490,843 shares at an average price of about $5.12, which is 44% lower than our stockâs current trading price4. In comparison, under our recently announced ATM program, we have sales of $2.3 million, or 288,874 shares at an average price of $8.03 per share. This is evidently an accretive combination. In addition, within 2023 we closed a tender offer for the purchase of 4,038,114 of our outstanding warrants at a fraction of their value, simplifying further our capital structure. Finally, within 2023, I have also completed $1.1 million in open market purchases of Seanergyâs common shares. âDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, our fleet recorded a daily time charter equivalent rate of $24,920, leading to adjusted EBITDA of $23.9 million, substantially higher than the respective figures from the same period last year. For the full year period, we recorded a time charter equivalent of $17,501, exceeding the Baltic Capesize Index average of $16,389, while achieving an adjusted EBITDA of $53.0 million and net income of $2.3 million. Our proven ability to limit downside risk while also maintaining significant exposure to rising Capesize rates is encouraging and remains a central aspect of our strategy. âLooking ahead, we are currently undergoing the strongest first quarter for the Capesize market since 2011 and we expect our commercial performance to remain solid. In terms of guidance for the first quarter of 2024, assuming that the remaining days of March are consistent with current FFA levels, we expect our daily TCE to be equal to about $23,219. Additionally, we have taken advantage of the recent upswing in freight futures levels by converting about half of our second-quarter ownership days at a fixed gross rate of approximately $28,300 in order to secure additional strong cash-flow for the Company. âAs regards our fleet developments, in 2023 we acquired our first Newcastlemax vessel through a 12-month bareboat charter with a purchase option. The vessel was delivered in the fourth quarter and commenced her employment with a first-class European charterer at a significant premium over the index. More recently, in February we agreed to acquire a 181,392 dwt Capesize bulk carrier, built in 2013 in Japan. The agreement for this acquisition was well-timed as it occurred prior to the steep upwards adjustment in vessel values witnessed over the recent weeks. Delivery is expected to take place between April and June, and we look forward to adding another high-quality vessel to our fleet acquired at an attractive price. Additionally, we extended the duration of time-charter employment on six of our vessels at index linked rates for periods ranging from 11 to 24 months. âConcerning our ESG initiatives, we recently announced that we are the only Greek-based shipping company to participate in the EU funded SAFeCRAFT project. This collaborative approach amongst leading stakeholders of our industry, including classification societies and manufacturers, the academic community and the European Union, aims in contributing to the development of greener solutions for the existing fleet, which will have an immediate impact on our ESG objectives. âAs a brief comment on the outlook of our market, ton-mile demand is expected to exceed net fleet growth in the next two years with healthy raw material flows. The Capesize orderbook is at historically low levels, while trade volumes and the need for fleet replacement due to environmental regulations have grown considerably. The high congestion resulting from port inefficiencies after the pandemic has normalized and is now closer to the low end of the historical range. As such there is little room for further efficiency gains and more potential for disruptions that are likely to benefit our market as has been the case with the tensions in the Red Sea and the low water levels in the Panama Canal. âOverall, we remain highly optimistic about the Companyâs prospects and our ability to deliver enhanced value to shareholders, as Seanergy is well-placed to benefit from the rising trend in the Capesize market through our high-quality fleet, index-linked market exposure and strong financial position.â _________________________4 Based on the closing share price on March 13, 2024.

Ownership days are an indicator of the size of the Companyâs fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that the Company recorded during a period. (2) Operating days are the number of available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that the vessels are off-hire due to unforeseen circumstances. Available days are the number of ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to major repairs, dry-dockings, lay-up or special or intermediate surveys. Operating days include the days that our vessels are in ballast voyages without having finalized agreements for their next employment. The Companyâs calculation of operating days may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. (3) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that the vessels are generating revenue and is determined by dividing operating days by ownership days for the relevant period. Fleet Utilization is used to measure a companyâs ability to efficiently find suitable employment for its vessels and minimize the number of days that its vessels are off-hire for unforeseen events. We believe it provides additional meaningful information and assists management in making decisions regarding areas where we may be able to improve efficiency and increase revenue and because we believe that it provides useful information to investors regarding the efficiency of our operations. (4) TCE rate is defined as the Companyâs net revenue less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of the Companyâs operating days during the period. Voyage expenses include port charges, bunker (fuel oil and diesel oil) expenses, canal charges and other commissions. The Company includes the TCE rate, which is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP, as it believes it provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with net revenues from vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, and because it assists the Companyâs management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of our vessels and because the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors regarding our financial performance. The Companyâs calculation of TCE rate may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. The following table reconciles the Companyâs net revenues from vessels to the TCE rate.

Assuming that for our remaining operating days the average of the BCI will be equal to the average Capesize Forward Freight Agreement (âFFAâ) rate of $34,446 per day (based on the FFA curve as of March 12, 2024), our estimated TCE rate for the first quarter of 2024 will be approximately $23,219. The following table provides the breakdown of index-linked charters and fixed-rate charters in the first quarter of 2024: Operating DaysTCETCE - fixed rate (index-linked conversion)455$18,683TCE - fixed rate0N/ATCE â index-linked1,092$24,940Total / Average1,547$23,219 _________________________5 This guidance is based on certain assumptions and there can be no assurance that these TCE rate estimates, or projected utilization will be realized. TCE estimates include certain floating (index) to fixed rate conversions concluded in previous periods. For vessels on index-linked T/Cs, the TCE rate realized will vary with the underlying index, and for the purposes of this guidance, the BCI rate assumed for the remaining operating days of the quarter for index-linked T/Cs is equal to the average FFA rate of $34,446 based on the curve as of March 12, 2024. Spot estimates are provided using the load-to-discharge method of accounting. The rates quoted are for days currently contracted. Increased ballast days at the end of the quarter will reduce the additional revenues that can be booked based on the accounting cut-offs and therefore the resulting TCE rate will be reduced accordingly. Fourth Quarter and Recent Developments: Dividend Distribution for Q3 2023 and Declaration of Special and Regular Dividends On January 10, 2024, the Company paid the previously announced quarterly dividend of $0.025 per common share, for the third quarter of 2023, to all shareholders of record as of December 22, 2023. Continuing its quarterly dividend payments, the Company has declared a regular cash dividend of $0.025 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2023 payable on or about April 10, 2024 to all shareholders of record as of March 25, 2024.

All the abovementioned shares have been cancelled and removed from the Companyâs share capital as of the date of this release. At-The-Market Offering Program On December 14, 2023, the Company filed a prospectus supplement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an âat-the-marketâ equity offering program under which, through B. Riley as sales agent, it may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to $30.0 million.

ESG Updates SAFeCRAFT Project In December 2023, the Company accomplished a strategic partnership via the European Union funded SAFeCRAFT Project Consortium (âSAFeCRAFTâ), a breakthrough initiative concerning the utilization of alternative fuels. SAFeCRAFT aims to demonstrate the safety and viability of Sustainable Alternative Fuels (SAFs) in seaborne transportation, accelerating the adoption of SAFs technologies. Seanergy will provide one of its existing, conventionally fueled Capesize vessels as the demonstrating vessel under SAFeCRAFT which will be retrofitted to utilize hydrogen (H2) as the main energy source for electric power generation. This system is also expected to cover a portion of the vessel's propulsion requirements and, therefore, to reduce reliance on conventional fuels. This visionary project has a duration of 48 months starting from December 2023 and is co-funded by the consortium partners and the European Unionâs key funding program for research and innovation, the âHorizon Europeâ program, aligning with the FuelEU Maritime 2040 targets and demonstrating a decisive ambition to achieve a 26% reduction of CO2eq in an existing vessel. ESG Report for 2022 On December 6, 2023, the Company released its Environmental, Social and Governance Report (âESG Reportâ) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ESG Report provides an overview of Seanergyâs policies and initiatives relating to environmental, social and governance commitments of the Company and has been developed in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 2021) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for Maritime Transportation. Recent Litigation On March 6, 2024, Sphinx Investment Corp., a purported shareholder of the Company, submitted a complaint in the High Court of the Republic of the Marshall Islands naming the Company and the members of its board of directors as defendants. The complaint alleges, among other things, violations of fiduciary duties in connection with the issuance of Series B preferred stock of the Company in December 2021. The Company is evaluating the lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend itself. Vessel Transactions and Commercial Updates M/V Iconship On February 5, 2024, the Company agreed to acquire the 181,392 dwt Capesize bulk carrier, built in 2013 in Japan, which will be renamed M/V Iconship.

KT&G issues response letter to ISS and shareholders regarding ISS' unilateral proxy voting recommendation against the Board,2024-03-15T12:46:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"KT&G  responds to Institutional Shareholder Services' recommendations, highlighting concerns over reliance on dissident shareholder data and potential impacts on shareholder value.","KT&G issues response letter to ISS and shareholders regarding ISS' unilateral proxy voting recommendation against the Board Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary KT&G responds to Institutional Shareholder Services' recommendations, highlighting concerns over reliance on dissident shareholder data and potential impacts on shareholder value. Positive KT&G clarifies its position on ISS' recommendations Concerns raised over ISS' reliance on data from dissident shareholder FCP KT&G questions ISS' recommendation against CEO nominee Kyung-man Bang Issues with ISS' recommendation against Board-endorsed Outside Candidate director candidate Sang-wook Kwak Contradictions in ISS' recommendation for Outside Director nominee Dong-hwan Son Company expresses concerns over ISS and FCP interactions Negative None. 03/15/2024 - 08:46 AM SEOUL, South Korea, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- KT&G Corporation (""KT&G"" or the ""Company"") (KRX:033780) responded to Institutional Shareholder Services' (""ISS"") unilateral recommendation to vote against KT&G Board of Directors' (""BOD"" or the ""Board"") proposals, by issuing a letter to both ISS and its shareholders on March 15, 2024 and published the letter on its website. The following provides the company's clarification concerning ISS' recommendation. Firstly, KT&G has observed that ISS' analysis incorporates data and assertions provided by a dissident shareholder, Flashlight Capital Partners (""FCP""). The company is concerned with the proxy advisory firm's reliance on the data provided by FCP, particularly regarding the company's overseas business performance, which the company believes may not entirely align with its reported financial results. Secondly, KT&G believes that ISS' recommendation to vote against the appointment of CEO nominee Kyung-man Bang appears to contradict its own proxy voting guideline. These guidelines generally do not recommend against the election of a CEO. KT&G has operated its Senior Management Training Program for over four years, and selected the CEO nominee through an impartial and transparent process, which encompasses open recruitment of CEO candidates and incorporation of objective opinions from the advisory panel composed of external experts. KT&G is concerned that ISS' recommendation might not fully reflect the rigorousness of this selection process, potentially impacting shareholder value, including the risk of creating a leadership vacuum. Thirdly, KT&G finds ISS' recommendation against Sang-wook Kwak, the Board-endorsed Outside Candidate director candidate who will also serve as an Audit Committee member, lacking a clear reasoning. KT&G believes this recommendation may indicate a misunderstanding of the cumulative voting system and possibly suggest an unduly critical perspective towards the company. Fourthly, according to ISS' proxy voting guideline, if a dissident shareholder who owns more than five percent of the company's stock nominates a director, the candidate may not be considered independent. Therefore, KT&G believes that ISS' recommendation to vote for Dong-hwan Son as Outside Director contradicts its own proxy voting guideline, given that Mr. Son was nominated by Industrial Bank of Korea (""IBK""), which holds 7.1% stake in KT&G. Lastly, the company expresses its concern over the interactions between ISS and FCP, particularly regarding discussions about the company's export business profitability. After a meeting with ISS on March 11, 2024, where FCP-provided data was cited, KT&G sought clarification and requested the data for review. However, KT&G did not receive a response. Subsequently, KT&G reviewed data publicized by FCP during its webinar and considered that some discrepancies and inaccuracies are there. For instance, FCP has claimed that KT&G's export cigarette business and export Next Generation Product (""NGP"") business recorded deficits of KRW 68 billion and KRW 57 billion from 2020 to 2022, respectively. In fact, the company achieved a combined operating profit of KRW 550 billion in export cigarette business and export NGP business during the same period. KT&G notified ISS on March 14, 2024 that there were sufficient material errors and misinformation in the materials FCP provided to ISS, but ISS proceeded to publish its Proxy Research Report on the same day FCP's webinar ended. In conclusion, KT&G seeks to address these concerns constructively and is committed to engaging in transparent discussions with all stakeholders. The company hopes for a careful reconsideration of the recommendations and a dialogue that serves the best interests of all shareholders.

KT&G issued a letter in response to ISS' recommendation to vote against the company's Board of Directors' proposals. What concerns did KT&amp;G raise about ISS' analysis? KT&G raised concerns about ISS' reliance on data provided by dissident shareholder Flashlight Capital Partners, especially regarding overseas business performance. Why does KT&amp;G question ISS' recommendation against CEO nominee Kyung-man Bang? KT&G questions ISS' recommendation as it seems to contradict ISS' own proxy voting guideline. What process did KT&amp;G follow in selecting the CEO nominee? KT&G selected the CEO nominee through an impartial and transparent process, including open recruitment and input from external experts. Why does KT&amp;G find ISS' recommendation against Sang-wook Kwak lacking clear reasoning?

(BRSP) declares a dividend of $0.20 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, payable on April 15, 2024. Stockholders of record as of March 29, 2024, will receive the dividend.","BrightSpire Capital Announces $0.20 Per Share Dividend for First Quarter 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary BrightSpire Capital, Inc.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a $0.20 per share dividend by BrightSpire Capital is a tangible return to shareholders and can be an indicator of the company's current financial health. From a financial analysis standpoint, the ability to pay dividends generally suggests that the company has sufficient cash flow and profitability. It's essential to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. If the yield is higher than the industry average, it could make the stock more attractive to income-focused investors.Furthermore, the payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, should be assessed to ensure that the dividends are sustainable. A payout ratio that is too high might indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its growth. Conversely, a low payout ratio could suggest that the company is retaining earnings for expansion, debt reduction, or other strategic initiatives. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements can affect investor sentiment and stock valuation. The market often interprets regular and consistent dividends as a sign of a company's stability and maturity. Investors might view BrightSpire Capital's dividend as a positive signal, potentially leading to an increase in demand for the stock. However, it's also important to consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and market conditions, as these factors can influence the attractiveness of dividend stocks.Additionally, the timing and consistency of dividend payments can be critical. Companies that have a history of maintaining or increasing dividends are often favored by investors. In this case, historical data on BrightSpire Capital's dividend patterns could provide valuable insights into the company's long-term financial strategy and commitment to returning value to shareholders. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BrightSpire Capital, Inc.

(VEEE) announces a significant expansion of its authorized dealer network with Maz Boats as its exclusive dealer for the Middle East. This strategic partnership marks Twin Vee's entry into the UAE market, catering to the growing demand for high-quality marine vessels in the region. The move aligns with the company's international growth strategy and showcases its commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership between Twin Vee PowerCats Co. and Maz Boats represents a significant step in Twin Vee's international market penetration efforts. The Middle Eastern recreational boating sector, particularly in the UAE, has been experiencing robust growth, with projections to exceed $1.2 billion by 2025. This growth is driven by younger demographics entering the market, increased tourism and favorable regional conditions for boating activities.From a market expansion perspective, Twin Vee's move to establish an exclusive dealership with a well-recognized regional player like Maz Boats is a calculated endeavor to capture market share in a high-potential region. The partnership is likely to facilitate access to local market intelligence and customer preferences, which can be leveraged for tailored marketing strategies and product offerings. The diverse range of Maz Boats' products and services, including their recent foray into survey vessels, aligns with Twin Vee's product diversification strategy, potentially leading to symbiotic growth for both entities.However, the success of this expansion will hinge on Twin Vee's ability to navigate cultural nuances and regional competition. It will also depend on their capacity to maintain product quality and brand reputation in a market that may have different consumer expectations than their traditional base. The long-term impact on Twin Vee's revenue streams and market position will be contingent upon the execution of this international strategy and the sustained demand within the recreational boating industry in the Middle East. Financial Analyst Investors in Twin Vee PowerCats Co. should consider the potential financial implications of the company's expansion into the Middle Eastern market. The partnership with Maz Boats offers an opportunity to diversify revenue sources geographically and reduce reliance on domestic markets. Given the expected growth of the recreational boating sector in the UAE and surrounding regions, there is a tangible opportunity for Twin Vee to capitalize on new revenue streams and enhance shareholder value.It is important to monitor how the market responds to Twin Vee's product offerings, as successful market penetration can lead to increased sales volumes and potentially higher margins if the products are positioned as premium offerings. The partnership could also result in cost synergies through shared logistics, marketing and distribution channels. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with entering a new market, including potential regulatory hurdles, geopolitical risks and the need for significant upfront investment in marketing and sales infrastructure.While the immediate financial impact may be limited, as market establishment efforts typically take time to materialize into significant revenue contributions, the long-term prospects could be favorable if Twin Vee successfully adapts to the market and builds a strong brand presence. Continuous evaluation of the company's international sales performance and the contribution to overall financial health will be important for investors. International Business Strategist The decision by Twin Vee PowerCats Co. to enter the Middle Eastern market through a partnership with Maz Boats is a strategic move that aligns with global business trends of tapping into emerging markets. The partnership leverages Maz Boats' established regional presence and expertise, which can act as a catalyst for Twin Vee's market entry and customer acquisition strategies.In terms of international business strategy, Twin Vee must adapt its business model to accommodate the unique consumer behavior, economic environment and competitive landscape of the Middle East. The shift in demographics towards younger boaters and the high influx of tourists presents an opportunity for Twin Vee to introduce innovative marketing campaigns and experiential offerings tailored to these groups. Additionally, the partnership with Maz Boats could facilitate cross-cultural knowledge transfer, enabling Twin Vee to better understand and serve the needs of local customers.Challenges such as local competition, cultural differences and the need for localized product features must be addressed. Twin Vee's ability to maintain operational efficiency and manage supply chain complexities in the region will also be critical to their success. The strategic partnership should be viewed as a long-term investment, with the potential to strengthen Twin Vee's global brand and support sustainable international growth. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM FORT PIERCE, FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Twin Vee PowerCats Co. (NASDAQ:VEEE),(""Twin Vee"" or the ""Company""), a manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of power sport boats, today announced a significant expansion of its authorized dealer network with the addition of Maz Boats as its exclusive dealer for Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries like Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar. This new partnership marks the first time in its nearly thirty-year history that Twin Vee products will be sold in the Middle East and underscores the Company's dedication to growing its market share internationally and tapping into the demand for high-quality marine vessels in the region.Maz Boats, founded in 1993 by the Al Mazrooei family, manufactures a diverse range of patented boat designs, catering to various segments, including recreational, commercial, and military applications. Over the years, Maz Boats has expanded its product offerings to include a wide array of boat configurations, including full and half-cabin designs, ferry boat passenger vessels, monohull designs, and, more recently, survey vessels. Maz Boats' capabilities extend beyond boat design production, encompassing chartering, boat maintenance services, and sales, all to meet the evolving needs of its customers.Commenting on the partnership, Joseph Visconti, CEO and President of Twin Vee PowerCats Co., expressed his excitement, stating, ""Having attended the Dubai International Boat Show for the past two years, I've seen how popular recreational boating is in the region and how much potential there is for growth. We're thrilled to partner with Maz Boats as Twin Vee's exclusive dealer in Dubai. Teaming up presents a tremendous opportunity for both companies to leverage our respective strengths and expertise. Moreover, it allows Twin Vee to tap into Maz Boats' extensive market knowledge and provides an opportunity to showcase our diverse model lines to its customers.""The UAE is experiencing growth in the recreational boating sector, which is expected to surpass $1.2 billion by 2025. One article from regional news source Zawya stated that recreational boating is seeing a fresh wave of new buyers, who are, on average, 15 years younger than they were 20 years ago and less likely to come from boat-owning families. These new boaters utilize their recreational marine craft for family or social purposes, or they have boats used for fishing or a few hours of cruising offshore.

"Scilex Holding Companyâs Wholly Owned Subsidiary, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Entered into a Definitive Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement with Virpax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Relating to the Previously Announced Term Sheet with Virpax in Respect of Such Release and Settlement",2024-03-15T13:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Scilex Holding Company announces approval of settlement agreement with Virpax Pharmaceuticals by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, involving payments and royalty agreements.","Scilex Holding Companyâs Wholly Owned Subsidiary, Scilex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Entered into a Definitive Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement with Virpax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Relating to the Previously Announced Term Sheet with Virpax in Respect of Such Release and Settlement Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Scilex Holding Company announces approval of settlement agreement with Virpax Pharmaceuticals by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, involving payments and royalty agreements. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The approval of the Definitive Settlement Agreement by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court represents a pivotal legal resolution for Scilex Holding Company. The settlement, which stems from a lawsuit involving alleged actions by a former executive, has resulted in a structured compensation agreement that includes both lump-sum payments and ongoing royalty arrangements.From a legal standpoint, the mutual release of claims is a significant aspect of this settlement. It indicates a comprehensive resolution between the involved parties, which can mitigate future legal risks and expenses. However, it's important to note that the litigation against the individual, Mr. Mack, is still ongoing, which could entail additional legal costs and uncertainties for Scilex.The royalty payments tied to sales of drug candidates could provide a sustained revenue stream, but this is contingent upon successful commercialization and the maintenance of valid patent claims. The legal intricacies of such agreements are complex and require careful monitoring to ensure compliance and to maximize potential financial benefits. Financial Analyst Scilex's financial outlook may be positively influenced by the approval of the Definitive Settlement Agreement. The immediate inflow of $3.5 million, followed by an additional $2.5 million, will likely improve the company's short-term liquidity. This is a non-trivial sum for a company operating in the high-stakes biopharmaceutical sector, where cash flow is often unpredictable and dependent on the success of product development and commercialization.The long-term financial implications hinge on the performance of the drug candidates Epoladerm, Probudur and Envelta. The agreed-upon royalty payments of 6% of annual net sales could become a significant source of revenue. However, these payments are subject to the successful market penetration and sales performance of these drugs, which can be highly variable in the competitive pharmaceutical industry.Investors should take note of the timeline for potential royalty payments, as they are dependent on the life cycle of patents and regulatory exclusivity. This agreement could provide a competitive edge for Scilex, but forecasting these revenues is complex and fraught with uncertainty due to the nature of drug development and market adoption. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The settlement's impact on Scilex's market position must be evaluated in the context of the pharmaceutical industry's dynamics. The focus on non-opioid pain management products is particularly relevant given the current public health push to find alternatives to opioids. This niche market is growing and presents opportunities for companies like Scilex that have a portfolio of products in this area.The drugs mentioned in the settlement, Epoladerm, Probudur and Envelta, if successfully brought to market, could meet a significant clinical need. The royalty agreement suggests that Scilex is optimistic about these drugs' market potential. However, the actual impact on the market will depend on several factors, including clinical trial outcomes, FDA approvals and the competitive landscape.Given that the pharmaceutical market is highly regulated and competitive, the success of these products will also depend on effective marketing strategies and the ability to navigate regulatory hurdles. Scilex's ability to leverage the settlement funds and royalties into effective product development and commercialization strategies will be important for its long-term success in the market. 03/15/2024 - 09:00 AM PALO ALTO, Calif., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scilex Holding Company (Nasdaq: SCLX, âScilexâ or âCompanyâ), an innovative revenue generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, today announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the âCourtâ), in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.

Such royalty payments will end upon the later of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire valid patent claim of Virpax or its licensor covering the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country; and (ii) expiration of any period of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country. Pursuant to the Definitive Settlement Agreement, each of the Plaintiffs and Virpax provide mutual releases of all claims that exist as of March 14, 2024 (the date on which the Definitive Settlement Agreement was approved by the Court), whether known or unknown, arising from any allegations set forth in the Action.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / AbbottIf you or a loved one have diabetes, here are the four things you should know to protect your heart health.AbbottWhat's in: Prioritizing your healthWhat's out: Forgetting about preventive health.When it comes to the ins and outs of knowing the connections between diabetes and heart disease, it can be confusing. People with diabetes have a higher risk of heart disease because of their chronic disease1 - but there are things you can do to protect the heart.Here is our ""In and Out"" list that can help guide what you do to lower your risk for heart disease if you or a loved one have diabetes.What's in: Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to watch your glucose levels.Glucose levels and heart disease risk go hand in hand.Continuous glucose monitors like our FreeStyle Libre CGM systems can help you watch patterns in your levels over time and take action to stabilize them in the moment. If you're living with diabetes, understanding glucose level trendlines is important for your health journey - especially when data suggests you're twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart disease compared with people who don't have diabetes.1If a person's glucose levels are constantly high, the heart's blood vessels and nerves can be damaged.1In comes a CGM. You can see your glucose levels, including where it has been and where it could go, throughout the day with this type of biowearable. As you move and eat, a CGM helps you watch out for when there is a sharp increase called a glucose spike - and how often that spike happens. If there's a noticeable pattern, CGM users can share* their CGM data with their healthcare provider (which our FreeStyle Libre systems do through LibreView in select countries**) to determine if there are any lifestyle changes that can help and if any tests are recommended.Take Beth Marcello, for example. Beth is a retired teacher and mother who was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and lives with heart failure. She started using the FreeStyle Libre and Abbott's CardioMEMS HF System and has had a much easier time managing her health.""For me, my health is a numbers game. Looking at the numbers on my FreeStyle Libre app - which I check often - allows me to make better decisions about what and when I eat,"" she said. ""That in turn, impacts my heart health and my CardioMEMS numbers.""""What's great is that not only can I make smarter decisions about what I do every day, but my doctors share this information, making the care I get very personal and connected.""What's out: Not planning out how you eat.""You can eat that?""Diabetes stigma remains prevalent as people continue to misunderstand that diabetes doesn't dictate a specific diet. Aim for healthy, balanced meals - the same advice applies to everyone.And on top of having healthy, balanced meals, be purposeful about how you navigate your plate. According to a 2022 study, people with Type 2 diabetes who ate vegetables before eating carbohydrates saw an improvement in their average glucose levels when followed up with at the five-year mark.2""Lifestyle changes for people with diabetes, like trying out food sequencing, don't have to be overcomplicated,"" said Dr. Mahmood Kazemi, divisional vice president, Diabetes Care, Abbott. ""Continuous glucose monitoring helps draw the connections between what's on a plate and how glucose levels are affected - and that benefits the diabetes management journey because informed decisions can happen. The goal is to help people with diabetes demystify the patterns in their glucose trendline over time since every body is different.""It's no secret that balancing a plate with leafy greens, whole grains and protein-rich foods can help protect against heart disease. But by considering how you eat in addition to what, you can better stabilize your glucose levels, which in turn decreases your risk of heart disease.3What's in: Getting active - starting with a walk.There's no question that being active is good for you.However, 39% of adults with diabetes reported being physically active, compared to 58% of adults without diabetes, according to a U.S. survey.4 If getting moving feels daunting, consider starting small and try going for a walk. According to a study that compared walking for 30 minutes at any time of the day to walking 10 minutes after three main meals a day, the latter option may be more ideal to help reduce blood glucose levels.5Steadily increasing your walking time better protects against heart disease. Research that followed people living with Type 2 diabetes over eight years found that people who walked at least two hours a week had a 34% lower heart disease mortality rate compared with people that were sedentary.6Take the first step by purposefully incorporating a walk after every meal. Eventually, you'll be able to consider moving up to other physical activities that can also help with diabetes and heart disease, such as resistance training.7What's out: Not setting up time to speak with your healthcare provider.It's important to make time to connect with your healthcare provider each year - especially to check in about your ABCs:1Get an A1C test, which is a simple blood test that measures your average blood glucose levels over the past three months. Your doctor can help define what your target range should be.Have your blood pressure checked.Check your cholesterol levels to ensure they're not too high.Talk about any smoking habits that can impact your risk level.If you have any questions about how to change your routine based on what your CGM is revealing about your glucose levels, an appointment is a great opportunity to walk through the data, talk about your current habits and plan for any changes that could help decrease your risk for heart disease.What's in: Protecting your heart.What's out: Avoiding change - this is the year you make lifestyle changes to take control of your health.These materials are not intended to replace your doctor's advice or information. For any questions or concerns you may have regarding the medical procedures, devices and/or your personal health, please discuss these with your physician.The testimonial relays an account of an individual's response to the treatment.

(MGRM) reports financial results for Q4 2023, plans 510(k) FDA submission in 2024, introduces mVision technology, and delivers first mBÃ´s surgical robot to global distributor. Positive Monogram Orthopaedics Inc. reported financial and operational results for Q4 2023. The company plans to accelerate 510(k) FDA submission with design modifications to reduce clinical trial risk. mBÃ´s surgical robot was delivered to a global distributor, marking a revenue milestone. Introduced mVision technology for registration and tracking, potentially integrated into the mBÃ´s system. The company aims for FDA submission in the second half of 2024 without clinical data. Management is confident in the modified system's equivalence arguments and safety profile. Monogram is fully funded for the anticipated 510(k) submission. 2023 was focused on product launch and pipeline development, including mVision technology. Future milestones include FDA clearance for mBÃ´s, OUS clinical trial approvals, and mVision development. The company aims to advance orthopedic robotics with innovative solutions. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Monogram Orthopaedics Inc. presents several key points that are likely to influence the company's market positioning and investor sentiment. The shipment of the mBÃ´s surgical robot system to an international customer marks a significant milestone in Monogram's commercialization efforts. This event is a tangible demonstration of the company's ability to execute on its international expansion strategy. The entry into global markets can lead to diversified revenue streams and reduce dependency on domestic sales, which is a positive signal for investors looking for growth opportunities.Furthermore, the introduction of mVision Technologies represents a strategic move to enhance the company's product offerings. This innovation could potentially disrupt the orthopedic robotics space by improving surgical outcomes and reducing operation times, which may lead to cost savings for healthcare providers. If successful, this technology could increase Monogram's competitive edge and market share, attracting interest from investors and potential strategic partners looking for novel and efficient solutions in the medical technology sector. Medical Device Regulatory Expert The 510(k) submission process is a critical regulatory pathway for medical device companies seeking to market their products in the United States. Monogram's strategy to avoid a clinical trial by making preemptive design modifications is a calculated risk that could significantly expedite the FDA clearance process. The company's proactive engagement with the FDA and the agency's understanding of the technical areas of concern are encouraging signs of a potentially smooth regulatory journey.However, the reliance on a 510(k) submission without clinical data is contingent upon the FDA's acceptance of the company's equivalence arguments. Should the FDA require additional data, Monogram's plan to leverage overseas clinical trial results demonstrates foresight and adaptability. This dual-pathway approach to FDA clearance and international approval could mitigate the risk of regulatory delays and provide a backup plan, which is reassuring for stakeholders concerned about the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process. Financial Analyst Monogram's financial position, as indicated by their statement of being fully funded through the anticipated 510(k) submission, offers a measure of security to investors. The ability to reach this critical regulatory milestone without the need for additional capital raises suggests prudent financial management and a lower risk of dilution for existing shareholders in the short term.The company's mention of an aggressive strategy for OUS clinical trials and the potential for post-launch marketing or international approval also hints at a broader revenue strategy. The ability to scale operations in international markets without significant increases in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses is an attractive proposition for cost-conscious investors. This approach could lead to improved profit margins and a stronger bottom line, which are key factors in assessing a company's long-term financial health and growth potential. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM 510(k) Submission with FDA On Track for Second Half of 2024Shipped mBÃ´s Surgical Robot System to First International CustomerIntroduced mVision Technologies, a Novel Approach to Registration and TrackingManagement to Host Business Update Conference Call on Thursday, March 21 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern TimeAUSTIN, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Monogram Orthopaedics Inc. (NASDAQ:MGRM) (""Monogram"" or the ""Company""), a medical technology company focused on reconstructive joint procedures and surgical robotics, has reported its financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth Quarter 2023 and Subsequent Operational HighlightsThe Company's plan to aggressively accelerate 510(k) submission with design modifications that management believes reduce the risk of a clinical trial is on track. The Company anticipates Verification and Validation completion on the upgraded design as early as the first half of 2024. The Company is fully funded to anticipated 510(k) submission in the second half of 2024.Delivered mBÃ´s surgical robot to one of the world's largest global robotics distributors in a first sale, representing a key revenue milestone and paving the way for broader commercialization.The Company is moving forward with an OUS clinical trial that will support US and OUS post-launch marketing or US 510(k) submission, depending on FDA feedback.Introduced mVision technology, a novel approach to registration and tracking that the company is now working on as a standalone product or for integration into the mBÃ´s surgical robotic system in the future.Presented a product discussion featuring Monogram's mBÃ´s and mVision technologies with a surgeon panel during AAOS Annual MeetingPresented at the Canaccord Genuity 2024 Musculoskeletal ConferenceManagement Commentary""2023 was transformative for Monogram as our first year as a public company, with a focus on advancing our product launch for mBÃ´s and the continued development of our next-gen product pipeline,"" said Ben Sexson, Chief Executive Officer of Monogram. ""The fourth quarter was highlighted by the delivery of our first mBÃ´s surgical robot to one of the world's largest global robotics distributors and the introduction of mVision technology.""Throughout 2023, we were highly focused on executing our commercialization roadmap. We have employed a dynamic regulatory strategy as new facts and opportunities emerge, which supports our intention to obtain FDA clearance as expeditiously and economically as possible. We are currently in the Verification phase, with the team actively executing extensive, highly rigorous internal and external testing. We think it could be possible to complete all Verification and Validation testing as early as the first half of 2024 with a 510(k) submission without clinical data in the second half of 2024.""We have had several formal communications with the FDA, and we believe they understand the technical areas of concern that could necessitate a clinical study. The team has preemptively made design changes related primarily to foot pedal control of the system that we believe could address the FDA's cited technical equivalence concerns and potentially obviate the need for a clinical trial. We believe the modified system has very strong equivalence arguments and a potentially favorable safety profile compared to other cleared products on the market, and the design modifications could even favorably improve the system's performance.""This approach could potentially be quite favorable to our commercialization timeline, and based on our progress with the FDA, we believe we have sufficient funding through the 510(k) submission. We remain on target to largely complete verification and validation testing in H1 2024, a requirement for FDA submission and clearance. At the same time, we are aggressively preparing to launch OUS clinical trials with our international partners. We plan to leverage OUS clinical data to supplement our US submission should the agency require a clinical trial despite our improved equivalence profile, or for post-launch marketing in the US and international approval should the FDA clear mBÃ´s without clinical data. We like the optionality that comes with this strategy.""We recently announced mVision, our next-generation navigation solution designed to eliminate cart-based tracking and streamline registration and tracking to eliminate point sampling and tracking with large arrays. Our engineers plan to configure the mBÃ´s robot to be upgradable to mVision navigation. With mVision, the goal is to minimize the risks associated with pin site fracture and infection and significantly reduce the surgical time associated with placing the arrays and registration. In addition, the goal is to minimize the surgical footprint in the OR. We are confident that mVision will advance the standard of care in orthopedic robotics.""During the quarter, we delivered our first mBÃ´s robot. We believe the international market for orthopedic robotics is attractive, large, and growing. The ability to scale OUS in a capital-efficient manner without the implant or significant increases to SG&A costs is also attractive. In the US, we want to own the total economics of the sale that would accrete from selling the implant, mBÃ´s robot, and related consumables.""Monogram's technology and its intrinsic value continue to gain recognition with surgeons in the joint reconstruction market, in which higher barriers to entry for new participants have historically reduced innovation in our view. We see an opportunity to unlock new growth within this extremely attractive market by providing a solution to the vulnerabilities in the existing economic model for robotics - namely, increased surgical time and increased consumables cost. We are confident that this fundamental value proposition will continue to garner recognition from the market and industry participants, including from potential strategic partners, as we continue to execute to generate long-term value for our shareholders.""Looking ahead into 2024, our next milestones on the commercialization path include completing our verification and validation testing, submitting mBÃ´s to the FDA for clearance, and obtaining approvals to run our OUS clinical trial. We will also further develop our mVision navigation technology, which could become a standalone product and/or be integrated into mBÃ´s. Taken together, we are incredibly enthusiastic about the future for Monogram, the pace of our product timeline, and our team's ability to scale the commercialization path of our advanced, next-generation active surgical robotics,"" concluded Sexson.Upcoming 2024 MilestonesLargely complete mBÃ´s system verification and validation - H1 2024Submit semi-active modality 510(k) application to FDA - H2 2024Commence OUS live-patient surgery trials - H2 2024Anticipated FDA response & expand international relationships - H2 2024Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $10.6 million, compared to $5.4 million the prior year.

Delcath Systems Announces $7 Million Private Placement,2024-03-15T12:20:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH) announces a private placement transaction with accredited investors, issuing common stock and pre-funded warrants, expecting gross proceeds of $7 million. The company plans to utilize the funds for working capital and general corporate purposes.","Delcath Systems Announces $7 Million Private Placement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Delcath Systems, Inc. (DCTH) announces a private placement transaction with accredited investors, issuing common stock and pre-funded warrants, expecting gross proceeds of $7 million. The company plans to utilize the funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement transaction by Delcath Systems represents a strategic move to bolster its working capital and address general corporate needs. The influx of approximately $7 million, though relatively modest for the biotech sector, indicates investor confidence, particularly as the transaction includes participation from executives and board members. However, the reliance on internal stakeholders raises questions about external investor interest. The pricing of the common stock and pre-funded warrants suggests a discount to the market, which is a common strategy to incentivize investment but can dilute existing shareholders' value.Furthermore, the structure involving pre-funded warrants, exercisable at a nominal price, is typically employed to provide immediate funds while offering potential upside to investors. The impact on the stock market could be mixed; the capital raise may be viewed positively as it supports the company's growth, but the potential dilution and the need for a capital infusion could signal underlying financial challenges. Investors should monitor the subsequent registration of these securities with the SEC, as it will facilitate liquidity and potentially impact the stock's trading dynamics. Market Research Analyst Delcath's focus on interventional oncology positions it within a niche but growing segment of the healthcare market. The use of net proceeds for working capital suggests an immediate need to fund ongoing operations or research and development activities. For stakeholders, the timing and size of this private placement could reflect the company's strategic planning cycle and its current stage of product development.An analysis of the broader market shows that private placements are common among biotech firms seeking to fund research without incurring debt. However, the market's reaction to such news can hinge on the company's pipeline's perceived potential and the terms of the deal. In Delcath's case, the terms indicate a potential increase in financial flexibility, which could be essential for advancing clinical trials or expanding market reach. Long-term benefits may include accelerated product development, but the immediate dilutive effect on current shareholders cannot be ignored. Legal Expert The legal framework governing the private placement is important for ensuring compliance with the Securities Act of 1933. Delcath's commitment to file registration statements for the resale of the common stock and shares issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants aligns with regulatory requirements and signals transparency to the market. The exclusion from registration under the Securities Act, leveraging an exemption, is a tactical approach to expedite funding while deferring the broader disclosure and regulatory review process associated with public offerings.Investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with unregistered securities, including limited liquidity and the absence of public market pricing information. The company's pledge to register these securities for resale is a positive step, but until the SEC registration is complete, the securities cannot be freely traded, which may limit their appeal to some investors. This legal nuance is a double-edged sword, providing short-term capital at the cost of immediate liquidity. 03/15/2024 - 08:20 AM NEW YORK, March 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Delcath Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: DCTH), an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic cancers of the liver, today announced that it has entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors comprised of existing investors, Delcath Executives and members of its Board of Directors, for a private placement transaction (the ""Private Placement""). Delcath will issue and sell 876,627 shares of its common stock (the ""Common Stock"") at a price per share of $3.72, and, to certain investors, in lieu of shares of Common Stock, 1,008,102 pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 1,008,102 shares of Common Stock (the ""Pre-Funded Warrants"") at a price per Pre-Funded Warrant of $3.71. The Pre-Funded Warrants will have an exercise price of $0.01 per share of Common Stock, be immediately exercisable and remain exercisable until exercised in full. Delcath expects to receive gross proceeds from the Private Placement of approximately $7 million before deducting offering expenses payable by Delcath. Delcath intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for working capital purposes and other general corporate purposes. The Private Placement is expected to close on March 19, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The securities to be sold in the Private Placement, including the shares of common stock underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or state securities laws as of the time of issuance and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. Delcath has agreed to file one or more registration statements with the SEC registering the resale of the Common Stock and the shares issuable upon exercise of the Pre-Funded Warrants purchased in the Private Placement. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy these securities nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. About Delcath Systems, Inc. Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT (Hepzato (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSATÂ® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to surgically isolate the liver while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT. In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

(VERB) announces a seamless native checkout process integration with META for Facebook and Instagram users, expanding MARKET.live's audience. This move allows users to shop within the apps without leaving, enhancing the shopping experience and broadening the reach of MARKET.live. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The integration of MARKET.live with META's platforms such as Facebook and Instagram represents a strategic move in the e-commerce and social media landscape. This collaboration facilitates a streamlined shopping experience by enabling users to conduct transactions directly within the social media applications they frequently use. The implementation of a native checkout process is expected to reduce friction for consumers, potentially increasing conversion rates and sales volumes for vendors on MARKET.live.From a market research perspective, this development taps into the growing trend of social commerce, where social media platforms are increasingly becoming venues for direct sales. By leveraging the vast user bases of Facebook and Instagram, MARKET.live is poised to significantly widen its reach. This could lead to a diversification of revenue streams for VERB Technology Company and enhance its competitive position in the social shopping segment. However, it is essential to monitor how this integration will affect user engagement and spending patterns over time to assess its long-term viability. Financial Analyst The announcement by VERB Technology Company about its integration with META platforms can have material financial implications. For investors, the key focus will be on how this integration translates into revenue growth and margin improvements. The addressable market expansion could lead to a surge in user engagement and, consequently, higher ad revenues and commission from sales. This can be a positive indicator for VERB's stock performance in the near term.However, investors should also consider the costs associated with such technological advancements and partnerships. The initial investment and ongoing operational costs could offset some of the revenue gains, at least in the short run. Additionally, the company's ability to scale its infrastructure to handle increased traffic without compromising on user experience will be critical. It's important to analyze future financial statements to evaluate the real impact of this integration on the company's bottom line. E-commerce Specialist The e-commerce industry is continually evolving and the seamless native checkout process introduced by MARKET.live is a testament to that. This feature addresses a common pain point in online shopping: the disruption of having to navigate away from a social media app to complete a purchase. By eliminating this step, MARKET.live not only enhances user convenience but also capitalizes on the impulse buying behavior that is often triggered by social media browsing.While this move is promising, it's important to consider the potential challenges. Integration with major platforms like Facebook and Instagram requires adherence to their data privacy and security standards. Any lapses could lead to user distrust and potential legal ramifications. Furthermore, the dependency on external platforms might pose risks if there are changes in policies or revenue-sharing agreements. Long-term success will depend on maintaining a good relationship with META and continuously innovating to keep the shopping experience fresh and engaging for users. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM New Seamless Native Checkout Process For META Represents Massive Expansion of MARKET.liveâs Addressable AudienceLOS ALAMITOS, Calif. and LAS VEGAS, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verb Technology Company, Inc.

The increase in mining capacity to 673 PH is substantial, as it suggests a significant boost in the company's ability to mine Bitcoin or other SHA-256 algorithm-based cryptocurrencies.It is important to note that the efficiency of the S21 machines, with a hash rate of 200 TH/s and power consumption of 3,500 W, positions the company competitively in the market, potentially lowering operational costs and increasing profitability margins. Furthermore, the reference to the upcoming 'halving event' is important as it historically affects the supply of new bitcoins and can lead to increased Bitcoin prices, potentially enhancing the profitability of mining operations if the market reacts as it has in the past. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the early acquisition and deployment of the mining machines may have implications for LM Funding's cash flow and capital expenditures. The capital investment in mining technology often requires significant upfront costs, but the expected increase in mining output could lead to a favorable return on investment over time.Investors should monitor the company's operational efficiency and cost management closely, as these factors will be critical in determining the actual impact on the bottom line. Additionally, the cryptocurrency market's volatility should be factored into any projections, as fluctuations in Bitcoin prices can dramatically affect mining profitability. The company's move to strengthen its position before the halving event could be a strategic play to capitalize on potential market changes. Cryptocurrency Expert Understanding the technical aspects of the S21 Antminer machines is key to assessing the potential impact of this news on LM Funding's business. The SHA-256 algorithm is the basis for Bitcoin mining and the high hash rate of these machines means they can process a large number of calculations per second, which is essential for mining success. The 'halving event' mentioned refers to the Bitcoin reward halving, which occurs approximately every four years and reduces the reward for mining new blocks by half. This event tends to decrease the rate at which new bitcoins are generated, leading to potential scarcity and price increases.However, the increased competition and the need for more efficient mining operations may also lead to a 'survival of the fittest' scenario in the mining industry. Companies with the latest technology, like the S21s and access to cheap power sources will likely be better positioned to weather the reduced block rewards post-halving. 03/15/2024 - 08:30 AM Expects machines to be located and mining by early April, increasing mining capacity to 673 PHTAMPA, FL, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LM Funding America, Inc.

(CISS) announces a public offering with expected gross proceeds of $6.0 million, consisting of Common Units and Pre-funded Units. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital, or general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to close on March 19, 2024, with Aegis Capital Corp. as the sole book-running manager. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The public offering by C3is Inc. is a significant financial event that warrants a close examination of its implications for both the company and its investors. The capital raise of $6.0 million, although not a large sum for a ship-owning company, indicates a strategic move to bolster the company's balance sheet. The use of proceeds for capital expenditures and potential acquisitions suggests a growth-oriented strategy. However, the pricing of Common Units at $0.05 and Pre-Funded Units at $0.04, with warrants exercisable at a premium, reflects a cost of capital that is relatively expensive, which could dilute existing shareholders.Moreover, the structure of the offering, including the Pre-Funded Warrants and the over-allotment option granted to Aegis Capital Corp., provides flexibility and indicates a proactive approach to managing potential over-subscriptions. However, the impact on the stock's liquidity and volatility post-offering should be monitored, as the introduction of new securities can lead to increased trading activity. The timing of the closing and the effectiveness of the registration statement are also critical factors that will determine the immediate financial impact on the company. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the entry of C3is Inc. into potential new seaborne transportation sectors could signal a diversification strategy that may be well-received by the market, contingent on the successful identification and acquisition of new vessels. This strategy could potentially open up new revenue streams and reduce the company's exposure to the volatility inherent in the dry bulk and crude oil tanker markets.However, the broader market implications of such an offering hinge on the investor perception of the company's growth prospects and the shipping industry's cyclical nature. The terms of the Warrants, particularly the exercise prices and the cashless exercise option, may be seen as an incentive for investors to speculate on the company's future stock price performance, which could introduce a speculative element into the stock's trading behavior.Lastly, the decision to engage Aegis Capital Corp. as the sole book-running manager and the involvement of Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel LLP as counsel indicates a reliance on experienced players in the capital markets, which could enhance investor confidence in the procedural aspects of the offering. 03/15/2024 - 08:22 AM ATHENS, Greece, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- C3is Inc. (Nasdaq: CISS) (the âCompanyâ), a ship-owning company providing dry bulk and crude oil tanker seaborne transportation services, today announced the pricing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering with gross proceeds to the Company expected to be approximately $6.0 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses payable by the Company. The offering consists of 120,000,000 Common Units or Pre-funded Units, each consisting of one share of common stock (âCommon Shareâ) or Pre-Funded Warrant, one half of a Class C-1 Warrant to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.075 per share (or 150% of the price of each Common Unit sold in the offering) or pursuant to an alternative cashless exercise option, which warrant will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the ""Class C-1 Warrants"") and one Class C-2 Warrant to purchase one Common Share at an exercise price of $0.085 per share (or 170% of the price of each Common Unit sold in the offering) which warrant will expire on the five-year anniversary of the original issuance date (the ""Class C-2 Warrants"" and together with the Class C-1 Warrants, the ""Warrants""). The purchase price of each Common Unit is $0.05 and the purchase price of each Pre-Funded Unit is $0.04 (which is equal to the public offering price per Common Unit minus $0.01). The Pre-Funded Warrants will be immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all of the Pre-Funded Warrants are exercised in full. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for capital expenditures, including for payment towards the $38.7 million remaining purchase price for the Aframax tanker we acquired in July 2023, or acquisitions of additional vessels which we have not yet identified, which may include vessels in seaborne transportation sectors other than the drybulk and tanker sectors in which we currently operate, working capital, or for other general corporate purposes, or a combination thereof. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on March 19, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, the Company has granted Aegis Capital Corp. a 45-day option to purchase up to 15% of the number of Common Shares and/or Pre-Funded Warrants sold in the offering, and/or additional Warrants representing up to 15% of the Warrants sold in the offering solely to cover over-allotments, if any.

Ladder Capital Corp Announces First Quarter 2024 Dividend to Holders of Class A Common Stock,2024-03-15T12:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Ladder Capital Corp (LADR) declares a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.23 per share of Class A common stock, payable on April 15, 2024.","Ladder Capital Corp Announces First Quarter 2024 Dividend to Holders of Class A Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Ladder Capital Corp (LADR) declares a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.23 per share of Class A common stock, payable on April 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Ladder Capital Corp's dividend is a concrete action that directly affects shareholder value. The dividend of $0.23 per share represents a return on investment for shareholders and can be indicative of the company's current liquidity and profitability status. As dividends are typically sourced from profits, a consistent or increasing dividend payout could suggest that Ladder is maintaining or improving its financial health.Moreover, dividends are often a sign of a company's confidence in its future cash flows. Thus, investors might interpret this declaration as a positive signal regarding Ladder's future earnings prospects. However, it's essential to compare this dividend against the company's earnings to assess the payout ratio, which can provide insights into the sustainability of the dividend in the long term. A payout ratio that is too high may not be sustainable, while a lower ratio could imply room for future dividend growth or that the company is reinvesting in growth opportunities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, dividend announcements can influence investor sentiment and stock performance. Ladder Capital Corp's announcement might lead to increased interest in the stock, particularly among income-focused investors such as retirees or those seeking steady cash flows from their investments. The ex-dividend date is also a key consideration, as it determines eligibility for the dividend payment and can often lead to a short-term increase in trading volume as investors position themselves to benefit.Additionally, the dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock price, is a critical metric for comparison with industry averages and competitors. If Ladder's yield is higher than average, it could attract more investors, but it could also indicate that the stock price has room for growth. Conversely, a lower yield could either suggest a potentially undervalued stock or raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain its dividend in the face of potential challenges. 03/15/2024 - 08:15 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ladder Capital Corp (âLadderâ or the âCompanyâ) (NYSE: LADR) today announced the declaration by its board of directors of a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.23 per share of Class A common stock.

EBITDA from ongoing operations for Aluminum Extrusions and PE Films fluctuated in Q4 2023. The company is facing challenges in sales volume and margin due to global excess capacity and intense competition. Positive Tredegar reported a significant net loss in 2023 compared to a profit in 2022. EBITDA from ongoing operations for Aluminum Extrusions and PE Films showed fluctuations in Q4 2023. Challenges in sales volume and margin are attributed to global excess capacity and intense competition. Negative Net income (loss) was $(105.9) million in 2023 compared to $28.5 million in 2022. EBITDA from ongoing operations for Aluminum Extrusions decreased by 43.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. Sales volume for various segments declined in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year. Market Research Analyst The reported financial results from Tredegar Corporation exhibit a significant downturn in net income and EBITDA, with a notable decline in sales volume across its operations. The impact on the stock market will likely be negative, as investors often react unfavorably to financial losses and reduced profitability. The company's specific mention of intense competition and global excess capacity in Brazil, as well as the ongoing strategic initiatives, including the sale of Terphane, indicate a strategic shift that could potentially stabilize the business in the long run.The aluminum extrusions industry is facing challenges from increased imports and a competitive global market, as evidenced by the sales volume decline in both the Aluminum Extrusions and Flexible Packaging Films segments. The preliminary favorable determinations in a trade case could offer some relief to the domestic industry, potentially leading to reduced competition from imports. However, investors should remain cautious as the final ITC vote will not occur until late 2024 and the outcome is uncertain. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the sharp decline in net income, both quarterly and annually, raises concerns about Tredegar's operational efficiency and market position. The company's efforts to address its financial leverage through an amendment of its credit agreement and conversion to an asset-based lending facility demonstrate a proactive approach to managing liquidity during a cyclical downturn. Additionally, the settlement of the pension plan in early November could indicate an attempt to reduce long-term liabilities and improve the balance sheet.Investors should note the potential benefits of the ongoing strategic initiatives, such as the divestiture of Terphane, which could lead to a more focused business strategy and potential debt reduction. However, the full impact of these initiatives will only be realized over time and the short-term financial health of the company remains under pressure. Legal Expert The legal developments surrounding the trade case backed by the Aluminum Extruders Council, in which Tredegar is a coalition member, could have significant implications for the industry. The preliminary countervailing duties announced by the Department of Commerce suggest a recognition of unfair subsidies by foreign governments. This could eventually lead to protective measures for domestic producers, potentially improving Tredegar's competitive position in the future.However, the ongoing legal process requires careful monitoring, as the final determinations will not be made until late 2024. Stakeholders should be aware of the potential for significant changes in the competitive landscape, pending the outcome of the anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations. This could affect both the short-term operations and the long-term strategy of the company. 03/15/2024 - 08:15 AM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tredegar Corporation (NYSE:TG, also the âCompanyâ or âTredegarâ) today reported fourth quarter and full year financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. Fourth quarter 2023 net income (loss) was $(35.6) million ($(1.04) per diluted share) compared to $(3.9) million ($(0.11) per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Net income (loss) from ongoing operations, which excludes special items, was $(0.1) million ($(0.01) per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.5 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full year 2023 net income (loss) was $(105.9) million ($(3.10) per diluted share) compared to $28.5 million ($0.84 per diluted share) in 2022. Net income (loss) from ongoing operations was $(4.7) million ($(0.15) per diluted share) in 2023 compared to $39.5 million ($1.17 per diluted share) in 2022. A reconciliation of net income (loss), a financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (âGAAPâ), to net income (loss) from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, is provided in Note (a) to the Financial Tables in this press release. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Highlights Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (âEBITDAâ) from ongoing operations for Aluminum Extrusions was $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year and versus $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sales volume was 32.9 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 37.2 million pounds in the fourth quarter of last year and versus 32.5 million pounds in the third quarter of 2023. Open orders at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were approximately 14 million pounds (versus 17 million pounds at the end of the third quarter of 2023), which is below the quarterly range of 21 to 27 million pounds in 2019 before pandemic-related disruptions that resulted in excessive open orders, which peaked in the first quarter of 2022 at approximately 100 million pounds. EBITDA from ongoing operations for PE Films was $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus negative $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $4.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sales volume was 8.5 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 5.6 million pounds in the fourth quarter of last year and 7.2 million pounds in the third quarter of 2023. EBITDA from ongoing operations for Flexible Packaging Films (also referred to as âTerphaneâ) was $2.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2023 versus $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sales volume was 22.8 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 24.5 million pounds in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 22.2 million pounds in the third quarter of 2023. The Company believes that unfavorable variances throughout the fourth quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022 were primarily due to lower sales volume and lower margin, driven by global excess capacity and intense competition in Brazil from imports from multiple origins. See Status of Current Corporate Strategic Initiatives section of this report for information on the sale of Terphane. John Steitz, Tredegarâs president and chief executive officer, said, âResults for the fourth quarter were better than expected and improved compared with the third quarter of 2023. There are signs that the downturn at Bonnell, which we believe is a residual impact of the pandemic and started in the second half of 2022, has hit bottom and that a recovery is underway. In addition, U.S. authorities have made favorable preliminary determinations regarding a trade case backed by a coalition of members of the Aluminum Extruders Council. At PE Films, EBITDA was $8.6 million during the second half of 2023 compared with $2.7 million during the first half. We expect that this positive recent performance will continue in 2024.â Mr. Steitz further stated, âWe continue to make progress on our corporate strategic initiatives. The process to complete the sale of Terphane is advancing as planned, including the review required by competition authorities in Brazil. In early November, we settled our pension plan. In late December, we executed an amendment of our credit agreement and conversion to an asset-based lending facility to support us during what has been an unprecedented cyclical downturn. Furthermore, favorable operating results have improved our outlook for our financial leverage.â Mr. Steitz continued, âIâd like to express my sincere appreciation to all of the employees at Tredegar and its operating divisions for coming together as a team to meet head-on our significant business challenges in 2023.â OPERATIONS REVIEW Aluminum Extrusions Aluminum Extrusions (or Bonnell Aluminum) produces high-quality, soft-alloy and medium-strength custom fabricated and finished aluminum extrusions primarily for the following markets: building and construction (âB&Câ), automotive, and specialty (which consists of consumer durables, machinery and equipment, electrical and renewable energy, and distribution end-use products). A summary of results for Aluminum Extrusions is provided below: Three Months Ended Favorable/ Year Ended Favorable/ (In thousands, except percentages) December 31, (Unfavorable) December 31, (Unfavorable) 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % Change Sales volume (lbs) 32,940 37,243 (11.6)% 138,451 174,670 (20.7)% Net sales $ 110,196 $ 127,805 (13.8)% $ 474,803 $ 637,872 (25.6)% Ongoing operations: EBITDA $ 8,008 $ 8,915 (10.2)% $ 37,976 $ 66,800 (43.1)% Depreciation & amortization (4,675 ) (4,568 ) (2.3)% (17,927 ) (17,414 ) (2.9)% EBIT* $ 3,333 $ 4,347 (23.3)% $ 20,049 $ 49,386 (59.4)% Capital expenditures $ 2,477 $ 8,576 $ 20,339 $ 23,664 * For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the EBITDA from ongoing operations by segment statements in the Financial Tables in this press release. The following table presents the sales volume by end use market for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 11.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2022 but increased 1.5% versus third quarter of 2023. Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, the Company observed order cancellations and slowing order input as customers continued to report high inventory levels, which carried into 2023. The Company believes that its percentage changes in sales volume by end-use markets for 2023 versus 2022, particularly for residential B&C and the distribution sector within specialty products, were unfavorable versus the industry as a whole mainly due to surging imports. Net new orders, which remain sluggish compared to historical levels, increased 55% in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022, marking the sixth consecutive quarterly increase in incoming orders. Open orders at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 were 14 million pounds (versus 17 million pounds at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and 41 million pounds at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022). This level is below the quarterly range of 21 to 27 million pounds in 2019 before pandemic-related disruptions that resulted in long lead times, driving a peak in open orders of approximately 100 million pounds during the first quarter of 2022. We believe that current open orders are below pre-pandemic levels due to higher interest rates, tighter lender requirements and the increase in remote working, which particularly impacts the non-residential B&C end-use market. In addition, data indicates that aluminum extrusion imports increased significantly in recent years, especially during the pandemic, and some of Bonnell Aluminumâs customers may have sourced, and continue to source, aluminum extrusions from producers outside the United States. The Company is participating as part of a coalition of members of Aluminum Extruders Council who have filed a trade case with the Department of Commerce (âDOCâ) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (âITCâ) against 15 countries in response to alleged large and increasing volumes of unfairly priced imports of aluminum extrusions since 2019. In November 2023, the ITC found that there is a reasonable indication that the American aluminum extrusions industry is materially injured or threatened with injury due to imports from 14 countries, including China. The ITCâs preliminary determination found that subject import volumes were significant and increasing, and that with regard to pricing, subject imports predominantly undersold the domestic product by volume in each year of the period of investigation. On March 5, 2024, the DOC announced its preliminary finding that the governments of China, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey unfairly subsidize their aluminum extrusion industries. The DOC calculated a range of affirmative preliminary countervailing duties from each country. A preliminary anti-dumping determination for these four countries and the 10 other countries included in the initial petition is expected in May 2024. The Company expects the final ITC vote to occur in late 2024. EBITDA from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased $0.9 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to: Lower volume ($3.6 million), higher labor and employee-related costs ($0.9 million), lower pricing ($0.6 million), and higher selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses ($1.8 million), partially offset by lower supply expense ($1.9 million) and utility costs ($0.7 million); The timing of the flow-through under the first-in first-out (âFIFOâ) method of aluminum raw material costs passed through to customers, previously acquired at higher prices in a quickly changing commodity pricing environment, resulted in a charge of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a charge of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022; and Inventories accounted for under the last in, first out (âLIFOâ) method resulted in a benefit of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a charge of $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, the Company recorded a favorable out-of-period adjustment of $1.9 million related to inventory in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Results vs. Full Year 2022 Results Net sales in 2023 decreased 25.6% versus 2022 primarily due to lower sales volume and the pass-through of lower metal costs. EBITDA from ongoing operations decreased $28.8 million in 2023 versus 2022, primarily due to: Lower volume ($29.6 million), higher labor and employee-related costs ($4.5 million), lower labor productivity in the first half of 2023 ($0.9 million), higher supply expense, including higher paint expense associated with a shift to more painted product throughout 2023 and inflationary costs for other supplies ($1.2 million), higher freight rates ($0.8 million) and higher SG&A expenses ($1.5 million); partially offset by higher pricing, primarily in the first quarter of 2023 ($4.0 million), and lower utility costs ($2.3 million); The timing of the flow-through under the FIFO method of aluminum raw material costs passed through to customers, previously acquired at higher prices in a quickly changing commodity pricing environment, resulted in a charge of $1.1 million in 2023 versus a benefit of $0.1 million in 2022; and Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method resulted in a benefit of $1.2 million in 2023 versus a charge of $2.9 million in 2022. In addition, the Company recorded an unfavorable out-of-period adjustment of $0.6 million related to inventory and accrued labor costs in the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2022. Aluminum Extrusions believes that it has adequate supply agreements for aluminum raw materials in 2024. See discussion of Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7a of the Companyâs Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (âForm 10-Kâ) for additional information on aluminum price trends. Projected Capital Expenditures and Depreciation & Amortization Capital expenditures for Bonnell Aluminum are projected to be $9 million in 2024, including $4 million for productivity projects and $5 million for capital expenditures required to support continuity of operations. The projected spending reflects stringent spending measures that the Company has implemented to control its financial leverage (see âDebt, Financial Leverage, Debt Covenants and Debt Refinancingâ section for more information). The multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning and manufacturing execution systems (""ERP/MES"") has been reorganized with an extended implementation period. As a result, the earliest âgo-liveâ date for the new ERP/MES is 2025. The ERP/MES project commenced in 2022, with spending to-date of approximately $21 million. Depreciation expense is projected to be $16 million in 2024. Amortization expense is projected to be $2 million in 2024. PE Films PE Films produces surface protection films, polyethylene overwrap films and films for other markets. A summary of results for PE Films is provided below: Three Months Ended Favorable/ Year Ended Favorable/ (In thousands, except percentages) December 31, (Unfavorable) December 31, (Unfavorable) 2023 2022 % Change 2023 2022 % Change Sales volume (lbs) 8,518 5,600 52.1% 29,355 32,873 (10.7)% Net sales $ 20,728 $ 14,959 38.6% $ 76,763 $ 97,571 (21.3)% Ongoing operations: EBITDA $ 4,516 $ (2,594 ) NM** $ 11,217 $ 11,949 (6.1)% Depreciation & amortization (1,216 ) (1,548 ) 21.4% (6,522 ) (6,280 ) (3.9)% EBIT* $ 3,300 $ (4,142 ) NM** $ 4,695 $ 5,669 (17.2)% Capital expenditures $ 266 $ 752 $ 1,772 $ 3,289 * For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the EBITDA from ongoing operations by segment statements in the Financial Tables in this press release. ** Not meaningful (âNMâ) Fourth Quarter 2023 Results vs. Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 38.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2022, with volume increases in both surface protection and overwrap films. Surface Protection sales volume increased 42% in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Although fourth quarter volume in Surface Protection is typically low due to seasonality, sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 8% versus the third quarter of 2023. Given recent volume improvements for Surface Protection and other market indicators, the Company believes that the consumer electronics market is now in recovery mode. Overwrap sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased 62% versus a weak fourth quarter of 2022. EBITDA from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased $7.1 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to: A $5.2 million increase from Surface Protection: Higher contribution margin associated with higher volume and favorable mix ($2.1 million), operating efficiencies ($1.0 million), cost improvements ($0.6 million) and lower SG&A and research and development ($0.7 million), primarily from the closure of the technical center in the third quarter of 2023; Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method resulted in a benefit of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a charge of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022; and The pass-through lag associated with resin costs ($0.2 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a benefit of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022). A $1.9 million increase from overwrap films primarily due to: Higher contribution margin associated with higher volume and favorable mix ($0.6 million) and cost improvements ($0.7 million); Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method resulted in a benefit of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a charge of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022; and The pass-through lag associated with resin costs (a charge of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus a benefit of $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022). See discussion of Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7a of the Form 10-K for additional information on resin price trends. Full Year 2023 Results vs. Full Year 2022 Results Net sales in 2023 decreased 21.3% versus 2022, primarily due to lower volume in Surface Protection, resulting from weak demand in the consumer electronics market and customer inventory corrections during 2023. Sales volume in 2023 for surface protection films declined 22% and increased 2% for overwrap films versus 2022. EBITDA from ongoing operations in 2023 decreased $0.7 million versus 2022 primarily due to: A $5.7 million decrease from Surface Protection: Lower contribution margin for non-transitioning products associated with a market slowdown and customer inventory corrections ($11.1 million) and for previously disclosed customer product transitions ($0.7 million), partially offset by favorable pricing ($0.5 million), operating efficiencies ($2.6 million) and cost improvements ($3.2 million); The pass-through lag associated with resin costs ($0.3 million charge in 2023 versus a benefit of $0.5 million in 2022); A foreign currency transaction gain of $0.2 million in 2023 versus a gain of $0.8 million in 2022; and Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method resulted in a benefit of $1.0 million in 2023 versus a charge of $0.1 million in 2022. A $5.0 million increase from overwrap films primarily due: Higher contribution margin associated with higher volume and favorable mix ($1.3 million), cost improvements ($3.1 million) and lower SG&A ($0.4 million); The pass-through lag associated with resin costs (a charge of $0.2 million in 2023 versus a benefit of $0.4 million in 2022); and Inventories accounted for under the LIFO method resulted in a benefit of $0.3 million in 2023 versus a charge of $0.4 million in 2022. Closure of PE Films Technical Center In August 2023, the Company adopted a plan to close the PE Films technical center in Richmond, VA and reduce its efforts to develop and sell films supporting the semiconductor market. Future research and development activities for PE Films will be performed at the facility in Pottsville, PA. PE Films continues to have new business opportunities primarily relating to surface protection films that protect components of flat panel and flexible displays. The Company anticipates all activities to cease at the PE Films technical center in Richmond, VA, by the end of the first quarter of 2024. The Company recognized total expense incurred through December 31, 2023 associated with exit activities of $1.3 million for: (i) severance and related costs ($0.9 million) and (ii) building closure costs ($0.4 million). In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash asset impairment ($3.5 million), accelerated depreciation ($0.3 million) and a gain on the lease modification ($0.1 million). Net annual cash savings of $3.4 million are anticipated, which began in the fourth quarter of 2023. Projected Capital Expenditures and Depreciation & Amortization Capital expenditures for PE Films are projected to be $2 million in 2024, including $1 million for productivity projects and $1 million for capital expenditures required to support continuity of current operations. Depreciation expense is projected to be $6 million in 2024. There is no amortization expense for PE Films. Flexible Packaging Films Flexible Packaging Films produces polyester-based films for use in packaging applications that have specialized properties, such as heat resistance, strength, barrier protection and the ability to accept high-quality print graphics. A summary of results for Flexible Packaging Films is provided below: Three Months Ended Favorable/ (Unfavorable) % Change Year Ended Favorable/ (Unfavorable) % Change (In thousands, except percentages) December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Sales volume (lbs) 22,805 24,475 (6.8)% 88,536 106,685 (17.0)% Net sales $ 31,464 $ 40,022 (21.4)% $ 126,326 $ 168,139 (24.9)% Ongoing operations: EBITDA $ 2,307 $ 6,957 (66.8)% $ 4,383 $ 27,452 (84.0)% Depreciation & amortization (750 ) (721 ) (4.0)% (2,865 ) (2,444 ) (17.2)% EBIT* $ 1,557 $ 6,236 (75.0)% $ 1,518 $ 25,008 (93.9)% Capital expenditures $ 1,433 $ 841 $ 4,323 $ 8,151 * For a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the EBITDA from ongoing operations by segment statements in the Financial Tables in this press release. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results vs. Fourth Quarter 2022 Results Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 21.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The Company believes that unfavorable variances throughout 2023 versus 2022 were primarily due to lower sales volume and lower margin driven by global excess capacity and competition in Brazil from imports. EBITDA from ongoing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased by $4.7 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to: Lower selling prices from the pass-through of lower resin costs and margin pressures ($4.3 million), lower sales volume ($1.0 million) and higher variable costs ($3.2 million), partially offset by lower raw material costs ($2.7 million) and lower SG&A expenses ($1.4 million); and Foreign currency transaction losses ($0.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to foreign currency transaction gains ($0.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022. Full Year 2023 Results vs. Full Year 2022 Results Net sales in 2023 decreased 24.9% compared to 2022, primarily due to lower sales volume and lower margin that the Company believes were driven by excess global capacity and competition in Brazil from imports, partially offset by favorable product mix. EBITDA from ongoing operations in 2023 decreased by $23.1 million versus 2022, primarily due to: Lower selling prices from the pass-through of lower resin costs and margin pressures ($17.6 million), lower sales volume ($9.7 million), higher fixed costs ($1.0 million, primarily due to under absorption from lower production volumes) and higher variable costs ($1.3 million, including higher costs resulting from quality issues), partially offset by lower raw material costs ($5.9 million) and lower SG&A expenses ($2.3 million); Foreign currency transaction losses ($0.3 million) in 2023 compared to foreign currency transaction losses ($0.2 million) in 2022; and Net unfavorable foreign currency translation of Real-denominated operating costs ($1.4 million) in 2023 versus 2022. Projected Capital Expenditures and Depreciation & Amortization Capital expenditures for Terphane are projected to be $4 million in 2024 for capital expenditures required to support continuity of current operations. Depreciation expense is projected to be $3 million in 2024. Amortization expense is projected to be $0.1 million in 2024. Corporate Expenses, Interest & Taxes Corporate expenses, net in 2023 decreased by $1.8 million compared to 2022, primarily due to lower pension expense as a result of the pension plan termination completed in 2023 ($3.7 million), lower accruals for employee-related compensation ($2.1 million) and lower stock-based compensation ($1.4 million), partially offset by higher professional fees associated with business development activities ($3.2 million) and a charge to adjust the initial purchase price of the nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract as a result of the routine administrative process to transition the pension plan ($2.0 million). Interest expense was $11.6 million in 2023 in comparison to $5.0 million in 2022, primarily due to higher weighted average total debt outstanding, higher interest rates and the write-off of $1.1 million of deferred financing fees. The effective tax rate used to compute income taxes (benefit) in 2023 was 33.8% compared to 13.4% in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to tax benefits previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) that were released as a result of the pension plan termination, partially offset by a reduction in Brazilian tax incentives as a percentage of income. The stranded taxes released with the termination of the pension plan represent the effect of the change in federal and state tax rates on pension-related deferred tax items initially recorded in other comprehensive income. The related stranded taxes were released in full in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had potential U.S. federal income tax benefits of $22 million that could be realized from the utilization against future taxable income of existing U.S. foreign tax credit, net operating loss, research & development and interest limitation carryforwards. See Note (e) to Financial Tables for information related to the effective tax rate from ongoing operations. For an explanation of differences between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate for 2023 and 2022, see Note 12 âIncome Taxesâ to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 âExhibits and Financial Statements Schedulesâ (âItem 15â) of the Form 10-K. Status of Current Corporate Strategic Initiatives The status of current corporate strategic initiatives is as follows: Agreement to Sell Terphane On September 1, 2023, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell Terphane to Oben Group (the âContingent Terphane Saleâ). Completion of the sale is contingent upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain competition filing approvals by authorities in Brazil and Colombia. On October 27, 2023, the Company filed the requisite competition forms with the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (âCADEâ) in Brazil. The regulatory review process is ongoing and in line with the Companyâs expectations. CADEâs maximum deadline for completing its review is no later than November 18, 2024. The merger review regarding the transaction was cleared by the Colombian authority in early February 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has reported results for Terphane as a continuing operation, given the early stage of the approval process by authorities. If the Contingent Terphane Sale transaction is completed, the Company expects to realize after-tax cash proceeds of $85 million after deducting projected Brazil withholding taxes, escrow funds, U.S. capital gains taxes and transaction costs. Actual after-tax net proceeds may differ from this estimate due to possible changes in deductions and the Company's tax situation during the potentially lengthy interim period to the closing date. Debt, Financial Leverage, Debt Covenants and Debt Refinancing Total debt was $146.3 million at December 31, 2023, $155.0 million at September 30, 2023 and $137.0 million at December 31, 2022. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were $13.5 million at December 31, 2023, $48.6 million at September 30, 2023 and $19.2 million at December 31, 2022. Net debt (total debt in excess of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash), a non-GAAP financial measure, was $132.8 million at December 31, 2023, $106.4 million at September 30, 2023 and $117.8 million at December 31, 2022. See Note (f) to the Financial Tables for a reconciliation of net debt to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company has been focused on managing net working capital, capital expenditures and costs during the current slowdown in business. Total debt increased $9.3 million and net debt increased $15.0 million at the end of 2023 versus the end of 2022 due to the $27.7 million contribution to the pension plan in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by lower net working capital. In November 2023, the Company disclosed its intent to reduce the risk of a debt covenant violation during a severe cyclical downturn impacting all of its businesses at the same time by transitioning from a âcash flowâ based revolving credit facility (which uses Credit EBITDA) to an asset based revolving credit facility. On October 26, 2023, Terphane Limitada (âTerphaneâ), the Companyâs wholly owned subsidiary in Brazil, borrowed $20 million secured by certain of its assets (âTerphane Brazil Loanâ). This U.S. Dollar borrowing matures on October 30, 2028, with interest payable quarterly at an annual floating interest rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (âSOFRâ) plus 5.99%. The SOFR rate was 5.36% as of December 31, 2023. Quarterly principal payments of $1.7 million begin starting in year 3 of the loan. There are no prepayment penalties. The Company expects that the Terphane Brazil Loan will be repaid (and collateral released) upon the closing of the Contingent Terphane Sale. On October 26, 2023, the Company borrowed $20 million from Terphane Brazil (the âIntercompany Loanâ) at the same interest rate as the Terphane Brazil Loan, thereby transferring the funds to the U.S. The Company will repay the Intercompany Loan in conjunction with the closing of the Contingent Terphane Sale. On December 27, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 3 (the âABL Facilityâ) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated June 29, 2022, which provides the Company with a $180 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility that will expire on June 30, 2026. The ABL Facility amended the Companyâs existing $200 million revolving, secured credit facility that was scheduled to mature on June 29, 2027 (the âPrior Credit Agreementâ). As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the ABL Facility. Availability for borrowings under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real properties and owned machinery and equipment. As of December 31, 2023, excess available borrowings under the ABL Facility were approximately $22.9 million, based upon the outstanding borrowing base availability net of the financial covenant for Minimum Liquidity (as defined in the ABL Facility). Upon the earlier of March 31, 2025 or the date the Company receives the proceeds from the sale of Terphane (the âABL Adjustment Dateâ), the $180 million ABL Facility will be reduced to $125 million. If the Contingent Terphane Sale is not completed by the ABL Adjustment Date, the Company may have to undertake alternative financing plans, subject to the limitations imposed by the ABL Facility, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or raising additional capital. Refer to Note 7 âDebt and Credit Agreementsâ to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of the Form 10-K for an explanation of the financial highlights and primary debt covenants. Pension Plan Termination On September 27, 2023, the Company borrowed $30 million under the Prior Credit Agreement in anticipation of the final funding expected for terminating its defined benefit pension plan obligation. On October 31, 2023, the Company used this cash to contribute $27.7 million to fully fund the pension plan with the amount necessary to purchase from Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract for $157.5 million. On November 3, 2023, the pension plan termination and settlement process was completed, and the Companyâs relevant pension plan obligation was transferred to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. This completed the pension plan termination process that began in February 2022. As a result of the routine administrative process to transition the pension plan, the Company recognized a $2.0 million charge to adjust the initial purchase price of the nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract. During 2023, the Company recognized a pre-tax pension settlement loss of $92.3 million.

Net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share from ongoing operations are key financial and analytical measures used by management to gauge the operating performance of Tredegarâs ongoing operations. They are not intended to represent the stand-alone results for Tredegarâs ongoing operations under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or earnings (loss) per share as defined by GAAP. They exclude items that management believes do not relate to Tredegarâs ongoing operations. A reconciliation to net income (loss) and diluted earnings (loss) per share from ongoing operations for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is shown below: Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (In millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net income (loss) as reported under GAAP1 $ (35.6 ) $ (3.9 ) $ (105.9 ) $ 28.5 After-tax effects of: (Gains) losses associated with plant shutdowns, asset impairments and restructurings 0.3 â 4.0 0.5 (Gains) losses from sale of assets and other: Gain associated with the investment in kalÃ©o â (0.1 ) (0.2 ) (1.1 ) Tax expense (benefit) from adjustments to deferred income tax liabilities under new U.S. tax regulations related to foreign tax credits (0.2 ) â 1.3 (3.8 ) Group annuity contract premium expense4 1.6 â 1.6 â Other 2.1 1.3 8.1 4.1 Net periodic benefit cost for the frozen defined benefit pension plan in process of termination2 0.7 3.2 8.4 11.3 Pension settlement loss4 31.0 â 51.0 â Goodwill impairment3 â â 27.0 â Net income (loss) from ongoing operations1 $ (0.1 ) $ 0.5 $ (4.7 ) $ 39.5 Earnings (loss) per share as reported under GAAP (diluted) $ (1.04 ) $ (0.11 ) $ (3.10 ) $ 0.84 After-tax effects per diluted share of: (Gains) losses associated with plant shutdowns, asset impairments and restructurings 0.01 â 0.12 0.01 (Gains) losses from sale of assets and other: Gain associated with the investment in kalÃ©o â â (0.01 ) (0.03 ) Tax expense (benefit) from adjustments to deferred income tax liabilities under new U.S. tax regulations related to foreign tax credits (0.01 ) â 0.04 (0.11 ) Group annuity contract premium expense4 0.05 â 0.05 â Other 0.06 0.04 0.23 0.13 Net periodic benefit cost for the frozen defined benefit pension plan in process of termination2 0.02 0.09 0.25 0.33 Pension settlement loss4 0.90 â 1.48 â Goodwill impairment3 â â 0.79 â Earnings (loss) per share from ongoing operations (diluted) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.02 $ (0.15 ) $ 1.17 1.

For more information, see âStatus of Current Corporate Strategic Initiativesâ section of this press release. (b) EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) from ongoing operations is the key segment profitability metric used by the Companyâs chief operating decision maker to assess segment financial performance. The Company uses sales less freight (ânet salesâ) as its measure of revenues from external customers at the segment level. For more business segment information, see Note 13 âBusiness Segmentsâ to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of the Form 10-K. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) from ongoing operations is a non-GAAP financial measure included in the accompanying tables and the reconciliation of segment financial information to consolidated results for the Company in the net sales and EBITDA from ongoing operations by segment statements. It is not intended to represent the stand-alone results for Tredegarâs ongoing operations under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP. The Company believes that EBIT is a widely understood and utilized metric that is meaningful to certain investors and that including this financial metric in the reconciliation of managementâs performance metric, EBITDA from ongoing operations, provides useful information to those investors that primarily utilize EBIT to analyze the Companyâs core operations. (c) Gains and losses associated with plant shutdowns, asset impairments, restructurings and other items for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 detailed below are shown in the statements of net sales and EBITDA from ongoing operations by segment and are included in âAsset impairments and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, net of adjustmentsâ in the condensed consolidated statements of income, unless otherwise noted.

Net debt is not intended to represent total debt as defined by GAAP. Net debt is utilized by management in evaluating the Companyâs financial leverage and equity valuation, and management believes that investors also may find net debt to be helpful for the same purposes. (g) During 2023, uncertainty about the timing of a recovery in the consumer electronics market persisted, and manufacturers in the supply chain for consumer electronics continued to experience reduced capacity utilization and inventory corrections. In light of the limited visibility on the timing of a recovery and the expected adverse future impact to the Surface Protection business, coupled with a cautious outlook on new product development opportunities, the Company performed a Step 1 goodwill impairment analysis, as of June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023, of the Surface Protection component of PE Films. The analyses concluded that the fair value of Surface Protection was less than its carrying value, thus a non-cash partial goodwill impairment of $34.9 million ($27.0 million after deferred income tax benefits) was recognized during 2023. As of December 1, 2023, the Companyâs reporting units with goodwill were Surface Protection in PE Films and Futura in Aluminum Extrusions. Both of these reporting units have separately identifiable operating net assets (operating assets including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets net of operating liabilities). The Company's Step 0 analysis of these reporting units concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value. Therefore, the Step 1 quantitative goodwill impairment tests for these reporting units were not necessary. The Surface Protection and Futura reporting units had goodwill in the amounts of $22.4 million and $13.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. (h) Beginning in 2022, and consistent with no expected required minimum cash contributions, no pension expense has been included in calculating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as defined in the Prior Credit Agreement, which is used to compute certain borrowing ratios and to compute non-GAAP net income (loss) from ongoing operations. (i) The ABL Facility has customary representations and warranties including, as a condition to each borrowing, that all such representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects (including a representation that no Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the ABL Facility) has occurred since December 31, 2022). In the event that the Company cannot certify that all conditions to the borrowing have been met, the lenders can restrict the Companyâs future borrowings under the ABL Facility. Because a Cash Dominion Period is currently in effect and the Company is required to represent that no Material Adverse Effect has occurred as a condition to borrowing, the outstanding debt under the ABL Facility (all contractual payments due on June 30, 2026) is classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with the ABL Facility, the lenders have been provided with the Companyâs financial statements, covenant compliance certificates and projections to facilitate their ongoing assessment of the Company. Accordingly, the Company believes the likelihood that lenders would exercise the subjective acceleration clause whereby prohibiting future borrowings is remote. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants.

The company also saw a 7% increase in total personal auto policies compared to the previous year. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net premiums written by The Progressive Corporation indicate a robust growth trajectory for the company, which is a critical factor for investors as it reflects the company's ability to generate revenue through its policy sales. The increase in net premiums written, to $5,720.5 million, showcases the company's expanding market presence and customer base.Another key indicator is the combined ratio, which at 86.8 for the current year, has improved from the prior year's 95.1. This metric is vital as it measures the profitability from underwriting activities; a ratio below 100 indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit. This improvement suggests that Progressive has managed its claims and expenses more effectively compared to the previous year, which could lead to higher profitability and potentially bolster investor confidence. Market Research Analyst Progressive's increase in policies in force across various segments, particularly a 10% growth in the Total Property business, reflects a positive consumer response to the company's offerings and strategic initiatives. This growth is significant as it demonstrates the company's competitive positioning in the insurance market. It's also worth noting the 7% increase in both Personal Lines Agency â auto and Direct â auto, suggesting a strong consumer preference for Progressive's automotive insurance products.However, the change in accounting closing calendar may pose challenges in making year-over-year comparisons, which could affect analysts' ability to conduct trend analysis. This change underscores the importance of understanding accounting practices when evaluating a company's financial health and performance. Economist The reported financials from The Progressive Corporation provide a snapshot of the company's economic health. The net income of $737.1 million, coupled with a per-share value of $1.24, indicates a solid profitability that could contribute positively to the overall economy through increased investor confidence and potential reinvestment. The positive performance might also reflect broader economic trends such as consumer spending capacity and overall demand for insurance products.Additionally, the reported pretax net realized gains on securities of $80.7 million suggest that the company's investment activities are yielding favorable results, which can be a buffer against underwriting volatility. It is important for stakeholders to monitor such gains as part of the company's comprehensive financial performance. 03/15/2024 - 08:18 AM MAYFIELD VILLAGE, OHIO, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) today reported the following results for the month ended February 29, 2024: February(millions, except per share amounts and ratios; unaudited)2024Net premiums written$5,720.5Net premiums earned$5,129.1Net income$737.1Per share available to common shareholders$1.24Total pretax net realized gains (losses) on securities$80.7Combined ratio â current year 86.8 â prior year 95.1Average diluted equivalent common shares 587.3 In October 2023, we converted our monthly accounting closing calendar to align with the Gregorian calendar.

(NYSE: SHCO) announced strong financial results for Q4 2023 and FY 2023, showcasing growth in total members, revenues, and Adjusted EBITDA. The company reported a net loss but highlighted significant progress in profitability and member experience enhancement. With new house openings and strategic initiatives, SHCO aims to drive operational excellence and membership growth in the upcoming year. Positive Total members in Q4 2023 grew to 259,884, a 14.6% increase year-over-year. Membership revenues increased by 24.2% year-over-year, totaling $95.8 million. Total revenues for FY 2023 reached $1,135.9 million, a 16.8% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023 was $36.6 million, up $13.4 million from the previous year. Net loss for FY 2023 was $118.0 million, inclusive of an impairment charge. Successfully opened two new houses in Bangkok and Mexico City. Expecting to open Soho House Sao Paulo soon. Appointed Tom Collins as Chief Operating Officer in November 2023. Focus on driving accommodations performance resulted in 4% RevPAR growth in Q4 2023. Total Soho House members grew to 193,865, a 19.7% increase year-over-year. Total members grew by 14.6% year-over-year to 259,884. SHCO ended Q4 2023 with Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash of $164 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Soho House & Co Inc. for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 exhibit a mixed performance. The 7.5% year-over-year growth in total revenues and a significant 24.2% increase in membership revenues reflect a robust expansion in the company's member base and its revenue-generating capabilities. The growth in Soho House membership by 19.7% year-over-year and the substantial waitlist, suggest a strong brand appeal and potential for future revenue growth. However, the reported net loss of $57.0 million, including a significant $47 million impairment charge, raises concerns about the company's profitability and asset valuation. The improvement in adjusted EBITDA by $13.4 million compared to the previous year indicates progress in operational efficiency, yet it is essential to monitor if this trend continues to offset the net losses.The 4% growth in Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) signals a positive trend in the hospitality segment of the business, which is important for long-term sustainability. The expansion into new markets like South East Asia and Latin America could diversify revenue streams and mitigate risks associated with market saturation. However, investors should be cautious about the high net debt of $638.3 million, which could impact financial flexibility. The updated fiscal 2024 guidance will be pivotal in assessing the company's trajectory and the effectiveness of its strategic priorities. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Soho House's expansion into new geographical locations, such as Portland and the upcoming Sao Paulo House, indicates a strategic move to capture untapped markets and broaden its global footprint. The company's ability to grow its membership base in a competitive hospitality and lifestyle sector is commendable and reflects successful brand positioning. The record-high membership waitlist suggests a strong demand for Soho House's offerings, which could translate into future revenue growth and possibly increased market share.However, the competitive landscape of luxury membership clubs and hospitality services is rapidly evolving, with consumers having numerous alternatives. It will be essential for Soho House to continue innovating and enhancing member experiences to maintain its market position. The increase in House-Level Contribution margin to 31% from 24% is a positive indicator of the company's ability to generate profit at the individual house level. The focus on operational excellence and improved food & beverage margins are strategies that could further strengthen the company's market position if sustained over time. Economist Examining the economic implications, the performance of Soho House & Co Inc. appears to reflect broader economic trends. The increase in membership and revenue during a period of economic recovery post-pandemic suggests discretionary spending is on the rise, particularly in the luxury and lifestyle sectors. The company's expansion strategy aligns with the economic principle of capitalizing on market growth opportunities, especially in regions that are experiencing an increase in consumer confidence and spending power.The reported net loss, however, underscores the potential risks associated with aggressive expansion, such as increased operational costs and the possibility of overextending in uncertain economic conditions. While the company has shown an ability to increase its EBITDA margins, the high level of debt may limit its ability to invest in growth opportunities or weather economic downturns without strain on its financial health. It will be important for Soho House to maintain a careful balance between growth and financial stability, particularly as economic forecasts remain uncertain amid global challenges such as inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. 03/15/2024 - 08:13 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Soho House & Co Inc.

Contacts: Investor Relations: ir@sohohouseco.com Press: press@sohohouseco.com Non-GAAP Financial Measures This presentation contains certain financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, House-Level Contribution and Margin, Other Contribution and Margin, Net Debt and certain financial measures presented on a Constant Currency basis that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âGAAPâ). We refer to these measures as ânon-GAAP financial measures.â We use these non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating our performance. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenues or net income (loss), in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies may calculate one or more of these measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of any such measure as a comparative measure. See below for a definition of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We provide earnings guidance using both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the Companyâs Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts and is not provided herein because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments that are made for future changes in foreign exchange and the other adjustments reflected in our reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, could be material. The information in this presentation should be read in conjunction with our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other information that we file with the SEC. The reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are an integral part of the information presented herein. You can access these documents on our website, www.sohohouseco.com, free of charge, as well as any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and should not be considered a part of, this presentation. In addition, the SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. The non-GAAP financial measures we use herein are defined by us as follows: ADJUSTED EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) before Depreciation and amortization, Interest expense, net, Income tax (expense) benefit, adjusted to take account of the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These other items include, but are not limited to, Gain (loss) on sale of property and other, net, Share of loss (profit) from equity method investments, Foreign exchange, Share of equity method investments adjusted EBITDA, Share-based compensation expense and other applicable items. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses (income) that do not relate to ongoing business performance. HOUSE-LEVEL CONTRIBUTION AND MARGIN. House-Level Contribution is defined as House Revenues less In-House operating expenses, which includes expense items such as food and beverage costs, labor costs, variable overheads and fixed costs, such as rent. It does not reflect the impact of depreciation, amortization, impairment, gain or loss on sale of property, general and administrative expenses or other applicable items. House-Level Contribution Margin is defined as House-Level Contribution as a percentage of our House Revenues and is a key determinant of our performance and profitability and our return on the investment we make in each of our Houses. Given that all costs associated with providing our members with the Soho House experience, including the costs associated with maintaining our Houses and providing services to members while in the Houses, are included in In-House operating expenses, we use House Revenues (inclusive of House Membership Revenues) in calculating House-Level Contribution and House-Level Contribution Margin to assess the overall profitability of our Houses. Accordingly, our management considers House-Level Contribution and House-Level Contribution Margin to be an important management measure to evaluate the performance of each House, and growth in aggregate House-Level Contribution allows us to leverage our general and administrative costs and improve overall profitability. OTHER CONTRIBUTION AND MARGIN. Other Contribution is defined as Other revenues plus Non-House Membership Revenues less Other operating expenses, which includes expense items not related to the operation of Houses, such as labor costs, variable overheads and fixed costs, such as rent. It does not reflect the impact of depreciation, amortization, impairment, gain or loss on sale of property, general and administrative expenses, pre-opening expenses, foreign exchange gain/loss, Share-based compensation expense and other applicable items. Other Contribution Margin defined as Other Contribution as a percentage of our Other revenues and is a key determinant of our performance and profitability and our return on the investment in our non-House business. Our management considers Other Contribution and Contribution Margin to be an important management measure. NET DEBT. Net Debt reflects the total debt, comprising long-term debt, property mortgage loans and related party loans, less cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Net Debt is an important measure to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. A limitation associated with using Net Debt is that it subtracts Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash and therefore may imply that there is less Company debt than the most comparable GAAP measure indicates. Management believes that investors may find it useful to monitor leverage and evaluate the balance sheet. CONSTANT CURRENCY. Some of our financial and operational data that we disclose in this release is presented on a âconstant currencyâ basis to isolate the effect of currency changes during the period. Where we refer to a measure being calculated in âconstant currency,â we are calculating the dollar change and the percentage change as if the exchange rate that is being used in the current period was in effect for all prior periods presented. We believe that this calculation provides a more meaningful indication of actual year over year performance and eliminates any fluctuations from currency exchange rates. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our business, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for revenues or net income (loss), in each case as recognized in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies may calculate one or more of these measures differently, which reduces the usefulness of any such measure as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the 13 weeks ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 is set forth below: For the 13 Weeks Ended Percent Change December 31, 2023 Actuals January 1, 2023 Actuals Actuals Constant Currency(1) (Unaudited, dollar amounts in thousands) Net income (loss) $ (57,335 ) $ 15,774 n/m n/m Depreciation and amortization 37,174 27,440 35 % 29 % Interest expense, net 24,609 18,551 33 % 27 % Income tax expense 5,425 2,061 n/m n/m EBITDA 9,873 63,826 (85 )% (85 )% Loss on sale of property and other, net 1,634 1,139 43 % 37 % Share of (income) loss of equity method investments 2,511 (1,515 ) n/m n/m Foreign exchange gain, net(2) (32,297 ) (58,560 ) 45 % 47 % Share of equity method investments EBITDA 2,054 1,895 8 % 4 % Adjusted share-based compensation expense(3) 4,044 9,044 (55 )% (57 )% Operational reorganization and severance expense(4) â 5,293 n/m n/m Membership credits (rebate) expense(5) â (15 ) n/m n/m Out of period operating lease liability adjustment(6) (5,776 ) 1,177 n/m n/m Out of period capital expenditure adjustment(7) 2,562 â n/m n/m Employment related settlement expense(8) â 913 n/m n/m Brand license inventory provision(9) 4,571 â n/m n/m Impairment relating to long lived assets(10) 47,455 â n/m n/m Adjusted EBITDA $ 36,631 $ 23,197 58 % 51 % See âNon-GAAP Financial Measuresâ for an explanation of our constant currency results. Primarily driven by foreign exchange volatility impacting our non-USD debt and working capital. For 13 Weeks Ended January 1, 2023 this excludes a $1 million non-cash expense, which is included within Share-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and includes an expense of $3 million, which is excluded from Share-based compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, in respect of a non-recurring cash payment in connection with the Growth Shares. In the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2023 this includes a non-cash share-based compensation expense of $1 million and $4 million with respect to a strategic reorganization of the Company's operations and support team. Beginning on March 14, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we issued membership credits to active members of our closed Houses to be redeemed for certain Soho Home products and services. Membership credits were a one-time goodwill gesture, issued as a marketing offer to active members. The expense represents our best estimate of the cost in fulfilling the membership credits. Represents an out-of-period adjustments correcting errors with respect to the estimation of the operating lease liability identified during the 13 week period ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 but relating prior financial periods. There is no material impact from the correction of this error to previously reported periods. Represents an out-of-period adjustment correcting an error with respect to the capitalization of certain expenses in connection to new House openings identified during the 13 week period ended December 31, 2023 but relating prior financial periods. There is no material impact from the correction of this error to previously reported periods. Represents expenses incurred in the 13 weeks ended January 1, 2023 with respect to a historic settlement of an employment related legal claim. The Company has remediated its operating processes to mitigate a similar issue from recurring. In November 2023, the Company entered into a 10-year licensing agreement with a third party to manufacture and distribute the Companyâs Cowshed brand, commencing January 1, 2024. This agreement has restricted the Companyâs ability to sell certain inventories it acquired prior to entering into the agreement. As such, the Company has provided in full for the inventory it is unable to recover as a result of the entering into the agreement. Following the Company's impairment review in the 13 weeks ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $47 million of impairment losses on long-lived assets (comprised of $33 million in respect of Operating lease assets and $14 million of Property and equipment, net), of which $37 million is in respect of Soho Works North America.

These key measures include: HOUSE MEMBERSHIP REVENUES. House Membership Revenues are comprised primarily of annual membership fees and one-time legacy registration fees from Soho House members which are amortized over 20 years. The one-time registration fee is no longer applicable to new members admitted from April 4, 2022, see House Introduction Credits below. HOUSE INTRODUCTION CREDITS. New members admitted from April 4, 2022 have been required to purchase House Introduction Credits as part of their membership, per the House rules. House Introduction Credits are credits of an equivalent value to cash within Houses and are redeemable to purchase food and beverage items, and bedroom stays, at the Houses. House Introduction Credits expire after the first three months from the date of issuance, where legally permitted in the regions we operate, if not utilized or if the Company terminates a memberâs House membership. House Introduction Credits are recognized upon issuance as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. Revenue from House Introduction Credits are recognized as In-House revenues when redeemed by members, and as breakage revenue within Membership revenues upon expiration or in the period that we are able to reliably estimate expected breakage to the extent that they are unredeemed, are recognized. IN-HOUSE REVENUES. In-House revenues include all revenues realized within our Houses, including food and beverage, accommodation and spa products and treatments. HOUSE REVENUES. House Revenues is defined as House Membership Revenues plus In-House revenues, less Non-House Membership Revenues. Our management views House Membership Revenues and In-House revenues as interrelated and their aggregation as important in tracking House performance. Although there is no minimum spend for any member on In-House offerings, nevertheless in practice most members consume food and beverage, accommodations and other offerings at our Houses. The pricing of our In-House offerings is reflective of the fact that the significant majority of In-House offerings that generate In-House revenues are consumed by members who also pay a membership fee in relation to that House, with pricing of such In-House offerings being identical for both members and non-members. NUMBER OF SOHO HOUSES. The number of Soho Houses reflects the total number of Soho Houses in operation in any period, irrespective of whether each House is (i) controlled by us, (ii) operated through a non-controlling interest in a joint venture or (iii) operated through a management contract. We review the number of members from all Houses to assess new member growth, total House Revenues, and House-Level Contribution. TOTAL MEMBERS. Total members is defined as Soho House members plus Other members. NUMBER OF SOHO HOUSE MEMBERS. Our Soho House membership model is an integral part of our business and has a significant impact on our profitability and financial performance. Typically, members hold an Every House membership or a Local House membership. Member count is the primary driver of Membership Revenues and is also a critical factor in In-House Revenues as members utilize the offerings that are provided within the Houses. Soho House members include all active, frozen and non-paying members. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, retain existing members and periodically increase our membership fee rates will impact our profitability. We have historically enjoyed strong member loyalty, reflected by very high retention rates. Robust demand for our memberships is also evidenced by considerable wait lists for our Houses. The year-over-year increase in our total number of Soho House members is driven by a combination of increases in membership at existing Houses and members from new Houses. NUMBER OF OTHER MEMBERS. Other members include members of Soho Works and Soho Friends and are key to our growth strategy and enhancing our Soho House member experience. Prior to August 2022, HOME+ membership, which is now included in Soho Friends, was also included. Like Soho House members, other memberships are an integral part of our business and we believe will have a significant impact on our profitability and financial performance in the future. SOHO HOUSE MEMBER RETENTION. Soho House Member Retention is defined as the number of Adult Paying Members (being all Soho House members excluding child members and complimentary members) at the beginning of a period less the number of Adult Paying Members who canceled their membership during that same period (without giving any effect to Adult Paying Members who froze their memberships during such period), as a proportion of total Adult Paying Members at the beginning of such period. FROZEN MEMBERS. Frozen Members refers to Soho House members who have elected to suspend their membership payments on a six, nine- or twelve-month basis during which period the member is not able to gain access to a Soho House site as a member, access our membership Apps, or book bedrooms or Cowshed treatments or products on discounted member rates. Frozen Members are not included in Adult Paying Members, but are included in the total number of Soho House members. MEMBERSHIP REVENUES. Membership revenues are comprised of House Membership Revenues (as defined below) and Non-House Membership Revenues (as defined below). House Membership Revenues and Non-House Membership Revenues are each comprised primarily of annual membership fees and one-time registration fees which are amortized over 20 years. Membership revenues are a function of the number of members, membership mix, and membership pricing. For GAAP, we report Membership revenues only from Houses and sites in which we own a controlling interest. Our membership pricing varies by geographic segment and membership offering and, as such, our mix of House and Soho Works club openings can affect our revenue growth and profitability over time. Prices are generally higher in North America and the rest of the world compared with the UK and Europe. Membership revenues provide a stable and recurring source of revenues which have few direct costs and, as such, is a reliable and predictable source of cash flow. HOUSE MEMBERSHIP REVENUES. House Membership Revenues is an important performance indicator and is defined above in the Non-GAAP reconciliation. IN-HOUSE REVENUES. In-House revenues refer to all revenues realized within our Houses, and primarily includes revenues from food and beverage, accommodation, and spa products and treatments. HOUSE REVENUES. House Revenues is an important performance indicator and is defined in âNon-GAAP Financial Measures."" OTHER REVENUES. Other revenues are defined as total revenues that are not realized within our Houses, including revenues from Scorpios, Soho Works and our stand-alone restaurants, procurement fees from Soho House Design, Soho Home and Cowshed retail products and other revenues from products and services that we provide outside of our Houses, as well as management fees from The Ned sites and The LINE and Saguaro hotels. NON-HOUSE MEMBERSHIP REVENUES. Non-House Membership Revenues are comprised of Soho Works membership revenue, Soho Friends membership revenue and SOHO HOME+ membership revenue which was merged into Soho Friends membership at the beginning of August 2022. ACTIVE APP USERS. Active App Users is defined as unique users who have logged into any of our membership Apps within the last three months. AVERAGE DAILY RATE. is Average Daily Rate represents the average rental income per paid occupied room. REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM (RevPAR). The key industry standard for measuring hotel-operating performance is RevPAR, which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms to available rooms by the average daily rate realized. Where this is presented on a like-for like basis, RevPAR is adjusted for new or divested sites, for example Houses that were not open in the comparison period.

Positive None.

Targets are considered science-based if they align with what the latest climate science says is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels. ""We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and contributing to a more sustainable world,"" said Megan Maltenfort, Cardinal Health's VP of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). ""We value our work with SBTi and will continue taking proactive steps to address climate change and to reduce the environmental impact of our products and processes."" With the SBTi approval, Cardinal Health commits to the following science-based targets: reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by fiscal 2030 from a fiscal 2019 base year.* 75% of its suppliers by spend, covering purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution, will have science-based targets by fiscal 2028.These approved targets represent an expansion of the company's current goal of reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, announced in September 2021; the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions from our supply chain has made the goal more ambitious. ""As we work to achieve our targets, we will collaborate with partners along our supply chain to collectively address the impacts of climate change,"" Maltenfort said. By the end of fiscal 2023, Cardinal Health had reduced its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 13% from a fiscal 2019 base year. In addition, the company continues to invest in energy efficiency opportunities in its distribution and manufacturing sites and is looking to expand its use of renewable energy across the enterprise. Cardinal Health reports on progress toward its climate goals in its annual Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with the latest climate science. It is a collaboration between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. *The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.

Trading of the units on the NYSE will cease on the Redemption Date. Non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding on distributions and sales transactions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The redemption of Global Partners LP's Series A Preferred Units represents a strategic financial decision that impacts both the company's capital structure and its preferred shareholders. By redeeming these units, Global is opting to retire a portion of its capital that is likely carrying a higher cost compared to other financing options, such as lower-interest debt instruments or equity at current market prices. This move could be indicative of management's confidence in the company's cash flow generation, as the redemption will require a significant cash outlay.From a shareholder perspective, this redemption eliminates a fixed-income investment option, which may have been appealing for its stability and predictable distributions. Investors should note the potential tax implications, especially for non-U.S. investors, due to the withholding tax requirements. The cessation of trading before the redemption date may also affect liquidity and trading strategies for current shareholders of these preferred units. Tax Expert The tax implications of this redemption are noteworthy, particularly the withholding tax on distributions to non-U.S. investors. The treatment of one hundred percent of Global's distributions as effectively connected income suggests that the company operates in a manner that subjects it to U.S. tax jurisdiction for these investors. The additional ten percent withholding is a significant tax burden and may influence the attractiveness of Global's securities to international investors.Brokers and nominees acting as withholding agents will need to navigate the complexities of these regulations to ensure compliance. This redemption event could serve as a reminder for investors to review their portfolios for similar tax exposures and for companies to consider the tax consequences of their capital market activities on their investor base. Market Research Analyst Global Partners LP's decision to redeem its Series A Preferred Units will likely be viewed favorably by analysts who see debt restructuring as a means to optimize the company's balance sheet. The preferred units' redemption is aligned with broader market trends, where firms seek to capitalize on favorable financing conditions to reduce higher-cost capital. However, the impact on the stock market will be limited to the company's specific securities, with minimal broader market implications.The redemption price set at $25.00 per share, along with accrued distributions, is a standard practice. Investors should consider the timing of the redemption and the potential opportunity cost of being invested in these preferred units until the redemption date. The redemption could also signal management's assessment of future interest rate movements and their impact on financing costs. 03/15/2024 - 08:15 AM WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) (âGlobalâ) today announced that it intends to redeem all $69,000,000 of its 2,760,000 issued and outstanding Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the âSeries A Preferred Unitsâ) (CUSIP: 37946R208).

Gross profit, net income, and adjusted EBITDA showed significant growth in 2023. Operational highlights included growth in GigaCloud Marketplace GMV and active participants. Acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign positively impacted financial results. Despite a warehouse fire in Japan, the Company remains confident in its future performance. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of GigaCloud Technology Inc. indicate a substantial year-over-year growth in both quarterly and annual revenues, with a particularly impressive increase in net income margins. Such performance is likely to draw investor attention, as it suggests that the company is not only expanding its top line but also improving profitability. The reported growth in gross margin, from 21.2% to 28.5%, reflects a significant improvement in operational efficiency or a shift towards higher-margin products and services. Additionally, the increase in Adjusted EBITDA, a measure often used to assess a company's operating performance, further underscores GigaCloud's financial health.From a balance sheet perspective, the increase in cash reserves indicates a solid liquidity position, which provides the company with flexibility for future investments or to weather potential market downturns. However, the increase in operating expenses, particularly in selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses, could be a point of concern if such trends continue without corresponding revenue growth. Investors should monitor whether these expenses are investments that will drive future growth or if they are indicative of rising costs that could pressure margins over time. Market Research Analyst GigaCloud's aggressive expansion in the B2B ecommerce space, as evidenced by the acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign, suggests a strategic move to diversify its product offerings and enhance its technological capabilities. The integration of these companies is expected to bolster GigaCloud's marketplace and service revenue streams, which could provide a competitive edge in the large parcel merchandise market. The increase in active sellers and buyers, along with a higher spend per active buyer, indicates a strengthening of the company's ecosystem, which is essential for sustaining long-term growth.However, the marketplace's reliance on a few sales channels and the potential risks associated with concentrating on large parcel merchandise should be considered. Diversification of sales channels can reduce dependency on specific markets or customer segments, mitigating risks associated with market volatility. Moreover, the reported warehouse fire incident could have been a significant setback, but the company's quick response and insurance coverage appear to have minimized operational disruptions. This incident highlights the importance of robust risk management practices in maintaining operational continuity. Economist The reported financial performance of GigaCloud indicates a robust demand for large parcel merchandise, which may be reflective of broader economic trends such as growth in ecommerce and a shift towards digital supply chain solutions. The company's ability to capitalize on these trends, as seen through its increased revenues and market share, points to effective strategic positioning within its industry.However, macroeconomic factors such as inflation, changes in consumer spending and global trade dynamics could impact GigaCloud's cost structure and pricing strategies. As the company scales its operations globally, it will need to navigate geopolitical risks and currency fluctuations that could affect its international sales and supply chain. The projected revenue for the next quarter suggests a confident outlook, but it remains subject to market and operational conditions. Investors should consider the potential impact of economic cycles on GigaCloud's performance, particularly in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving ecommerce landscape. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Fourth Consecutive Quarter of Record Profitability, Revenues up 94.8% from Fourth Quarter 2022EL MONTE, Calif., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GigaCloud Technology Inc (Nasdaq: GCT) (âGigaCloudâ or the âCompanyâ), a pioneer of global end-to-end B2B ecommerce solutions for large parcel merchandise, today announced its unaudited financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

We believe the Noble House acquisition would contribute additional sales channels and business relationships to further complement our B2B ecommerce ecosystem. In November 2023, we completed the acquisition of a 100% equity interest of Apexis, Inc., a Florida corporation dba Wondersign, or Wondersign, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $10.0 million. The Wondersign acquisition was funded using cash on hand from operations. Wondersign is a cloud-based interactive digital signage and e-catalog management SaaS company headquartered in Tampa, Florida with access to thousands of storefronts across the United States through its customers. Wondersign develops and maintains âCatalog Kiosk,â a leading digital catalog software that allows retailers to display an endless aisle of products and better connect with todayâs omni-channel shoppers. We believe that the acquisition of Wondersign would help us achieve our goal in making GigaCloud Marketplace a customer-facing and seamless platform, providing a user-friendly experience for both platform participants and retail store customers. Noble House contributes product revenues to our GigaCloud 1P and off-platform ecommerce revenue streams, while Wondersign contributes service revenues through its catalog subscription services, and product revenues through the sales of its Catalog Kiosk displays. The financial impact from the acquisitions of Noble House and Wondersign was reflected in our financial results in the fourth quarter of 2023. The operating impact from these acquisitions has not been reflected in the operating metrics in our GigaCloud Marketplace in the fourth quarter of 2023. Warehouse Fire On March 9, 2024, one of the Companyâs warehouses in Japan suffered damages due to a warehouse fire. While the Company is still evaluating the impact caused by the warehouse fire, the Company estimated approximately $1.8 million in damages with respect to the cost of its inventory held at the warehouse. The Company has insurance coverage associated with the damages to the inventory and warehouse equipment. Furthermore, the Company has a total of four warehouses in Japan and the Company has shifted our warehousing operations in Japan to the other three warehouses to minimize any disruptions to the Companyâs operations in Japan. Share Repurchase Program The Company established a share repurchase program in June 2023 under which the Company may purchase up to $25.0 million of its Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.05, over a 12-month period. From the launch of the share repurchase program on June 14, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the Company in aggregate purchased approximately 215,000 Class A ordinary shares in the open market at a total consideration of approximately $1.6 million pursuant to the share repurchase program. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, we did not repurchase any Class A ordinary shares. Business Outlook The Company expects its total revenues to be between $230 million and $240 million in the first quarter of 2024. This forecast reflects the Companyâs current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change and cannot be predicted with reasonable accuracy as of the date hereof.

The notes will bear interest at 0.875% per annum, with an option for additional $78.75 million. The offering is expected to close on March 18, 2024. MicroStrategy intends to use the net proceeds to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by MicroStrategy to issue $525 million in convertible senior notes is a strategic financial move that signals the company's intention to raise capital for further investments, specifically in bitcoin. The upsized offering from the initially stated $500 million suggests a robust demand from qualified institutional buyers, reflecting investor confidence in the company's prospects or in the potential upside of its investment in bitcoin.Convertible notes are a type of debt that investors can convert into equity at a later date, under specific conditions. The relatively low interest rate of 0.875% per annum indicates that MicroStrategy is taking advantage of the current interest rate environment to obtain inexpensive financing. However, the conversion premium of approximately 40% over the recent weighted average price of MicroStrategy's class A common stock underscores the potential dilution that current shareholders might face if the conversion occurs.The decision to allocate a significant portion of the proceeds to bitcoin acquisitions is noteworthy. It underscores MicroStrategy's commitment to its strategy of investing in digital assets, a move that could have a profound impact on the company's risk profile and balance sheet. This strategy could lead to increased volatility in the company's stock, as the value of its bitcoin holdings will be subject to the fluctuations of the cryptocurrency market. Market Research Analyst MicroStrategy's decision to use the proceeds from the note offering to invest in bitcoin is indicative of the company's broader strategy to align itself with the cryptocurrency market. This move could be interpreted as a bold bet on the future of digital currencies, which may attract a certain segment of investors interested in gaining exposure to bitcoin through a publicly traded company.However, it's important to consider the broader market implications of such a strategy. The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility, which could introduce additional risk to MicroStrategy's financial performance. Moreover, the company's increasing focus on bitcoin may impact its core business operations and could be a point of concern for investors who are more interested in the company's traditional business analytics software offerings.The fact that the notes are being offered through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers and are not registered under the Securities Act suggests a targeted approach to raising funds, which may exclude smaller investors and could potentially concentrate ownership among larger institutional entities. Cryptocurrency Analyst MicroStrategy's continued investment in bitcoin is a significant development within the cryptocurrency space, as it represents one of the largest and most public endorsements of bitcoin by a NASDAQ-listed company. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy may influence the perception of bitcoin's legitimacy and stability as an investment asset, potentially affecting the cryptocurrency market.However, this strategy also exposes the company to the regulatory and market risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. The lack of regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, potential for increased scrutiny from financial regulators and the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies are factors that could impact MicroStrategy's financial stability. The company's ability to navigate these risks while maintaining a balance with its core business operations will be critical for its long-term success.Furthermore, the conversion feature of the notes ties the company's stock performance directly to the cryptocurrency market, which could lead to a complex dynamic between the company's stock price, bitcoin price movements and investor sentiment. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM TYSONS CORNER, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MicroStrategyÂ® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) (âMicroStrategyâ) today announced the pricing of its offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of 0.875% convertible senior notes due 2031 (the ânotesâ). The notes will be sold in a private offering to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the âSecurities Actâ). MicroStrategy also granted to the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $78.75 million aggregate principal amount of the notes. The offering was upsized from the previously announced offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The offering is expected to close on March 18, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The notes will be unsecured, senior obligations of MicroStrategy, and will bear interest at a rate of 0.875% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The notes will mature on March 15, 2031, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. Subject to certain conditions, on or after March 22, 2028, MicroStrategy may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of MicroStrategy class A common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period of time ending on the trading day immediately before the date the notice of redemption is sent. If MicroStrategy redeems fewer than all the outstanding notes, at least $75 million aggregate principal amount of notes must be outstanding and not subject to redemption as of the relevant redemption notice date. Holders of notes may require MicroStrategy to repurchase their notes on September 15, 2028 or upon the occurrence of certain events that constitute a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with certain corporate events or if MicroStrategy calls any note for redemption, it will, under certain circumstances, be required to increase the conversion rate for holders who elect to convert their notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption. The notes will be convertible into cash, shares of MicroStrategyâs class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of MicroStrategyâs class A common stock, at MicroStrategyâs election. Prior to September 15, 2030, the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods, and thereafter, at any time until the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 0.4297 shares of MicroStrategy class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2,327.21 per share. The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 40% over the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategyâs class A common stock from 9:30 a.m. through 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday, March 14, 2024, which was $1662.1999. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. MicroStrategy estimates that the net proceeds from the sale of the notes will be approximately $515.0 million (or approximately $592.3 million if the initial purchasers exercise in full their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasersâ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes. The notes are being offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The offer and sale of the notes and the shares of MicroStrategyâs class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the notes and any such shares may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements. The offering of the notes is being made only by means of a private offering memorandum. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy the notes, nor shall there be any sale of, the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

We stand by our March 13th press release and urge all of our fellow shareholders to reject the Boardâs intimidation tactics, which are evidently geared to silencing vocal investors.

New listings and active listings are up, with the highest levels in months. Home prices continue to rise due to supply. Mortgage rates are climbing, impacting home sales. Redfin reports positive trends in housing supply and prices in February 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The recent data from Redfin indicates a shift in the housing market dynamics, with new listings and active listings showing signs of recovery. This is an important development for the economy, as housing is a significant component of gross domestic product (GDP) and consumer spending. The increase in supply, if sustained, could help to moderate the rapid price growth seen in recent years, potentially easing inflationary pressures. However, the uptick in mortgage rates could dampen demand, leading to a more balanced market but also potentially slowing down economic growth if housing sales decline significantly.Furthermore, the regional differences highlighted, with Texas and Florida leading in new and active listings, suggest that local economic conditions and state-specific factors such as building regulations and population growth trends are influencing the housing supply dynamics. This uneven recovery could have implications for regional economic performance and inter-state migration patterns. Real Estate Market Analyst The data presents a nuanced picture of the housing market. While the year-over-year increase in new listings is the largest since May 2021, the overall supply remains below pre-pandemic levels. This suggests that while the 'lock-in effect'âwhere homeowners are reluctant to sell due to low mortgage ratesâis beginning to ease, it is not yet resulting in a supply sufficient to fully meet pent-up demand.The robust price growth, with the median U.S. home sale price experiencing the biggest increase in nearly a year and a half, reflects this imbalance between supply and demand. In markets like Seattle, where a significant share of homes go under contract within two weeks, the competitive environment persists. This could indicate a seller's market in certain areas, despite the national trends towards increased supply. Financial Analyst From an investment perspective, the housing market's current trajectory could have mixed implications for businesses and the stock market, particularly for companies in the real estate, construction and mortgage industries. While increased housing supply and steady price growth could signal stability and opportunities for real estate companies, the elevated mortgage rates could suppress homebuyer demand, potentially affecting the revenue streams of mortgage lenders and homebuilders.Investors should monitor the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions closely, as these will influence mortgage rates and, by extension, the housing market's performance. The report's mention of mortgage-purchase applications sliding in February correlates with the uptick in mortgage rates, underscoring the sensitivity of the housing market to interest rate fluctuations. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Housing supply is finally rebounding as sellers get used to elevated mortgage rates, but itâs not rebounding enough to curb home price growth. High housing costs mean many house hunters remain hesitant to commit. SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NASDAQ: RDFN) â New listings jumped 3.8% month over month on a seasonally adjusted basis in February to the highest level since September 2022, according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. They were up 14.8% year over year, the largest annual gain since May 2021. Active listings, or the total supply of homes for sale, hit the highest level in a year. They climbed 0.8% from a month earlier on a seasonally adjusted basis, and were little changed (-0.1%) from a year earlierâthe smallest annual decline in months. New listings rose fastest from a year earlier in Texas and active listings rose fastest in Floridaâthe two states that have been building the most homes. In Florida, condo listings in particular are contributing to the jump in supply amid a surge in HOA and insurance fees. âThe housing market is nothing like it was two years ago during the pandemic homebuying frenzy, but itâs better than it was last year. Itâs coming back,â said David Palmer, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in Seattle. âSellers who were on the fence in 2023 are now listing. Theyâre more used to elevated rates now. There still arenât enough listings to quench pent-up buyer demand, but itâs getting better.â Nationwide, housing supply is on the rise because the âlock-in effectâ is easing; eventually, homeowners who have been holding on to their ultra-low mortgage rates simply have to move. âFebruary was a mixed bag for the housing market and the economy,â said Redfin Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao. âHousing supply is finally starting to recover in a meaningful way, which is great news for buyers who for months have been competing for a tiny pool of homes for sale. Still, many house hunters are hesitant to pull the trigger because mortgage rates and home prices remain elevated.â Mortgage-purchase applications slid in February as mortgage rates ticked back up after dropping in December. The average 30-year-fixed mortgage rate was 6.78% last month, up from 6.64% in January. Mortgage rates will likely remain elevated a bit longer than expected after this weekâs inflation report came in hotter than anticipated. Home sales rose 0.5% month over month on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, and fell 3.5% year over year. Home Prices Post Biggest Increase in Nearly a Year and a Half The median U.S. home sale price climbed 6.6% year over yearâthe biggest uptick since September 2022âto $412,778. Please note that home price data is not seasonally adjusted, which is why Redfin focuses on year-over-year changes for this metric. Prices continue to rise because despite the recent uptick in listings, thereâs still not enough supply to meet demand. Both new listings and active listings remained far below pre-pandemic levels in February. âIf you price your home reasonably, buyers will show up. If you donât, buyers will wait for you to drop the price,â Palmer said. âI recently listed an estate sale fixer upper for $550,000 and it got 14 offers, sold for $75,000 over the asking price and the buyer waived every contingency.â In Seattle, 77.4% of homes that went under contract did so within two weeksâthe highest share among the metros Redfin analyzed. It took the top spot from Rochester, which has held that title for months. The typical home that went under contract in Seattle did so in 11 days (versus a national median of 48 days).

The drug has the potential to benefit 40,000 to 80,000 patients annually, with a global market potential of $4 billion USD.","Lantern Pharma Announces Initial Patients Dosed in First-In-Human Clinical Trial for AI-Guided Drug-Candidate, LP-284 Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial AI Rhea-AI Summary Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN) announces dosing of first two patients in Phase 1 clinical trial for LP-284, a potential therapy for non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma and solid tumors. LP-284 is the second synthetic-lethal molecule from Lantern, with AI playing a crucial role. The drug has the potential to benefit 40,000 to 80,000 patients annually, with a global market potential of $4 billion USD. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for LP-284 is significant for the oncology community, particularly for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and solid tumors. The drug's mechanism, being synthetically lethal in DNA damage repair deficient cancers, targets a niche yet critical vulnerability in cancer cells. The potential patient population benefitting from LP-284 is considerable, given the high relapse rates in aggressive NHL subtypes like mantle cell lymphoma.Furthermore, the AI-driven approach to drug development could represent a paradigm shift in oncology therapeutics. The reduced time and cost to reach clinical trials, as reported for LP-284, could lead to more rapid availability of treatments and potentially lower costs for the healthcare system. However, it is essential to remain cautious as the efficacy and safety of LP-284 are yet to be established in clinical settings and the true impact on patient outcomes will only be known after further trials. Medical Research Analyst From a research and development perspective, Lantern Pharma's use of AI and machine learning to expedite the drug development process is noteworthy. The reported timeline and budget for bringing LP-284 to human trials are well below industry norms, which typically span several years and require significant financial investment. This efficiency could lead to a competitive advantage and potentially disrupt traditional drug development models.However, investors should consider that Phase 1 trials primarily focus on safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics, rather than efficacy. The market potential of $4 billion USD for LP-284 hinges on successful clinical outcomes and eventual FDA approval, which are uncertain at this stage. It is also critical to monitor how LP-284's biomarker signatures will perform in patient selection, as this will be a key factor in the drug's efficacy and market penetration. Market Research Analyst Assessing the market potential for LP-284, the estimated $4 billion annual market opportunity in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presents a lucrative prospect for Lantern Pharma. This figure aligns with the high prevalence of NHL and the unmet need for effective treatments in relapsed or refractory cases. The AI and ML platform, RADRÂ®, could be a strategic asset in identifying additional indications for LP-284, potentially expanding its market reach.However, the pharmaceutical market for cancer treatments is highly competitive, with several companies investing in similar targeted therapies. The success of LP-284 will not only depend on its clinical outcomes but also on how it differentiates from existing and upcoming therapies. Market adoption will also be influenced by the drug's cost-effectiveness, reimbursement policies and integration into existing treatment protocols. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM LP-284 is in a Phase 1 clinical trial, having been developed with guidance from Lanternâs AI platform, RADRÂ®, as a potential therapy for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma and other solid tumors. LP-284 is the second of Lanternâs synthetic-lethal franchise of molecules that have been shown to be synthetically lethal in DNA damage repair deficient cancers and has entered into first-in-human clinical trials. LP-284 is the third drug candidate brought to clinical trials by Lantern Pharma using AI, machine learning and computational biology approaches. Lantern estimates that LP-284 can have the potential to improve outcomes for 40,000 to 80,000 patients with blood cancers annually, with a global annual market potential of $4 Billion USD. DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lantern Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ: LTRN), an artificial intelligence (AI) company developing targeted and transformative cancer therapies using its proprietary AI and machine learning (ML) platform, RADRÂ®, with multiple clinical stage drug programs, today announced the dosing of the first two patients in the Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating Lanternâs investigational new drug LP-284 in patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkinâs lymphoma (NHL), including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and double hit lymphoma (DHL) and other high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBL) as well as other select solid tumors and sarcomas. Recently, Lantern Pharmaâs AI platform, RADRÂ® is expected to exceed 100 billion data points during 2024, and has been crucial in uncovering and accelerating indications for LP-284 as well as other drug-candidates that are in development. âEnrolling and treating initial patients in our Phase 1 trial for LP-284 is a major milestone and underscores the commitment of our team to advancing our pipeline of AI-driven therapies to patients,â stated Panna Sharma, Lantern's President and CEO. âWe believe LP-284 has unique and breakthrough potential for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphomas and certain solid tumors with certain genomic signatures, many of which have no or limited effective therapeutic options.â âLP-284 is a molecule which was advanced from initial concepts through IND-studies, manufacturing, multiple FDA-granted orphan indications, multiple patent filings, as well as presentations at major oncology conferences and into humans in a timeline and cost structure that is typically unheard of for a novel oncology-focused molecule. This milestone validates our unique approach of leveraging AI and machine learning to expedite cancer drug development,â said Sharma. âInsights from our proprietary AI and ML platform, RADRÂ®, were instrumental in our development of LP-284 and aided in understanding its mechanism of action, identifying and prioritizing its cancer indications, and generating machine learning biomarker signatures to assist with patient selection in future clinical trials. We have been able to expedite its journey from a concept to a first-in-human clinical trial in a highly efficient and cost-effective manner - less than 3 years and under $3 million - underscoring the power and potential of our AI platform RADRÂ® to accelerate oncology drug discovery and development.â The open-label Phase 1a/1b multicenter Phase 1 trial (NCT06132503) is evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of LP-284 and determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) lymphomas and solid tumors. The secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LP-284 and to assess clinical activity of LP-284. Patients will be enrolled and treated with LP-284 administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day schedule. The study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation with MTD and/or RP2D confirmation (Phase 1a) and dose expansion (Phase 1b). Up to 30 patients will be enrolled in Phase 1a; the total number of patients will depend on the number of dose levels explored. Additionally, Lantern may enroll up to 40 patients in each of the two cohorts of MCL and HGBL (including DLBCL) tumors in Phase 1b. NHL is the leading hematological malignancy in the US and remains one of the leading causes of cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 500,000 new cases annually worldwide. Despite advances in NHL using combination and targeted therapies, nearly 20% to 40% of patients with certain subtypes still relapse after treatment. In aggressive subtypes of NHL, like MCL, nearly all patients relapse from standard-of-care (SOC) therapies. Globally, the annual market potential of LP-284 in NHL is estimated to be approximately $4 billion USD. About LP-284: LP-284 is a novel small molecule with a synthetically lethal mechanism of action that preferentially damages cancer cells that harbor mutations in DNA damage repair pathways. Lanternâs LP-284 program has been accelerated and focused using AI insights and biological modeling powered by RADRÂ®.

(Nasdaq: JSPR) announces positive Phase 1b/2a data on briquilimab for Fanconi Anemia treatment. All six patients achieved full donor engraftment and blood count recovery. Briquilimab shows promising safety profile and tolerance in FA patients. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings on briquilimab's efficacy in treating Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients are significant within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. Full donor engraftment and blood count recovery in all six patients indicate a potential breakthrough in non-toxic conditioning regimens for stem cell transplants. Considering the rarity and complexity of FA, a disease that leads to bone marrow failure and a predisposition to cancer, advancements in treatment can have profound implications. The safety profile and tolerability are key factors that could influence the drug's adoption and market penetration. The data may suggest a competitive edge for Jasper Therapeutics in the niche market of FA treatments, potentially impacting the company's valuation and investor interest. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the positive outcomes of the briquilimab clinical trial could have a noticeable effect on Jasper Therapeutics' stock performance. The biotech sector is often driven by clinical trial results, which can lead to significant stock volatility. Successful Phase 1b/2a trials typically lead to increased investor confidence and can be a precursor to strategic partnerships or additional funding. It's essential to monitor the subsequent phases of clinical trials to gauge the long-term financial impact. The company's ability to navigate the FDA approval process and address a market with unmet medical needs will be important in determining future revenue streams and growth potential. Healthcare Industry Analyst Within healthcare, the development of treatments for rare diseases like FA is closely watched. The positive clinical trial results for briquilimab may have broader implications for stem cell transplantation techniques and other mast cell driven diseases. The current standard of care for FA involves high-risk procedures with significant toxicity, so a non-toxic alternative could disrupt current treatment paradigms. This innovation may lead to increased demand for Jasper's therapy, affecting supply chains and healthcare provider practices. The long-term impact could include shifts in treatment standards and reimbursement policies, influencing the overall healthcare market. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Three additional patients with Fanconi Anemia treated with briquilimab prior to stem cell transplantAll six patients with Fanconi Anemia treated with briquilimab achieved full donor engraftment and full blood count recovery and briquilimab was well tolerated REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jasper Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: JSPR) (Jasper), a biotechnology company focused on development of briquilimab, a novel antibody therapy targeting c-Kit (CD117) to address mast cell driven diseases such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU), announced additional positive Phase 1b/2a data on briquilimab as a conditioning agent in the treatment of Fanconi Anemia (FA). The data was presented at the 2024 Stanford Medicine Center for Definitive and Curative Medicine Symposium on March 13, 2024, in Palo Alto, California. The ongoing investigator initiated Phase 1b/2a clinical trial is evaluating a conditioning regimen that includes intravenous briquilimab as a potential treatment for FA patients in bone marrow failure. Data from the study show that briquilimab infusion has a promising safety profile and appears to be well tolerated in patients with FA, with all six patients treated achieving full donor engraftment and full blood count recovery. âWe continue to be encouraged by the results from Stanford Medicine's Phase 1b/2a study in Fanconi Anemia, which demonstrates the potential of briquilimab to serve as a key component of non-toxic conditioning regimens for stem cell transplant,â said Edwin Tucker, Chief Medical Officer of Jasper. âWeâd like thank our collaborators at Stanford Medicine for their work evaluating briquilimab in this vulnerable patient population.â About Briquilimab Briquilimab (formerly JSP191) is a targeted aglycosylated monoclonal antibody that blocks stem cell factor from binding to the cell-surface receptor c-Kit, also known as CD117, thereby inhibiting signaling through the receptor. This inhibition disrupts the critical survival signal, leading to the depletion of the mast cells via apoptosis which removes the underlying source of the inflammatory response in mast cell driven diseases such as chronic urticaria. Jasper is currently conducting clinical studies of briquilimab as a treatment in patients with CSU or with CIndU. Briquilimab is also currently in clinical studies as a treatment for patients with LR-MDS and as a conditioning agent for cell and gene therapies for rare diseases. To date, briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in more than 145 dosed participants and healthy volunteers, with clinical outcomes as a conditioning agent in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), FA, and sickle cell disease (SCD). About Fanconi Anemia Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare but serious blood disorder that prevents the bone marrow from making sufficient new red blood cells. The disorder can also cause the bone marrow to make abnormal blood cells. FA typically presents at birth or early in childhood between five and ten years of age. Ultimately, it can lead to serious complications, including bone marrow failure and severe aplastic anemia. Cancers such as acute AML and MDS are other possible complications. Treatment may include blood transfusions or medicine to create more red blood cells, but a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is currently the only cure. About Phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT04784052) The Stanford sponsored, investigator initiated Phase 1/2 study is an open-label clinical trial evaluating briquilimab as a potential treatment for FA patients in bone marrow failure (BMF) requiring allogeneic transplant. Utilizing briquilimab, the regimen eliminates the need for busulfan chemotherapy or total body irradiation. Participants with FA with BMF receive allo-HCT with TCRÎ±Î²+ T-cell/CD19+ B-cell depleted hematopoietic grafts from 10/10 unrelated, 9/10 unrelated or haploidentical family donors. A 0.6 mg/kg dose of briquilimab is administered in combination with standard FA dosing of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and rituximab as lymphodepletion. The primary outcomes include safety, efficacy, and engraftment success. About Jasper Jasper is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing briquilimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting c-Kit (CD117) as a therapeutic for chronic mast and stem cell diseases such as chronic urticaria and lower to intermediate risk MDS and as a conditioning agent for stem cell transplants for rare diseases such as SCD, FA and SCID. To date, briquilimab has a demonstrated efficacy and safety profile in more than 145 dosed participants and healthy volunteers, with clinical outcomes as a conditioning agent in SCID, acute myeloid leukemia, MDS, FA, and SCD.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst BlackRock's introduction of the iShares S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (IVVW) and the iShares Russell 2000 BuyWrite ETF (IWMW) represents a strategic expansion in their product offerings, directly targeting income-seeking investors. The use of a covered call strategy, where call options are sold on the underlying indices, is a conservative approach to generating income. This strategy typically appeals to investors who are seeking yield in a low-interest-rate environment or those who anticipate moderate growth in the underlying stocks.The expense ratios for IVVW and IWMW, at 0.25% and 0.39% respectively, are competitive within the ETF space and investors would do well to compare these costs with potential returns. The monthly distribution of call option premiums, in addition to quarterly dividends, may offer a steady income stream, which is particularly attractive during volatile market periods or when traditional fixed-income yields are low.However, it's important to note that while covered call strategies can provide income, they limit upside potential since the option buyer may exercise the call, requiring the fund to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. Investors should balance the desire for immediate income against the possibility of foregoing significant gains if the market rallies. Market Research Analyst BlackRock's launch of these ETFs is indicative of the evolving demand for income diversification and the growing interest in options-based strategies. The ETFs' design to offer a monthly income stream through call options is a response to the investor's appetite for alternative income sources beyond traditional bonds and dividend stocks. The choice between the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices allows investors to tailor their exposure to their market capitalization preferences, with IVVW focusing on large-cap equities and IWMW on small-cap equities.Market trends show a heightened interest in outcome-oriented strategies, as investors look to manage risk while seeking returns. BlackRock's derivative investing expertise and their extensive lineup of financial products position them to capitalize on this trend. The success of these ETFs will depend on their ability to deliver the promised income and manage the risks associated with selling options. Investors will likely monitor the performance of these ETFs closely to determine if they meet their income and risk management goals. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Target enhanced monthly income with an exchange traded fund utilizing a covered call strategy on either U.S. large-cap or small-cap equities NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BlackRock today announced the launches of the iShares S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF (Cboe: IVVW) and the iShares Russell 2000 BuyWrite ETF (Cboe: IWMW), which seek to generate an attractive monthly income and help investors diversify their income sources. The ETFs provide access to a differentiated source of income by selling monthly call options on their underlying indices â in addition to receiving dividend income â in a single-ticker solution. The Funds expand BlackRockâs outcome-oriented strategies, joining a lineup which includes fixed income BuyWrite and buffer ETF strategies, among others. âIncome remains top of mind as investors move out of cash and prepare for a shift in monetary policy,â said Rachel Aguirre, Head of U.S. iShares Product at BlackRock. âThese equity BuyWrite ETFs simplify access to a well-known options strategy for investors seeking to capture enhanced income opportunities in the US equity market.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting www.iShares.com or www.blackrock.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. A BuyWrite Strategy ETFâs use of options may reduce returns or increase volatility. During periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Underlying Fund may be unable to maintain positive returns. Very low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk. In a falling interest rate environment, the ETF may underperform the Underlying Fund. By writing covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums, the ETF will give up the opportunity to benefit from increases in the value of the Underlying Fund but will continue to bear the risk of declines in the value of the Underlying Fund. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses sustained from the volatility of the Underlying Fund over time. The ETF will be subject to capital gain taxes, ordinary income tax and other tax considerations due to its writing covered call options strategy.

(EGIO) expects Q4 2023 revenue of $93-$95 million with a cash balance of $47 million. The company's focus on innovation and fiscal discipline drives sustained shareholder value creation. Despite a delayed annual report due to a change in auditors, Edgio showcases strong financial and operational performance, including significant cost savings and new client wins. Positive Strong Q4 2023 revenue projection of $93-$95 million. Robust cash balance of approximately $47 million as of December 31, 2023. Operationalized run-rate cost savings of around $84 million by the end of 2023. Significant growth in bookings, with Security/Applications bookings nearly doubling in the second half of 2023. Received $50 million in new financing in November 2023 and exchanged 95% of 2025 Convertible Notes for New 2027 Convertible Notes. Launched enterprise-level Protect and Perform Applications Bundles, winning the 'Overall Web Security Solution of the Year' award. Expectation to file a notification of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the SEC for the Annual Report due to a change in auditors. Engaged a new independent registered public accounting firm in January 2024. Obtained a waiver for delayed reporting through June 30, 2024, from lenders under its senior secured credit facility. Negative Delayed annual report filing due to change in auditors. Potential additional interest under senior secured convertible notes if SEC filings are not made by May 14, 2024. Financial Analyst The preliminary revenue forecast of Edgio, Inc. for Q4 2023, ranging between $93 and $95 million, along with the Adjusted EBITDA projection, suggests a company navigating through a challenging financial landscape. The increase in cash reserves from $27.6 million in Q3 to roughly $47 million by year-end indicates a strengthened liquidity position, likely bolstered by the $50 million of new financing received in November 2023. However, the anticipated Adjusted EBITDA of negative $2 million to breakeven points to underlying operational challenges. The significant growth in bookings, particularly in the Security/Applications sector, reflects a potentially robust demand for the company's offerings, which could translate into future revenue streams.Investors should note the operationalized run-rate cost savings of approximately $84 million, which aligns with the company's forecasted range and demonstrates a commitment to optimizing the cost structure. Such cost containment measures, if sustained, could improve profitability in the long term. The exchange of 95% of 2025 Convertible Notes for New 2027 Convertible Notes also indicates a restructuring of debt that may provide more financial flexibility in the medium term. However, the delay in the annual report due to the auditor change adds an element of uncertainty and could impact investor sentiment until the audited financials are available. Market Research Analyst Edgio's strategic focus on market-leading solutions across Security/Applications and Media, leveraging its global edge network, positions the company to capitalize on the growing demand for cybersecurity and content delivery services. The new client wins, including a major Korean ecommerce company and a large fashion ecommerce company in China, signal an expansion of Edgio's market presence in Asia, a region with high growth potential in e-commerce and digital services.The launch of the Protect and Perform Applications Bundles could represent a competitive advantage by offering a comprehensive package that addresses the increasing complexity of web security and performance needs. Recognition in the form of an award for 'Overall Web Security Solution of the Year' may enhance the company's brand reputation and could lead to increased market share.From a market perspective, the delayed annual report and the change in the auditor could raise concerns among investors regarding transparency and financial governance. While the waiver obtained from lenders shows some level of confidence from creditors, the potential for additional interest on senior secured convertible notes if SEC filings are delayed past May 14, 2024, could be a point of concern for debt investors. Legal Expert The filing of Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting a 15-day extension for the annual report, is a regulatory compliance aspect that investors must consider. The resignation of the previous independent registered public accounting firm and the subsequent engagement of a new one could be a routine change, but it also may indicate deeper issues that could surface later. The delay in the audit completion and the subsequent late filing of the 2023 Form 10-K could lead to legal and regulatory scrutiny.Investors should be aware of the implications of not meeting the extended deadline, including the potential for additional interest obligations and the impact on investor confidence. The waiver from lenders provides temporary relief, but it is not a permanent solution to the challenges posed by delayed financial reporting. The legal ramifications of these delays, including potential SEC inquiries or investor lawsuits, should be monitored closely. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Expects Preliminary Q4 2023 Revenue of $93 - $95 Million Total Cash and Cash Equivalents Balance of Approximately $47 Million as of December 31, 2023 Annual Report Delayed due to Change in Auditor PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Edgio, Inc. (Nasdaq: EGIO) (the âCompanyâ), today announced unaudited financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Todd Hinders, CEO, said, âCustomer focus and a steadfast commitment to innovation and fiscal discipline are drivers of sustained shareholder value creation. At Edgio, we have built a solid foundation with market leading solutions across Security/Applications and Media, leveraging our highly performant global edge network. Our strong and differentiated technological foundation combined with focused go-to-market motions, improving unit economics, and optimized cost structure gives me confidence in our ability to drive profitable growth.â Unaudited Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights: Based on information currently available to the Company for the fourth quarter 2023, the Company expects: Q4 2023 revenue in the range of $93-$95 million and Adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $2 Million to breakeven. Bookings in the second half of 2023 grew more than 30% versus the first half with Security/Applications bookings growth almost doubling in the same period. Operationalized run-rate cost savings at end of 2023 of approximately $84 million, within the expected range of $80 - $90 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance as of December 31, 2023, of approximately $47 million, versus $27.6 million as of September 30, 2023. Q4 2023 capital expenditures of approximately $5 million or $2.5 million, net of proceeds from financing receivables. In addition, in November 2023, the Company received approximately $50 million of new financing, net of transaction costs and fees, and exchanged 95% of 2025 Convertible Notes for New 2027 Convertible Notes. The financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, included in this release are preliminary, have not been reviewed or audited, are based upon the Companyâs estimates, and were prepared prior to the completion of the Company's financial statement close process. As a result, these preliminary financial results could be subject to change as the Companyâs independent registered public accounting firm completes its audit of these periods. These limited preliminary financial results should not be viewed as a substitute for the Companyâs full fourth quarter results and do not present all information necessary for an understanding of the Companyâs financial performance as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on this preliminary data. Business Highlights: New client wins over the last few months include a major Korean ecommerce company, a domestic fashion label, the Asian subsidiary of a major hardware company, a domestic auto-parts ecommerce company, and a large fashion ecommerce company in China. Launched enterprise-level Protect and Perform Applications Bundles, combining web performance, full-spectrum web security suite and Security Operations Center (SOC) support services â all in a single, comprehensive package. Won âOverall Web Security Solution of the Yearâ award in the 7th annual CyberSecurity Breakthrough Awards program conducted by CyberSecurity Breakthrough. Files Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission: The Company also announced today that it expects to file a notification of late filing on Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the Companyâs Annual Report for 2023 on Form 10-K (âAnnual Reportâ), which provides an automatic 15-day extension of the filing deadline for the Annual Report to April 1, 2024. As previously disclosed, on December 18, 2023, the Company received notice that the Companyâs previous independent registered public accounting firm had decided to resign as independent registered public accounting firm of the Company, effective that day. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company accepted the resignation and engaged in a thorough search for a new independent registered public accounting firm, and on January 26, 2024, the Company entered into an engagement with a new independent registered public accounting firm. The onboarding of a new audit team takes considerable time as the new audit firm familiarizes itself with the Companyâs accounting and financial processes. Due to the engagement of a new independent registered public accounting firm in the first quarter of 2024, which is late in the normal auditing process, the completion of the Companyâs public company audit is delayed, and the Company does not expect the audit to be completed in time to file the 2023 Form 10-K on or before the extended deadline. The Company is working diligently to complete and file the 2023 Form 10-K as soon as practicable. The Company has obtained a waiver from the lenders under its senior secured credit facility related to delayed reporting through June 30, 2024. The Company may incur certain additional interest under its senior secured convertible notes if its SEC filings are not made on or before May 14, 2024. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To evaluate its business, the Company considers and uses non-generally accepted accounting principles (ânon-GAAPâ), including Adjusted EBITDA as contained in this press release, as supplemental measures of operating performance. EBITDA is defined as U.S. GAAP net loss, adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest and other (income) expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude share-based compensation, restructuring charges, acquisition and legal related expenses, and expenses related to the 2023 restatement and other significant non-recurring gains or losses. These measures include some of the same adjustments management considers when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period-to-period basis. The Companyâs management uses these non-GAAP financial measures because, collectively, they provide valuable information on the performance of the Companyâs on-going operations and assist management in making decisions regarding the Companyâs strategic priorities and areas for future investment and focus. The Company believes these measures also provide similar insights to investors and enable investors to review the Companyâs results of operations âthrough the eyes of management.â The terms EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and are not measures of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Companyâs operating performance, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Companyâs cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; This measure does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Companyâs working capital needs; This measure does not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs, including provision for litigation and litigation expenses; This measure does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the Companyâs debt; This measure does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; While share-based compensation is a component of operating expense, the impact on the Companyâs financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of the Companyâs common stock; and Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Companyâs U.S. GAAP financial results and using Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental support for managementâs analysis of business performance. Because the preliminary Adjusted EBITDA ranges presented in this release represent the Companyâs expectations with respect to the final financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023, these forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are presented without reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure because these GAAP figures cannot be reconciled at this time due to ongoing closing and auditor review and without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including amounts that, based on historical experience, could be material. The Company believes these open GAAP financial items could affect items that would be adjusted for, and therefore do not affect the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking, including statements regarding the Companyâs financial condition, anticipated financial performance, achieving profitability, business strategy and plans, market opportunity and expansion and objectives of the Companyâs management for future operations.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The partnership between Jack Henry and the ICBA, particularly the inclusion of new tools like Banno Business and JHA SmartPay RDN, is strategically significant for community banks. These tools allow these institutions to enhance their digital offerings, which is critical in a banking landscape increasingly dominated by tech-savvy consumers and fintech competitors. Improved digital experiences and operational efficiencies can lead to increased customer satisfaction and retention, potentially translating into higher revenues and a stronger competitive position in the market.From a financial perspective, the adoption of Synergy Document Management and Centurion Data Backup and Recovery could lead to cost savings. These savings come from reduced need for physical storage and increased operational efficiency, which could improve the banks' bottom line. Moreover, such enhancements in information security could mitigate risks associated with data breaches, thereby reducing potential costs from security incidents. Market Research Analyst Jack Henry's ongoing relationship with the ICBA as a Preferred Service Provider and the recent additions to their service offerings reflect an understanding of the evolving market demands. Community banks are seeking to differentiate themselves not just through customer service, but also through technology. By providing modern digital banking experiences and improving operational efficiencies, Jack Henry is positioning itself as an essential partner for these institutions.It's important to note that as community banks adopt these technologies, they could see an uptick in their appeal to small-to-medium sized businesses, a segment that often requires personalized services combined with the convenience of digital tools. This could lead to market share growth within this niche and broaden the customer base for community banks. Information Security Expert The emphasis on information security tools and disaster recovery processes is a response to the increased cyber threats facing the financial industry. By integrating Centurion Data Backup and Recovery, community banks can enhance their resilience against data loss and system outages, which is vital for maintaining customer trust and regulatory compliance.

The Company's CEO highlights progress in clinical studies and regulatory approvals, emphasizing the potential of their innovative opioid products. Positive Significant progress made by Ensysce in 2023 operationally and clinically for lead pain therapeutic PF614 and overdose protection product PF614-MPAR. FDA grant of Breakthrough Therapy designation to PF614-MPAR in January 2024. Completion of successful End of Phase 2 meeting with FDA regarding PF614. Publication of clinical evaluation results for PF614 in Clinical and Translational Science journal. Reduction in abuse potential of PF614 compared to OxyContin demonstrated in clinical studies. Ensysce's financial results show a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, federal grants, R&D and G&A expenses, and net loss compared to the previous year. Corporate update conference call scheduled for March 21, 2024, to discuss recent milestones and financial results. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results announced by Ensysce Biosciences indicate a significant reduction in net loss from $25.1 million in the full year of 2022 to $10.6 million in 2023. This improvement in net loss is primarily attributed to a decrease in research and development expenses, which dropped from $19.8 million to $7.6 million year-over-year. The reduction in R&D expenses could signal a transition from early to later stages of clinical trials, which often involve higher initial costs associated with setup and recruitment. However, the company's cash position decreased from $3.1 million at the end of 2022 to $1.1 million at the end of 2023, raising concerns about its ability to fund ongoing and future operations without securing additional financing.From an investor's perspective, the exercise of warrants contributing to cash proceeds of $6.8 million in early 2024 is a positive development, providing the company with a necessary cash infusion. Nonetheless, the low cash reserves relative to the company's burn rate may necessitate further capital raising efforts, which could result in dilution for existing shareholders. The company's financial performance suggests a need for careful monitoring of its cash flow management and potential future funding requirements. Medical Research Analyst Ensysce's announcement of the FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for PF614-MPAR is a pivotal milestone for the company. Breakthrough Therapy status is granted to drugs that may offer substantial benefits over existing therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions. This designation can lead to expedited development and review processes, potentially shortening the time to market. For stakeholders, this could mean a faster path to revenue generation from this product, assuming successful completion of clinical trials and regulatory approval.Furthermore, the PF614 product's bioequivalence to existing opioids, coupled with reduced abuse potential, positions it as a compelling candidate in the fight against the opioid epidemic. The use of TAAP technology to deter abuse is a novel approach that could differentiate PF614 in the competitive pain management market. If the Phase 3 clinical trials, set to commence in the second half of 2024, yield positive results, Ensysce could capture a significant share of the opioid market with a safer alternative, subject to FDA approval. However, the long-term impact will depend on the drug's clinical efficacy, safety profile and market acceptance post-launch. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The opioid epidemic in the United States represents a substantial market for safer pain management solutions. Ensysce's advancement of PF614 and PF614-MPAR through clinical trials addresses a critical need for opioids with reduced risk of abuse and overdose. The market potential for these products is significant, given the high demand for effective pain relief that also mitigates the risks associated with opioid use.The company's strategic positioning with TAAP and MPAR technologies could disrupt the opioid market by offering a unique value proposition. However, market penetration will hinge on successful Phase 3 trial outcomes, regulatory approval and effective commercialization strategies. It is essential to consider the competitive landscape, including other pharmaceutical companies that may be developing similar abuse-deterrent formulations. The breakthrough designation by the FDA certainly boosts the company's prospects, but actual market impact will be determined by the product's performance in clinical trials and subsequent adoption by healthcare providers and patients. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Corporate Update Call to be Held Thursday, March 21, 2024 at 11:00am ET to Discuss Recent FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Phase 3 Clinical PlansSAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 15, 2024 / Ensysce Biosciences, Inc. (""Ensysce"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:ENSC), a clinical-stage company applying transformative chemistry to improve prescription drug safety, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, Chief Executive Officer of Ensysce, commented, ""We are proud of the significant progress Ensysce has made in 2023 both operationally and clinically for our lead pain therapeutic, PF614, and our overdose protection product, PF614-MPAR. Our advancements were particularly instrumental in providing a foundation for our constructive end of Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for PF614. We believe the FDA's guidance positioned Ensysce favorably and solidified the PF614 Phase 3 clinical study designs to initiate enrollment in the second half of 2024, ultimately reducing regulatory risks that could impede our commercialization plan. Especially encouraging was the FDA grant of Breakthrough Therapy designation to PF614-MPAR in January 2024, acknowledging its unique advantage over current opioids. Breakthrough Therapy, an exclusive designation applied to less than 300 drugs historically, offers Ensysce the opportunity to accelerate our clinical programs and go-to market plans.""""Importantly, the collective empirical data we've received from four completed clinical studies verify PF614's bioequivalence to commercially available opioids but with reduced abuse potential, and reaffirms our belief that Ensysce's PF614 will provide a ""next generation"" opioid family with the added value proposition of safer products with overdose protection. We have many reasons to remain optimistic on our path to regulatory approval as we advance through our Phase 3 clinical trials beginning in the second half of 2024. Progress in 2023 and early 2024 has provided further evidence that our innovative analgesics will provide prescribers and patients in severe pain with an alternative, effective option with safety advantages to address the opioid epidemic in the United States,"" concluded Dr. Kirkpatrick.TAAPTM (Opioid Abuse Deterrent Program) UpdatesOur lead product, PF614, is a Trypsin-Activated Abuse Protection (TAAPTM) extended-release oxycodone and a potential ""next generation"" analgesic for severe pain. The Company's TAAPTM technology is designed to control release, be highly resistant to tampering, and reduce abuse through a unique chemical modification. PF614's TAAPTM modification makes it inactive until it is swallowed, following which it is activated or âturned on' to release oxycodone by the body's own trypsin, an enzyme in the small intestine. Ensysce recently completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for PF614, received FDA guidance on the strategy and design of its Phase 3 clinical program and expects to commence enrollment for the Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2024. Ensysce believes it has a body of evidence showing that PF614 works as designed, has a good safety profile and is bioequivalent to OxyContin providing strong efficacy, yet reduced abuse potential.As a reaffirmation of the Company's belief in the efficacy of PF614, on February 15, 2024, the Company announced the online publication of its manuscript entitled, ""Clinical evaluation of PF614, a novel TAAPTM prodrug of oxycodone, versus OxyContinÂ® in a multi-ascending dose study with a bioequivalence arm in healthy volunteers"" by the open-access medical journal Clinical and Translational Science (CTS) sponsored by the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (ASCPT). The results from the two-part PF614â102 study demonstrate a clear dose relationship between PF614 and oxycodone, which is the foundation for the FDA submission.As previously mentioned, on January 31, 2024, the Company completed a successful End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA regarding PF614 and received guidance on its non-clinical development approach and clinical development plans.Instrumental to the meeting was the PF614-201 study, ""A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Study of PF614 on Analgesic Response in the Cold Pressor Test in Healthy Male Subjects"" that concluded in December 2023. This study measured the time-of-onset of pain-relief in healthy volunteers and showed that Ensysce's TAAPTM chemical approach delivers effective analgesia. This study was a meaningful component of the Company's Phase 3 clinical protocol design and a driver of the positive outcome with the FDA.MPARÂ® (Opioid Abuse Deterrent and Overdose Protection Program) UpdatesPF614-MPAR is a combination product of the TAAP prodrug PF614 with a trypsin inhibitor, designed to treat severe pain while providing overdose protection. MPARÂ® (Multi-Pill Abuse Resistance) reduces or âturns off' the release of the opioid to prevent an overdose, providing an additional layer of protection to Ensysce's TAAPâ¢ medications. Over the past year, clinical data demonstrated that the MPARÂ® technology reduces release and absorption of oxycodone from PF614 when consumed in more than a prescribed dose.Importantly, in January 2024, Ensysce received notice from the FDA that it had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for PF614-MPAR, acknowledging the potential impact of the innovative MPARÂ® overdose protection technology. Breakthrough Therapy is an elite designation that expedites the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies.In February, the Company received additional productive guidance from the FDA to aid the design of our PF614-MPAR programs to efficiently move toward a new drug application (NDA) submission and approval to bring this innovative drug to market.Financial ResultsCash - Cash and cash equivalents were $1.1 million as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $1.5 million as of September 30, 2023. After year end, the Company received cash proceeds of $2.1 million from the exercise of warrants, originally issued in the fourth quarter of 2023, to purchase 1.3 million shares of common stock. Additionally, in February 2024, the Company received gross proceeds of $4.7 million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses, from the exercise of warrants to purchase 3.6 million shares of common stock originally issued in May 2023.Federal Grants - Funding under federal grants totaled to $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $1.4 million in the comparable year ago quarter. For the full year of 2023, funding from federal grants was $2.2 million compared to $2.5 million for the full year of 2022. The decreases are due to the timing of research activities eligible for funding, particularly relative to the MPARÂ® program.Research & Development Expenses - R&D expenses were $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2022. For the full year of 2023, R&D expenses were $7.6 million compared to $19.8 million for the full year of 2022. The decreases were primarily the result of reduced external research and development costs related to the clinical programs for PF614 and PF614-MPAR, particularly regarding bioequivalence and human abuse potential studies for PF614.General & Administrative Expenses - G&A expenses were $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, a slight increase compared to $1.2 million for the same period of 2022. For the full year of 2023, G&A expenses were $5.4 million, a decrease compared to $6.9 million for the full year of 2022. The quarterly increase from the same prior year period was primarily a result of higher non-cash stock-based compensation, while the full year decrease resulted from reduced consulting, legal, liability insurance and employee bonus expenses.Other Income (Expense) - Total other income (expense), net was an expense of $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to income of $0.7 million for the same period of 2022. For the full year, total other income (expense), net was income of $91,912 in 2023 compared to income of $14,410 in 2022. The changes in other expenses were primarily due to non-cash fair value adjustments for convertible notes and warrants.Net Loss - Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.5 million compared to $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year of 2023, net loss was $10.6 million compared to $25.1 million for the full year of 2022. As a clinical stage biotech company, our continued research and development efforts toward regulatory approvals for our product candidates are expected to result in losses for the foreseeable future.Corporate Update Conference CallEnsysce CEO, Dr. Lynn Kirkpatrick, CFO, Dave Humphrey, and CMO, Dr. William Schmidt, will host a conference call on Thursday, March 21, 2024, at 11:00am ET to provide a corporate update and review recent company milestones.

(PRPH) reports financial and operational results for 2023, highlighting significant capacity expansion and growth at Pharmaloz Manufacturing. Nebula Genomics secures major international B2B deal, while Pharmaloz accelerates capacity expansion. The Company transitions to a genomics lab, anticipates rapid revenue growth, and plans a conference call on March 15, 2024. Positive Pharmaloz Manufacturing enhances capacity by over 50%, with plans to triple and potentially quadruple production capabilities by 2025. Nebula Genomics shifts focus to whole genome sequencing, secures international B2B agreement with MenaDNA, and anticipates additional distribution deals. BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test and Equivir show promising results, with plans for commercialization in 2024. Financial results for 2023 show a decrease in net revenue, gross profit, and net income compared to 2022, primarily due to reduced COVID-19 testing volumes. ProPhase Labs undergoes strategic pivot to cutting-edge genomics lab, positioning for exponential growth and significant B2B agreements. Negative Net revenue for 2023 decreased by 63.1% compared to 2022, with a significant drop in diagnostic services revenue. Gross profit decreased by $54.4 million in 2023 compared to 2022, with lower margins for both diagnostic services and consumer products. Net loss for 2023 was $16.8 million, in contrast to a net income of $18.5 million in 2022. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash decreased to $2.1 million in 2023 from $9.1 million in 2022, impacting working capital. Market Analyst The information provided indicates ProPhase Labs has made strategic moves that could potentially reshape its market position and financial outlook. The expansion of Pharmaloz Manufacturing's capacity, with projections to triple its production capability, is a substantial development. This expansion is likely to address the current shortage in lozenge manufacturing capacity, which could lead to increased demand for ProPhase's services. The installation of new automation equipment and the acquisition of significant new customers suggest a positive trajectory for revenue and profit growth.Additionally, the transition of ProPhase from a clinical lab to a whole genome sequencing lab is noteworthy. The investment in cutting-edge genomics technology and the signing of a major international B2B deal with MenaDNA, Inc. positions Nebula Genomics to capture a larger share of the growing genomics market. The potential for this subsidiary to generate significant revenue and the mention of other deals in the final negotiation stages could be of particular interest to investors. Financial Analyst The financial results for ProPhase Labs show a decrease in net revenue year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in COVID-19 testing volumes. However, the increase in consumer products revenue and the strategic pivot towards genomics and manufacturing capacity expansion could offset this decline in the long term. The company's ability to secure a low-interest rate mortgage on the Pharmaloz plant and the partial sale of an investment for $3.6 million demonstrates financial prudence.Looking at the gross margin, there is a notable decrease in diagnostic services, which could be a concern. However, the focus on high-margin business lines, such as the anticipated launch of the BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test and Equivir, may improve profitability. The financial restructuring, including securitizing receivables and increasing collections, suggests management is actively working to improve the company's liquidity position. Biotech Industry Analyst The shift from clinical diagnostics to genomics is a strategic realignment with the industry's trajectory towards personalized medicine. The acquisition of new genome sequencing machines and the creation of an automated workflow for high-throughput sequencing could place ProPhase Labs at the forefront of genomic diagnostics. The BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test's development and the potential to receive insurance reimbursement codes indicate progress towards commercialization, which is a critical milestone for biotech companies.Furthermore, the interim results from Equivir's trials suggest a positive outcome and the planned ramp-up in production aligns with the company's goal of commercialization in the second half of 2024. The ability to leverage an established retail network for distribution could facilitate rapid market penetration and revenue growth for this product. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM Nebula Genomics secures major international B2B deal â Additional significant B2B deals in final stages Ahead of schedule, Pharmaloz Manufacturing accelerates capacity expansion â set for rapid revenue and profit growth Completes full transition and right sized operation in Q4 from clinical lab to cutting edge genomics lab Company to hold a conference call Friday March 15, 2024, at 11:00 AM ET Garden City, NY, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProPhase Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ: PRPH) (âProPhaseâ or the âCompanyâ), a next-generation biopharma, genomics, and diagnostics company, today reported its financial and operational results for the full-year ended December 31, 2023. The end of 2023 marked a period of significant capacity expansion and growth for Pharmaloz Manufacturing Inc. (PMI) as well as a pivotal transformation for the Company, transitioning from a clinical laboratory framework to a leader in whole genome sequencing. There is a significant shortage of lozenge manufacturing capacity in both the U.S. and globally. The Company is now in late-stage negotiations with four major lozenge brands. All are short manufacturing capacity and need a reliable FDA approved manufacturer. PMI recently acquired cutting-edge automation equipment and, with other operating efficiencies, is set to escalate plant capacity by over 50% immediately, raising annual production capability from below $10 million to over $15 million. The installation of a second lozenge production line and further automation in Q2 2024 are projected to approximately triple capacity entering Q3 to a $45 million potential run-rate (an increase from previous Company guidance of $30-35 million). Additional equipment set to arrive by Q4 2024 could increase annual production capabilities in the first half of 2025 to a range of $80-$100 million (also an increase from earlier guidance). Regarding Nebula Genomics, given the positive reception at major genomics conferences during 2023 and demand for whole genome sequencing, management determined that the opportunity for its business was so significant that it shifted significant laboratory resources to whole genome sequencing and eliminated certain legacy clinical lab initiatives, including equipment and personnel. During this transformative phase to right size and focus the laboratory operations, ProPhase faced numerous one-time charges, including more than $2.4 million in startup costs. It also equipped Nebula Genomics with four platforms of state-of-the-art technology. With this significant repositioning completed, Nebula Genomics can now deliver low-cost, high-precision genomic diagnostics across North America and the global market. Depending on market conditions, our ability to generate enhanced revenues, and other factors, the Company anticipates that there will be a significant sequential improvement in revenues and EBITDA going forward, driven by strategic advancements across its subsidiaries. Key recent developments include: Nebula Genomics has marked a milestone with the execution of an international revenue generating business-to-business (B2B) agreement with MenaDNA, Inc. This agreement presents the possibility for significant expansion of its global footprint and paves the way for prospective future revenue streams. Several additional and meaningful distribution arrangements, both domestically as well as internationally, are anticipated during the next few months, if not sooner, but cannot be assured. Our Pharmaloz Manufacturing subsidiary has significantly increased its production capabilities with the addition of new automation equipment and additional equipment to be installed in the coming months. With the recent acquisition of significant new customers, recent price increases and potential additional major deals on the near-term horizon, the Company is already experiencing a dramatic increase in both revenues and profits, which the Company expects to continue as the year progresses subject to market conditions and other factors. The BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test and the dietary supplement Equivir are both anticipated to be in commercialization in the coming months and may provide significant contributions to both the top and bottom line in the second half of 2024. Participants can register for the virtual conference call by navigating to: https://www.renmarkfinancial.com/events/fourth-quarter-year-end-2023- results-virtual-conference-call-nasdaq-prph-2024-03-15-110000 Additional corporate highlights and recent positive developments, include the following: 1)Nebula Genomics âAnalyzes greater than 99% of human DNA compared to typical ancestry tests that analyze less than 1%. âHas a world-class, proprietary bioinformatics platform to provide deep genetic health information, rare genetic mutations plus ancestry at highly competitive prices. âData protected by world-class cyber security. âSigned a major international business to business agreement with MenaDNA, a large, well-placed distribution company that will enable us to grow our presence globally. âOn the verge of signing another major long-term international agreement that, if signed, could represent an initial $10-$20 million in annual revenues. Additional significant agreements are also currently in the final negotiation stages. âAcquired a second high-capacity whole genome sequencing machine and are currently creating an optimized automated workflow to ensure high throughput low fail genomic sequencing runs. âThe second high-capacity machine brings our total low pass (1X WGS) throughput potential to over 2 million specimens per year equating to $150-$200+ million in potential revenue capacity. âHired several key industry veterans and streamlined existing clinical laboratory personnel. âBegan offering genetic counseling to our direct consumer customers. 2)Pharmaloz Manufacturing âGenerated revenues of just over $9 million in 2023. Due to better-than-expected efficiencies resulting from recently installed automation equipment, capacity estimates are increased from $30 million to now $45 million in revenues once the second lozenge line is installed entering Q3 2024. Capacity estimates are expected to increase from a range of $60-$80 million to $90-$100 million with estimated 20-25% pre-tax net profit margins once the third and fourth lozenge lines are installed in the first half of 2025. âThere is a significant shortage of lozenge manufacturing capacity in both the U.S. and globally. The Company is now in late-stage negotiations with four major lozenge brands. All are short manufacturing capacity and need a reliable FDA approved manufacturer. âThe Company estimates that to build a new manufacturing facility from scratch with the capacity that Pharmaloz will have next year might cost $100+ million and take 5+ years to complete with FDA approvals. And of course, this would not include customers. âRecently announced the signing of two significant deals representing over $5 million in additional revenues per year. Manufacturing has already begun for the first of these deals. Both deals could expand significantly in the future. âEngineering completed the design of phase 1 and phase 2 plans to take the plant from 1 lozenge line to a potential of up to 7 operational lines within the next four years and a potential of over $250 million in annual capacity. âNew liquid fill equipment ahead of schedule for delivery in Q2 allowing for new higher margin business lines. âExisting customers accepted an average increase of 15.2% for production beginning in 2024. âPassed the 3-year FDA audit with no citations. 3)BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer Test âCompleted additional samples which are currently being analyzed by Stat King, a division of Genesis Drug Discovery and Development, in order to further validate the 90%+ sensitivity and specificity of the BE-Smart Esophageal Cancer test. âCommercialization discussions continue with multiple potential global partners. âCompany on track to commercialize BE-Smart in the second half of 2024. âDevelopment on track with goal to receive Current Procedural Terminology (âCPTâ) codes in mid- 2024 for insurance reimbursement. âWorking in collaboration with CDx Diagnostics to analyze multiple samples from individual patients in order to continue to perfect the multistage prediction algorithm. âWorking in conjunction with multiple groups to fully develop the âadvanced traffic lightâ approach of green, yellow, orange, and red to assess distinct levels of cancer risk, leading to optimized treatment approaches. This approach may lead to insurance companies mandating the use of the BE-Smart test for endoscopies performed on Barrettâs Esophagus patients. âOn track to assess RNA Seq data confirming the presence of the 8 major proteins discovered by the BE-Smart cancer test that are patent protected. Also, in the process of confirming the lack of meaningful expression of other proteins currently used as the gold standard. Ultimately, this will further support BE-Smartâs potential advantage vs. all existing competing technologies. 4)Equivir Â·Completed enrollment of over 329 patients with last patient starting at the beginning of the 2024. Â·Released impressive interim results from 152 patients at the 90-day mark. Â·Out of the total number of upper respiratory incidents, 68% were in the placebo group vs only 32% in the Equivir group. Â·Initial data was better than initially expected with the full data set anticipated to be available by the end of June 2024. Â·Pharmaloz is planning to ramp up production of the Equivir capsules with a second half 2024 launch timeframe. Â·Currently working with our distribution partner to leverage distribution in over 40,000 food, drug and mass retail stores. 5)Other financial highlights Â·Q4 2023 secured a low interest rate mortgage on the Pharmaloz plant. Subsequent to year-end 2023: Â·Realized over $3.6 million on the partial sale of an investment. Â·Raised over $2.5 million by securitizing a small portion of outstanding receivables. Â·Increased monthly accounts receivable collections with current collection partner. Ted Karkus, ProPhase Labâs Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""In Q4, ProPhase Labs made a strategic pivot, transitioning from a clinical lab to a cutting-edge whole genome sequencing (WGS) lab, marking a significant turning point in our journey. This shift, while costly, has positioned us on a trajectory for exponential growth. We divested our clinical lab equipment to upscale our WGS capabilities, believing we now possess the nation's most advanced WGS technology. This move not only sets us apart in a competitive landscape marked by operational and security challenges but also aligns with our vision to meet the burgeoning global demand for our services. This transition is already paying dividends with a significant B2B agreement in place and more anticipated to follow in the coming weeks and months. Furthermore, over the last six years, Nebula Genomics has compiled extensive whole genome data from 120+ countries, revealing a hidden and valuable asset that we are eager to update shareholders further in the coming weeks. This underscores our commitment to innovation and our potential to transform global health insights while continuing to build significant underlying value in our Company. Pharmaloz, once an undeveloped asset, has emerged as a powerhouse in the lozenge industry, driven by unprecedented demand. Our collaboration with a top engineering firm has enabled a scalable expansion plan, increasing our production capacity significantly without the need for additional labor. This strategic growth, coupled with cutting-edge automation, is set to redefine Pharmaloz's market position, offering substantial value to our stakeholders, high margin revenue and opening avenues for several strategic opportunities. ProPhase Biopharma has seen remarkable progress, particularly with the BE-Smart technology, which stands to revolutionize gastrointestinal diagnostics and treatment if successful. Our advancements in this area underscore our commitment to innovation and patient care. The promising interim results from Equivir's trials highlight its potential to significantly impact respiratory health, with plans already underway for a widespread commercial launch. Our established retail network will play a crucial role in making Equivir accessible to a broad audience. As we move forward, our focus remains on driving value across all subsidiaries, with a clear vision of realizing and maximizing shareholder value. The strategic initiatives and operational advancements in Q4 have laid a solid foundation for future growth. With the current capacity expansions and revenue acceleration at Pharmaloz Manufacturing, I believe that this subsidiary alone, later this year, may be worth more than the entire current market cap of the Company. In parallel, the value of Nebula Genomics should grow considerably in the coming quarters as our B2B initiatives take shape and potentially accelerate revenues in the coming quarters. Suffice it to say, the outlook for ProPhase Labs has never been more promising."" Financial Results December 31, 2023 compared with December 31, 2022 Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased $77.4 million, or 63.1%, to $45.2 million compared to $122.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net revenue was the result of a $83.5 million decrease from diagnostic services, and a $6.1 million increase from consumer products. The decrease in net revenue for diagnostic services was due to decreased COVID-19 testing volumes compared to the 2022 period as a result of the highly contagious Omicron variant, which emerged in early 2022. Overall diagnostic testing volume decreased from approximately 1,000,000 tests for the year ended December 31, 2022, to approximately 480,000 tests for the year ended December 31, 2023, of which 29% were reimbursed by the HRSA uninsured program for the year ended December 31, 2022, and none were reimbursed from the HRSA uninsured program for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $29.0 million, comprised of $11.8 million for diagnostic services and $17.2 million for consumer products. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $52.0 million comprised of $39.9 million for diagnostic services and $12.1 million for consumer products. We realized a gross profit of $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $70.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $54.4 million was comprised of a decrease of $55.4 million in diagnostic services, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in consumer products. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 we realized an overall gross margin of 35.9% and 57.6%, respectively. Gross margin for diagnostic services was 52.6% and 63.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gross margin for consumer products was 15.6% and 15.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gross margin for consumer products have historically been influenced by fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter production volume, fixed production costs and related overhead absorption, raw ingredient costs, inventory mark to market write-downs and timing of shipments to customers. Diagnostic expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $1.9 million as compared to $12.0 million of diagnostic expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in diagnostic expenses of $10.1 million was primarily due to was due to decreased COVID-19 testing volumes for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 as a result of the Omicron variant, which emerged in early 2022. General and administration expenses increased $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $34.5 million, as compared to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in general and administration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was was principally related to an increase in personnel expenses, marketing and professional fees associated with the Company's strategic initiatives. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The increase in research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was principally due to increased activities at ProPhase BioPharma. These activities include product research and field testing. As a result of the effects described above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $16.8 million, or $(0.98) per share, as compared to a net income of $18.5 million, or $1.17 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $(0.98) and $1.02, respectively. Our aggregate cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2023, were $2.1 million as compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2022. Our working capital was $26.7 million and $44.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease of $7.0 million in our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to (a) the proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of $3.8 million, (b) the proceeds from the maturities of marketable debt securities of $4.2 million, (c) the proceeds for issuance of notes payable and mortgage loan of $10.5 million, and (d) the proceeds from warrant exercise of $1.2 million, offset by (i) $11.3 million cash used in operating activities, (ii) the asset purchase of Stella of $2.9 million, (iii) repurchase of common shares for payment of statutory taxes due on cashless exercise of options for $5.4 million, (iv) repurchase of common shares for $0.6 million, (v) purchase marketable debt securities of $3.8 million, and (vi) capital expenditures of $3.2 million.

In an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our results of operations as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (âGAAPâ), we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures. The primary non-GAAP financial measures we disclose are EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts EBITDA by excluding acquisition costs, other non-cash items, and other unusual or non-recurring charges (as described in the table below). Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate and manage the Companyâs operations because we believe they provide useful supplemental information regarding the Companyâs ongoing economic performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that are not considered part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and in providing estimates of future performance and that failure to report these non-GAAP measures could result in confusion among analysts and others and create a misplaced perception that our results have underperformed or exceeded expectations. The following table sets forth the reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA excluding other costs to the most comparable GAAP financial measures (in thousands): For the years ended (unaudited) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 GAAP net income (1) $(16,782) $18,463 Interest, net 1,197 611 Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (6,018) 4,445 Depreciation and amortization 6,277 4,718 EBITDA (15,326) 28,237 Share-based compensation expense 4,560 3,986 Non-cash rent expense (2) 117 236 Bad debt expense 91 6,163 Adjusted EBITDA $(10,558) $38,622 (1) We believe that net income is the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that is most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measure the Companyâs operating performance without regard to certain expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and the Companyâs computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from others in the industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Companyâs results as reported under GAAP. (2) The non-cash portion of rent, which reflects the extent to which our GAAP rent expense recognized exceeds (or is less than) our cash rent payments. For newer leases, our rent expense recognized typically exceeds our cash rent payments, while for more mature leases, rent expense recognized is typically less than our cash rent payments.

Applied Digital Announces Agreement to Sell Garden City Campus to Marathon Digital Holdings,2024-03-15T12:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Applied Digital  (APLD) announced the sale of its 200 MW campus in Garden City, TX to Marathon Digital Holdings for a net purchase price of $87.3 million, focusing on strategic HPC sites in North Dakota. The transaction will release $12 million of restricted cash and is expected to close in Q2 2024.","Applied Digital Announces Agreement to Sell Garden City Campus to Marathon Digital Holdings Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Applied Digital (APLD) announced the sale of its 200 MW campus in Garden City, TX to Marathon Digital Holdings for a net purchase price of $87.3 million, focusing on strategic HPC sites in North Dakota. The transaction will release $12 million of restricted cash and is expected to close in Q2 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of Applied Digital Corporation's 200 MW campus to Marathon Digital Holdings for a net purchase price of $87.3 million represents a strategic move that has several financial implications. Firstly, the immediate liquidity boost from the sale will enhance Applied Digital's balance sheet, potentially improving creditworthiness and investor confidence. The release of $12 million of restricted cash further alleviates financial constraints, offering more operational flexibility.From a valuation perspective, the transaction's impact on Applied Digital's stock will depend on market perception of the deal's fairness and the company's future earnings potential without the Garden City campus. A well-received sale could lead to a positive re-rating of the stock as it may signal management's confidence in the profitability and growth prospects of their remaining assets.For Marathon, acquiring a significant customer's facility could lead to cost savings and operational synergies, given their existing colocation hosting agreement. This move could be seen by investors as a strategic consolidation, potentially driving Marathon's stock performance positively if the market believes the acquisition will lead to enhanced earnings. Market Research Analyst The High-Performance Computing (HPC) market is highly competitive, with significant capital and operational expenditure requirements. Applied Digital's decision to focus on strategic sites in North Dakota suggests a targeted approach to capitalize on specific market opportunities within the HPC sector. By consolidating operations, the company may aim to optimize its service offerings and improve its competitive edge.Market trends indicate an increasing demand for HPC solutions, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain technologies. Applied Digital's strategic pivot could be interpreted as an alignment with these trends, positioning the company to better meet future demand. However, the success of this strategy will hinge on the company's ability to enhance its operational efficiency and the performance of its data centers post-divestiture.On the other hand, Marathon's expansion through this acquisition may indicate an aggressive growth strategy in the blockchain hosting space. Investors should monitor how this acquisition integrates with Marathon's existing operations and whether it can capture additional market share in the blockchain mining sector. Blockchain Industry Expert Applied Digital's sale of its Garden City campus, which provides hosting for blockchain mining clients, to Marathon Digital Holdings is a significant development within the blockchain infrastructure industry. The transaction highlights the increasingly strategic nature of physical assets in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly as it pertains to mining operations.Marathon's acquisition of the campus where it already operates under a colocation hosting agreement suggests a vertical integration strategy to control more of the mining infrastructure stack. This could potentially lower costs and improve Marathon's mining efficiency. For the broader industry, this move may signal a trend towards consolidation as companies seek to optimize their operations in response to the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets.Investors should consider the potential for increased operational control and cost efficiencies against the backdrop of fluctuating cryptocurrency prices and regulatory developments. The long-term success of such investments is closely tied to the stability and growth of the blockchain sector, which remains subject to significant market and regulatory risks. 03/15/2024 - 08:00 AM â¢ Divestiture Reflects Strategy to Focus on Strategic HPC Sites in North Dakota â¢ Redirects Resources and Strengthens Balance Sheet DALLAS, March 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital Corporation (Nasdaq: APLD) (""Applied Digital"" or the ""Company""), a designer, builder, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure designed for High-Performance Computing (âHPCâ) applications, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its 200 megawatt (""MW"") campus in Garden City, TX to Marathon Digital Holdings (Nasdaq: MARA) (âMarathonâ) for a net purchase price of approximately $87.3 million, with a gross purchase price of $97.3 million after adjustments contemplated in the purchase agreement. In addition to the purchase price, this transaction will release $12 million of restricted cash previously committed as collateral for the site's letter of credit. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of calendar 2024.

Applied Digital exclusively focuses on infrastructure and support services and does not currently own any equipment placed in the facility. Marathon has been a significant customer at the Garden City campus, operating under a multi-year colocation hosting agreement, and will remain a customer at our North Dakota blockchain hosting facilities.

With a focused emphasis on the building of our HPC data centers, we reinforce our groundwork for enduring growth and operational excellence,"" said Wes Cummins, CEO and Chairman of Applied Digital.

Personal data is handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation (European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) 2016/679). For full information regarding the Companyâs handling of personal data, please refer to our privacy policy: https://www.olink.com/about- us/integrity-policy/. To be entitled to participate in the Meeting a shareholder whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee must, in addition to providing notification of participation, register its shares in its own name so that the shareholder is recorded in the share register on Thursday 11 April 2024. Such registration may be temporary (so-called voting right registration) and is requested from the nominee in accordance with the nomineeâs procedures and such time in advance as the nominee determines. Voting right registrations completed not later than Monday 15 April 2024 are taken into account when preparing the share register. The Company intends to enable shareholders to participate electronically via link. It should then be noted that such a procedure presupposes that the Meeting first approves that pre-registered persons participate via link. In the case of participation via link, there is no support for managing the voting register, which means that if participants via a link actively want to influence the Annual General Meetingâs decision, this must be done by proxy to a person who physically participates in the Annual General Meeting. If there are registered persons on Monday, 15 April 2024 that wish to participate via link, the Company will send out an invitation with instructions on how to join the Annual General Meeting electronically. OPPORTUNITY FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO EXERCISE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS THROUGH PROXY Shareholders who do not wish to attend the meeting in person may authorize a proxy to exercise their voting rights. The power of attorney is proposed to be presented to the Chairman of the Meeting or another person whom the shareholder knows will attend the Annual General Meeting. If the power of attorney is exhibited to the Chairman of the Meeting, the power of attorney must be combined with a voting instruction so that the Chairman of the Meeting knows how to vote under the various decision points. If the power of attorney is not combined with a voting instruction, then the Chairman will not be able to represent the shareholder at the meeting. In other cases, the power of attorney should also be combined with a voting instruction. If participation will be by proxy, the shareholder shall issue a written, signed and dated proxy together with any documents verifying authority. Proxies for legal entities must also be accompanied by a certificate of incorporation or equivalent document verifying authority. A copy of the proxy, the voting instruction and any certificate of incorporation should, in advance, before the meeting be sent to the Company at the above address. The original proxy shall, if applicable, also be presented at the meeting. The Company provides the shareholders with proxy forms as well as blank voting instructions, which can be obtained at the Companyâs head office or on the Companyâs website www.investors.olink.com by the latest on Wednesday 20 March 2024. Note that the possibility of having a proxy exercise the shareholders' voting rights at the Annual General Meeting presupposes that the shareholder has made a notification and is included in the share register in accordance with what is stated above in the Notice of participation. Thus, it is not enough to just submit a power of attorney form. PROPOSED AGENDA 1. Opening of the Meeting. 2. Election of Chairman to preside over the Meeting. 3.

PROPOSAL BY THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDERS WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTIONS UNDER ITEMS 15 15. Resolution regarding incentive program (âLTI I 2024â) Background and reasonsThe Company has previously implemented long term incentive programs for the years of 2021, 2022 and 2023. In view of this, the majority shareholders propose that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the board members in the Company (âLTI I 2024â). The proposal to implement an incentive program has been put forward as the majority shareholders determines that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders to create even greater participation for current and future board members in the Company with regard to the groupâs development. It is also important to encourage continued commitment. In the light of the above, the majority shareholders propose that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement the incentive program LTI I 2024 in accordance with item (a)â(b) below. The resolutions under item (a)â(b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that all resolutions are to be passed as one resolution. LTI I 2024 is proposed to include up to 8 current and future board members of the Company. Proposal regarding the adoption of LTI I 2024 (item 15 (a)) LTI I 2024 is comprised of restricted stock units (âRSUâ) which will be granted to current and future board members of the Company pursuant to the Olink Holding AB (publ) Amended and Restated 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the âPlanâ), as amended, and an award agreement thereunder to be entered into between the Company and each recipient evidencing each such grant and terms under the Plan. On 14 March 2024, the Board adopted, subject to the approval of the Companyâs shareholders, an amendment to the Plan, which will become effective on the date of its approval by the Companyâs shareholders, which will occur upon approval by the Companyâs shareholders of LTI I 2024 and LTI II 2024 as described herein. The purpose of the amendment to the Plan is to increase the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Plan in order to ensure that there is a sufficient number of shares available for grant pursuant to LTI I 2024 and LTI II 2024 as described herein. The majority shareholders propose that the general meeting resolves to issue not more than 70,000 warrants of series I 2024 in order to secure delivery of either shares, warrants of series I 2024 or American depository shares in the Company (âADSâ) upon exercise of RUSs to participants in LTI I 2024. The right to subscribe for the warrants of series I 2024 shall vest in the Company. The Company shall keep warrants of series I 2024 to ensure delivery of shares, warrants of series I 2024 or ADS upon exercise of RSUs in LTI I 2024. Each warrant of series I 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series I 2024 shall be issued without consideration to the Company. Below is a description of the terms and conditions for the LTI I 2024. A copy of the Plan can be found at https://investors.olink.com/annual-general-meeting and shareholders are advised to review the actual terms of the Plan. LTI I 2024 â Restricted stock units (with warrants as hedging arrangement) Within the scope of LTI I 2024, the Company may grant participants RSUs, entailing the right to, subject to certain conditions being met, receive either a share, warrant of series II 2024 or an ADS free of charge or to an exercise price equal to the quota value of the CompanyÂ´s share, at the time of exercise of the RSU. RSUs may be granted to current and future board members of the Company;The RSUs will be granted without consideration no later than the day before the next Annual General Meeting;The RSUs granted will be subject to time-based vesting requirements â on the date when a portion of the options would vest as a result of the passage of time with the participant remaining board member of the Olink group;The RSUs will vest and become exercisable in equal installments on 7 April 2025, 7 April 2026, 7 April 2027 and 7 April 2028 provided the participant remain a board member of the Olink group at the applicable vesting dates. As a main rule each vesting period shall be twelve (12) months. All granted RSUs will, as a general rule, have vested (if applicable) on 7 April 2028, i.e, a vesting period of four (4) years. In the event that the period between the grant date and the first vesting date is less than ten (10) months for any participant, the Board is entitled to decide on a separate vesting schedule for the participant with conditions substantially equivalent to those set out in this proposed resolution;The RSUs may not be transferred or pledged; andThe terms and conditions for participants in LTI I 2024 granted RSUs may differ between countries due to differences in local legislation, however the terms and conditions shall not be more favorable for participants than what is set out in this resolution proposal. The warrants issued to the Company in order to secure delivery of shares, warrants of series I 2024 or ADS upon settlement of RSUs granted to participants in LTI I 2024 may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, at an exercise price equal to the sharesâ quota value, at the time of exercise. Allocation of RSUs, limitations in the disposition over RSUs and the right to receive RSUs The right to receive RSUs of LTI I 2024 shall vest in current and future board members of the Company. In total, a maximum of 70,000 RSUs may be granted to participants, of which a maximum of 10,000 RSUs may be granted to each participant. Proposal regarding issue of warrants of series I 2024 (item 15 (b)) The majority shareholders proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 70,000 warrants of series I 2024 for subscription of shares, whereby the Companyâs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 170,233.46 at full exercise of warrants for subscription of shares, corresponding to approximately 0.06 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. The right to subscribe for the warrants of series I 2024 shall, with deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights, only belong to the Company, with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants of series I 2024 as described above. The subscription for warrants shall be made up to and including 15 May 2024. Each warrant of series I 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series I 2024 shall be issued without compensation to the Company. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, at an exercise price equal to the sharesâ quota value, at the time of exercise. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI I 2024, the majority shareholders proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign to a third party or in another way dispose of the warrants of series I 2024 in accordance with above. A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants of series I 2024, including complete terms and conditions for the warrants, is set out in Appendix A (including its sub-appendix). Recalculation due to split, consolidation, new share issue etc. The exercise price for warrants in LTI I 2024, determined as set out above, shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10 whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and/or the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may be recalculated in the event of a split or reverse split of shares in accordance with customary re-calculation terms. Costs The RSUs are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the RSUs. According to IFRS 2, the RSUs costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for 70,000 RSUs, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 16.2 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on, inter alia, the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Companyâs share/ADS of USD 22.53, equivalent to SEK 232.03, at the time of grant, based on a USD-SEK exchange rate of 10.2989, (ii) that the maximum number of RSUs encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants, (iii) that all granted RSUs will vest and (iv) that holders of RSUs receive a share, ADS or warrant of series LTI I 2024. Social security costs, which are expected to arise primarily in connection with holders of RSUs receive a share, ADS or warrant of series LTI I 2024, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 4.3 million during the term of the program, based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)â(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 23 per cent and an increase in the market price of the Companyâs share/ADS to USD 26.0. Other costs related to the LTI I 2024, including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors, external appraiser and administration of the incentive program, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 0.5 million during the term of the program. Based on the assumptions set out above, the total costs of the LTI I 2024 are estimated to approximately SEK 21.1 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the total employee benefits expenses of the Olink group, which during the financial year 2023 amounted to SEK 957 million. Motivation in respect of vesting and exercise conditions According to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet fÃ¶r svensk bolagsstyrning), the vesting period, or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised, shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above, RSUs will vest and settled in equal installments on 7 April for four years (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled). The reason for applying such terms, which are not in line with the recommendations of the Swedish Corporate Governance Board as set out above, is that the majority shareholders deem such terms to be in line with market practice for programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in the LTI I 2024 are operative. It is therefore, in the opinion of the majority shareholders of the Company, in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of the LTI I 2024. Dilution Upon exercise of all warrants of series I 2024 issued within the frame of LTI I 2024 for subscription of shares, up to 70,000 shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued, equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.06 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of warrants of series I 2024 for subscription of shares, the Companyâs share capital will increase with SEK 170,233.46. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of RSUs, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company as per 20 February 2024 after such issues. Preparation of the proposal The proposal to the incentive program LTI I 2024 has been prepared by the majority shareholders together with external advisers. No participant of LTI I 2024 has participated in the preparation of this proposal. The reason for the deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights The reason for the deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights is to implement an incentive program for the Board of Directors in the Company. Majority requirement A resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the general meeting. Authorization It is further proposed that the Board of Directors, or a person appointed by the Board of Directors, is authorized to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB and that the Board of Directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the LTI I 2024 and the Plan due to applicable foreign rules and laws. PROPOSAL BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTIONS UNDER ITEMS 9b AND 16-17 9b. Resolution with respect to disposition of the Companyâs result according to the adopted Balance Sheet The Board of Directors proposes that no dividend be paid for the financial year 2023 and that the Company's available funds be capitalized in a new account. 16. Resolution regarding incentive program (âLTI II 2024â - Restricted stock units (with warrants as a hedging arrangement))Background and reasons The Company has previously implemented long term incentive programs for the years of 2021, 2022 and 2023.

The Administrator has discretionary authority to operate, manage and administer the Plan within the parameters set out by the General Meeting, including the power to: designate participants; determine the type or types of awards to be granted to each participant;determine the number of awards to be granted and the number of shares to which an award will relate;determine the terms and conditions of awards, including, but not limited to, the exercise price, grant price, purchase price, any performance criteria, any restrictions or limitations on the award, any schedule for vesting, lapse of forfeiture restrictions or restrictions on the exercisability of an award, and accelerations, waivers, or amendments to awards;determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances an award may be settled in, or the exercise price of an award may be paid in cash, shares, or other property or an award may be canceled, forfeited, or surrendered;establish sub-plans or procedures under the Plan or take any other necessary or appropriate action to address (i) laws, rules, regulations or customs of any foreign jurisdictions with respect to tax, securities, currency, employee benefit or other matters, (ii) listing and other requirements of any foreign securities exchange, and (iii) any necessary local governmental or regulatory exemptions or approvals; and make all other decisions and determinations that may be required pursuant to the Plan or as the Administrator deems necessary or advisable to administer the Plan. The Administrator's decisions and actions concerning the Plan are final and conclusive. Within the limitations of the Plan and applicable law, the Administrator may delegate its responsibilities under the Plan to persons selected by it, and the Board is permitted to exercise all of the Administratorâs powers under the Plan. How many shares can be awarded under the Plan? The maximum number of shares authorized for grant under the Plan is 2,660,303 shares, which represents an increase of the maximum number of shares available for grant under the Original Plan, to take into account the shares available for grant pursuant to LTI programs of 2022 and 2023. The Administrator may adjust the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan to reflect certain changes in the Companyâs capital structure. For purposes of the Plan, a âShareâ means, as determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion: (i) a Common Share, or (ii) a number of American depositary instruments being either American Depositary Shares or American Depositary Receipts of the Company representing one Common Share. Shares underlying awards that are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or expire unexercised would be available for future awards under the Plan. Any Shares that are subject to awards that may only be settled in cash (and any Shares that are subject to an award that is settled in cash in lieu of Shares) will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan. Any Shares withheld or tendered to pay the option price of an option or other purchase price of an award or withholding tax obligation with respect to a stock option will be available for grant pursuant to future awards, as permitted by applicable law. Shares withheld to satisfy withholding tax obligations with respect to and award will not reduce the number of Shares available for grant pursuant to future awards and will be added back to the shares available for future grants. Shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise will be available for future grants under the Plan. If the Company acquires or combines with another company, any awards that may be granted under the Plan in substitution or exchange for outstanding stock options or other awards of that other company will not reduce the shares available for issuance under the Plan. What are the types of awards that may be granted under the Plan? The Plan permits the granting of the following types of awards: (1) stock options that qualify as incentive stock options under the US Internal Revenue Code (the âCodeâ), (2) options other than incentive stock options, which are referred to as non-qualified stock options, (3) stock appreciation rights, granted either alone or in tandem with other awards, (4) restricted stock units,(5) performance stock unit awards, (6) performance bonus awards, (7) other stock-based awards, (8) other cash-based awards and (9) dividend equivalents. How are awards made under the Plan? The Administrator makes all decisions about awards in accordance with the Plan within the parameters set out by the General Meeting, such as the eligible individuals to whom awards are made under the Plan and the sizes and types of awards. The size, type, vesting, forfeiture, exercisability, settlement and other terms and conditions of an award granted under the Plan will be set forth in individual award agreements entered into between the Company and each participant, subject to and consistent with the terms of the Plan. Can the Plan be amended or terminated? The Board may amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan at any time, with or without prior notice, retroactively or otherwise; provided that (i) no amendment requiring shareholder approval to comply with applicable law will be effective unless approved by the Board, and (ii) no amendment, other than an increase to the overall share limit, or adjustments in connection with certain corporate transactions or other events may materially and adversely affect any award outstanding without participant consent. Additionally, no Plan amendment may be made without the approval of the Companyâs shareholders to the extent such approval is required by any applicable law, tax rules, stock exchange rules or accounting rules. The Administrator may amend, modify, or terminate the terms of any outstanding award, including by substituting another award of the same or a different type, changing the exercise or settlement date, and converting an incentive stock option to a nonqualified stock option. Participant consent to such action will be required unless (i) the action, taking into account any related action, does not materially and adversely affect the participantâs rights under such award; or (ii) the change is permitted under the terms of the Plan in connection with certain corporate transactions or other events, or necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Additionally, the Administrator has the authority, without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, to (a) amend any outstanding stock option or stock appreciation right to reduce its exercise price per Share, or (b) cancel any stock option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or another award. Proposal regarding issue of warrants of series II 2024 (item 16 (b)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 849,195 warrants of series II 2024 for subscription of shares, whereby the Companyâs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 2,065,162.94 at full exercise of warrants for subscription of shares, corresponding to approximately 0.68 er cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. The right to subscribe for the warrants of series II 2024 shall, with deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights, only belong to the Company, with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants of series II 2024 as described above. The subscription for warrants shall be made up to and including 15 May 2024. Each warrant of series II 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series II 2024 shall be issued without compensation to the Company. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, at an exercise price equal to the sharesâ quota value, at the time of exercise. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI II 2024, the Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign to a third party or in another way dispose of the warrants of series II 2024 in accordance with above. A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants of series II 2024, including complete terms and conditions for the warrant, is set out in Appendix A (including its sub-appendix). Recalculation due to split, consolidation, new share issue etc. The exercise price for warrants in LTI II 2024, determined as set out above, shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10 whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and/or the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may be recalculated in the event of a split or reverse split of shares in accordance with customary re-calculation terms Costs The RSUs are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the RSUs. According to IFRS 2, the RSUs costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for 849,195 RSUs, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 197.0 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on, inter alia, the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Companyâs share/ADS of USD 22.53 equivalent to SEK 232.03 at the time of grant, based on a USD-SEK exchange rate of 10.2989 (ii) that the maximum number of RSUs encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants, (iii) that all granted RSUs will vest and (iv) that holders of RSUs receive a share, ADS or warrant of series LTI II 2024. Social security costs, which are expected to arise primarily in connection with holders of RSUs receive a share, ADS or warrant of series LTI II 2024, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 52.3 million during the term of the program, based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)â(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 23 per cent and an increase in the market price of the Companyâs share/ADS to USD 26.0. Other costs related to the LTI II 2024, including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors, external appraiser and administration of the incentive program, are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.5 million during the term of the program. Based on the assumptions set out above, the total costs of the LTI II 2024 are estimated to approximately SEK 250.8 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the total employee benefits expenses of the Olink group, which during the financial year 2023 amounted to SEK 957.4 million. Motivation in respect of vesting and exercise conditions According to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet fÃ¶r svensk bolagsstyrning), the vesting period, or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised, shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above, RSUs will vest in equal installments on 7 April for four years and holders of RSUs will receive a share, ADS or warrant, provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled. The reason for applying such terms, which are not in line with the recommendations of the Swedish Corporate Governance Board as set out above, is that the Board of Directors of the Company deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in the LTI II 2024 are operative. It is therefore, in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company, in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of the LTI II 2024. Dilution Upon exercise of all warrants of series II 2024 issued within the frame of LTI II 2024 for subscription of shares, up to 849 195 shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued, equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.68 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of warrants of series II 2024 for subscription of shares, the Companyâs share capital will increase with SEK 2,065,162.94. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of RSUs, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company as per 20 February 2024 after such issues. Preparation of the proposal The proposal to the incentive program LTI II 2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors together with external advisers. The Companyâs board member and CEO Jon Heimer has not participated in the preparations of LTI II 2024. The reason for the deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights The reason for the deviation from the shareholdersâ preferential rights is to implement an incentive program for the members of the group management, key employees, other employees and consultants in the Company and the group. Majority requirement A resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the general meeting.

About Cognition Therapeutics:Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system and retina. We are currently investigating our lead candidate CT1812 in clinical programs in Alzheimerâs disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). We believe CT1812 and our pipeline of Ï-2 receptor modulators can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases. We believe that targeting the Ï-2 receptor with CT1812 represents a mechanism functionally distinct from other current approaches in clinical development for the treatment of degenerative diseases.
