The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased almost 0.4% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares gained ground in the wake of AI updates from its annual developer conference. The gains capped a second-straight winning day for the major gauges.Attention is firmly on the Fed's two-day meeting that began Tuesday morning, seen as a test for stocks bruised by recent inflation surprises that undermined bets on interest-rate cuts coming soon.With policymakers widely expected to keep rates at their historic highs, the focus is on the ""dot plot"" for any clues to the number and timing of any cuts this year. The central bank's policy decision is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan ended its era of negative rates with its first hike in 17 years, making a splash in a week packed with central bank decisions.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued to pull back from its recent record high, falling over 5% at one point. Shares of crypto-linked companies Coinbase (COIN) and Marathon Digital (MARA) lost ground alongside the token.On the corporate front, shares of Unilever (UL) popped after the Ben & Jerry's maker said it would cut jobs and spin off its ice cream unit.Live12 updatesTue, March 19, 2024 at 1:05 PM PDTHamza ShabanStocks rise ahead of Fed decisionInvestors shed earlier losses and embraced optimism on Tuesday, as Wall Street prepared for the Federal Reserve's next policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose close to 0.6%, beating back earlier losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% or more than 300 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased almost 0.4% as Nvidia (NVDA) shares gained ground after the company announced its new flagship AI processor is expected to ship later this year.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 12:15 PM PDTHamza ShabanMicrosoft hires DeepMind founder to lead new AI shiftThe race for AI market share is also playing out in the hiring of key experts.Microsoft announced on Tuesday that DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman is joining the tech giant to form a new organization called Microsoft AI, focused on advancing Copilot and other consumer AI products and research. Several employees from Suleyman's AI startup Inflection are also heading over to Microsoft, as well as Karén Simonyan, co-founder and chief scientist.Suleyman will serve as CEO of the new group, said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. In addition, the company's existing AI units will report to Suleyman, bringing the groups that run Copilot, Bing, and Edge, as well as Microsoft's GenAI team into the same organization.""These teams are at the vanguard of innovation at Microsoft, bringing a new entrant energy and ethos, to a changing consumer product landscape driven by the AI platform shift,"" Nadella said in a note to employees that was published on the company's blog.The move comes as tech giants are scrambling to advance their AI efforts, through new products, research efforts and partnerships.Microsoft's hiring announcement arrives amid reports that Apple (AAPL) is in talks with Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to potentially incorporate Google's ""Gemini"" generative AI engine into its iPhones. Apple had previously engaged in talks with OpenAI for a similar potential partnership.In the note to staff, Nadella said the company's AI innovation continues to build on its ""most strategic and important partnership with OpenAI.""Tue, March 19, 2024 at 11:30 AM PDTHamza ShabanThe effort to ban TikTok faces potential 'graveyard' in SenateAfter a House vote to advance legislation that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner to sell the app or face a US ban, the Senate now stands as the next hurdle in Congress's fight against the platform.But as Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports, the Senate often becomes a key stumbling block in Washington's efforts to confront Big Tech.A possible ban of the popular social-media app is atop the Senate’s agenda as lawmakers return to the nation's capital this week.While bipartisan energy behind any effort to take on China could overwhelm efforts to slow the bill, there are also significant legal issues that senators may not be keen to overlook.What's more, the Senate in past years has served as a flashing red light to other technology reforms that found bipartisan enthusiasm in the House, including data privacy efforts and a move to prohibit tech giants from favoring their own products.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 10:48 AM PDT Josh SchaferMore investors see the possibility of a ""no landing"" scenarioWhile markets have scaled back projections for interest rate cuts this year— and could possibly price in even fewer cuts after the Federal Reserve provides its latest update on monetary policy Tuesday — investors still see the same ending to the Fed's rate hiking cycle.In Bank of America's March Global Fund Manager Survey, 62% of respondents said the most likely outcome for the global economy is a ""soft landing."" Typically, this would mean inflation retreats to the long-term target range without an outright economic downturn.Notably, the 62% projecting a soft landing is lowest level of conviction seen since October (the most recent bottom in US equity markets). But, as seen in the chart below, this isn't because more investors fear a ""hard landing,"" which would bring recession.Instead, an increasing amount of investors see the possibility for a ""no landing"" scenario, where the economy sees both above-trend economic growth and above-trend inflation.This reflects the new growing consensus that any expectations for an economic downturn have gone by the wayside. This, stock market bulls have argued, is the key takeaway on the shifting economic story to start 2024.""What really counts is this resilience that we're seeing in consumer and business and in terms of the jobs numbers,"" Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance Live.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 10:15 AM PDTHamza ShabanStocks trending in afternoon tradingHere are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Tuesday:Nordstrom (JWM): Shares of the retailer jumped more than 11% Tuesday after Reuters reported the company's founding family is seeking to take the US department store private, citing people familiar with the matter.Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): The semiconductor company fell more than 5% in afternoon trading, joining other chip stocks that fell after AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) held its developers conference.Unilever (UL): The consumer goods giant rose 2% to start the trading day after it announced plans to spin off its ice-\ cream business — which includes Ben & Jerry's, Magnum, and Klondike — and a restructuring plan that could impact 7,500 jobs as part of an effort to save more than $800 million over the next three years.Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Shares of the server manufacturer sank 9% after it said it plans to sell 2 million shares. The company plans to use the roughly $2 billion in proceeds to support operations and boost manufacturing capacity. The stock offering comes as Super Micro's shares have skyrocketed this year, more than tripling on the demand for AI technology.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 9:31 AM PDTHamza ShabanStocks turn positive in afternoon trading Investors shifted directions Tuesday afternoon and sent all three major indexes into green territory as Wall Street braced for the Fed's press conference Wednesday and the next indication of where interest rate policy is headed.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, beating back earlier losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6% or more than 200 points, coming off a winning day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed just over the flatline after trading in the red earlier in the day.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 8:45 AM PDTHamza ShabanJapan ends era of negative ratesThe world's last remaining negative interest wait is no more after the Bank of Japan, the final major holdout, put an end to an aggressive monetary stimulus program designed to pull the economy out of a slump.Japan's central bank on Tuesday ended its negative policy rate of minus 0.1% and replaced it with a target range of 0.0-0.1%. The hike, the first in 17 years, marks an end of an era in which major central banks engaged in an unconventional experiment in the aftermath of the global financial crisis to fuel growth.The long-held interest rate policy, along with other measures to inject money into the economy, “have fulfilled their roles,” said Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda.In contrast to the US Federal Reserve, which is expected to begin lowering rates this summer after years of fighting off historic levels of inflation, Japan's central bank has been wrestling with a different problem: the need for growth. Japan suppressed borrowing costs to encourage consumers and businesses to spend, giving the economy a much-needed boost. Inflation has exceeded the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than a year.Media reports earlier this week indicated the move was coming, muting the impact on the market Tuesday. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained close to 0.7% on Tuesday while the dollar held at about 150 yen.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 8:00 AM PDTHamza ShabanHow the realtor settlement could hurt homebuyers The major realtor lawsuit settlement that may free home sellers from heavy commissions could have a negative impact on a group already beleaguered with higher interest rates and elevated home pricers.Homebuyers, squeezed by lack of inventory, could soon be on the hook for paying agent commissions, reports Yahoo Finance's Rebecca Chen.Under the longstanding system, homeowners looking to list their property are typically liable for both seller and buyer commissions. They sign a contract specifying the percentage of the commission split — traditionally each party takes 3%. But if the settlement is approved by a federal judge, the long-standing standard 6% commission would be eliminated and buyers would be responsible for their own agent compensation.Under the new model buyers would have to come up with the money to pay their agent on top of shelling out a down payment, financing, and closing costs.Experts also doubt that the settlement will push home prices downward since economic factors like supply and demand are what’s keeping homes expensive. And as Yahoo Finance's Myles Udland writes, the Fed's crude interest rate policy lever isn't designed to cope with housing affordability either.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 7:15 AM PDTHamza ShabanTrending tickers in morning tradingHere are some of the leaders of Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Tuesday:Unilever (UL): The consumer goods giant rose 2% to start the trading day after it announced plans to spin off its ice cream business — which includes Ben & Jerry's, Magnum, and Klondike — and a restructuring plan that could impact 7,500 jobs as part of an effort to save more than $800 million over the next three years.Bitcoin (BTC-USD): The dominant cryptocurrency is on track to suffer its biggest daily drop in two weeks as investors continue to flee from the token after it recently hit an-all time high. Bitcoin was changing hands at $63,000, a fall of about 7%.Nvidia (NVDA): Fresh off its annual developers conference, the AI darling lost 3% after it unveiled its latest AI chip, which it said is up to 30 times speedier than its predecessor.Super Micro Computer (SMCI): Shares of the server manufacturer sank 11% after it said it plans to sell 2 million shares. The company plans to use the roughly $2 billion in proceeds to support operations and boost manufacturing capacity. The stock offering comes as Super Micro's shares have skyrocketed this year, more than tripling on the demand for AI technology.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 6:34 AM PDTHamza ShabanStocks slide before Fed meetingWall Street pulled back some as Federal Reserve officials began their two-day huddle to decide their next move on interest rate policy.The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flatline, coming off a win on Monday for the major indexes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped about 0.5% as AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) retreated after sharing AI updates from its annual developer conference.Tue, March 19, 2024 at 5:30 AM PDTBrian SozziThe bottom line on NvidiaNvidia's (NVDA) stock didn't do too much on day one of its GTC conference despite an impressive array of new product introductions.But that doesn't mean what the company unveiled was disappointing — quite the contrary! I actually think everything CEO Jensen Huang showed off is so complex, it could take a few days for investors to digest and assess if the stock warrants another push higher.Wall Street was pleased with what they heard.Here's what JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur had to say:""Overall, the team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time. With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, Nvidia is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view. Bottom line: NVIDIA continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.""Tue, March 19, 2024 at 5:15 AM PDTBrian SozziThe AI stock bubble... or notAs Nvidia's (NVDA) GTC conference continues out on the West Coast, it feels natural for BofA's new fund manager survey out today to weigh into the AI stock bubble debate.The end result: Institutional investors have no clue if this is a bubble!Investors can't decide whether AI stocks are in a bubble."
Bloomberg,‘Most-Crowded Trade’ Fuels Rebound in US Stocks: Markets Wrap,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-stocks-look-mixed-ahead-223805733.html,(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders gearing up for Wednesday’s Federal Reserve decision sent stocks higher amid gains in a handful of big techs.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI FeaturesNvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell ChipsEvergrande’s Alleged $78 Billion Fraud Is Among Biggest EverMusk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best InterestsEquities erased,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks, bonds and the dollar saw small moves ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision that will help shape the outlook for interest rates this year.Most Read from BloombergTrump Rules Out Vivek Ramaswamy as Running Mate as He Eyes New TeamApple Is in Talks to Let Google Gemini Power iPhone AI FeaturesNvidia Looks to Extend AI Dominance With New Blackwell ChipsEvergrande’s Alleged $78 Billion Fraud Is Among Biggest EverMusk Says His Ketamine Prescription Is in Investors’ Best InterestsInvestors who were once convinced the Fed would start cutting rates this week are painfully surrendering to a higher-for-longer reality. Treasuries stabilized after a recent slide that saw traders pushing back their timetable for policy easing. Equities edged up as the “Magnificent Seven” cohort of tech megacaps — dubbed the “most-crowded trade” in equities — bounced from session lows.“Investor hesitation comes ahead of this week’s meeting, where the Fed may lean toward a slightly hawkish tone after recent stick inflation data,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,160. Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. advanced, while Nvidia Corp.’s widely anticipated new chips were unable to fuel more gains after an almost 80% surge in the shares this year. Treasuries edged higher. The yen slid as the Bank of Japan refrained from signaling any future hikes after scrapping the world’s last negative interest rate regime.With the Fed expected to hold rates steady for a fifth consecutive meeting on Wednesday, attention will shift to the central bank’s projections in the so-called dot plot.The summary of economic projections will reveal whether still-robust data are giving officials cause to dial back intentions to cut rates — or whether their outlook for three reductions this year remains on track.“Whether the rise in yields and the dollar can continue comes crucially down to whether the Fed validates the hawkish narrative or not,” said Win Thin and Elias Haddad at Brown Brothers Harriman. “If Jerome Powell can stick to the hawkish script, the message will remain consistent and market reaction will likely be limited. If he veers from the script and delivers a dovish tilt, then market reaction will likely be quite violent.”Story continuesMark Cabana at Bank of America said that if the Fed’s dots show only two cuts in 2024, the two-year note will sell off 10 basis points, the dollar will rally and risk assets will “take it on the chin to some extent.”Speaking in a Bloomberg Television interview Tuesday, Cabana said if the dots show three cuts — the base case for BofA economists — the two-year note will then rally five basis points, the dollar will weaken and risk will be on.The Fed will also begin in-depth discussions about its balance sheet this week, including when and how to slow the pace at which the central bank drains excess cash from the financial system.Since 2022, the Fed has been letting as much as $60 billion in Treasuries and as much as $35 billion in agency-backed mortgage debt mature each month and roll off its balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening.“In our view, commentary around plans for the Fed’s balance sheet will be at least as important as remarks around the potential timing of rate cuts,” said Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research. “While we don’t expect an official QT tapering announcement until the May meeting, we’re hoping for color around the potential timing and pace of the wind down.”The Fed has expressed a preference for eventual return to a Treasury-only portfolio — so the MBS runoff pace is expected to continue, though the Fed might be more flexible to extend the timeline, slowing QT, according to Naomi Fink at Nikko Asset Management.“There’s also a bias toward coupon securities, which means the Fed over time has to increase its T-bill holdings relative to its coupon holdings, which all else equal, argues for waning support for the long-end of the curve,” Fink noted.Investors should buy the dip in stocks in case of a setback amid a macroeconomic backdrop of good growth and further inflation normalization, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists.“While equity momentum has somewhat supported broader risk appetite, we see limited implications of a continued reversal barring a material US rate shock,” a team led by Christian Mueller-Glissmann wrote.Bullish positioning softened for US equities last week, according to Citigroup strategists led by Chris Montagu. While S&P 500 and Nasdaq positioning remains net long — and moderately extended — the current setup leaves less positioning risks for both indexes, they noted.Wall Street is so divided on whether the US stock market’s meteoric rise has gone too far, too fast that even Bank of America’s own strategists disagree.There is little evidence that the frenzy for artificial-intelligence is pushing the market into bubble territory, according to BofA’s Savita Subramanian. Her view runs counter to what the firm’s chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett said last week.“There’s no broad spread euphoria,” Subramanian said in a joint interview with Jill Carey Hall, the firm’s head of small- and mid-cap strategy on Bloomberg Television. “The risks are sitting outside of the public market,” adding that private credit and private equity, along with regional banks are where credit risks are bubbling up.Corporate Highlights:Cryptocurrency-linked stocks slipped as Bitcoin extended a retreat following a record daily outflow from the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund for the token.MicroStrategy Inc. made its second multi-million dollar purchase of Bitcoin in a little more than a week, raising the company’s holdings to more than 1% of all the cryptocurrency that will ever be issued.Boeing Co. has been exploring the sale of at least two of its defense businesses, as the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer fights through its biggest crisis in years.Super Micro Computer Inc. is offering to sell 2 million shares of common stock in a public offering that could raise as much as $2 billion.Chevron Corp.’s discussions with Exxon Mobil Corp. and China’s Cnooc Ltd. over a prolific oil field off the shores of Guyana ended “abruptly” a few weeks ago, Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said.SpaceX isn’t making an initial public offering of its Starlink unit a priority at the moment, according to Gwynne Shotwell, the company’s chief operating officer.Siemens AG flagged disappointing demand in China for its key digital industries division.AstraZeneca Plc agreed to buy Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. for as much as $2.4 billion as European drugmakers snap up promising biotech companies.Key events this week:Eurozone consumer confidence, WednesdayFed rate decision; Chair Jerome Powell holds news conference, WednesdayReddit’s IPO, WednesdayECB’s Christine Lagarde speaks, WednesdayEurozone S&P Global Services PMI, S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, ThursdayBank of England rate decision, ThursdayUS Conference Board leading index, existing home sales, initial jobless claims, ThursdayNike, FedEx earnings, ThursdayJapan CPI, FridayGermany IFO business climate, FridayAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks, FridayECB’s Robert Holzmann and Philip Lane speak, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.3% as of 12:31 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7%The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%The MSCI World index was little changedCurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2%The euro fell 0.1% to $1.0861The British pound was little changed at $1.2722The Japanese yen fell 1.1% to 150.77 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 4.6% to $64,269.14Ether fell 6% to $3,295.95BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined two basis points to 4.31%Germany’s 10-year yield was little changed at 2.45%Britain’s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 4.06%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.9% to $83.46 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.2% to $2,155.33 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Farah Elbahrawy, Ye Xie, Michael Mackenzie, Alexandra Harris and Jessica Menton.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Super-Cheap EVs Offer Hope for Average American BuyersDollar’s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and AbroadCongress Should Think Bigger Than TikTok Ban, Tech Critics SayAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of TrollsWomen Are Closing the B-School Dean Gap©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,Is Palo Alto Networks Stock Going Back to $350? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palo-alto-networks-stock-going-192132294.html,Palo Alto Networks' growth story is more of a troubling tale -- and this stock no longer looks like a buy.,"Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) stock sat on a wall. Palo Alto Networks had a great fall (dropping 28.5% after earnings last month). Can all the king's horses and all the king's men, bid Palo Alto Networks stock back up to $350 again?That's the question facing investors today, as equity researcher Redburn Atlantic raises its price target on Palo Alto stock to $350. That's about what the stock cost right up until Palo Alto reported fiscal Q2 2024 earnings on Feb. 21 and warned that its cybersecurity business is slowing.Is Palo Alto stock a buy?Q2 2024 results were great -- sales jumped 19% year over year, and profits were up nearly 19-fold. But then Palo Alto CEO Nikesh Arora spooked investors with talk of a new ""platformization and consolidation"" strategy that could slow sales growth to 13% year over year in Q3, and reduce billings growth to 2%.Redburn analyst Nina Marques isn't scared though. Near-term, ""platformization"" may slow Palo Alto's growth rate, as the company offers customers discounts to sign up for bundled services. But in the long term, she sees platformization delivering ""massive returns"" for Palo Alto as the company leverages artificial intelligence to enhance cybersecurity across its products. Yes, Marques says Palo Alto is an AI stock.So how might this play out in practice? At a current market cap of $92 billion and a projected long-term growth rate of 18.5%, I'd like to see Palo Alto generate about $5 billion in free cash flow to justify its current valuation -- but most analysts don't see that happening before 2027. This year, the stock is only expected to generate $3.1 billion in free cash flow, which tells me Palo Alto is probably overpriced even at the $281 it currently costs. It's definitely not worth $350 a share, unless the company grows a whole lot faster than most analysts think it will.Long story short, Redburn is wrong on this one. Palo Alto may be a fine company, but its stock isn't going to $350 anytime soon.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Palo Alto Networks right now?Before you buy stock in Palo Alto Networks, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palo Alto Networks wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Is 3M Stock Going to $126? 1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks So.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-stock-going-126-1-190522055.html,A Barclays analyst is getting increasingly bullish on the turnaround prospects of this high-yield dividend stock.,"A week after raising a price target by $1 to $111, a Barclays analyst did it again, raising 3M's (NYSE: MMM) price target to $126 and slapping an ""overweight"" (buy) rating on the stock. That implies a 20% jump in the stock price over the next 12 months or so.The move comes after some relatively positive news recently from 3M, which may have affected the analyst's thinking.3M is improvingPlenty has gone wrong for 3M in recent years, but the Barclays upgrade sees improvement underway. 3M was hit with a combination of weak end markets (notably in electronics, automotive original equipment manufacturer, materials, and housing), ongoing legal costs and the threat of multi-billion-dollar legal settlements, and weak margin performance. The list goes on.The bullish case for the stock is based on the idea that many of these things are already baked into the price and are starting to improve. For example, management recently told investors it was ""seeing some strength in electronics coming in stronger than expected,"" and the automotive aftermarket remains strong. There are still areas of weakness, but its end markets don't appear to be improving overall.Meanwhile, management is confident its restructuring actions will lead to margin expansion. It also cited lower-than-expected stranded costs from the Solventum spinoff due to the restructuring actions. In addition, former L3 Harris Technologies CEO William Brown will take over as the new CEO on May 1, creating hopes that a new strategic approach might be implemented.Is 3M stock a buy?The midpoint of management's earnings per share guidance for 2024 ($9.35-$9.75) puts the stock on slightly less than 11 times 2024 earnings, and the stock is indisputably a value candidate.That said, the sustainability of the current dividend is coming into question, and this is a company with a track record of disappointing investors. There are also question marks around its business model. Cautious investors will want to see the dividend policy and guidance after the Solventum spinoff on April 1.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Where Will Celsius Holdings Stock Be in 10 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-celsius-holdings-stock-10-183700105.html,Is Celsius the next big fizz in the energy drink market? Check out the health-conscious challenger's odds.,"Energy drink stocks have been on a hypercaffeinated roll since Red Bull and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: MNST) started dueling around the turn of the millennium. The latest serious contender is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH), a health-focused drink designer with a global distribution deal, skyrocketing sales, and an 8% share of the convenience store and gas station market in North America.Celsius is participating in a long and heated market battle. Known as Hansen Natural at the time, Monster brewed its first energy drink in April 2002 and has never looked back. The stock has gained a heart-stopping 144,000% since then, turning a hypothetical $350 investment into half a million dollars.Challengers have come and gone over roughly two decades, but none have had the staying power of Monster and Red Bull. That won't stop even more rivals from entering the ring to capture a respectable slice of that ever-booming energy drink market.Will Celsius follow in Monster's and Red Bull's red-hot footsteps? From here, Celsius and its stock can go three different ways.The bull case for CelsiusIn a perfect world, the global distribution deal with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) sets Celsius up for long-term success. Putting the unfamiliar drink brand in front of billions of consumers, the top-notch distribution network raises awareness of the company's healthier energy drinks. The worldwide interest in organic, low-salt, and vegan foods continues for years and years, further boosting Celsius' growth prospects.In this scenario, the best is yet to come. The $8.9 billion market cap and $1.3 billion of annual sales you see today could become comparable to Monster's 2023 tally of $53 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.Of course, Neither Celsius nor Red Bull will sit on their hands while Celsius rises, so the third-place challenger may still have more catching up to do before truly joining the ruckus at the very top of the energy drink market. Still, history suggests that Celsius might be able to grow both its sales and market value fivefold over the next decade.Story continuesNot too shabby, right?The bear case against CelsiusOn the other hand, the bull case assumes that Celsius comes up aces in every challenge along the way. Many things could go horribly wrong instead.Consumer habits are notoriously fickle, and the health craze could very well cool down. That would be terrible news for Celsius, whose entire existence is based on a health-conscious alternative to traditional energy drinks.Or, the health trend could take a sharp turn in the other direction. Imagine a world where consumers turn up their noses on every kind of energy drink, no matter how health-focused it might be. And governments in key markets like the U.S. and Western Europe might consider halting the sales of caffeinated drinks not named coffee, putting up brick walls in front of every growth rocket in this category.Monster is notoriously litigious. The company sued up-and-comer Vital Pharmaceuticals in 2018, collecting enough damages to drive the Bang Energy maker out of business. Then, Monster bought what was left at a pennies-on-the-dollar bankruptcy discount. I don't know whether Monster would have a substantial case for doing the same to Celsius -- and PepsiCo should intervene with its deep pockets and access to high-powered law firms -- but you never know.I'm not saying that any of these extreme downturns are especially likely, but the risks are real enough. At the very least, challenges like these will probably hold Celsius' skyrocketing growth back a bit.Realistically, the company should land between these extremesI may share a first name with innovative physicist Anders Celsius, but that doesn't give me any special insights into our energy-drink namesake's business prospects. In my view, the company faces a promising growth market, but also a couple of powerful rivals and dominant market shares. As a result, Celsius looks like a promising growth stock with a couple of significant headwinds.Is Celsius a buy with these 10-year prospects?Investor enthusiasm is also running a bit hotter than I'd like, driving Celsius stock to lofty valuation ratios such as 114 times earnings and 168 times free cash flow. Monster Beverage looks like a bargain by comparison, and true value investors should consider taking part in the Celsius story by investing in distribution partner PepsiCo instead.So Celsius Holdings is most definitely not every investor's dream stock. You may want to consider a small, speculative stake in this interesting growth story, but only as an extra-small part of a diversified portfolio. Companies heading into direct competition with Monster and Red Bull often fall short of their early goals.Should you invest $1,000 in Celsius right now?Before you buy stock in Celsius, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Celsius wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Why Super Micro Computer, Advanced Micro Devices, and Other Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Tumbled on Tuesday",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-super-micro-computer-advanced-181639466.html,The market is digesting big developments in the artificial intelligence (AI) space.,"After the market close on Monday, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) kicked off its annual GPU Technology Conference (GTC), which some have dubbed the ""Woodstock of Artificial Intelligence (AI)."" Thousands of tech glitterati showed up in person to watch CEO Jensen Huang's keynote address, while millions more tuned in online.During the two-hour presentation, Huang expounded on the company's latest creations, collaborations, and partnerships, which will have a ripple effect across much of the tech world. This morning, investors are still digesting the impact of these announcements, which is causing something of a hangover in AI stocks -- likely following the old adage ""buy the rumor, sell the news.""With that as a backdrop, AI-centric server maker Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) tumbled 10.3%, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) slumped 5%, and chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ARM) declined 2.8% as of 1:26 p.m. ET on Tuesday.A check of all the usual suspects -- regulatory filings, financial reports, and changes to analysts' price targets -- was mixed in terms of company-specific news (more on that in a bit), suggesting much of the move was tied to Nvidia's day in the spotlight.Image source: Getty Images.The unveiling of BlackwellNvidia announced its long-awaited Blackwell architecture, the successor to the company's highly sought-after Hopper processors, which have become the gold standard for AI processing. Huang called the updated B200 graphics processing unit (GPU) the ""world's most powerful chip"" for AI.The GB200 superchip combines two B200 processors and a Grace CPU on a single board. Nvidia also developed a new network switch chip -- the NVLink -- that facilitates speedier communication while reducing the burden on the main processors.These next-generation processors are being packaged into full systems, including the GB200 NVL72, which contains 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs in a complete rack-scale design. The liquid-cooled system also contains a 72-GPU NVLink, which ""acts as a single massive GPU,"" delivering 30 times faster performance for the large language models (LLMs) that underlie generative AI.Story continuesAs Nvidia's chief rival in the AI chip space, AMD's stock price reaction isn't unexpected, as Nvidia raised the bar for AI performance expectations. Analysts from JPMorgan posit that Nvidia ""continues to be one to two steps ahead of its competitors,"" while analysts at Bank of America suggest Nvidia continues to ""widen its competitive moat.""Furthermore, the Grace CPU in Nvidia's GB200 was designed by Arm Holdings, which means the company gets a cut of each sale, either in the form of royalties or licensing revenue.Super Micro Computer, commonly referred to as Supermicro, partners with Nvidia on its own rack-scale, AI-centric servers to ensure optimal integration and performance from Nvidia's AI workhorse processors. Supermicro announced the expansion of its product portfolio to include these latest powerhouse AI chips.It's easy to see how the ripples from Nvidia's announcements will impact each of these companies in both positive and negative ways.There was one piece of company-specific news that may have fueled its downturn Tuesday. In a regulatory filing, Supermicro announced a secondary stock offering, with plans to sell 2 million shares of common stock, bringing the total share count to 58.55 million.Current shareholders are no doubt unhappy about the dilution, which amounts to about 3.5% -- far less than today's stock price drubbing. However, since the stock was recently sitting near an all-time high, it maximizes the amount of capital Supermicro will raise. At its current price of roughly $900 (as of this writing), the company could raise roughly $1.8 billion.Are any of these stocks a buy?Most market commentators believe that it's still very early days for the adoption of AI. If they're right -- and I believe they are -- each of these stocks has a vast opportunity ahead. For example:Supermicro has become the server of choice for many businesses looking to adopt AI. Furthermore, the company's building-block strategy allows companies to start small and easily expand their existing systems as the need arises.Arm Holdings controls a vast library of intellectual property (IP) and will continue to see its licensing and royalty revenue grow from the accelerating adoption of AI.AMD offers alternatives to Nvidia's AI processors, as well as CPUs of its own design to accompany them, so it will also benefit from the secular tailwind represented by AI.In terms of valuation, Supermicro is the least expensive of the group, with a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2, while AMD and Arm Holdings are selling for 9 times and 33 times forward sales, respectively.However, for those with a long-term outlook and stomach for some increased volatility, each of these stocks represents an intriguing opportunity, especially since it's still early days for AI.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.
