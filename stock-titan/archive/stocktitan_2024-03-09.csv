The Tender Offer saw $680,986,000 in principal amount accepted for purchase out of the $800,000,000 tendered. The company is also redeeming $119,015,000 of the Notes on March 27, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Wynn Resorts' recent completion of a tender offer for a portion of its 5.500% Senior Notes due 2025 indicates a strategic approach to debt management. By repurchasing $680,986,000 of the outstanding notes, the company is effectively reducing future interest expenses, which could improve net income margins over time. The tender offer was set below the aggregate principal amount outstanding, suggesting a deliberate and conservative financial strategy. This move could be seen as positive by investors, as it may improve the company's debt profile and creditworthiness.However, it's important to consider the liquidity position and whether the repurchase was financed by cash on hand or through new debt. If the latter, the interest rate and terms of the new debt could negate any potential benefits. Additionally, the market's response to such financial maneuvers can be mixed, depending on the perceived rationale and the company's overall financial health. Debt Market Analyst The acceptance of the tender offer at the full amount tendered suggests that the bondholders view the terms as favorable, or at least acceptable given market conditions. This could reflect an appetite for liquidity among investors or a belief that reallocating capital away from Wynn Resort's debt is advantageous at this time. It's also indicative of the current state of the credit markets and investor sentiment towards the hospitality and gaming industry.Further scrutiny of the tender offer terms, such as the premium paid over the market price and comparison with industry benchmarks, would provide additional insights into Wynn Resorts' market positioning. The fact that the company is redeeming an additional $119,015,000 of the Notes on a subsequent date also suggests a phased approach to liability management, which could be a signal of strategic financial planning or a response to market conditions. Investment Strategist Wynn Resorts' decision to buy back debt ahead of maturity could be part of a broader capital allocation strategy aimed at optimizing the balance sheet. For stakeholders, the key question is whether this transaction is part of a shift towards more aggressive growth strategies, possibly funded by lower-cost capital, or a move to de-leverage in an uncertain economic environment.Investors should also be aware of the potential impact on the company's stock. A successful tender offer often results in a temporary increase in share price due to perceived financial prudence. However, the long-term impact on the stock will depend on how the freed-up capital is reinvested and the company's ability to generate returns that exceed the cost of capital. 03/08/2024 - 08:39 PM LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) (“Wynn Resorts”) today announced the final results of the previously announced tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) by its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Wynn Las Vegas, LLC, to purchase a portion of Wynn Las Vegas, LLC and Wynn Las Vegas Capital Corp.’s outstanding 5.500% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”).

The company plans to use the net proceeds to strengthen its position during the liquidation process and cover legal fees incurred in opposing an activist shareholder campaign.","GYRODYNE ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF SUCCESSFUL, OVERSUBSCRIBED RIGHTS OFFERING Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Gyrodyne, LLC successfully closes a rights offering, generating $5 million in gross proceeds by selling 625,000 common shares at $8 per share. The offering exceeded expectations with participants subscribing for 1,031,640 shares, resulting in pro rata allocation of oversubscription shares. The company plans to use the net proceeds to strengthen its position during the liquidation process and cover legal fees incurred in opposing an activist shareholder campaign. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of Gyrodyne's Rights Offering and the full subscription of the offered shares at $8 per share, resulting in $5 million in gross proceeds, is a significant liquidity event for the company. The net proceeds of approximately $4.4 million, after accounting for costs, will bolster the company's cash position. This is critical as Gyrodyne navigates through its liquidation process, which includes enforcing purchase agreements and defending property rights. The oversubscription by approximately 65% signals strong investor confidence, or potentially a limited supply of shares, which can be an indicator of underlying value in the company's assets or a strategic play by investors.From a financial perspective, the allocation of funds towards outstanding legal fees and the opposition of an activist shareholder campaign suggests a contentious environment that could impact future governance and policy direction. Investors should monitor the efficacy of these expenditures in terms of preserving or enhancing shareholder value. Legal Expert The reference to the Article 78 proceeding against Gyrodyne indicates an ongoing legal challenge related to the company's actions or decisions made by its governing body. An Article 78 proceeding is a legal mechanism in New York that allows individuals to appeal the decisions of a state or local agency. The outcome of such proceedings could have material implications for the company's asset liquidation strategy and its ability to defend its property rights.The allocation of a portion of the net proceeds to address legal fees connected with an activist shareholder campaign reflects a proactive approach to corporate governance disputes. This move could serve to solidify the current board's control and strategic direction, which they believe will maximize shareholder value. However, it also highlights the potential for further governance-related turbulence that could affect investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. Market Research Analyst The real estate sector, within which Gyrodyne operates, is sensitive to market conditions and investor sentiment. The successful Rights Offering and the pro rata allocation of over-subscription shares can be interpreted as a positive market response, possibly reflecting the attractiveness of Gyrodyne's real estate portfolio or the perceived potential for returns during the liquidation process. However, it's important to consider the broader real estate market trends, as they will significantly influence the company's ability to negotiate favorable terms in purchase agreements.Furthermore, the company's intention to use the proceeds to ensure operational strength during the liquidation indicates a strategic approach to maximize the value of its assets. Investors should consider the company's track record in managing its real estate holdings and the potential impact of market conditions on the liquidation outcomes. 03/08/2024 - 05:07 PM ST. JAMES, N.Y., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gyrodyne, LLC (NASDAQ: GYRO) (the ""Company"" or ""Gyrodyne""), an owner and manager of a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, today announced the successful closing of its previously announced rights offering (the ""Rights Offering"") for shares of the Company's limited liability company interests (""Common Shares""). Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering, all 625,000 of the Common Shares offered in the Rights Offering were purchased at $8 per share, generating $5 million in gross proceeds to the Company (approximately $4.4 million net of costs). The subscription period for the Rights Offering expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 7, 2024. The Company is issuing 625,000 shares, the maximum number of shares issuable in the Rights Offering, consisting of 353,164 shares pursuant to the exercise of basic subscription privileges and 271,836 shares pursuant to the exercise of over-subscription privileges. In total, Rights Offering participants subscribed for 1,031,640 shares, exceeding by approximately 65% the 625,000 maximum shares offered in the Rights Offering. Rights Offering participants who exercised their basic subscription privilege in full requested a total of 678,476 additional shares in the exercise of oversubscription privileges, far exceeding the 271,836 over-subscription shares available. As a result, the available over-subscription shares will be allocated pro rata among the oversubscribing shareholders, with such proration to reflect the proportion that the number available shares bears to the number of requested shares, or approximately 40% of each oversubscription request. Gyrodyne will return to those shareholders who submitted over-subscription requests the full amount of their excess payments. It may take longer for shareholders that own shares in “street name” to receive payment because the subscription agent will return payments through the record holder of such shares (i.e., through the custodian bank, broker, dealer or other nominee). Rights Offering participants will receive the shares purchased by them in uncertificated book-entry form shortly after the date hereof. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Rights Offering to supplement its cash on hand to ensure it is operating from a position of strength through the duration of the liquidation process to negotiate and enforce purchase agreements and defend its property rights in the Article 78 proceeding brought against Gyrodyne and in any other such proceeding that may arise. The Company also intends to use a portion of the net proceeds on outstanding legal fees that were incurred in opposing an activist shareholder campaign to elect directors and effect policy changes the board believed would not maximize value and would not be in the best interests of Gyrodyne’s shareholders. For any questions regarding the issuance of shares purchased in the Rights Offering, please contact the Company’s information agent, Mackenzie Partners, toll-free at 800-322-2885 or via email at proxy@mackenziepartners.com. The issuance of Common Shares in connection with the Rights Offering was made pursuant to the Company's effective registration statement on Form S-1 (Reg. No. 333-276312) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section 19(a) Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The press release announces the distribution sources and amounts for February 2024, with a distribution per share of $0.065. The distribution includes net investment income, long-term capital gains, and return of capital. The fiscal YTD distributions sum up to $0.260 per share. The Fund's 5-year average total return on NAV is 5.34%, with a current distribution rate of 9.81% of NAV. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The disclosure of distribution amounts and sources for an investment fund is a critical piece of information for investors, as it directly impacts their income from investments. In this case, the distribution is predominantly from net realized long-term capital gains, accounting for 80% of the current distribution and 47% of the cumulative distributions. This suggests the fund is successfully realizing profits from investments held longer than a year, which is generally taxed at a lower rate than short-term gains, potentially offering tax advantages to investors.However, the annualized current distribution rate of 9.81% as a percentage of net asset value (NAV) is notably high and could raise sustainability concerns. If the distribution rate exceeds the fund's total return over time, it may erode the fund's principal, potentially impacting long-term capital growth. Investors should monitor the fund's ability to maintain such distributions without compromising its asset base. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the composition of the distributions is essential. The absence of return of capital in the current distribution is notable, as return of capital is typically not taxable but reduces an investor's cost basis in the investment. This can have implications for future capital gains taxes. The fact that the reported figures are based on U.S. GAAP and may differ from federal income tax regulations is an important distinction, as investors need to be aware that tax reporting figures may vary and should prepare for potential discrepancies when filing taxes. Market Research Analyst Looking at the performance metrics, the average annual total return on NAV over 5 years of 5.34% juxtaposed with a cumulative total return on NAV for the fiscal YTD of 8.23% indicates that the fund may be experiencing a period of above-average performance. This could attract new investors looking for funds with strong recent returns. Nevertheless, it's crucial to consider whether the current performance is aligned with the fund's historical risk profile and investment strategy. A significant deviation could indicate a change in management approach or market conditions, which may affect future performance. 03/08/2024 - 05:04 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Notification of Sources of Distribution Distribution Period February 2024 Distribution Amount Per Share of Common Stock $0.065 The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution, payable March 11, 2024 to shareholders of record February 29, 2024, together with the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date (YTD) from the following sources.

Hempacco Announces One-for-Ten Reverse Stock Split,2024-03-08T22:12:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Hempacco Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: HPCO) announces a 1-for-10 reverse stock split to meet Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, reducing outstanding shares from 31.4 million to 3.14 million.","Hempacco Announces One-for-Ten Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Hempacco Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: HPCO) announces a 1-for-10 reverse stock split to meet Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, reducing outstanding shares from 31.4 million to 3.14 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is a strategic financial maneuver often employed by companies seeking to optimize their stock price, particularly to meet listing requirements or to enhance the stock's appeal to investors. In the case of Hempacco Co., Inc., the 1-for-10 reverse stock split aims to address the Nasdaq's minimum bid price rule, which mandates that shares trade above $1.00 to maintain listing status.From a financial perspective, the reduction in authorized shares from 200 million to 20 million is intended to create a perceived increase in the value of each share, though it is important to note that this does not inherently change the company's market capitalization. This could potentially make the stock more attractive to institutional investors, who may shy away from stocks priced too low. However, it is also critical to consider investor sentiment, as reverse splits can sometimes be viewed negatively, suggesting a company's underlying challenges in maintaining its stock value.In evaluating the implications for stakeholders, the short-term benefit is clear: compliance with Nasdaq requirements and avoidance of delisting. Long-term effects, however, hinge on the company's operational performance and market conditions. Investors should monitor the company's subsequent financial reports and market performance to assess the efficacy of this strategic move. Market Research Analyst The hemp industry, within which Hempacco operates, is characterized by volatility and regulatory scrutiny. A reverse stock split in this context can serve as a signal to the market regarding the company's commitment to maintaining its public trading status and improving its stock's marketability. The reduction in outstanding shares to approximately 3.14 million should theoretically increase the scarcity of the stock, possibly leading to higher demand and liquidity.However, it is paramount to analyze market trends and investor behavior in similar situations. Historical data suggests that the success of reverse stock splits in sustaining long-term share price appreciation is mixed. Therefore, while the reverse stock split may address immediate listing concerns, its impact on investor confidence and the company's reputation must be carefully considered.For stakeholders, the rounding up of fractional shares to whole shares may be a minor positive, but the overarching concern will be the company's strategic direction post-split. Future growth prospects, product innovation and market expansion will be key factors in determining whether the reverse stock split will be a footnote or a turning point in the company's history. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the board's decision to enact a reverse stock split under Section 78.207 of the Nevada Revised Statutes is a legitimate exercise of corporate power, especially when intended to comply with exchange listing standards. The unilateral action by the board is permissible under corporate governance laws, provided it is done in accordance with the company's articles of incorporation and bylaws.For shareholders, the rounding up of fractional shares is a favorable legal outcome, avoiding the disenfranchisement that can occur when fractional shares are cashed out. Moreover, the legal mechanisms that enable such corporate actions offer companies like Hempacco a means to swiftly adapt to market conditions and regulatory demands without requiring a shareholder vote, which can be a lengthy process.It is essential for investors to understand that while the reverse stock split does not alter the par value of shares, it does modify the number of shares they hold and can influence the market perception of the company. Legal compliance in this matter serves to reassure stakeholders that the company is managing its regulatory obligations effectively. 03/08/2024 - 05:12 PM San Diego, California--(Newsfile Corp. - March 8, 2024) - Hempacco Co., Inc. (NASDAQ: HPCO) (""Hempacco"" or the ""Company""), a vertically integrated hemp manufacturing company, today announced that its Board of Directors on February 20, 2024, approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the Company's authorized shares of common stock (the ""Reverse Stock Split""), such that, following the consummation of the Reverse Stock Split, the number of authorized shares of common stock will be reduced from 200,000,000 to 20,000,000. The reverse stock split is anticipated to be effective as of the open of the market on March 13, 2024.As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 10 pre-split shares of Company common stock outstanding will automatically combine into one new share of common stock without any action on the part of the holders, and the number of outstanding common shares will be reduced from approximately 31.4 million shares to approximately 3.14 million shares. Any fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share on a per shareholder basis. The Reverse Stock Split will not affect the par value of the Company's common stock.The Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split pursuant to Section 78.207 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (""NRS""). The Board of Directors approved the Reverse Stock Split unilaterally pursuant to Section 78.207 of the NRS, solely to enable the Company to expeditiously meet the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement of The Nasdaq Stock Market (""Nasdaq"") and to reduce the risk of the Company being delisted as a result of failure to meet those requirements. The Reverse Stock Split will have no effect on the Company's authorized preferred stock. The Company anticipates that the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split will be before market open on March 13, 2024, with the common stock trading on a post-split basis under the Company's existing trading symbol, ""HPCO,"" at the market open on March 13, 2024, with a new CUSIP number, 42371L205.

The park's 1,800+ solar panels will provide 80% of the port's energy needs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1,000 tons annually. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert The installation of a solar park with over 1,800 panels at Carnival Corporation's Amber Cove Cruise Center represents a significant stride in the cruise industry's journey towards environmental sustainability. This initiative is not only commendable from an ecological standpoint but also from a business perspective. By supplying 80 percent of the port's energy demand with solar power, Carnival Corporation is expected to experience a reduction in operational costs associated with energy consumption.Moreover, the expected reduction of approximately 1,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually is an equivalent environmental benefit to planting over 30,000 trees. This shift to renewable energy sources is likely to enhance the company's brand image and appeal to a growing segment of eco-conscious consumers. The move aligns with global trends towards sustainable tourism and may set a precedent for other companies in the hospitality and travel sectors to follow. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the investment in renewable energy infrastructure at Amber Cove is likely to have a favorable impact on Carnival Corporation's long-term cost structure. While the upfront capital expenditure for the solar park is not disclosed, the operational savings on energy costs and potential government incentives for sustainable practices could improve profit margins over time. Furthermore, Carnival's proactive approach to sustainability can potentially mitigate regulatory risks as governments worldwide impose stricter environmental regulations on the tourism and transportation industries.Investors may view this development positively, as it demonstrates the company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and aligning with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria, which is increasingly important for investment decisions. However, the actual impact on Carnival's stock performance will depend on the cost of the project versus the savings on energy and the broader market's perception of the company's sustainability efforts. Market Research Analyst The cruise sector is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer preferences and global trends. With sustainability becoming a key factor in consumer decision-making, Carnival Corporation's investment in solar energy at Amber Cove positions it as a leader in eco-friendly initiatives within the industry. This differentiation could attract a new demographic of environmentally conscious travelers, potentially increasing market share.Additionally, the announcement that Amber Cove has reached the milestone of one million arriving guests highlights the port's significance as a tourist destination. The integration of sustainable practices is likely to enhance the destination's reputation and could lead to increased visitation, thereby boosting revenue from port fees and on-site consumer spending. 03/08/2024 - 04:35 PM MIAMI, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Underscoring its commitment to sustainability, Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), the world's largest cruise company, today unveiled a new solar park at its Amber Cove Cruise Center in the Dominican Republic. The park's 1,800-plus solar panels will supply 80 percent of the port's energy demand. Carnival Corporation, Carnival Cruise Line and Amber Cove Cruise Center celebrated with a ribbon cutting that was attended by government, industry and community leaders, including Joel Santos, minister of the presidency of the Dominican Republic, and Christine Duffy, president of Carnival Cruise Line. ""As we bring guests to enjoy the beauty and rich culture of the Dominican Republic, we also take our environmental stewardship here and everywhere we visit very seriously,"" said Duffy. ""With this new solar park in Amber Cove, we are furthering our commitment to sustainability at our destinations by focusing on renewable energy sources to power the vast majority of the port's needs."" ""On behalf of the Government, we celebrate this achievement, which makes Amber Cove the first cruise terminal in the country with a project of this scale,"" said Joel Santos, minister of the presidency of the Dominican Republic. ""This project will undoubtedly contribute to the production of clean energy and environmental sustainability in Puerto Plata, the first tourist destination in the Dominican Republic."" The shift to renewable solar energy will replace most of the port's current energy sources and reduce its reliance on fossil fuel-based energy, therefore reducing greenhouse gas emissions that would otherwise be produced. In total, the solar park is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1,000 tons per year – the equivalent to planting more than 30,000 trees. Located in the heart of the Dominican Republic's north coast just outside the historical town of Puerto Plata, Amber Cove Cruise Center is one of eight leading port destinations and exclusive islands owned and operated by Carnival Corporation. The 25-acre port features restaurants, shops, bars, pools, a zipline, waterfront and hilltop cabanas, and many shore excursion opportunities, such as snorkeling and a waterfall adventure. Four of the company's cruise lines – Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Holland America Line and Princess Cruises – regularly visit the cruise port, which celebrated one million arriving guests last December – accounting for more than half of all cruise guest visits to the Dominican Republic in 2023.

(BTTR) announces a 1-for-44 reverse stock split to comply with NYSE American listing standards. The split will be effective on March 20, 2024, aiming to improve the stock price and benefit shareholders.","Better Choice Company To Effectuate a Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Better Choice Company, Inc. (BTTR) announces a 1-for-44 reverse stock split to comply with NYSE American listing standards. The split will be effective on March 20, 2024, aiming to improve the stock price and benefit shareholders. Positive Better Choice Company, Inc. plans a 1-for-44 reverse stock split to address NYSE American listing standards. The Board of Directors and majority shareholders approved the reverse stock split within a range of 1-for-25 to 1-for-45. The reverse split will be effective on March 20, 2024, with trading starting on a post-split basis on March 21, 2024. The CUSIP number will change to 08771Y 402, but there will be no change to the par value of the common stock. Stockholders will receive one whole share for fractional shares due to the reverse split, maintaining their ownership percentage. Equity Stock Transfer LLC will act as the exchange agent for the reverse split, providing instructions to stockholders for exchanging old certificates for new ones. Stockholders holding shares in brokerage accounts are not required to take any action for the exchange. The reverse split is a measure to regain compliance with NYSE American's listing standards and is deemed necessary for the company and its shareholders. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a 1-for-44 reverse stock split by Better Choice Company represents a significant corporate action aimed at addressing compliance issues with the NYSE American's listing standards, specifically related to the minimum share price requirement. Such a move is typically employed by companies to elevate their stock price by reducing the number of shares outstanding, thus increasing the per-share price without altering the company's market capitalization.From a financial perspective, this action does not inherently add value to the company but is often viewed as a strategy to avoid delisting and to make the stock more attractive to institutional investors who may be prohibited from holding stocks below a certain price. However, it is important to note that reverse splits can sometimes be perceived negatively by the market, as they may signal underlying financial weaknesses. Investors will be monitoring the stock's performance post-split to gauge market sentiment and the efficacy of this maneuver. Market Research Analyst The reverse stock split decision by Better Choice Company must be analyzed in the context of the pet health and wellness industry, where stock performance can be influenced by consumer spending trends, regulatory changes and competitive dynamics. The industry is growing, driven by increased pet ownership and a greater focus on pet health. In this competitive landscape, Better Choice's ability to maintain its listing status and potentially attract more investors through a higher share price could be crucial for raising capital and funding growth initiatives.Long-term implications for stakeholders include the potential for improved liquidity and the ability to maintain or increase investment from funds that have minimum share price criteria. However, the success of such corporate actions is contingent upon the company's fundamental performance post-split. Stakeholders will be interested in the company's future growth strategies and how they align with industry trends to ensure sustainable value creation. Legal Expert The reverse stock split is a legal maneuver that requires approval from both the company's Board of Directors and its shareholders, reflecting corporate governance practices. The company has followed due process by obtaining the necessary authorizations within the stipulated Reverse Split Range. This action is also a direct response to the NYSE American's notification of non-compliance, showcasing the company's commitment to adhere to regulatory requirements and maintain its listing.It is essential that all stockholders are treated fairly during this process. The company's approach to issuing whole shares in lieu of fractional shares is a standard practice intended to minimize the impact on shareholders' ownership percentages. The role of the transfer agent is also crucial in ensuring that the transition is seamless for shareholders who possess physical stock certificates. 03/08/2024 - 04:05 PM TAMPA, Fla., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Better Choice Company, Inc. (NYSE American: BTTR) (“Better Choice” or the “Company”), a pet health and wellness company, announced today that it will proceed with a 1-for-44 reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001, following authorization by its Board of Directors and majority shareholders to effect a reverse stock split by a ratio of not less than 1-for-25 and not more than 1-for-45 (the “Reverse Split Range”), at any time on or before March 31, 2024, with the Board having the discretion as to whether or not the Reverse Split is to be effected, and the exact ratio to be set at a whole number within the Reverse Split Range. The Board approved the Reverse Split on March 4, 2024. The Reverse Split will be effective on March 20, 2024 and will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on March 21, 2024. In conjunction with the Reverse Split, the CUSIP number will be changed to 08771Y 402. There will be no change to the par value of the Company’s common stock. The Reverse Split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's ownership percentage of the Company's shares with the exception of those holders of fractional shares. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Split. The Company will issue one whole share of common stock to any stockholder who would have been entitled to receive a fractional share of common stock due to the Reverse Split. Each holder of common stock will hold the same percentage of the outstanding common stock immediately following the Reverse Split as that stockholder did immediately before the Reverse Split, except for adjustments due to the additional net share fraction that will need to be issued as a result of the treatment of fractional shares. The Company’s transfer agent, Equity Stock Transfer LLC, is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Split and will send instructions to stockholders of record who hold stock certificates regarding the exchange of their old certificates for new certificates, should they wish to do so. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or “street name” are not required to take any action to effect the exchange of their shares. As previously disclosed, the Company received a letter from the NYSE American LLC (the “NYSE American”) stating that the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide, notifying the Company that its stock has been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and the Company’s continued listing is predicated on it effecting a reverse stock split of its common stock, par value $0.001 or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time. The Company intends to seek to regain compliance with the NYSE American’s continued listing standards by undertaking this Reverse Split as a measure that is considered necessary and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Olo's partnership with Qu to integrate Olo Pay and Engage suites into Qu's POS system represents a strategic move in the restaurant technology sector. This collaboration aims to address a significant market gap by digitizing a larger portion of the 84% of restaurant transactions that are currently non-digital, according to Circana data. The integration facilitates a unified payment management system that could streamline operations, potentially leading to cost savings and improved customer satisfaction due to a more seamless payment experience.From a market research perspective, this move is likely to enhance Olo's competitive position by expanding its service offerings and increasing its value proposition to restaurant brands. As digital adoption grows, Olo's ability to provide a comprehensive solution that covers both in-store and online transactions could lead to increased market share and customer loyalty. The data aggregation capability that comes with the Engage integration may provide valuable insights into consumer behavior, enabling restaurants to tailor their services and marketing strategies more effectively. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the potential financial implications of Olo's expanded partnership with Qu. The integration is expected to be operational later this year and it could have a positive impact on Olo's revenue streams by attracting new customers and increasing transaction volumes through its platform. The ability to offer card-present payment processing and enhanced customer engagement tools could make Olo's offerings more attractive to large restaurant chains seeking to optimize their digital and in-store experiences.However, investors should also monitor the costs associated with the development and maintenance of these integrations. It is crucial to assess whether the increased revenues will offset these costs in the long term. Additionally, the success of this initiative depends on the rate of adoption by restaurant brands, which could be influenced by factors such as market readiness for digital transformation and the competitive landscape of restaurant technology providers. Technology Integration Expert The technical aspects of integrating Olo Pay and Engage suites into Qu's POS system are non-trivial, involving complex software development and system compatibility challenges. The integration is designed to provide a seamless payment process and consolidate customer data across digital and in-store interactions. This holistic approach to customer data management can enable restaurants to gain comprehensive insights and deliver a more personalized experience.The success of the integration will hinge on the robustness and reliability of the technology, as well as the ease of use for both restaurant staff and customers. As this technology rolls out, it will be essential to ensure that the system is user-friendly and that the transition for restaurants is smooth, to encourage widespread adoption. The technical execution of this integration will be a critical factor in its market success and its potential to drive the digital transformation of the restaurant industry. 03/08/2024 - 04:05 PM Announced live at Olo’s annual customer conference, Beyond4, Olo’s Pay and Engage suites will integrate seamlessly into Qu’s POS effective later this year NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Olo Inc.

TRIUMPH UPDATES FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR FULL YEAR FISCAL 2024,2024-03-08T21:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Triumph Group, Inc. updates financial guidance for fiscal year 2024, reaffirming net sales of $1.17-1.20 billion, operating income of $100-110 million, and adjusted EBITDAP of $157-167 million. The company completed debt paydowns and asset sales, impacting cash flows and free cash use.","TRIUMPH UPDATES FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR FULL YEAR FISCAL 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Triumph Group, Inc. updates financial guidance for fiscal year 2024, reaffirming net sales of $1.17-1.20 billion, operating income of $100-110 million, and adjusted EBITDAP of $157-167 million. The company completed debt paydowns and asset sales, impacting cash flows and free cash use. Positive Triumph Group, Inc. reaffirms its financial outlook for fiscal year 2024, with net sales expected to range from $1.17 billion to $1.20 billion. Operating income for the same period is projected to be between $100.0 million and $110.0 million, while adjusted EBITDAP is forecasted to be in the range of $157.0 million to $167.0 million. The company updated its cash flow projections, with cash flow used in operations expected to range from $(15.8) million to $(5.8) million, and free cash use anticipated to be between $(39.6) million and $(29.6) million. Triumph Group, Inc. recently completed debt paydowns and asset sales, affecting its balance sheet and cash flows. The company's updated financial guidance reflects these recent transactions and their impact on its operations. The company's balance sheet update includes the completion of debt repayments and asset sale tenders, totaling approximately $128.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Triumph Group, Inc. also posted unaudited preliminary quarterly results for continuing operations, highlighting the impact of discontinuing its Product Support business. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent financial update from Triumph Group, Inc. indicates a strategic divestiture and debt reduction, which can have substantial implications for the company's liquidity and leverage ratios. The call of senior secured notes and the settlement of an asset sale tender are pivotal moves to restructure the company's debt profile. This debt reduction is expected to decrease interest expenses, potentially improving net income and earnings per share in future periods. However, the updated guidance also suggests a significant use of cash in operations, which may raise questions about the company's operational efficiency and cash management strategies.From a valuation perspective, the reaffirmation of net sales and operating income guidance suggests stability in the company's core operations, which could be perceived positively by the market. However, the adjustment in cash flow and free cash use guidance to negative figures might concern investors about the near-term cash requirements and the company's ability to fund its operations without additional financing. The implications of these financial maneuvers should be monitored closely in the upcoming quarters for their impact on the company's financial health and stock performance. Market Research Analyst Triumph Group's financial update reflects broader industry trends where companies are streamlining operations and shedding non-core assets to focus on profitability and debt management. The sale of the Product Support business could be seen as a strategic move to concentrate on more profitable segments. This aligns with the current market sentiment favoring leaner, more focused enterprises.Investors and stakeholders may interpret the reaffirmed guidance as a signal of management's confidence in the company's strategic direction and operational targets. However, the negative cash flow guidance could be indicative of transitional costs and the expenses associated with restructuring. It is crucial to assess how these factors will play out against the backdrop of the aerospace and defense industry's cyclical nature and current economic conditions. The long-term success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in its continuing operations and to manage the working capital effectively. Debt Market Analyst The call of senior secured notes and the settlement of an asset sale tender represent a proactive approach to debt management by Triumph Group. By repurchasing debt at a premium and at par, the company is likely trying to optimize its capital structure and reduce future interest obligations. This could be a strategic move to improve credit ratings and reduce the cost of capital, which can enhance shareholder value over time.However, the impact on the debt markets could be mixed. Current debt holders might view the call of notes as a positive step towards financial stability, while potential investors could be wary of the negative cash flow guidance. The company's ability to manage its remaining debt obligations and to refinance at favorable rates in the future will be a critical factor for debt market stakeholders. The balance between debt reduction and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs will be a delicate one that requires careful monitoring. 03/08/2024 - 04:05 PM RADNOR, Pa. , March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Triumph Group, Inc.

Oncology Doctor The positive Phase 1 clinical trial data for PSMA-TRACTr JANX007 and EGFR-TRACTr JANX008 represent significant strides in the development of targeted therapies for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and solid tumors, respectively. The observed PSA declines and RECIST responses, along with the favorable safety profiles, suggest that these therapies could offer a new avenue for treatment where current options are limited. Particularly, the ability to administer higher doses without reaching the maximum tolerable dose could imply a better therapeutic window for patients with mCRPC, a group that typically faces poor prognosis.From an oncological perspective, the lack of Grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) is noteworthy, as it suggests a manageable safety profile, which is crucial in advancing these drugs through the clinical pipeline. The continued enrollment in the Phase 1 clinical trials for both JANX007 and JANX008 indicates ongoing research commitment and the potential for these therapies to address unmet medical needs. Financial Analyst Janux Therapeutics' financial position, with $344.0 million in year-end cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, is robust, particularly following the net proceeds of approximately $320.2 million from the recent underwritten offering. This capital infusion is pivotal for the company's ability to sustain its clinical and preclinical programs. For investors, the cash runway is a key indicator of the company's ability to continue operations without the immediate need for additional fundraising, which could dilute existing shares.The reported net loss figures, while substantial, show a slight improvement year-over-year, which could be interpreted as a sign of financial management amidst aggressive R&D spending. The R&D expenses, although slightly higher for the year, are in line with the company's developmental stage and reflect the investment necessary to advance their clinical candidates. The increase in general and administrative expenses is also expected as the company grows and requires more sophisticated administrative support. Market Research Analyst The progression of Janux's TRACTr platform and the advancement of its clinical candidates are closely watched by market analysts for their potential impact on the competitive landscape of cancer treatments. The positive clinical data and the strategic financial moves to strengthen the balance sheet could positively influence market sentiment. The anticipation of further updates on JANX007 data in the second half of 2024 is likely to keep investor interest piqued, as such milestones are critical for gauging the long-term viability and commercial potential of the therapies.Moreover, the promotion of Co-founder Dr. Tommy DiRaimondo to Chief Scientific Officer is a strategic decision that could ensure continuity in the company's research direction and possibly enhance investor confidence in the company's scientific leadership. The emphasis on expanding and optimizing the preclinical pipeline indicates a forward-looking approach, aiming to sustain the company's innovation cycle beyond its current clinical candidates. 03/08/2024 - 04:01 PM Recently presented positive Phase 1 clinical trial data for PSMA-TRACTr JANX007 in mCRPC and for EGFR-TRACTr JANX008 in solid tumors Enrollment ongoing for JANX007 and JANX008 Update on JANX007 data and doses selected for expansion cohorts is anticipated in 2H 2024 $344.0 million in year-end cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments In March, further strengthened balance sheet with approximately $320.2 million net proceeds from underwritten offering SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Janux Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: JANX) (Janux), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad pipeline of novel immunotherapies by applying its proprietary technology to its Tumor Activated T Cell Engager (TRACTr) and Tumor Activated Immunomodulator (TRACIr) platforms, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “2023 was a critical year for Janux as we tested the potential power of our TRACTr platform in the clinic. We believe the data recently presented from both of our clinical programs displays the profound impact we can have on patients through our tumor-activated approach. We are excited to be helping cancer patients who need novel therapies and with our substantial cash runway we feel well-positioned to execute on our clinical plan,” said David Campbell, Ph.D., President and CEO of Janux. RECENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS AND FUTURE MILESTONES: Presented positive updated interim Phase 1 clinical trial data for PSMA-TRACTr JANX007 in prostate cancer in February 2024. As of February 12, 2024: Increasing depth of PSA declines and RECIST responses at higher doses were observed, while a favorable safety profile was maintained. 83% (5/6) of subjects achieved PSA50 declines with first step dose ≥ 0.2mg. 56% (10/18) of subjects achieved PSA50 declines with first dose ≥ 0.1mg. No CRS > Grade 2 observed in heavily pre-treated late stage mCRPC population. Majority of non-CRS treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were Grade 1 or 2. Low incidence of Grade 3 TRAEs, and no Grade 4 or 5 events were observed. JANX007 has been administered at doses up to 3mg, significantly exceeding the anticipated maximum tolerable dose for the parental T cell engager, while the maximum tolerable dose for the TRACTr has not yet been established. Also presented positive interim Phase 1 clinical trial data for EGFR-TRACTr JANX008 in solid tumors. As of February 12, 2024: A subject with NSCLC achieved a RECIST PR maintained through 18-weeks with 100% target lung lesion reduction and elimination of liver metastasis with no CRS or TRAEs. No CRS greater than Grade 1 observed in any cohort. Majority of non-CRS TRAEs were Grade 1 or 2. No treatment-related SAEs or DLTs have been observed. Net proceeds of approximately $320.2 million (after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other estimated offering expenses) raised in an underwritten offering of common stock and pre-funded warrants in March 2024. Janux plans to deploy these funds to expand development of clinical programs, advance additional preclinical programs and extend corporate runway. JANX007 continues to enroll in the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in mCRPC (NCT05519449). JANX008 continues to enroll in the first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NCT05783622). Co-founder Dr. Tommy DiRaimondo promoted to Chief Scientific Officer. Tommy was instrumental in successfully transitioning Janux’s PSMA-TRACTr and EGFR-TRACTr programs from research into clinical trials. Tommy continues to manage the internal and external research operations and plays an integral role in managing the IP, discovery, creation, optimization and expansion of Janux’s preclinical pipeline. An update on JANX007 data and doses selected for expansion cohorts is anticipated in the second half of 2024. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS: Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments: As of December 31, 2023, Janux reported cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $344.0 million compared to $327.0 million at December 31, 2022.

The SELECT trial's findings, demonstrating a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE, are clinically meaningful given the high burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among this patient population. This approval could potentially alter clinical practice by providing healthcare professionals with a pharmacological strategy to address residual cardiovascular risk in patients with obesity, beyond lifestyle modifications and existing standard of care.From a medical research perspective, the SELECT trial's robust design and the significant absolute risk reduction of 1.5% at a mean follow-up of 40 months underscore the potential of Wegovy® to become a key component in the management of patients with obesity and CVD. It is noteworthy that the efficacy of Wegovy® was consistent across various subgroups, including age, sex, race and baseline BMI, indicating broad applicability of the treatment. However, the higher discontinuation rate due to gastrointestinal disorders warrants consideration in the risk-benefit assessment for individual patients. Financial Analyst The FDA's approval of an additional indication for Wegovy® could have a substantial impact on Novo Nordisk's financial performance. Obesity and CVD are prevalent conditions and the expansion of Wegovy®'s label to include MACE reduction addresses a significant unmet medical need. This could lead to increased demand and market share for the drug, translating into revenue growth for the company. The approval may also strengthen Novo Nordisk's competitive positioning in the anti-obesity market, particularly as the first FDA-approved drug to link weight management with cardiovascular risk reduction.Investors should monitor Novo Nordisk's execution of manufacturing scale-up plans to meet the anticipated demand surge. The company's ability to manage supply chain effectively and mitigate adverse event-related concerns will be crucial for sustained growth. Additionally, payor acceptance and insurance coverage will play a critical role in patient access and commercial success. Healthcare Economist The broader implications of this FDA approval for the healthcare system are substantial. Obesity and CVD impose a significant economic burden due to associated healthcare costs and productivity losses. The introduction of Wegovy® as a treatment option that can concurrently address weight management and reduce cardiovascular risk has the potential to mitigate these costs. By preventing MACE, which often results in expensive hospitalizations and long-term care, this treatment could lead to cost savings for both payers and patients over time.It is essential to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Wegovy® in the context of its clinical benefits and the economic burden of obesity-related CVD. If Wegovy® can demonstrate a favorable cost-benefit ratio, it may encourage broader insurance coverage and formulary inclusion, thereby improving accessibility for the eligible patient population. The impact on public health could be significant if Wegovy® is widely adopted as part of a comprehensive strategy to manage obesity and reduce cardiovascular risk. 03/08/2024 - 02:57 PM Wegovy® (semaglutide) injection 2.4 mg is the first-and-only medicine indicated for both reduction of the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as death, heart attack, or stroke and for long-term weight management1The approval is based on the results of SELECT, the largest cardiovascular outcomes trial ever completed for people with obesity and known heart disease2 PLAINSBORO, N.J., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an additional indication for Wegovy® to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with known heart disease and with either obesity or overweight along with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.1 This new indication adds to the prescribing label for Wegovy®, a prescription-only medicine previously approved help adults and children aged 12 years and older with obesity, or some adults with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems, to help them lose excess body weight and keep the weight off when used along with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.1 Experience the full interactive Multichannel News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/9253451-novo-nordisk-wegovy-semaglutide-fda-approval/ ""Today, we're taking a pivotal step forward in addressing some of the most pressing health issues of our time with the added indication for Wegovy®,"" said Doug Langa, Executive Vice President, Head of North America Operations, and President of Novo Nordisk Inc. ""We recognize how important this moment is for the millions of people who live with excess weight or obesity and known heart disease, and we will continue to advance options that put their needs first. Reducing this risk is a key part of our commitment to driving change for this community, as we work to increase manufacturing capacity to responsibly supply this important medicine."" The FDA decision is based on the results of the landmark SELECT phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial that examined the effect of adding Wegovy® 2.4 mg or placebo to cardiovascular standard of care in adults with overweight and obesity with established CVD and without diabetes.2 Wegovy® 2.4 mg significantly reduced the risk for first occurrence of a three-part composite MACE endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, or non-fatal stroke.1,2 The primary composite outcome occurred in 6.5% of patients treated with Wegovy® and 8.0% with placebo. The estimated relative risk reduction of MACE was 20% vs placebo (HR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72, 0.90] p <0.001, absolute risk reduction of 1.5% at 40 months, the mean follow-up duration).1,2 The reduction of MACE with Wegovy® was not impacted by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline BMI, or level of renal function impairment.1,2 Safety data collection was limited to serious adverse events (including death), adverse events leading to discontinuation, and adverse events of special interest.1,2 In the SELECT trial, the proportion of patients for whom serious adverse events were reported was 33.4% in patients randomized to Wegovy® 2.4 mg and 36.4% of patients receiving placebo.2 Sixteen percent (16%) of Wegovy®-treated patients and 8% of placebo-treated patients, respectively, discontinued study drug due to an adverse event.1 The most common adverse event leading to discontinuation was gastrointestinal disorders, occurring in 10% of patients in the Wegovy® group and 2% in the placebo group.2 ""This approval is a significant decision because people living with excess weight or obesity and established cardiovascular disease and without diabetes have never had an FDA-approved treatment option that lowers weight and reduces the likelihood of another cardiovascular event,"" said Dr. A. Michael Lincoff, Professor of Medicine at Cleveland Clinic and the lead study author of the SELECT outcomes trial. ""For healthcare professionals, this approval provides a new treatment option to help us address cardiovascular residual risk that remains for patients on current standard of care."" Between 1999 and 2020, obesity-related cardiovascular disease deaths tripled in the U.S., according to the American Heart Association.3 In fact, more than one in three U.S. adults live with obesity,4 one of the leading risk factors contributing to heart disease and stroke.5 About the SELECT Trial SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven superiority trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of Wegovy® 2.4 mg versus placebo as an adjunct to cardiovascular standard of care for reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in people with established CVD with overweight or obesity with no prior history of diabetes.2 The trial, initiated in 2018, enrolled 17,604 adults and was conducted in 41 countries at more than 800 investigator sites.2 About Wegovy® (semaglutide) injection 2.4 mg What is Wegovy®?WEGOVY® (semaglutide) injection 2.4 mg is an injectable prescription medicine used with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity: to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with known heart disease and with either obesity or overweight.that may help adults and children aged 12 years and older with obesity, or some adults with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems, to help them lose excess body weight and keep the weight off.Wegovy® contains semaglutide and should not be used with other semaglutide-containing products or other GLP-1 receptor agonist medicines.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 01:30 PM WBA leaders, team members, partners and suppliers came together in a shared commitment to people and the planet.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / At Walgreens Boots Alliance's first-ever Healthy Communities Day, held in Chicago this week, participants celebrated the progress of WBA's health-centered Environmental, Social & Governance strategy and crafted future ambitions for healthier communities around the world. Marking the launch of its ESG Report for 2023, the event brought together stakeholders active at the forefront of global impact issues, from climate change to healthcare access, for candid discussions of what's next.Representatives ranging from global enterprise leaders to small business owners to nonprofit founders gathered in the National Museum of Mexican Art for the day, itself a testament to Walgreens' community involvement as a museum sponsor and just a short distance from the first Walgreens store opened in 1901. Here are six takeaways from the event.None of us can do it alone. One theme throughout the day was that significant change comes when we work together and multiply our impact. WBA CEO Tim Wentworth set the tone for open partnership: ""The most important part of our relationship is that we can share and define goals that we couldn't achieve individually, but together we can exceed.""Ornella Barra, WBA COO international and ESG committee chair, agreed, saying, ""We understand the need to keep up at this work and will continue to make investments that improve the prospects and environment for our people and our consumers. We cannot achieve this alone.""A heartfelt example of what we've already accomplished together, with partner Vitamin Angels and the support of our customers, team members and their incredible network, is the over 400 million parents and children around the world supplied with life-changing vitamins and supplements in the past 10 years. Watch Michaela's story above to see the real-life change we're making.Climate change is closer than you think-and it's personal. In a discussion moderated by Una Kent, WBA's VP of ESG and DEI, International, panelists discussed the inextricable link between climate change and human health. David Croft​, Global Head of Sustainability at Reckitt, acknowledged a misconception that many people hear climate change and think of distant polar ice caps and not the impact right at their doorstep.""Does that feel personal to you? Do you want to change something about something that's so remote?"" he asked. ""One of the biggest things we've done together is start to change some of the conversation so that climate change becomes personal.""In one such example, Sarah McDonald​, VP, Sustainability at Haleon, talked about a study that put trackers on children's backpacks to see how much air pollution they ingested while walking to school. An alternate route on a less congested road meant less polluted air and better health outcomes in the long term.So, what are we doing about it? We're joining forces, for starters. WBA and each company represented on the panel are part of the Climate and Health Coalition, which formed in 2022 to help the private sector accelerate the transformation of our health and climate systems to improve outcomes for both people and planet. Read more about WBA's commitment to a Healthy Planet.Together we can localize healthcare. In a panel moderated by Alethia Jackson, WBA's SVP of ESG and Chief DEI Officer, panelists discussed how 60% of health outcomes are driven by social determinants of health, such as your zip code. What this tells us is that healthcare is local and must be tailored to fit the unique needs of a community.Each panelist represented a different point in the patient's healthcare journey, such as vaccinating people in under-resourced countries, helping mothers through pregnancy, developing medicines and vaccines that can help with chronic disease, decentralizing and diversifying clinical trials, and making the LGBTQ+ community feel seen, heard and supported with their health needs. At the center of it all are pharmacists, embedded in their communities and empowered to provide education, access and care.""Approximately 50% of our stores are located in medically underserved areas. Knowing our patients and customers in these communities has allowed us to work in tandem with partners who are also trying to help different segments of the population with the most need,"" said Jackson. Read more about WBA's commitment to Healthy Communities.Sustainability works when we bring consumers along for the journey. Rajnish Kapur, SVP of Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain, WBA, led a discussion on the influence retailers like WBA can have on creating a better environment through choices on supplier partners, transportation, packaging and more.""We need to meet consumers where they are and bring them along with us. We can't expect them to leap the Grand Canyon to come to where we are and our point of view as corporations,"" said Jennifer Duran, global VP of Product Resiliency and Sustainability at Kenvue, maker of iconic brands like Band-Aid and Tylenol. This includes changing the narrative on sustainability from an add-on or afterthought to an integrated and expected feature of the products.Small business owner Theresa Ging, CEO of Sugar Bliss, notes that in addition to sustainable packaging, it further supports the environment through a partnership with Plastic Bank, which removes plastic from the ocean and supports disadvantaged communities. ""I realized the consumer I'm targeting understands that recyclable packaging probably costs more. They understand there's a social mission and we're giving back.""Panelists agreed that making more inroads for small businesses to learn how to make sustainable choices would go a long way, and true to theme, working together between industry organizations, retailers and suppliers big and small was the way to do it. Read more about WBA's commitment to Sustainable Marketplace.Forging connections are critical to fighting cancer. Angela Bower, Senior Director of Health Services Diversity and Inclusion, brought together some of the most prominent players in cancer care, awareness and prevention to discuss what patients need now. When you learn that 1 in 2 people will get cancer in their lifetime, and most of our panelists were cancer survivors or family of cancer survivors, you begin to understand the magnitude.The emotional needs of cancer patients came through clearly, as Stephanie Lieber, Executive Director of Imerman's Angels said, ""Like many folks on this panel, we do this so that no one faces cancer alone.""Pharmacists in our stores can be an important lifeline for cancer patients, offering counseling on emotional, physical and financial needs. Through a partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, Boots pharmacists have been trained and had more than 150,000 supportive conversations with people with cancer.Addressing inequities in cancer diagnosis and treatment was also a charged topic, with discussion on solutions as varied as educational materials for awareness starting at younger ages, culturally competent outreach in the Black and Hispanic communities, and increased diversity in clinical trials. Working together was also reinforced as the goal, as Paula Schneider, Chief Executive of Susan G. Komen said, ""Be open to any partnership or one-plus-one-equals three situations. If we can figure out how to partner better together, the world will be a better place.""Team members are the foundation of how we deliver on community health. Every person working at WBA, from customer service associates to pharmacists to supply chain and corporate support, has a role in our vision to be the leading partner in reimagining local healthcare and wellbeing for all. Sal Venegas, interim chief HR officer, said, ""Our team members, our people, are the heart of the company and the key to our success.""For the more than 331,000 team members at WBA, creating a safe, healthy and inclusive workplace is our goal. Mary Stutts, CEO at the Healthcare Businesswoman's Association and event panelist, shared that ""the majority of employees really want to be active in their community and to be proud of working for a company that is active in their community."" Listen to two of our team members talk about how this comes to life for them above.Read more about WBA's commitment to a Healthy and Inclusive Workplace.

The combined purchase price was $1.5625 per share, with warrants exercisable at $1.64 per share. WallachBeth Capital acted as the sole placement agent for the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closure of a securities purchase agreement by bioAffinity Technologies, involving both a registered direct offering and a concurrent private placement of warrants, is a strategic move to raise capital. The pricing of the common stock at $1.5625 and the exercise price for the warrants at $1.64 suggests a moderate premium over current market prices, which is a common practice to incentivize institutional investors. This capital infusion is likely to be utilized for the company's operational and strategic initiatives, possibly to fund research and development, commercialization efforts, or to strengthen the company's balance sheet.Investors and analysts should monitor the subsequent utilization of these funds, as efficient deployment could lead to value creation, while any missteps might dilute existing shareholders' equity. The five-year expiration on the warrants provides a long-term horizon for investors, aligning with the typical development cycle of biotech firms. However, the need for shareholder approval for warrant exercise introduces an element of uncertainty that must be factored into the investment risk profile. Legal Expert bioAffinity Technologies' reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for the private placement of common warrants highlights a strategic approach to streamline the capital-raising process. This exemption allows the company to issue securities without the extensive disclosures typically required in public offerings, thus expediting the availability of funds and reducing administrative overhead. However, this also means that the securities are restricted, limiting their immediate liquidity for investors.It is crucial for stakeholders to understand the legal framework governing these transactions, including the implications of the shelf registration statement and the prospectus supplement. The adherence to SEC regulations, as evidenced by the use of an effective shelf registration statement and the filing of a prospectus supplement, is indicative of the company's commitment to regulatory compliance and transparency in its capital-raising activities. Market Research Analyst The biotechnology sector is capital-intensive and companies like bioAffinity Technologies often require substantial funding to advance their research and product pipelines. The decision to engage in a registered direct offering and concurrent private placement indicates that the company is seeking to capitalize on market conditions and investor sentiment. The role of WallachBeth Capital as the sole placement agent suggests a targeted approach to reach institutional investors who can provide significant capital injections and are typically more patient capital providers.Market participants should consider the broader industry context, where such capital raises are common as biotech firms navigate through various stages of development. The impact on the company's stock price will depend on market perception of the offering's terms and the potential for the company's growth. The long-term nature of the warrants could be seen as a vote of confidence by investors in the company's future prospects. 03/08/2024 - 01:15 PM JERSEY CITY, N.J., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WallachBeth Capital LLC, a leading provider of capital markets and institutional execution services, announced today that bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIAF and BIAFW) has closed a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 1,600,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and common warrants to purchase up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement (together with the registered direct offering) at a combined purchase price of $1.5625 per common share. The common warrants issued pursuant to the concurrent private placement will have an exercise price of $ 1.64 per share, are initially exercisable on the date that shareholder approval of the exercise of the warrants is obtained and will expire five years from the date of such approval.

Consumers can experience Tide evo at SXSW 2024, where they can witness firsthand the innovative features and benefits of the product. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Tide evo represents a significant innovation in the home care industry, potentially disrupting traditional laundry product formats. As a market research analyst, it's crucial to evaluate the product's alignment with current consumer trends towards environmentally friendly and convenient products. The shift from plastic to recyclable paperboard packaging and the focus on energy-saving cold water washing are in line with a growing consumer preference for sustainable household items. This could lead to an increase in market share for Tide, particularly among environmentally conscious consumers.Furthermore, the product's debut at SXSW—a hub for innovation and tech-savvy individuals—may enhance brand image and attract a younger demographic. The strategic choice of the Colorado market for the initial launch could be indicative of a targeted approach, considering Colorado's reputation for environmental awareness. The success in this market might set a precedent for national expansion and could serve as a litmus test for consumer acceptance of the new format. Environmental Sustainability Expert From an environmental perspective, the launch of Tide evo is noteworthy. The use of Forest Stewardship Council™ certified paper packaging and manufacturing in a facility powered by renewable energy addresses two critical environmental concerns: plastic pollution and carbon emissions. By designing Tide evo for cold water washing, the product not only reduces energy consumption for consumers but also could have a broader impact on reducing the carbon footprint associated with laundry.It's important to assess the life cycle of the product to understand the full environmental impact, from production to disposal. If Tide evo's paperboard packaging significantly reduces plastic waste and is effectively recycled, it could set a new standard in the industry, prompting competitors to follow suit and potentially influencing regulatory frameworks around packaging. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Tide evo's introduction are multifaceted. The claim that Tide evo is five times more effective at removing stains than competitive brands could justify a premium pricing strategy, potentially increasing Procter & Gamble's profit margins in the laundry segment. However, the investment in research and development over a decade and the costs associated with sustainable manufacturing and packaging need to be recuperated. It will be critical to monitor the product's sales performance and market penetration post-launch to assess the return on investment.Additionally, the impact on the stock market could be positive if Tide evo captures significant market share and boosts Procter & Gamble's overall revenue. Investors will be interested in sales data from the initial Colorado launch before predicting the national roll-out's success. If the product resonates well with consumers, it may lead to an upward trend in the company's stock price, reflecting investor confidence in the brand's innovative trajectory. 03/08/2024 - 01:30 PM A decade in the making, Tide evo brings design, convenience and breakthrough innovation together for the ultimate clean CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tide, America's #1 trusted laundry detergent brand, is excited to introduce Tide evo at SXSW 2024, marking a leap forward in laundry innovation driven by consumer insights.

Network-1's dividend policy includes semi-annual cash dividends of $0.05 per share. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for Network-1 Technologies indicate a significant shift in the company's revenue stream, with a year-over-year increase from no revenue to $2.6 million. This is a noteworthy development for investors as it reflects the company's ability to monetize its intellectual property through litigation settlements. However, the net loss of $1.457 million, despite the increase in revenue, suggests that the company's cost structure and contingent legal fees might be areas of concern.Furthermore, the increase in interest and dividend income aligns with the broader market trend of higher interest rates in 2023. The positive turnaround in gains from marketable securities also demonstrates a more favorable investment environment, which could be indicative of prudent financial management. Yet, these financial gains were not sufficient to offset the operational losses.The liquidity position, with over $45 million in cash and marketable securities, suggests a strong balance sheet. This is further supported by the company's confidence in its liquidity to fund future operations. The share repurchase program and consistent dividend policy are signals of management's commitment to returning value to shareholders. Nonetheless, the share repurchase strategy should be evaluated in the context of the company's long-term growth strategy and potential investment opportunities that could drive future revenue growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Network-1 Technologies' transition from a lack of revenue to generating income through litigation settlements is a strategic pivot that may influence investor perception. The ability to enforce and monetize patents is crucial in the intellectual property sector and successful litigation can serve as a deterrent against future infringements, potentially opening up new licensing opportunities.However, the dependence on litigation settlements for revenue may raise questions about the sustainability and predictability of future earnings. Investors typically prefer stable and recurring revenue streams and the reliance on one-off settlements could introduce volatility into the stock's performance. It is also important to consider the competitive landscape and the potential for Network-1 to secure additional licensing agreements without resorting to litigation.The share repurchase program, while underscoring confidence in the intrinsic value of the company's stock, may also reflect a lack of attractive investment opportunities to fuel organic growth. The continuation of dividend payments signals stability, but the Board's statement that the dividend policy is subject to periodic review could introduce uncertainty regarding future payouts. Legal Expert In the realm of intellectual property, Network-1 Technologies' focus on litigation to enforce patent rights is a critical aspect of their business strategy. The company's success in securing settlements highlights the strength and enforceability of its patent portfolio. However, the legal landscape is ever-changing and the potential for legislative or judicial shifts could impact the company's ability to leverage its intellectual property in the future.The increased legal expenses are indicative of the costs associated with litigation, which can be substantial. While the company has successfully monetized its Remote Power Patent, there is an inherent risk in relying heavily on litigation outcomes, which are unpredictable and can be influenced by various external factors.It is also essential to consider the broader implications of the company's litigation strategy on its reputation and relationships within the industry. Aggressive enforcement actions could potentially lead to strained relationships with other companies and may affect future collaboration or licensing agreements. 03/08/2024 - 05:00 PM NEW CANAAN, CT / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / Network-1 Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American:NTIP) (""Network-1""), a company engaged in acquiring, developing, licensing, and monetizing intellectual property, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.Network-1 had revenue of $2,601,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to no revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022.

Network-1incurred increases in operating expenses of $933,000 in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in costs of revenue of $874,000 related to contingent legal fees and incentive bonus compensation in connection with the litigation settlements.Interest and dividend income for 2023 was $1,868,000 as compared to interest and dividend income of $1,020,000 for 2022.

Wainwright & Co., LLC to raise up to US$375 million through the sale of common shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The proceeds will be used for capital expenditures, mining operations, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bitfarms Ltd.'s establishment of an at-the-market equity program is a strategic move that allows the company to raise capital flexibly and efficiently. By selling common shares at prevailing market prices, Bitfarms can potentially minimize dilution compared to fixed-price offerings. However, the impact on existing shareholders could be negative if the market perceives the potential sale of shares as a sign of liquidity issues or if the sales lead to significant dilution.Investors should consider the company's growth trajectory and the cryptocurrency market's volatility. The capital raised through this program is earmarked for expansion and operational costs, which could lead to increased mining capacity and revenue in the long term. Nonetheless, the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency prices and regulatory risks must be factored into the investment thesis. Legal Expert The ATM Program's legal structure, utilizing a prospectus supplement and a shelf registration statement, provides Bitfarms with a pre-approved mechanism to offer shares over a period. This method offers regulatory compliance and transparency to investors, as the details are accessible through SEDAR and EDGAR databases. It is crucial for potential investors to understand that these securities offerings are subject to market conditions and regulatory compliance, which can affect the timing and volume of sales. Market Research Analyst The cryptocurrency mining industry is highly competitive and energy-intensive. Bitfarms' decision to invest in capital expenditures to improve its mining operations could enhance its competitiveness by reducing energy costs and improving mining efficiency. However, the industry's future depends heavily on the regulatory environment and energy prices. Market analysts should monitor these factors closely as they can significantly influence Bitfarms' operational costs and, consequently, its stock performance. 03/08/2024 - 05:37 PM TORONTO, Ontario and BROSSARD, Québec, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bitfarms Ltd. (Nasdaq/TSX: BITF), a global Bitcoin vertically integrated company, announced that it has entered into an at-the-market offering agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) dated March 8, 2024 with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (the “Agent”) as agent, pursuant to which the Company established an at-the-market equity program (the “ATM Program”). Pursuant to the ATM Program, the Company may, at its discretion and from time-to-time during the term of the ATM Agreement, sell, through the Agent, such number of common shares of the Company (“Common Shares”) as would result in aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of up to US$375 million. Sales of Common Shares, if any, through the Agent will be made through “at-the-market” issuances, including without limitation, sales made directly on the Nasdaq Stock Market or another trading market for the shares in the United States at the market price prevailing at the time of each sale. No Common Shares will be offered or sold under the ATM Program on the TSX or any other trading market in Canada. The ATM Program may be terminated by either party at any time. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the ATM Program, if any, primarily on capital expenditures to support the growth and development of the Company’s existing mining operations as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. Since the Common Shares will be distributed at trading prices prevailing at the time of the sale, prices may vary between purchasers and during the period of distribution. The volume and timing of sales, if any, will be determined at the sole discretion of the Company's management and in accordance with the terms of the ATM Agreement. To date, no Common Shares have been distributed by the Company pursuant to the ATM Agreement. The offer and sale of the Common Shares under the ATM Program will be made by means of a prospectus supplement dated March 8, 2024 (the “Prospectus Supplement”) to the Company’s existing shelf prospectus dated November 10, 2023 (the “Base Shelf Prospectus” and, together with the Prospectus Supplement, the “Prospectus”) and U.S. registration statement on Form F-10 (the “Registration Statement”) (File No. 333-272989), which includes the Base Prospectus. The Prospectus Supplement has been filed with the applicable provincial regulatory authorities in Canada and the SEC. The Prospectus is available on the SEDAR website maintained by the Canadian Securities Administrators at http://www.sedar.com and is available on the SEC’s EDGAR website at http://www.sec.gov. This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these Common Shares in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

The company had not regained compliance within the initial 180-day grace period and faces delisting unless a hearing is requested by March 13, 2024. Positive None. Negative The company is at risk of delisting from Nasdaq if it fails to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule within the specified timeframe. Financial Analyst Aesthetic Medical International Holdings Group Limited's announcement of its intent to request a Nasdaq Hearings Panel for an extension to meet the minimum bid price requirement is a critical juncture for the company. The inability to maintain the minimum $1 bid price as per Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) signals potential liquidity issues and investor skepticism about the company's valuation. This development is particularly impactful for current and prospective investors as it raises concerns about the company's financial stability and future growth prospects. A delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq often results in reduced visibility in the market, diminished investor confidence and limited access to capital markets, which can be detrimental to a company's growth trajectory.Moreover, the trading of the company's securities on an over-the-counter (OTC) market post-delisting could result in lower trading volumes and higher volatility. This scenario typically leads to a more challenging environment for raising funds and dilutes the stock's attractiveness to institutional investors. It's imperative to monitor the company's strategic moves closely, including cost management and revenue enhancement initiatives, which could be pivotal in regaining compliance and investor trust. Market Research Analyst The aesthetic medical services industry in China is characterized by its rapid growth and increasing consumer demand for cosmetic procedures. However, the sector is also highly competitive and fragmented, with numerous players vying for market share. Aesthetic Medical International Holdings Group's current regulatory challenge with Nasdaq could be symptomatic of broader market pressures, including aggressive pricing strategies, regulatory changes and shifts in consumer preferences. From a market perspective, the company's ability to navigate these challenges and articulate a clear strategic vision will be crucial in differentiating itself from competitors.It's essential to assess the company's market positioning, service offerings and consumer engagement strategies. A successful turnaround plan could involve expanding into emerging markets, leveraging technological advancements, or forming strategic partnerships. These actions could potentially enhance the company's market share and improve its stock performance in the long term, notwithstanding the immediate hurdles posed by the Nasdaq compliance issue. Legal Expert The formal process of requesting a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel is a legal recourse available to companies facing delisting. It provides an opportunity for Aesthetic Medical International Holdings Group to present a plan of compliance and argue for the continued listing of its securities. The legal intricacies of this process involve demonstrating a credible strategy to achieve and sustain compliance with Nasdaq's requirements, which may include measures such as a reverse stock split or other corporate actions.While the company's securities remain tradable pending the hearing outcome, the overhang of potential delisting can still affect contractual agreements, such as debt covenants and partnerships, that may have clauses triggered by stock exchange listings. The company's legal team must navigate this process meticulously, ensuring transparent communication with stakeholders and adherence to SEC regulations. The outcome of the hearing will have significant legal implications for the company's operational and financial structure. 03/08/2024 - 05:30 PM SHENZHEN, China, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aesthetic Medical International Holdings Group Limited (Nasdaq: AIH) (the “Company” or “AIH”), a leading provider of aesthetic medical services in China, today announced that it will request a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel as the next step in the process in seeking an extension to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Rule”) for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). Reference is made to the form 6-K of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 8, 2023 (the “Previous Disclosure”) in relation to the letter the Company received from the Listing Qualifications Staff (the “Staff”) of Nasdaq notifying that, as of September 5, 2023, the Company’s securities had a closing bid price less than US$1.00 per share for more than 30 consecutive trading days, which is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement as set forth under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) for continued listing on the Nasdaq. The Company was provided a 180-calendar day grace period to regain compliance pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Previous Disclosure. On March 6, 2024, the Company received a notification letter (the “Notification Letter”) from the Staff of Nasdaq stating that, the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule within the 180-calendar day grace period and is not eligible for a second 180-calendar day grace period. Accordingly, the Staff had determined to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq unless the Company requests a hearing no later than 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 13, 2024. The Company intends to timely submit the request for a hearing. This request will ordinarily stay any further action by the Staff and the Company’s securities are expected to continue to be eligible to trade on Nasdaq at least pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process.

(TSX: ETG) (OTCQB: ERLFF) – the ""Company"" or ""Entrée"") has today filed its annual operational and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. All numbers are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. 2023 HIGHLIGHTS Oyu Tolgoi Underground Development Update The Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia includes two separate land holdings: the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence, which is held by Oyu Tolgoi LLC (""OTLLC"") and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property, which is a joint venture partnership between Entrée and OTLLC. Rio Tinto International Holdings Ltd. (""Rio Tinto"") owns 66% of OTLLC and is the manager of operations at Oyu Tolgoi. Ramp up of the Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 underground mine, which incorporates the development of three panels (Panels 0, 1, and 2), continued during 2023. Oyu Tolgoi is set to become the fourth largest copper mine in the world by 2030, with the operation expected to deliver average mined copper production of ~500 ktpa between 2028 and 2036. On March 13, 2023, Rio Tinto announced the commencement of underground production from Oyu Tolgoi Lift 1 Panel 0 on the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence. As at December 31, 2023, 86 Lift 1 Panel 0 draw bells had been opened, including 67 draw bells during 2023.Construction of conveyor to surface works continued to plan and was approaching 88% completion at the end of the year. Commissioning is expected in the second half 2024. Construction works for the concentrator conversion also remains on schedule. Commissioning is expected to be progressively completed between the fourth quarter 2024 through to the second quarter 2025. Construction of Primary Crusher 2 commenced in December 2023 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2025.Shaft sinking continued during 2023. At the end of December, Shaft 3 reached 923 metres below ground level (82% sunk) and Shaft 4 reached 1,013 metres below ground level (86% sunk). Final depths required for Shafts 3 and 4 are 1,130 metres and 1,176 metres below ground level, respectively. OTLLC expects both shafts to be commissioned in the second half 2024.Technical studies for Panels 1 and 2 mine design and schedule optimization were completed by OTLLC during the second quarter 2023. The Hugo North Extension (""HNE"") deposit on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property is located at the northern portion of Panel 1. According to Rio Tinto:The technical studies have resulted in substantially de-risked, resilient mine designs that provide a pathway to ramp-up, flexibility to pursue value creating opportunities and react to future risks, and improved stability, constructability, and operability. The studies also provide a pathway to bring the panels into production faster and maximize the use of the ventilation system. Identified risks associated with the previous Panel 1 mine design have been resolved by increasing draw point and rim drive spacing, relocating the central material handling system and return raises outside of the active caving area, and optimally orienting the extraction drives and drill drives.Panel 1 production on the Oyu Tolgoi mining licence is anticipated to commence in ~2027.The technical studies have been incorporated into OTLLC's 2023 Oyu Tolgoi Feasibility Study (""OTFS23"") which has been submitted to and is under review by applicable regulatory bodies in Mongolia. Entrée is currently reviewing OTFS23 but does not anticipate any material changes to underground development cost or schedule for the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property.Rio Tinto reported during its July 11, 2023 investor site visit that with the technical studies for Panels 1 and 2 completed, attention is shifting to the design of Lift 2. Drilling programs to support a Lift 2 Pre-Feasibility Study are in progress. An updated resource model for Hugo North (including Hugo North Extension) is expected to be completed in 2024 and will include mineralization from Lift 2.Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property First Lift 1 Panel 1 development work on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence is expected to commence in 2024. Development work will start in the southwest corner of the HNE deposit and will establish the initial Panel 1 western ore handling truck chute, including extraction level tipple development, the truck chute chamber on the haulage level, and the supporting ventilation loop with the return air level. OTLLC has advised the Company all 2024 development will be in rock classified as waste which will be stockpiled separately and sampled in accordance with OTLLC's standard sampling protocols and procedures.In 2023, OTLLC completed an in-fill diamond drilling program at HNE comprising both underground holes (25 holes totaling ~6,577 metres drilled on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence) and surface holes (7 holes totaling ~6,753 metres). Additional HNE underground and surface in-fill diamond drilling on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence is planned for 2024 (~14,128 metres of underground drilling in 25 holes and ~6,840 metres of surface drilling in 4 holes). The principal purpose for the drilling is to support the Lift 2 Pre-Feasibility Study and the updated resource model for Hugo North (including Hugo North Extension).OTLLC is also proposing ~8,785 metres of diamond drilling in 5 surface holes on the Heruga deposit (Javhlant mining licence) in 2024 to increase ore body knowledge and support an Order of Magnitude Study. No drilling has been conducted on the Heruga deposit since 2008. In 2023, OTLLC completed an exploration program on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence that included 2,880 metres of diamond drilling in 4 holes and a 40.4 line kilometre dipole-dipole induced polarization geophysical survey at Ulaan Khud South. OTLLC also completed integrated geological-geophysical 3D modelling at the Airstrip and Ductile Shear targets.2023 exploration on the Javhlant mining licence included 2,263.4 metres of diamond drilling in 3 holes and a 39.6 line kilometre dipole-dipole induced polarization geophysical survey at the Railway target. Integrated geological-geophysical 3D modelling was completed at the SEIP, West Mag and East Bumbat Ulaan targets.OTLLC is in the process of finalizing an exploration program and budget for 2024. On the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence, the program is expected to focus on the Airstrip and Ulaan Khud South targets, including ~2,500 metres of diamond drilling at Ulaan Khud South and geological and geophysical studies. On the Javhlant mining licence, work will be conducted on the Bumbat Ulaan, East Bumbat Ulaan, and West Heruga targets and will include ~1,800 metres of reverse circulation drilling at Bumbat Ulaan, diamond drilling at West Heruga, and geological studies.Corporate For the 2023 fiscal year, the Company's operating loss was $4.5 million compared to $3.6 million in 2022. The increase from 2023 was mainly due to legal costs for both commercial negotiations with OTLLC and Rio Tinto and the arbitration proceedings.For the 2023 fiscal year, the operating cash outflow before changes in non-cash working capital items was $3.1 million compared to $2.4 million in 2022.Share purchase warrants to purchase 5,139,000 common shares with an exercise price of C$0.60 were exercised resulting in gross proceeds of C$3.1 million being received by the Company for the 2023 fiscal year.Stock options to purchase 1,200,000 common shares with exercise prices ranging from C$0.55 to C$0.77 were exercised resulting in gross proceeds of C$0.7 million being received by the Company.As at December 31, 2023, the cash balance was $6.1 million and the working capital balance was $6.1 million.On September 5, 2023, the Company voluntarily filed a Form 15 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for the purpose of terminating the registration of the Company's common shares under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"") and suspending its reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The Company's common shares have not traded on a national securities exchange in the United States since the Company voluntarily withdrew its common shares from listing on NYSE American LLC in 2019. The Company's shares continue to trade in Canada on the Toronto Stock Exchange (""TSX"") under the symbol ""ETG"" and in the United States on the Over-the-Counter OTCQB Venture Market under the symbol ""ERLFF"".OUTLOOK AND STRATEGY Entrée's primary objective is to confirm the transfer of the Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences to OTLLC as contemplated by the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi joint venture agreement (the ""Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA""), either in conjunction with finalization, execution, and closing of an agreement with OTLLC to restructure or amend the existing Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA to streamline the operating environment for both parties, or enforcement of certain provisions of the 2004 Equity Participation and Earn-in Agreement (the ""Earn-in Agreement"") and Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA pursuant to binding arbitration proceedings commenced by the Company in 2022. The Company currently is registered in Mongolia as the 100% ultimate holder of the licences. The commencement of arbitration proceedings followed protracted discussions with Rio Tinto and OTLLC to confirm the transfer of the Shivee Tolgoi and Javhlant mining licences to OTLLC. The arbitration was commenced in Vancouver, British Columbia under the International Commercial Arbitration Act (British Columbia). A three-member Tribunal has been appointed and a merits hearing has been set for April 2024. Notwithstanding the commencement of arbitration proceedings, the Company remains committed to seeking a commercial resolution with Rio Tinto and OTLLC and the parties continue to make progress. Any definitive agreement reached between the Company and OTLLC to restructure or amend the existing Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA would be subject to TSX acceptance and the requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions applicable to a related party transaction. There are no assurances that a definitive agreement will be finalized and executed, or if finalized and executed, that the transaction would close. The Company is also in discussions with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (the State-owned company that holds the Government's 34% interest in OTLLC) regarding the potential for the Government of Mongolia and Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC to conclude an agreement with the Company for the State to share in 34% of the economic benefit of the Company's interest in the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. The Minerals Law of Mongolia provides the State may share in up to 34% of the economic benefit derived from exploitation of a mineral deposit of strategic importance where proven reserves were determined through funding sources other than the State budget. The Hugo North Extension copper-gold deposit on the Shivee Tolgoi mining licence and the Heruga copper-gold-molybdenum deposit on the Javhlant mining licence are mineral deposits of strategic importance. SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS Operating Loss During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's operating loss was $4.5 million compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Project expenditures in 2023 included expenditures for professional and advisory fees related to advancing a potential restructuring of, or amendments to, the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA. The increase from 2022 to 2023 was due to legal costs for both commercial negotiations with OTLLC and Rio Tinto and the arbitration proceedings. General and administration expenditures in 2023 was comparable to 2022 with cost increases related to inflation. Depreciation expense in 2023 was consistent with 2022. Non-operating Items The foreign exchange (gain) loss in 2023 was primarily the result of movements between the C$ and US dollar as the Company holds its cash in both currencies and the loan payable is denominated in US dollars. Interest expense was primarily related to the loan payable to OTLLC pursuant to the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JVA and is subject to a variable interest rate. The amount recognized as a loss from equity investee is related to exploration costs on the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi JV Property. Deferred revenue finance costs are related to recording the non-cash finance costs associated with the deferred revenue balance, specifically the Sandstorm Gold Ltd. stream. The total assets as at December 31, 2023 were lower than at December 31, 2022 due to a lower cash balance from operating activities. Total non-current liabilities have increased since December 31, 2022 due to recording the non-cash deferred revenue finance costs each quarter.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The inclusion of Linde plc into the Nasdaq-100 Index and its related indices signifies a notable shift in the composition of these key benchmarks. This change reflects Linde's growth and its increasing market capitalization, which has evidently met the criteria for inclusion in these indices. The Nasdaq-100 Index is often used as a barometer for investor sentiment and market trends, particularly in the technology and non-financial sectors. Linde's addition might be indicative of the broader market's recognition of the industrial gas sector's stability and potential for growth.From a market perspective, stocks included in major indices typically experience increased visibility and investor interest, which can lead to greater liquidity and potentially a more stable shareholder base. For current and potential investors, this could mean a reevaluation of Linde's stock, considering its new status as part of a major index, which often attracts index funds and passive investment strategies. Financial Analyst The transition of Linde plc into the Nasdaq-100 Index may have several financial implications. Historically, the inclusion in such an index can lead to a short-term increase in stock price due to the demand surge from index-tracking funds and ETFs that are required to hold shares of the index's constituents. In the longer term, the impact on the stock price will depend on Linde's financial performance and its alignment with the overall index's movement.Investors should consider the potential for increased volatility around the inclusion date as portfolios adjust to the new composition. Additionally, the removal of Splunk Inc. from these indices could result in a temporary sell-off from index funds that may no longer hold the stock, affecting its liquidity and potentially its price. ESG Investment Analyst Linde's addition to the Nasdaq-100 ESG Index is particularly noteworthy, as this suggests the company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices are aligning with investor expectations for sustainable and responsible business operations. This could attract a new segment of socially conscious investors and could signal to the market that Linde is committed to maintaining high ESG standards. For stakeholders, this inclusion could be seen as a validation of Linde's ESG efforts and may encourage further integration of sustainable practices in their business strategy.For investors focused on ESG criteria, the reassessment of Linde's ESG performance compared to industry norms will be crucial. They will be looking for transparency in Linde's ESG reporting and how its practices compare with peers. The company's future performance in these areas will be closely watched, as any discrepancies or improvements could significantly influence investor perception and the company's standing within the ESG investment community. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 PM NEW YORK, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced that Linde plc (Nasdaq: LIN), will become a component of the Nasdaq-100 Index® (Nasdaq: NDX®), the Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted™ Index (Nasdaq: NDXE™), the Nasdaq-100 Ex-Tech Sector™ Index (Nasdaq: NDXX™), and the Nasdaq-100 ESG™ Index (Nasdaq: NDXESG™) prior to market open on Monday, March 18, 2024.

Revenues also declined for the same period. The company recognized non-cash expenses in 2023 affecting the comparison. Positive None. Negative Net income decreased from $16,574,000 in Q3 2023 to $92,000 in Q3 2024, and from $22,107,000 in the first nine months of 2023 to $2,546,000 in the first nine months of 2024. Revenues also declined from $31,833,000 in Q3 2023 to $12,689,000 in Q3 2024, and from $35,975,000 in the first nine months of 2023 to $9,117,000 in the first nine months of 2024. In Q3 2023, AMREP had non-cash expenses including a pension settlement expense of $2,336,000 and a tax benefit of $16,071,000 which impacted the comparison with 2024 financials. Financial Analyst The reported net income of AMREP Corporation for its 2024 fiscal third quarter signifies a substantial decrease when compared to the same period of the prior year. This decline from $16,574,000 to $92,000 could potentially raise concerns among investors regarding the company's profitability and operational efficiency. The decrease in net income is also reflected in the earnings per diluted share, dropping from $3.12 to just $0.02. Such a stark contrast may suggest underlying issues that need to be addressed or could be indicative of significant one-time events that affected the previous year's profitability.It is also noteworthy that the revenues for the third quarter increased year-over-year, from $9,117,000 to $12,689,000, which could indicate growth in the company's core business activities. However, the nine-month revenue comparison shows a decrease, which might suggest variability in the company's revenue streams or possibly seasonal factors at play. Investors might be interested in the company's strategies to stabilize and grow revenues in future quarters.The previous year's figures were influenced by a non-cash pre-tax pension settlement expense and a non-cash income tax benefit, which are non-recurring items and could have significantly inflated the net income for that period. When evaluating the company's performance, it is crucial to consider these one-time factors to gain a more accurate picture of the ongoing financial health of the business. Market Research Analyst The financial results of AMREP Corporation, particularly the decline in net income, could have implications for the company's stock market performance. Investors often react to earnings reports and a decline of this magnitude could lead to volatility in the company’s stock price. It is essential to analyze the company's market position, competitive landscape and the broader economic environment to understand the potential impact on its stock.Additionally, the increase in quarterly revenue despite the overall decrease in net income suggests that while AMREP may be growing its sales, it could be facing higher costs or inefficiencies that are impacting its bottom line. Understanding the reasons behind these financial dynamics is crucial for stakeholders to assess the company's future profitability and investment potential.Given the complexity of the financial results, with both positive and negative indicators, investors and analysts will likely scrutinize the company's forthcoming explanations and strategic plans to address the challenges and leverage growth opportunities in its market segments. Economist From an economic perspective, the financial performance of AMREP Corporation, as reported, may be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as market demand, input costs and labor market conditions. The substantial year-over-year decline in net income might reflect broader economic trends that could be affecting the industry or the company specifically. For instance, if input costs have risen due to inflationary pressures, this could squeeze profit margins despite increasing revenues.Moreover, the company's ability to adapt to economic changes and maintain financial stability is critical for long-term success. The reported figures suggest that while the company may be increasing sales, it is not translating into net income at the same rate, which could imply issues with cost management or pricing strategies. An economist would also consider the potential impact of interest rates on the company's debt servicing costs and investment decisions.Overall, the economic analysis should take into account the cyclical nature of the business, the economic environment and industry-specific challenges to provide a comprehensive view of the company's financial results and future prospects. 03/08/2024 - 04:40 PM HAVERTOWN, Pa., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMREP Corporation (NYSE:AXR) today reported net income of $92,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, for its 2024 fiscal third quarter ended January 31, 2024 compared to net income of $16,574,000, or $3.12 per diluted share, for the same period of the prior year.

The company aims to buy back up to €1 billion worth of shares by June 5, 2024, with detailed transaction information available on their corporate website.","Weekly Report (March 1-7, 2024) on the First Tranche of Stellantis 2024 Share Buyback Program Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary Stellantis N.V. announces the first tranche of its 2024 Share Buyback Program, repurchasing over 3.7 million common shares for €176.76 million. The company aims to buy back up to €1 billion worth of shares by June 5, 2024, with detailed transaction information available on their corporate website. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Stellantis N.V.'s recent share buyback announcement is a financial maneuver that can have several implications on the company's stock valuation and investor sentiment. Share buybacks are often viewed positively by the market as they can indicate a management's confidence in the company's future prospects and a belief that the stock is undervalued. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, buybacks can increase earnings per share (EPS), a key metric for valuing a company's stock.However, the effectiveness of such programs depends on the purchase price relative to intrinsic value and the company's alternative investment opportunities. In the case of Stellantis, the buyback is substantial, allocating up to €1 billion for the repurchase of shares. This action suggests that the company prioritizes returning value to shareholders over other potential uses of capital, such as investment in new projects or paying down debt.Investors should monitor the average purchase price and compare it to the company's historical valuations to assess the buyback's success. The repurchase at an average price of €24.7277 per share may be seen as a strategic move if the management believes that the shares are trading below their intrinsic value. The disclosed transactions also provide transparency, allowing investors to scrutinize the execution of the buyback program. Market Research Analyst The automotive industry, where Stellantis operates, is currently undergoing significant transformation with the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technology. In this context, share buyback programs can signal to the market that the company is financially robust and expects to navigate the industry's changes successfully. However, it is important to consider the opportunity cost of such buybacks, especially in an industry that requires heavy investment in research and development (R&D) to remain competitive.Stellantis' decision to allocate a considerable sum for share repurchases could be interpreted in different ways. On one hand, it could reassure investors about the company's liquidity and balance sheet strength. On the other hand, stakeholders might question if this capital could have been better spent on technological advancements or strategic acquisitions to secure a competitive edge in the evolving market.The timing of the buyback program is also crucial; if executed during a market dip, the company could benefit from purchasing its own shares at a lower price, potentially yielding better returns for shareholders when the market recovers. Economist From an economic perspective, share buyback programs can be influenced by macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates, inflation and overall market sentiment. In a low-interest-rate environment, companies may prefer to return capital to shareholders through buybacks rather than holding excess cash or making low-yield investments. Conversely, high-interest rates could make debt servicing more expensive, which would require careful consideration of capital allocation decisions.Stellantis' buyback program coincides with a period marked by economic recovery from the pandemic and potential shifts in monetary policy. The company's actions could be seen as a strategic deployment of capital, balancing the need to reward shareholders and maintain financial flexibility against an uncertain economic backdrop.It is also essential to consider the broader economic implications of such buybacks, including their impact on income distribution among shareholders. While buybacks can boost stock prices, benefiting shareholders, they may also reduce the funds available for employee compensation and investment in labor, which can have broader economic consequences. 03/08/2024 - 12:38 PM Weekly Report (March 1-7, 2024) on the First Tranche of Stellantis 2024 Share Buyback Program AMSTERDAM, March 8, 2024 - Stellantis N.V.

(CSTL) announces data presentations at AAD Annual Meeting showcasing improved survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma using DecisionDx-Melanoma test. The company's gene expression profile tests demonstrate effectiveness in guiding personalized care for skin cancer patients. Positive Castle Biosciences presents findings at AAD Annual Meeting confirming DecisionDx-Melanoma test improves survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Data from a study of over 5,000 patients supports the efficacy of Castle's gene expression profile tests in guiding patient care. Abstracts presented at AAD highlight the use of DecisionDx-Melanoma and DecisionDx-SCC tests in improving risk assessment and treatment decisions for skin cancer patients. Castle's MyPath Melanoma diagnostic test aids in diagnosing invasive melanoma, reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment for challenging lesions. The company's collaborations with leading dermatologists aim to empower clinicians and patients with actionable information for better outcomes. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The study on the DecisionDx-Melanoma test is a significant advancement in the management of cutaneous melanoma (CM), particularly for patients under the age of 65. From an oncological perspective, the ability to stratify patients based on their risk of melanoma-specific death is crucial. Aggressive management strategies, such as increased imaging surveillance for those identified as high-risk, can lead to earlier detection of recurrence. This is important because lower tumor burdens are generally associated with better responses to treatment. The implications of this study are substantial, as they could lead to a shift in how younger CM patients are monitored post-diagnosis, potentially improving survival rates. Medical Research Analyst The data presented on the DecisionDx-SCC (40-GEP) test contributes to the field of precision medicine. The utilization of the test in clinical settings indicates that it is being adopted according to intended use indications, which is pivotal for the test's credibility and applicability in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cases. Over 70% of patients being classified as lower biological risk for metastasis (Class 1) suggests that the test could be effective in reducing overtreatment. Furthermore, the test's ability to provide independent risk assessment from clinicopathological presentation supports its integration into clinical decision-making processes. This could lead to more personalized treatment plans, which is a key goal in modern oncology. Market Research Analyst Castle Biosciences' presentations at the AAD Annual Meeting showcase the company's commitment to innovation in dermatologic diagnostics. The clinical adoption of their gene expression profile (GEP) tests, such as DecisionDx-Melanoma and DecisionDx-SCC, reflects positively on the company's market position. By demonstrating the clinical utility of these tests, Castle Biosciences could see increased demand from healthcare providers seeking to improve patient outcomes. This could potentially lead to sustained revenue growth as the tests become standard practice in the management of skin cancers. Moreover, the company's ability to leverage existing RNA-based testing in the diagnostic workflow to provide quick, actionable results with the MyPath Melanoma test further strengthens its competitive edge in the precision medicine space. 03/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Castle’s presentations at AAD include the latest findings from the Company’s ongoing collaboration with the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program Registries, providing new data from a study of more than 5,000 patients confirming that testing with DecisionDx®-Melanoma is associated with improved survival in patients with cutaneous melanoma (CM) FRIENDSWOOD, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Castle Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: CSTL), a company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care, today announced that it will share data across its dermatologic portfolio of gene expression profile (GEP) tests via oral and electronic poster presentations at the 2024 AAD Annual Meeting, taking place March 8-12 in San Diego. “Our presentations at the 2024 AAD Annual Meeting add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of our tests in guiding improved, personalized care for patients with skin cancers,” said Robert Cook, Ph.D., senior vice president of research and development at Castle Biosciences. “In collaboration with leading dermatologists dedicated to advancing patient care, we are excited to share our latest findings which highlight how our tests are empowering both clinicians and patients with meaningful, clinically actionable information that can refine risk and inform important treatment decisions.” Castle will present the following abstracts at AAD. Abstract content will be available throughout the meeting in the online viewing portal and at the on-site viewing stations, and will also be published online in the Fall 2024 Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD) supplement. DecisionDx®-Melanoma Oral Poster Presentation Title: 31-GEP testing is associated with improved melanoma-specific survival relative to untested patients: an analysis of patients <65 years old Presenter and Lead Author: Michael Tassavor, M.D., Skin Cancer Center, Cincinnati Abstract Number: 51667 Date: March 9, 2024 Time: 4:50-4:55 p.m. Pacific Time Location: San Diego Convention Center (Upper Level, Sails Pavilion, Poster Center 1) Summary: For patients with CM, the median age at diagnosis is 66 years old, suggesting that almost half of newly diagnosed patients are younger than 65. In this large study of unselected, clinically tested patients with CM who were under 65 (n=5,183), the DecisionDx-Melanoma (31-GEP) test identified patients at higher risk of melanoma-specific death who may benefit from more aggressive management, including imaging surveillance. In the study, use of the DecisionDx-Melanoma test was associated with improved melanoma-specific survival relative to untested patients. This is clinically significant, as identifying high-risk patients allows for earlier detection of recurrence, while the tumor burden is lower, which has been shown to lead to better response to therapy. DecisionDx®-SCC Oral Poster Presentation Title: Consistent utilization of the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test in high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) by clinicians according to intended use indications Presenter and Lead Author: Jane Yoo, M.D., Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Abstract Number: 54153 Date: March 9, 2024 Time: 10:30-10:35 a.m. Pacific Time Location: San Diego Convention Center (Upper Level, Sails Pavilion, Poster Center 2) Summary: This study provides summary metrics regarding DecisionDx-SCC (40-GEP) test results and patient risk factors for tumor samples clinically tested in the first three years of the test’s availability between September 2020 and August 2023 (n=16,930). The study data demonstrate that clinicians are utilizing the DecisionDx-SCC test appropriately for patients with high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). These patients are at a higher risk of poor outcomes compared to the general SCC patient population, yet over 70% of patients received a Decision-SCC Class 1 test result, indicating they are at a lower biological risk for metastasis. Each DecisionDx-SCC Class result was present in the various subgroupings of risk factors in the study (patients with 1-2, 3-4 and more than 5 risk factors), demonstrating that the test provides independent risk assessment from clinicopathological presentation. These data support incorporating the test’s results into clinical practice to improve the accuracy of risk predictions to guide more personalized treatment plans for patients. MyPath® Melanoma ePoster Title: Enabling access to prognostic gene expression profile (GEP) testing for invasive melanoma by leveraging RNA-based testing in the diagnostic workflow Abstract Number: 52819 Summary: Reaching a definitive diagnosis of melanoma can be challenging. Ancillary testing can provide clarity and a definitive diagnosis for problematic lesions. The MyPath Melanoma (23-GEP) diagnostic test returns accurate results quickly, with approximately 80% of cases tested receiving an actionable result in a median of four business days. Between March 1 and July 31, 2023, approximately 60% of ambiguous lesions tested with MyPath received a benign test result, potentially reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment for diagnostically challenging lesions. Lesions that receive a malignant test result (approximately 20% of lesions tested with MyPath in the five-month study timeframe) can be tested with the DecisionDx-Melanoma risk stratification test, using the same extracted tumor material when available, to inform risk-aligned decisions about sentinel lymph node biopsy, surveillance imaging and patient follow-up schedules. Approximately 80% of clinically tested lesions with a malignant MyPath result have sufficient biopsy tumor content for DecisionDx-Melanoma testing. About DecisionDx-Melanoma DecisionDx-Melanoma is a gene expression profile risk stratification test. It is designed to inform two clinical questions in the management of cutaneous melanoma: a patient’s individual risk of sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity and a patient's personal risk of melanoma recurrence and/or metastasis. By integrating tumor biology with clinical and pathologic factors using a validated proprietary algorithm, DecisionDx-Melanoma is designed to provide a comprehensive and clinically actionable result to guide risk-aligned patient care. DecisionDx-Melanoma has been shown to be associated with improved patient survival and has been studied in more than 10,000 patient samples. DecisionDx-Melanoma’s clinical value is supported by 50 peer-reviewed and published studies, providing confidence in disease management plans that incorporate the test’s results. Through Dec. 31, 2023, DecisionDx-Melanoma has been ordered more than 150,000 times for patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma. About DecisionDx-SCC DecisionDx-SCC is a 40-gene expression profile test that uses an individual patient’s tumor biology to predict individual risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma metastasis for patients with one or more risk factors. The test result, in which patients are stratified into a Class 1 (low), Class 2A (higher) or Class 2B (highest) risk category, predicts individual metastatic risk to inform risk-appropriate management. Peer-reviewed publications have demonstrated that DecisionDx-SCC is an independent predictor of metastatic risk and that integrating DecisionDx-SCC with current prognostic methods can add positive predictive value to clinician decisions regarding staging and management. About MyPath Melanoma MyPath Melanoma is Castle’s gene expression profile test designed to provide an accurate, objective result to aid dermatopathologists and dermatologists in characterizing difficult-to-diagnose melanocytic lesions. Of the approximately two million suspicious pigmented lesions biopsied annually in the U.S., Castle estimates that approximately 300,000 of those cannot be confidently classified as either benign or malignant through traditional histopathology methods. For these cases, the treatment plan can also be uncertain. Obtaining accurate, objective ancillary testing can mean the difference between a path of overtreatment or the risk of undertreatment. Interpreted in the context of other clinical, laboratory and histopathologic information, MyPath Melanoma is designed to reduce uncertainty and provide confidence for dermatopathologists and help dermatologists deliver more informed patient management plans. About Castle Biosciences Castle Biosciences (Nasdaq: CSTL) is a leading diagnostics company improving health through innovative tests that guide patient care. The Company aims to transform disease management by keeping people first: patients, clinicians, employees and investors. Castle’s current portfolio consists of tests for skin cancers, Barrett’s esophagus, mental health conditions and uveal melanoma.

Financial Analyst The recent filing of audited Year-End Financial Statements by International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. provides investors with crucial information on the company's financial health and operational performance. A detailed analysis of the financial statements would reveal trends in revenue, expenses and net income, which are critical in assessing the company's profitability and growth potential. Investors would also scrutinize the Management Discussion and Analysis section for management's perspective on the past year's results and future outlook.The announcement of a non-brokered private placement, raising approximately US$2.5 million through the issuance of common shares, is a strategic move that indicates the company's approach to financing its operations without relying on intermediaries. This capital injection could signal confidence from existing major shareholders and might affect the company's stock price due to the dilution of existing shares. However, the price per common share at which the Private Placement was conducted would be compared against the current market price to evaluate its impact on shareholder value.

This proactive approach could potentially mitigate future environmental risks and align with increasing regulatory and investor demands for sustainable and responsible mining practices.Investors with an interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors would consider this news positively, as it suggests the company is actively working to minimize its environmental footprint. The long-term benefits of such initiatives include a stronger social license to operate and possibly smoother regulatory processes. However, the costs and time associated with these environmental measures will need to be weighed against their potential to enhance the company's reputation and operational efficiencies. 03/08/2024 - 12:05 PM VANCOUVER, BC, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.

The notes are convertible at the option of holders and will bear interest at 1.50% per year, with an initial conversion rate of 6.7927 shares of iRhythm's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes. The net proceeds from the offering are estimated to be approximately $643.6 million, with intended uses for general corporate purposes and repayment of debt. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of iRhythm Technologies' offering of Convertible Senior Notes is a significant financial event that warrants attention from investors and market analysts. The issuance of $661.25 million in Convertible Senior Notes at a 1.50% interest rate, with an option for investors to convert these into equity, is indicative of the company's strategic financial management to optimize its capital structure. The conversion premium of approximately 35.0% above the recent stock price suggests a positive outlook on the company's future value, potentially signaling growth expectations.From a financial perspective, the use of proceeds to repay existing debt and repurchase shares is a move that can be seen as a commitment to reducing leverage and possibly signaling confidence in the intrinsic value of the company's stock. The repurchase of shares at $109.05, coupled with the capped call transactions, is designed to minimize dilution from the conversion of notes and manage potential impacts on the stock price. These financial maneuvers may be interpreted as management's confidence in the company's prospects and a commitment to shareholder value. Market Research Analyst iRhythm's actions in the financial markets could have ripple effects on investor sentiment and the stock's trading dynamics. The capped call transactions are particularly noteworthy as they are structured to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of notes and provide a hedge against the equity price over the cap. This indicates that the company is proactively managing market expectations and potential equity price volatility post-conversion. The premium of 100.0% over the closing price on the cap also reflects the management's bullish view on the stock's potential upside.The market could respond to these developments with increased trading activity, especially as the capped call counterparties engage in derivative transactions and stock purchases. While these activities are intended to establish initial hedges, they can also influence market prices in the short term, affecting both the common stock and the convertible notes. Investors will monitor these dynamics closely as they can impact conversion decisions and the overall market perception of iRhythm's financial health and growth trajectory. Legal Expert The private placement of Convertible Senior Notes to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A is a sophisticated legal maneuver that allows iRhythm to raise capital efficiently while complying with securities regulations. This exemption from SEC registration requirements enables a quicker capital raise but limits the pool of investors to those who meet certain financial sophistication criteria. It's crucial to note that the securities, including any shares of common stock issued upon conversion, are not registered under the Securities Act, which restricts their liquidity and transferability.Moreover, the legal stipulations regarding the convertibility conditions, redemption rights and repurchase obligations under a fundamental change provide a structured framework that governs the notes. These terms are legally binding and protect both the issuer and the note holders, setting clear expectations on how the notes can be managed through their lifecycle. For investors, understanding these legal complexities is essential when assessing the risk and strategic implications of holding such financial instruments. 03/08/2024 - 04:30 PM SAN FRANCISCO, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iRhythm Technologies, Inc. (“iRhythm”) (NASDAQ: IRTC), a leading digital health care company focused on creating trusted solutions that detect, predict and help prevent disease, announced today the closing of its offering of 1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “notes”) for gross proceeds of $661.25 million in a private placement to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The proceeds include the full exercise of the option granted by iRhythm to the initial purchasers of the notes to purchase up to an additional $86.25 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes are senior, unsecured obligations of iRhythm, and will bear interest at a rate of 1.50% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2024. The notes will mature on September 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the notes. Prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2029, the notes are convertible at the option of holders of the notes only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and thereafter, the notes are convertible at the option of holders at any time until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, regardless of whether such conditions have been met. Upon conversion, the notes may be settled in shares of iRhythm’s common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of iRhythm’s common stock, at the election of iRhythm. The initial conversion rate is 6.7927 shares of iRhythm’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $147.22 per share of iRhythm’s common stock, representing an approximate 35.0% premium based on the last reported sale price of iRhythm’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 4, 2024 of $109.05 per share). The initial conversion rate and the corresponding conversion price are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Prior to September 5, 2027, the notes are not redeemable. On or after September 5, 2027, and prior to June 1, 2029, iRhythm may redeem for cash all or part of the notes, at its option, subject to a partial redemption limitation, if the last reported sale price of iRhythm’s common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which iRhythm provides notice of redemption. Holders of the notes have the right to require iRhythm to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture relating to the notes). iRhythm is also required to increase, in certain circumstances, the conversion rate for holders who convert their notes in connection with certain fundamental changes occurring prior to the maturity date or convert their notes called (or deemed called) for redemption following the delivery by iRhythm of a notice of redemption. iRhythm estimates that the net proceeds from the offering are approximately $643.6 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses payable by iRhythm. iRhythm used approximately $72.4 million of the net proceeds from the offering to pay the cost of the capped call transactions, as described below. In addition, iRhythm used approximately $80.2 million of the net proceeds from the offering for the repayment in full of the indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and related fees, under iRhythm’s Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”), with Braidwell Transaction Holdings LLC – Series 5, which consisted of borrowings under the initial tranche of the Loan Agreement’s term loan facility. iRhythm also used approximately $25.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase 229,252 shares of iRhythm’s common stock in connection with the offering at a purchase price of $109.05 per share in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate. These repurchases could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of iRhythm’s common stock, and could result in a higher effective conversion price for the notes. iRhythm intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include sales and marketing activities, medical affairs and educational efforts, research and development and clinical studies, and working capital, capital expenditures, and investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies in the future. However, iRhythm has no commitments or specific plans with respect to any such investments in and acquisitions of other companies, products or technologies at this time. In connection with the pricing of the notes and the full exercise of the option by the initial purchasers to purchase additional notes, iRhythm entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain financial institutions (the “capped call counterparties”). The capped call transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of iRhythm’s common stock that will initially underlie the notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to iRhythm’s common stock upon conversion of the notes and/or offset any cash payments that iRhythm could be required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap equal to $218.10 per share, which represents a premium of 100.0% over the closing price of iRhythm’s common stock of $109.05 per share on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 4, 2024. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the capped call counterparties have advised iRhythm that they and their respective affiliates expect to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to iRhythm’s common stock and/or purchase iRhythm’s common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the notes. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of iRhythm’s common stock or the notes at that time. In addition, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to iRhythm’s common stock and/or purchasing or selling iRhythm’s common stock or other securities of iRhythm in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the notes and prior to the maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes or following any repurchase of notes by iRhythm in connection with any optional redemption, fundamental change repurchase or otherwise, in each case, if iRhythm elects to unwind a corresponding portion of the capped call transactions in connection with such conversion or such redemption or repurchase). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of iRhythm’s common stock or the notes, which could affect noteholders’ ability to convert the notes and, to the extent the activity occurs during any observation period related to a conversion of the notes, it could affect the number of shares of iRhythm’s common stock and value of the consideration that noteholders will receive upon conversion of the notes. This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any of these securities (including the shares of iRhythm’s common stock, if any, into which the notes are convertible) and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful. The notes were only offered and sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The notes and any shares of iRhythm’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes have not been and are not expected to be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

(GRPH) declared a special dividend of $1.03 per share in connection with the merger with Lenz Therapeutics, Inc. The payment is subject to the merger's closing and will be paid to stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024. The special dividend, not exceeding $60 million, will be paid on March 21, 2024, subject to merger conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a special dividend by Graphite Bio, Inc. in connection with its merger with Lenz Therapeutics represents a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The announcement of a $1.03 per share dividend is a concrete figure that market participants can factor into their valuation of the company. Considering the dividend is contingent upon the successful closure of the merger, it acts as an incentive for shareholders to vote in favor of the transaction. The conditionality of the dividend also introduces an element of risk, as the merger's outcome remains uncertain until the shareholder vote and all merger conditions are met.From a financial perspective, the special dividend's impact on the company's cash reserves is noteworthy. The cap of $60 million indicates a substantial outflow, which could affect the company's liquidity post-merger. Investors should be aware of this when considering the short-term financial health of the merged entity. Additionally, the exact amount of the dividend being subject to adjustments based on certain cash amounts as stipulated in the Merger Agreement could lead to variations in the expected payout, which stakeholders should monitor closely. Mergers and Acquisitions Expert Mergers and acquisitions often lead to significant restructuring and strategic realignment. In the case of Graphite Bio's merger with Lenz Therapeutics, the special dividend can be seen as a strategic move to distribute excess cash to shareholders prior to the merger's completion. This could be indicative of the combined company's future capital allocation strategy or a method to optimize its balance sheet for post-merger operations.It is also important to consider the implications of such a dividend on the valuation of the deal itself. The adjustment of the merger terms to include a special dividend could reflect negotiations between the companies to provide immediate tangible value to shareholders, potentially swaying investor sentiment towards a favorable vote. The timing of the dividend payout, set shortly after the expected merger completion date, is aligned with the typical pattern of finalizing financial transactions and rewarding shareholders in the process. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a special dividend in the context of a merger can have broader implications for market sentiment and the biotechnology sector. Special dividends are relatively rare and can be interpreted as a positive signal about the financial health and prospects of the company. For the biotech industry, where investment often hinges on long-term potential and the success of clinical trials or regulatory approvals, a cash dividend provides immediate, risk-free value to shareholders, contrasting with the typically speculative nature of biotech investments.Furthermore, the market's reaction to such news can be mixed, as some investors might view the special dividend as a positive return on investment, while others could interpret it as a sign that the company lacks opportunities to reinvest its cash for higher returns. The announcement could also lead to increased trading volumes as investors reposition their portfolios in light of new information, affecting the stock's liquidity and volatility in the short term. 03/08/2024 - 05:00 PM Special dividend estimated to be $1.03 per share Payment of special dividend conditioned upon closing of merger SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graphite Bio, Inc.

(NASDAQ: RUSHA and RUSHB), which operates the largest network of commercial vehicle dealerships in North America, announced today that Michael McRoberts, Chief Operating Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, will step down from his role as COO later this year, and Scott Anderson, Senior Vice President of Finance, Insurance and Leasing, will retire effective March 30, 2024. McRoberts was instrumental in leading the Company’s operations through a period of substantial growth and transformation. His extensive background in the commercial vehicle dealership, leasing, and contract-carriage industries markedly impacted the Company’s operations and strategic direction. In addition, McRoberts’ leadership was pivotal in refining the Company’s operations to achieve greater efficiencies, leveraging its data in furtherance of the Company’s strategic initiatives, and driving the customer experience. When McRoberts steps down as Chief Operating Officer, he will continue to serve in a senior advisory role and in his current capacity as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors. Further details regarding the timing of McRoberts’ retirement, which will occur in the second half of the year, will be provided at a later date. McRoberts was appointed Chief Operating Officer in July 2016. He joined the Company in 2011 and served as Regional Manager for Rush Truck Centers in California until he was appointed Senior Vice President – Dealer Operations in March 2013. Prior to joining Rush Enterprises, McRoberts served as the Vice President – General Manager and Chief Operating Officer for the Scully Companies, a regional full-service leasing and dedicated contract carriage organization. His background also includes 13 years of experience with other commercial vehicle dealership groups, serving in various executive positions. “Michael’s strong leadership and strategic guidance has been a primary contributor to our ability to achieve the significant growth and consistent financial results we have experienced over the last decade,” said W.M. “Rusty” Rush, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President of Rush Enterprises, Inc. “As a direct result of Michael’s leadership, we have become more disciplined and improved our processes over the years, enabling us to offer our customers superior commercial vehicle solutions at even greater value. He has also been a respected mentor to our leaders throughout the Company and a trusted colleague and adviser, and I am grateful for his innumerable contributions to our success,” said Rush. Jason Wilder will assume the role of Chief Operating Officer upon McRoberts’ retirement later in the year. Wilder has served as Senior Vice President – Navistar Dealerships since May 2019. From 2011 until 2019, he served as Regional General Manager of the Georgia Region, and as the Regional General Manager of the Company’s North Carolina dealerships from 2008 until 2011. Wilder joined the Company in November 2006 as the General Manager of the Atlanta medium-duty dealership. Prior to joining the Company, he was the General Manager of Fouts Brothers Truck Center in Smyrna, Georgia. “Jason has a tremendous depth of knowledge of commercial vehicle dealership operations and has demonstrated strong leadership ability since the first day he joined our Company. He has worked closely with Michael and me over the years, and I expect a very smooth transition,” added Rush. Jorgan Peterson will assume Wilder’s current role of Senior Vice President – Navistar Dealerships later this year. Peterson has served as Regional General Manager of the Utah and Idaho region of Navistar dealerships since 2013, where he was responsible for guiding the growth and transformation of the Company’s dealerships in the region. He started with the Company in 2010 as District General Manager of the Idaho region and prior to joining the Company had been with Lake City International Truck dealership group in Salt Lake City, Utah and Boise, Idaho since 2003. “Jorgan is very experienced with our Navistar dealership operations and I am excited to have him in this new role,” Rush stated. Anderson oversaw Rush Enterprises’ commercial vehicle finance and insurance operations during a period of significant growth in the number of the Company’s dealerships. He also led the Company’s PacLease and Idealease truck leasing and rental operations, growing the network to more than fifty locations and a fleet of over 10,000 vehicles. Anderson refined the leasing and rental operation to become an important contributor to the Company’s overall financial success. He will remain as a consultant to the Company through at least September 30, 2024. Anderson served as Vice President – Finance and Insurance of the Company from 2005 until his promotion to Senior Vice President – Finance and Insurance, and he assumed responsibility for Rush Truck Leasing in 2007. Prior to joining the Company, Anderson served as Manager of Continental European Operations for CIT Group and Managing Director of European Commercial Finance for Associates Capital Corp. “Scott is more knowledgeable about the truck finance, insurance and leasing industry than anyone I know and is largely responsible for the success of our leasing and rental business,” Rush said. “His retirement is truly bittersweet, as he will be greatly missed. I wish him all the best as he begins this new chapter.” Mark Kuhn will assume the role of Vice President – Leasing. Kuhn became General Manager of Rush Truck Leasing – PacLease Division, in 2021. He joined the Company in 2015 as General Manager of Rush Truck Leasing – Fort Worth, after serving in numerous management roles with PACCAR Leasing Company. “Mark’s extensive experience with the commercial truck leasing industry and our Company puts him in a solid position to assume the management of our Rush Truck Leasing operations and to continue to expand its contributions to the Company’s overall success,” Rush stated. “While we will certainly miss both Mike and Scott, I am very confident that Jason, Jorgan, and Mark are each well equipped to take on their new leadership responsibilities,” added Rush.

NN Announces First Steps in Balance Sheet Optimization Plan,2024-03-08T21:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"NN, Inc. (NNBR) announced the sale and leaseback of three facilities for $16.8 million to reduce term loan balance, cut cash interest, and strengthen the balance sheet. The move is part of a transformation plan to lower costs, enhance free cash flow, and prepare for future refinancing.","NN Announces First Steps in Balance Sheet Optimization Plan Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NN, Inc. (NNBR) announced the sale and leaseback of three facilities for $16.8 million to reduce term loan balance, cut cash interest, and strengthen the balance sheet. The move is part of a transformation plan to lower costs, enhance free cash flow, and prepare for future refinancing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by NN, Inc. to engage in a sale-leaseback transaction for three of its facilities represents a strategic financial move aimed at optimizing its capital structure. By converting fixed assets into liquid capital, NN, Inc. is effectively reducing its term loan balance, which in turn will lower its cash interest obligations. This is a significant action as interest expenses are a recurring cost that can weigh heavily on a company's profitability. By lowering these expenses, NN, Inc. is poised to improve its net income and cash flows, which is an important consideration for investors and creditors alike.Furthermore, the reduction of the corporate headquarters' footprint signifies a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. These measures to cut operating costs are likely to be viewed favorably by the market, as they can lead to improved margins and potentially higher earnings per share (EPS). However, it is crucial to monitor the execution of the company's transformation plan to ensure that these cost savings translate into tangible financial improvements without compromising the company's operational capabilities. Real Estate Investment Analyst The sale-leaseback arrangement allows NN, Inc. to unlock the value tied up in real estate assets while retaining operational control of the facilities. This is a common tactic used by companies to free up capital for debt reduction or other strategic initiatives. The aggregate purchase price of $16.8 million should be compared against the current market value of similar industrial properties to assess the fairness of the deal. Additionally, the lease terms post-sale will be critical in determining the long-term cost-effectiveness of this transaction.It is worth noting that such transactions can have varying implications on a company's balance sheet and future financial commitments. While it reduces the asset base, it introduces a future lease obligation that must be carefully managed. Investors should consider how the lease payments might affect future cash flows and whether the terms are in line with market rates. A favorable leaseback deal can enhance financial flexibility, but unfavorable terms could lead to higher long-term costs. Market Research Analyst By stating that the transaction will have no impact on EBITDA, NN, Inc. is reassuring stakeholders that its core earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will remain stable. This is pivotal for investors who closely monitor EBITDA as a measure of a company's operational performance independent of its financing structure. Nonetheless, it's essential to scrutinize the long-term implications of this move on the company's cost structure and ability to invest in growth opportunities.The market will also be interested in NN, Inc.'s plans for future refinancing when market conditions are favorable. This indicates a proactive approach to capital management and suggests that the company is looking to take advantage of potentially lower interest rates or more favorable loan terms in the future. Investors should track the company's debt maturity profile and interest rate exposure to understand how refinancing could affect its financial health. 03/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Will reduce term loan balance, reduce cash interest, and strengthen balance sheetCHARLOTTE, N.C., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NN, Inc. (NASDAQ: NNBR), a global diversified industrial company that engineers and manufactures high-precision components and assemblies, today announced that on March 5, 2024, it entered into a Purchase and Sale and Escrow Agreement to sell and lease back three facilities, for an aggregate purchase price of a $16.8 million that is expected to close on or around March 15, 2024 with no impact to EBITDA. The net proceeds from the transaction will be used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance under the company’s term loan, lowering ongoing cash interest expenses. In addition, the company has reduced its corporate headquarters footprint by approximately two-thirds through a separate sublease transaction, lowering ongoing operating costs. “These actions mark another strong step forward in the execution of our transformation plan and helps us further strengthen and strategically de-risk our balance sheet,” said Mike Felcher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of NN, Inc. “We are taking actions in line with a multi-step 2024 plan to reduce our cost of capital, and to position ourselves for future refinancing when market conditions are favorable. Combined with our continued efforts to drive consistent free cash flow generation through our operations, this is as an important strategic pillar as we align our capital resources for a stronger, more focused long-term growth program.” NN will continue to operate at these facilities. There will be no impact to NN employees or customers.

Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, and Evercore ISI. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Akero Therapeutics' successful closing of a substantial public offering is a significant financial event that merits attention from various stakeholders. The gross proceeds of approximately $366.9 million, prior to deductions for underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, suggest robust market confidence in the company's potential to develop treatments for metabolic diseases with high unmet medical needs. The full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares indicates strong investor demand.The infusion of capital is likely to bolster Akero's balance sheet, providing the company with the financial resources necessary to advance its clinical programs and potentially accelerate the development of its pipeline. It is important to note that while the immediate liquidity is a positive sign, it also dilutes existing shareholders. The long-term impact of this dilution will largely depend on the company's ability to leverage the raised capital to achieve milestones that enhance shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The participation of prominent financial institutions such as J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Jefferies and Evercore ISI as joint book-running managers reflects a level of institutional support and confidence in Akero Therapeutics' market proposition. The pricing of the public offering at $29.00 per share provides a reference point for the market's valuation of the company and may influence investor perception and stock performance in the near term.From a market dynamics perspective, the successful offering could signal to other biotech firms that the capital markets are receptive to funding clinical-stage companies in the current economic environment. This could encourage similar companies to pursue public offerings or other forms of capital raising to fund their operations and research endeavors. Biotech Industry Analyst The metabolic disease sector is marked by a high unmet medical need, which provides a substantial opportunity for companies like Akero Therapeutics that are developing transformational treatments. The capital raised through this offering is critical for funding ongoing research and development efforts, which are inherently resource-intensive and high-risk. The successful capital raise is a testament to the company's strategic positioning within the biotech industry and the potential market demand for its therapies.Investors will be closely monitoring how effectively Akero deploys the new funds towards advancing its clinical trials. The outcome of these trials will be pivotal in determining the company's future trajectory and the long-term return on investment for the stakeholders involved in this public offering. 03/08/2024 - 04:02 PM SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Akero Therapeutics, Inc.

The company advances VELDONA drug candidates to Phase III clinical studies and expands the market of AI Nose-powered VOC-sensing technology with strategic partners NISD and Inabata.","Ainos Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Ainos, Inc. reports financial results for 2023, focusing on strategic pivot towards VELDONA and AI-powered point-of-care testing. The company advances VELDONA drug candidates to Phase III clinical studies and expands the market of AI Nose-powered VOC-sensing technology with strategic partners NISD and Inabata. Positive Ainos, Inc. successfully navigated a year of transition in 2023, focusing on diversifying its business model post-COVID era. The company made significant progress in expanding the addressable market for its AI Nose technology with strategic partners NISD and Inabata. Ainos advanced the manufacturing of VELDONA investigational new drugs and commenced shipping VELDONA Pet cytoprotein supplements in Taiwan. Despite reduced demand for COVID-19 test kits impacting revenues, Ainos maintained a stable headcount, showcasing resilience and cost-effective operations. The company aims to pivot away from COVID-19 test kits sales, focusing on VELDONA Pet, Ainos Flora, and VOC sensing platform development in 2024. Ainos strengthened its financial position in 2023 through private placements and convertible promissory notes, supporting its growth strategy. The company reported a decrease in revenues, gross profit, and net loss in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to reduced demand for COVID-19 test kits. Operating expenses decreased in 2023, with R&D expenses increasing while SG&A expenses decreased. Ainos had a net loss of US$13,770,549 in 2023, with cash and cash equivalents of US$1,885,628 as of December 31, 2023. Recent business developments include partnerships with SIDSCO Biomedical Co., Ltd., positive clinical data for VELDONA low-dose oral interferon formulation, and progress in VOC sensing platform development. Negative Significant decrease in revenues from US$3,519,627 in 2022 to US$122,112 in 2023 due to reduced demand for COVID-19 test kits. Negative gross profit of US$253,733 in 2023 compared to positive gross profit of US$1,405,343 in 2022. Net loss attributable to common stock shareholders was US$13,770,549 in 2023, indicating a financial loss for the company. While operating expenses decreased in 2023, R&D expenses increased, impacting the overall financial performance of the company. Ainos' financial position was weakened in 2023, with a decrease in cash and cash equivalents compared to the previous year. Financial Analyst The financial results of Ainos, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2023, highlight a significant decrease in revenue, primarily due to a reduced demand for COVID-19 test kits. This decline is reflected in the year-over-year revenue drop from US$3,519,627 in 2022 to US$122,112 in 2023. The company's shift towards diversification, including the advancement of VELDONA drug candidates and the expansion of AI Nose-powered VOC-sensing technology, is a strategic move to mitigate the impact of this reduced demand. However, the net loss of US$13,770,549, although slightly improved from the previous year's US$14,006,690, indicates that the company is still facing financial challenges.From an investment perspective, the increase in R&D expenses to US$7,317,388, despite the decrease in share-based compensation, suggests that Ainos is investing heavily in its future product pipeline. The collaboration with strategic partners, such as NISD and Inabata and the successful manufacturing of a GMP clinical batch of VELDONA investigational new drugs, are positive indicators of progress in product development. However, the negative gross profit and the need for additional capital, as evidenced by the private placement and convertible promissory notes, raise concerns about the company's current financial stability and the time frame required to achieve profitability. Medical Research Analyst The progression of Ainos' VELDONA drug candidates into Phase III clinical studies is a critical milestone in the pharmaceutical development process. Phase III trials are pivotal in determining the efficacy and safety of a drug and are often the last step before seeking regulatory approval. The positive top-line data from clinical studies for the VELDONA low-dose oral interferon formulation, particularly its efficacy in treating oral warts in HIV-seropositive patients, which has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, is a strong indicator of the drug's potential. This designation provides certain benefits, including market exclusivity upon approval, which could significantly impact the company's future revenue streams if the drug is successful.Furthermore, the expansion into the pet care market with the VELDONA Pet cytoprotein supplements and the exploration of contract clinical trials with SIDSCO for veterinary investigational medicines could open new revenue channels. The diversification into pet care, a robust and growing market, aligns with broader industry trends where companies expand beyond human health into animal health to leverage existing expertise and create additional income sources. Market Research Analyst The strategic pivot towards AI-powered point-of-care testing and VOC-sensing technology represents Ainos' response to the evolving healthcare landscape. The initiation of the second phase of collaboration with NISD and Inabata to co-develop an AI Nose-powered VOC sensing platform is particularly noteworthy. The potential applications of this technology across industries such as telehealth, automotive, industrial and environmental safety suggest that Ainos is targeting a multi-sector approach, which could lead to a diversified and resilient business model.The VOC-sensing technology market is growing, driven by the need for improved diagnostic tools and environmental monitoring solutions. Ainos' entry into this market, especially if they can achieve mass production following the successful finalization of the prototype, could position the company at the forefront of a niche yet expanding segment. The company's ability to maintain a stable headcount amidst widespread downsizing in the healthcare industry further indicates operational efficiency, which is a positive sign for potential investors and partners. 03/08/2024 - 04:20 PM Strategic pivot towards VELDONA and AI-powered point-of-care testing to continue in 2024Advancing VELDONA drug candidates to Phase III clinical studiesExpanding market of AI Nose-powered VOC-sensing technology with strategic partners NISD and InabataSAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / Ainos, Inc. (NASDAQ:AIMD, AIMDW) (""Ainos"", or the ""Company""), a diversified healthcare company focused on the development of novel point-of-care testing, low-dose interferon therapeutics, and synthetic RNA-driven preventative medicine, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.Chun-Hsien (Eddy) Tsai, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Ainos, commented, ""In 2023, we navigated a year of transition and successfully advanced the shift of our business model to align with the post-COVID era. Although we faced reduced demand for COVID-19 test kits, impacting our revenues during 2023, we have made noteworthy strides in diversifying our business for sustained growth, reaching key milestones that we anticipate will catalyze the development and commercialization of our product pipeline in the coming years.""""First, we moved closer to expanding the potential addressable market for our AI Nose with initiation of the second phase of our collaboration with Nisshinbo Micro Devices Inc. (""NISD"") and Taiwan Inabata Sangyo Co (""Inabata""). Together, we are co-developing an AI Nose-powered VOC sensing platform with potential applications spanning a wide variety of industries, including telehealth, automotive, industrial, and environmental safety. Second, in November, our contract manufacturer Swiss Pharma completed manufacturing of a Good Manufacturing Practice clinical batch of VELDONA® investigational new drugs. This advances one of our key programs and has the potential to ultimately facilitate delivery of high-quality, safe, and effective therapeutics to individuals seeking relief from immunity issues or viral infections. Finally, we commenced shipping VELDONA® Pet cytoprotein supplements in Taiwan during the third quarter of 2023. Formulated to address a variety of health issues in dogs and cats, these supplements are an important new product line for the Company and represent a significant step as we strive to diversify our revenues.""""During 2023, amid widespread downsizing in the healthcare industry, our ability to maintain a stable headcount is a testament to our resilience, capital efficiency, and our cost-effective operations in Taiwan. This stability provides us with a strong foundation, empowering us to develop our business and advance our product pipeline.""""As we move further into 2024, we will continue our strategic pivot away from the sale of COVID-19 antigen rapid test kits. In line with this transition, our near-term priorities encompass sales and marketing of VELDONA® Pet, advancing our flagship VOC POCT candidate, Ainos Flora, and co-developing a VOC sensing platform with our Japanese partners. At the same time, we will advance clinical studies and actively pursue the out-licensing of VELDONA® human drug candidates, including our candidate for treating oral warts in HIV-seropositive patients, which the U.S. FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (""ODD""). I believe that our long-term strategic vision will likely yield sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.""Meng-Lin Sung, Chief Financial Officer of Ainos, commented, ""Our strategic initiatives to advance our pipeline and diversify our revenue streams made solid progress in 2023. In 2023, we bolstered our financial position with our US$3 million tranche of a total anticipated US$10 million private placement and our issuance and sale of two convertible promissory notes in a principal amount of US$3 million. These transactions provided us with additional capital as we implement our growth strategy.""Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenuesRevenues were US$122,112, compared to US$3,519,627 in the full year of 2022, reflecting a decrease in selling price and sales volume of the Company's COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Kits attributable to the slowdown of COVID-19 infections in Taiwan.Cost of RevenuesCost of revenues was US$375,845 in the full year of 2023, compared with U$$2,114,284 in the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales volume, partially offset by recognition of inventory loss.Gross ProfitIn the full year of 2023, gross profit was negative US$253,733, compared with a positive gross profit of US$1,405,343 a year ago, driven by declines in sales volume and selling price, as well as recognition of inventory loss.Total Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses decreased to US$12,952,663 in the full year of 2023 from US$15,381,555 in the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in share-based compensation.

The Advance Notice By-law is similar to the advance notice by-laws adopted by many other Canadian public companies.Among other things, the Advance Notice By-law fixes deadlines by which shareholders must notify the Company of director nominations prior to any annual or special meeting of shareholders where directors are to be elected. It also sets forth the information about the proposed nominee that a shareholder must include in the notice for it to be valid.In the case of an annual shareholder meeting, notice to the Company must be given not less than 30 days prior to the date of the annual meeting nor more than 65 days before the date of such meeting. In the event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the first public announcement of the meeting's date, notice may be given not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such announcement.In the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is not also an annual meeting), notice to the Company must be given not later than the close of business on the 15th day following the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting.The Advance Notice By-law also prescribes the proper written form for a shareholder's notice and provides that the Company's Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, waive any requirement under these provisions. The Advance Notice By-law is effective immediately and will be placed before shareholders for approval, confirmation and ratification at the next Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the ""Meeting""). Pursuant to the provisions of the Act, the Advance Notice By-Law will cease to be effective unless it is approved, ratified and confirmed by a resolution adopted by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders of the Company at the Meeting.About EarthLabs Inc.

Genuine equity demands embracing diverse perspectives and voices, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and included. -Delphine Donné, VP/GM, Personal Workspace SolutionsAt Logitech, we believe that diversity is a destination while inclusion is the journey. -Kirsty Russell, Head, People & CultureIn principle, sports promise an even playing field, where meritocracy reigns, rewarding individuals based on their skill and dedication to improvement. However, the reality often falls short, particularly in certain domains like esports and racing, where diversity remains a challenge, notably for women. As we commemorate International Women's Day tomorrow, it's important we celebrate women and their achievements to date. -Ujesh Desai, GM, GamingDiversity of perspectives is the key to creating a more positive - and equal - future. Advancement is only achievable with the inclusion of women. -Anne Carrigy, CIOCreating an environment that welcomes and empowers women in technology is a responsibility we all share. As men, in particular, we can improve by ensuring a more inclusive workplace for everyone, especially women. This means providing space for them to voice their opinions, making them feel valued and heard, and providing opportunities for them to lead and grow. -Jay Wilder, Head, SoftwareToday, I'm pausing to reflect on the incredible journey we're on at Logitech. It's a journey made deeply impactful by the diverse talents and unwavering commitment of my colleagues, many of whom are women, including in leadership roles that shape the direction of our work and our company culture. -Emerald De Leeuw-Goggin, Head, AI Governance & PrivacyI am living with three brilliant women who also happen to have a black belt in sass. Together, you three are a force to be reckoned with. You challenge me to be better, you enable me to see the world through a different lens, and you remind me every day that being the fourth smartest in the house is my most comfortable place. -Jonah Staw, Head, Global Direct E-Commerce & GM, MusicBy inspiring inclusion, we invite multiple perspectives; perspectives that can inspire, challenge and help us make sense of the world in new and exciting ways. As someone leading Creative, Design and Innovation teams, I couldn't be more thrilled about the 2024 International Women's Day theme to Inspire Inclusion. -Malin Leschly, VP, Design & Brand InnovationMentors across Logitech gave me the opportunity to engage in new things, which created a wonderful but unconventional zig zagging career path for me. Today, I can listen, encourage and hopefully inspire others to be ambitious and do what excites them. I hope to reinforce the importance of all of our voices and I can remind us to include ourselves in our future.-Michele Hermann, VP/GM, Head, Education SolutionsWe still have a long road ahead. There are numerous gaps and inequalities that need to be addressed worldwide. Hence, I want to highlight the significant role that mentorship, allyship, sponsorship and community play in enhancing women's representation. Cultivating these aspects is key to creating environments where women can thrive personally and professionally. -Justyna Lloyd, Associate General CounselI love this year's IWD theme - Inspiring inclusion, because at Logitech that is what we strive to do every day. Not just internally with our teams, but through our products and how we approach business…In my current role I have the privilege of getting to nurture inclusion. I get to witness everyday how inclusion isn't just the right thing to do but how it really does drive innovation and business results and that is a real privilege! -Elaine Laird, Head, Community & AdvocacyI wouldn't be where I am today without strong female networks that have provided role models, mentoring, friendship, and advice over the years. Investing in making strong connections with other professional women has been a powerful career multiplier. It's also the way I give back. -Hayley Nelson, Head, B2B MarketingWomen have shaped and had my back throughout my journey, and I hope I've returned the favor to those who've reached out or followed suit. -Leslie Howard, Head, Personal Workspace Solutions MarketingCelebrating all women around the world. We can all make a difference by promoting the value of inclusion through our everyday actions. -Desiree Ortiz-Rodriguez, Head, Microsoft Commercial AllianceAt Logitech, I'm proud to say that my reporting line consists solely of women, all the way up to our CEO and Chairwoman. I only realized this a few days ago - and consider it quite special since I work in an IT organization, not usually the most female-dominated field! It's a testament to the progress we've made towards equity and inclusion, but it also highlights that diversity is still a destination we're striving towards. -Jeanne Marell, Design Guide, Global ITThank you Logitech for creating a work environment that values and supports women and thank you to all the women out there who uplift and celebrate each other, not just today, but every day. -Gina Giró i Aguirre, Product CounselAs a woman in AV, I've navigated through a landscape often dominated by male perspectives, which presented both challenges and opportunities for growth. Seeing other women thriving in this field not only provides inspiration but also validates the importance of diversity and inclusion, fostering an environment where all voices are heard and valued. -Amina Jusovic, Territory Account Manager, Public SectorHappy International Women's Day to all!View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Logitech on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: LogitechWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/logitechEmail: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: LogitechView the original press release on accesswire.com What is the theme of Logitech's International Women's Day celebration?

"Fangdd unveils 2024 strategic layout, aims to enter the real estate stock asset services sector",2024-03-08T21:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Fangdd to Enter Trillion Dollar Real Estate Stock Asset Services Market in 2024,"Fangdd unveils 2024 strategic layout, aims to enter the real estate stock asset services sector Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Fangdd to Enter Trillion Dollar Real Estate Stock Asset Services Market in 2024 Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The shift in China's real estate market from an 'incremental market' to a 'stock market' highlights a significant transition in the industry dynamics. This change suggests a maturation of the market, similar to patterns observed in the United States and Japan. As urbanization slows and housing saturation increases, the focus on stock assets, which include existing properties as opposed to new developments, becomes more pronounced. This trend can influence the strategies of real estate companies and has implications for investors looking at the sector.For a company like Fangdd, entering the real estate stock asset services market represents a diversification strategy that can potentially stabilize revenue streams. Given the company's extensive experience in real estate transactions, their pivot towards asset revitalization and operational technology services could leverage their existing competencies in a new domain. This move might also attract investors seeking exposure to a more resilient business model in the face of a declining real estate transaction business. Financial Analyst The announcement by Fangdd to enter the real estate stock asset services market is a strategic one, with potential to impact the company's financial health. Diversifying income sources away from transaction commissions, which are subject to market volatility, could mitigate operational risks. The focus on asset revitalization capabilities and increasing service asset projects is indicative of a proactive approach to harnessing the value of existing real estate assets.From a financial perspective, this could lead to more stable cash flows and improved valuation metrics. Investors should monitor Fangdd's execution of this strategy, as success in this area could lead to improved earnings stability and potentially enhance shareholder value over the long term. However, the costs associated with establishing operational and technological services will need to be weighed against the anticipated benefits. Real Estate Industry Expert The transition towards stock asset management in real estate is a complex process that involves not just a change in business model but also a shift in industry expertise. Fangdd's plan to build a platform with comprehensive service capabilities suggests a move towards a more integrated approach to real estate asset management. This includes not just sales but also operation and technological innovation.Understanding the nuances of stock asset management, such as the importance of asset revitalization and the potential of long-term rental apartments and commercial properties, will be crucial for Fangdd's success. The company's deep industry experience could provide a competitive edge in navigating these nuances. Stakeholders should note that the effectiveness of Fangdd's strategic blueprint will hinge on the company's ability to adapt to these new market conditions and deliver on its service promises. 03/08/2024 - 04:10 PM SHENZHEN, China, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Due to urbanization slowdown and per capita housing saturation in China, the traditional real estate industry is constantly shrinking in development scale, and the Chinese real estate market is gradually shifting from an ""incremental market"" to a ""stock market"". In the long term, stock assets will be continuously accumulated in scale and value, and the operation of stock assets will become increasingly significant, which will inevitably replace incremental real estate development as the main track. In the United States and Japan where the real estate markets are mature, a group of excellent asset service enterprises have emerged in the areas of long-term rental apartments, commercial real estate, and other stock assets. In response to this trend of the real estate industry, Fangdd plans to enter the trillion dollar market of real estate stock asset services and actively explore related business. In 2024, Fangdd has planned a strategic blueprint for real estate stock asset services: by filling gaps, elongating strengths, and forging new strengths, Fangdd aims to build a leading platform of real estate stock asset services with comprehensive service capabilities of operation, sales, and technology. To this end, Fangdd will focus on the following two aspects in 2024: 1. improving asset revitalization capabilities by establishing the operational and technological services required for real estate stock assets; 2. increasing service asset projects by seizing potential opportunities of stock assets mainly in the areas of apartments, commercial properties and industries. With many years of experience in real estate transaction services, Fangdd has self-operated business in 15 cities of China. Due to an average of nearly 20 years of real estate operating experience, our founding team has a profound understanding of real estate industry in terms of operation and management. In the short term, under the continuous downward trend of the real estate transaction business, Fangdd, through the strategic layout of real estate stock asset services, can diversify income sources and resist the operational risks from sole dependence on transaction commissions. In the long run, real estate stock asset services can bring new business opportunities and growth momentum and opportunities and new growth poles, which will contribute to our business transformation and upgrading. About FangDD Fangdd Network Group Ltd. (Nasdaq: DUO) is a customer-oriented property technology company in China, focusing on providing real estate transaction digitalization services. Through innovative use of mobile internet, cloud, big data, artificial intelligence, among others, FangDD has fundamentally revolutionized the way real estate transaction participants conduct their business through a suite of modular products and solutions powered by SaaS tools, products and technology.

Nothing in a career is so gratifying as to work alongside highly skilled craftsmen and women and dedicated business professionals to provide a service that none of us can imagine living without.” Additionally, Thomas D. Hyde, Evergy’s current lead independent director, will not stand for reelection this year as he also retires from the board in May following 12 years of service. B. Anthony Isaac, longstanding board member from Wichita, has been selected by the board of directors to step into the role of lead independent director. “Tom’s vast career experience informed the judgment and wisdom that he contributed to all of our board deliberations,” Campbell said. “We thank Tom for the leadership and counsel he provided to our board and management and welcome Tony to his new role as lead independent director.” These changes will be reflected in the board of directors slate that will be submitted for approval at the company’s annual meeting in May 2024 and take effect following the annual meeting if approved by the shareholders.

Kocak to Principal Accounting Officer, showcasing commitment to leadership and innovation in precision oncology therapies. Ms. Gentry's new role will focus on clinical operations for RenovoGemTM in Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer, while Mr. Kocak will lead financial management and strategic planning. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor From an oncological perspective, the promotion of Leesa Gentry to Chief Clinical Officer at RenovoRx is a strategic move that could have a significant impact on the company's clinical operations. The development of RenovoGemTM for the treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC) is particularly noteworthy, as LAPC is a condition with limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. The TIGeR-PaC study's primary endpoint of a 6-month Overall Survival benefit is ambitious and if met, could represent a significant advancement in the standard of care. Ms. Gentry's prior success in achieving the first interim analysis and the continuation of the study underlines the potential of RenovoGemTM to meet a critical unmet medical need.Moreover, the focus on reducing side effects compared to standard chemotherapy regimens is crucial in oncology, where treatment tolerability can greatly affect patient quality of life. Positive clinical trial results could lead to increased investor confidence and potentially expedite the drug's path to market, subject to regulatory approval. This would not only benefit patients but could also enhance RenovoRx's market position and financial stability. Financial Analyst The appointment of Ronald B. Kocak as Principal Accounting Officer holds financial implications for RenovoRx. His role in completing a $6.1 million private placement is indicative of his ability to secure funding necessary for the company's sustained research and development. The extension of the company's cash runway is a critical factor for investors, as it suggests a reduced risk of near-term cash shortfalls and the need for dilutive financing rounds.Financial management and strategic planning are essential for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, particularly one that is in the midst of a Phase III study. The costs associated with such studies are substantial and efficient financial oversight can make the difference between a successful program and one that is hampered by budget constraints. Mr. Kocak's expertise and experience in the life sciences industry could provide RenovoRx with an edge in managing its financial resources during a pivotal period in its clinical development. Market Research Analyst The leadership changes at RenovoRx signal a commitment to growth and innovation, which is vital in the competitive biopharmaceutical landscape. The market for pancreatic cancer treatments is characterized by high unmet needs and the company's focus on a precision oncology therapy could position it well within this niche market. The success of RenovoGemTM in clinical trials could disrupt the current treatment paradigm and capture significant market share.Understanding the competitive landscape, potential market size and the regulatory environment is essential for forecasting the commercial potential of RenovoGemTM. If the TIGeR-PaC study yields positive results, RenovoRx could leverage this to negotiate partnerships or licensing agreements, which would be lucrative for the company's long-term growth strategy. The market's response to these leadership changes and the progress of the clinical trials will be critical in assessing RenovoRx's future potential and the impact on its stock valuation. 03/08/2024 - 04:05 PM Company has promoted Leesa Gentry to Chief Clinical Officer and Ronald B. Kocak to Principal Accounting Officer LOS ALTOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RenovoRx, Inc. (“RenovoRx” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RNXT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel precision oncology therapies based on a local drug-delivery platform, today highlighted the recent key leadership promotions of Leesa Gentry to Chief Clinical Officer and Ronald B.

Shaun Bagai, Chief Executive Officer of RenovoRx, commented, “We are delighted to promote Leesa and Ron to their new leadership roles, which reflects our commitment to assembling a dynamic team poised to continue to lead a successful clinical pathway for our proprietary therapy platform. We have streamlined our team, focusing our efforts on strategic initiatives to drive growth and innovation. On behalf of our Board of Directors, I extend our gratitude to Leesa and Ron on their hard work and dedication to date and congratulate them on their well-deserved promotions.” Ms. Gentry has served as Senior Vice President of Clinical Operations at RenovoRx since April 2023. In her new role as Chief Clinical Officer, she will oversee clinical and regulatory operations ensuring the highest standards for safety and quality are met across RenovoRx clinical studies. Ms. Gentry will continue to implement her breadth of experience as the Company drives towards a second interim analysis for the Phase III TIGeR-PaC study evaluating RenovoRx’s lead product candidate, RenovoGemTM for the treatment of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC), which is expected by late 2024. Since joining RenovoRx, Ms. Gentry has demonstrated exemplary leadership and commitment to advancing the Company’s clinical pipeline. In 2023, Ms. Gentry helped to achieve the first interim analysis in the TIGeR-PaC with the Data Monitoring Committee recommending a continuation of the study. The TIGeR-PaC study’s primary endpoint is a 6-month Overall Survival benefit with secondary endpoints including reduced side effects versus standard of care. Under her guidance, the Company’s clinical strategy to date has yielded positive results that contribute to the Company’s commitment to improve patients’ lives and lifespans by delivering therapies that have the potential to revolutionize the current paradigm of cancer care. Mr. Kocak has been promoted to the position of Principal Accounting Officer and will retain his roles as Vice President and Controller of RenovoRx. He joined the Company in October 2021 and is a seasoned financial reporting and accounting professional with extensive public and private company experience in the life sciences industry. Mr. Kocak was instrumental in the recent completion of a $6.1 million private placement that extended RenovoRx’s cash runway to support its clinical program initiatives. In this new leadership role, Mr. Kocak will oversee all financial management, reporting and strategic planning initiatives crucial to furthering the Company’s research and development efforts.

The annualized dividend rate is $5.08 per share, with a history of 31 years of dividend increases or maintenance. EastGroup focuses on industrial properties in Sunbelt markets, aiming to provide quality business distribution space. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst EastGroup Properties' announcement of a quarterly cash dividend of $1.27 per share, marking the 177th consecutive distribution, signals a strong commitment to shareholder returns. The consistency and growth of dividends over 31 years, with increases in 28 of those years, can be particularly appealing to income-focused investors, suggesting a robust financial position. This pattern of dividend growth often indicates a company's confidence in its future cash flows and profitability.From a valuation perspective, the dividend yield, which is the annualized dividend rate divided by the stock's current price, becomes a critical factor for investors. The yield comparison against industry averages and fixed-income alternatives will influence investment decisions. However, it's essential to assess the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends, to ensure the dividend's sustainability. A payout ratio that is too high could signal potential cash flow issues in the future. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst As a self-administered equity real estate investment trust (REIT) focusing on industrial properties in Sunbelt markets, EastGroup's strategy emphasizes the development and acquisition of distribution facilities near major transportation hubs in supply-constrained submarkets. This strategic focus is designed to capitalize on the growing demand for distribution space, driven by e-commerce and the need for efficient supply chain logistics. The Sunbelt region has been experiencing significant population growth and business expansion, which may contribute to the demand for industrial real estate and potentially support EastGroup's revenue growth and, by extension, its dividend payments.It is crucial to understand that REITs are required by law to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders, which often results in higher dividend yields compared to other sectors. However, investors must also consider the potential risks associated with property market cycles, interest rate sensitivity and the company's ability to manage its property portfolio effectively. Market Research Analyst The inclusion of EastGroup in the S&P Mid-Cap 400 and Russell 1000 Indexes is noteworthy as it may increase the stock's visibility among institutional investors and index funds, potentially leading to greater liquidity and stability in the stock price. The company's focus on functional, flexible and quality business distribution space aligns with current market trends towards last-mile logistics and the importance of strategic location for distribution centers.Investors should monitor market trends in industrial real estate, such as vacancy rates, average rents and new construction, as these factors can affect EastGroup's operational performance and ability to grow its dividend. Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and interest rates, on real estate values and financing costs should be considered, as they can influence the company's net asset value (NAV) and cost of capital. 03/08/2024 - 12:43 PM JACKSON, Miss., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- EastGroup Properties (NYSE: EGP) (the ""Company"", ""EastGroup"") announced today that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.27 per share payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record of Common Stock on March 28, 2024.

Studies showcased the efficacy of aloe-based moisturizers in improving skin barrier function and hydration, supporting the skin microbiome, and enhancing tolerability for various skin conditions. Positive None. Negative None. Dermatologist The studies from Burt's Bees regarding nature-based products for skin health are significant within the dermatological community. The focus on improving barrier function and hydration in sensitive skin populations is critical, as compromised barrier function can lead to a host of skin issues, including increased susceptibility to pathogens and irritants. The mention of aloe-containing moisturizers suggests a potential for anti-inflammatory and hydrating properties, which could be beneficial for conditions like atopic dermatitis and rosacea. The use of rice milk is less common in dermatology, but its inclusion could indicate a novel approach to supporting the skin microbiome, which is an emerging area of interest in skin care and disease management. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, Burt's Bees' findings could be influential in the natural skin care market. The emphasis on evidence-based benefits of nature-based products addresses a growing consumer demand for clinically proven natural remedies. The study on the tolerability of topical formulations in acne-prone populations is particularly notable, as it suggests a move towards gentler, non-irritating ingredients that can be used in sensitive skin conditions without exacerbating them. This could potentially open up a new segment of the market for natural acne solutions. Market Research Analyst In terms of market implications, Burt's Bees' research positions the brand at the forefront of the natural skin care industry. Their claim as the '#1 dermatologist recommended natural skin care brand' could be bolstered by these studies, which may enhance brand credibility and consumer trust. Moreover, if the findings are well-received by the dermatology community at the AAD meeting, it could lead to increased endorsements by professionals and possibly influence consumer purchasing decisions. This has the potential to impact market shares, particularly in the niche of skin care products for sensitive skin conditions. 03/08/2024 - 01:02 PM Clinical studies presented at the 2024 American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting demonstrate how nature-based products support the microbiome in compromised skin, while improving barrier function and hydration DURHAM, N.C., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Burt's Bees, the #1 dermatologist recommended natural skin care brand* and a pioneer in naturally-derived lip and skin care solutions, announced its latest research findings on the benefits of nature-based products to maintain and protect skin health and hydration.

Largest stockholder no longer owns majority stake. Company no longer a 'controlled company' under Nasdaq listing standards. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent secondary offering by Landsea Homes Corporation represents a notable shift in the company's ownership structure. The sale of over 2.4 million shares by the largest stockholder, at $11.60 per share and the additional exercise option for roughly 365,000 shares, indicates a strategic move to diversify the shareholder base. This is a critical development for current and potential investors, as the transition away from being a 'controlled company' could affect corporate governance and potentially lead to changes in how the company is managed.Furthermore, with the Selling Stockholder relinquishing the majority control, there could be implications for the stock's liquidity and volatility. A diversified investor base often leads to improved marketability of the shares and can attract institutional investors who were previously hesitant to invest in a company under majority control. However, this also opens the door to more significant influence from activist investors, which could lead to pressure for changes in strategy or leadership. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of the secondary offering, it's important to note that Landsea Homes did not receive any proceeds from this transaction. This indicates that the liquidity event was solely for the benefit of the Selling Stockholder. From a financial perspective, the transaction does not directly infuse capital into Landsea Homes, which means it does not immediately change the company's operational or financial capacity.However, the offering price of $11.60 per share provides a reference point for the market, potentially impacting investor perception of the company's valuation. Additionally, the participation of senior management and directors in the purchase of shares at the offering price signals confidence in the company's prospects, which could be perceived positively by the market. Legal Expert The transition out of 'controlled company' status under Nasdaq listing standards introduces new compliance requirements for Landsea Homes. The company will need to adhere to Nasdaq's corporate governance standards, which include a majority of independent directors on the board and independent oversight of executive compensation and nomination processes. This change can be beneficial for shareholders, as it often leads to enhanced transparency and accountability.It's also noteworthy that the transaction was conducted under a shelf registration statement, which is a regulatory filing that allows an issuer to sell securities to the public without the need for a separate prospectus for each act of offering. This suggests that Landsea Homes and the Selling Stockholder anticipated this transaction and planned accordingly, which reflects a level of foresight in corporate strategy. 03/08/2024 - 04:15 PM DALLAS, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Landsea Homes Corporation (Nasdaq: LSEA) (“Landsea Homes” or the “Company”), a publicly traded residential homebuilder, announced today the closing of its previously announced underwritten secondary offering by its largest stockholder, Landsea Holdings Corporation (the “Selling Stockholder”), of 2,434,783 shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $11.60 per share (before underwriting discounts and commissions), and the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 365,217 shares the Company’s common stock (the “Offering”). B. Riley Securities and BofA Securities acted as joint bookrunning managers in the Offering. BTIG and Wedbush Securities acted as co-managers in the Offering. The Company did not offer any shares of its common stock in the Offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares offered by the Selling Stockholder. As a result of the Offering, the Selling Stockholder no longer beneficially owns a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, and the Company no longer qualifies as a “controlled company” under the Nasdaq listing standards. The Company is currently in compliance with and intends to comply with the transition period requirements applicable following the loss of such status under the Nasdaq listing standards. “The closing of the Offering marks a significant milestone for our company,” said Landsea Homes Chief Executive Officer John Ho. “While Landsea Homes has always operated as an independent entity, it is an important step to no longer be considered a ‘controlled company’ under the Nasdaq listing standards. We also believe that reducing our investor concentration and cultivating a more diverse investor base are in the best interest of our shareholders. We appreciate the Selling Stockholder’s continued support.” Certain members of the Company’s senior management team and board of directors and a family member of the Company’s Chairman purchased an aggregate of $915,000 in shares of common stock that was offered by the Selling Stockholder in the Offering, at a price equal to the per share Offering price. A shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (including a prospectus) relating to these securities has been filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"").

The clearance could potentially open up new revenue streams and partnerships, as well as increase investor confidence in the company's growth potential. The technology's unique selling proposition lies in its nonthermal approach and precise ablation, which could position Pulse Biosciences favorably against competitors in the soft tissue ablation market.Anticipating the operational readiness and upcoming commercialization programs, investors and stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate of the technology and any strategic alliances that may follow. The company's upcoming earnings conference call will likely provide further insights into their commercial strategy and market penetration plans. Investors should look for information on pricing strategies, insurance coverage and reimbursement rates, as these factors will significantly influence the technology's accessibility and financial success. Market Research Analyst With the clearance of CellFX nsPFA Percutaneous Electrode System, Pulse Biosciences is entering a competitive landscape within the medical device sector that is focused on surgical innovations.

Financially, Entera had $11.0 million in cash as of December 31, 2023, projecting operational funding until mid-2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results declared by Entera Bio Ltd. demonstrate a significant reduction in net loss from $13.1 million in 2022 to $8.9 million in 2023, which is a positive indicator of the company's cost management and operational efficiency. The reduction in research and development expenses by $1.3 million, despite ongoing clinical studies, suggests strategic allocation of resources and potential cost-saving measures in pre-clinical activities. The decrease in general and administrative expenses by $2.8 million, including a restructuring of professional fees and a reduction in D&O insurance costs, reflects prudent fiscal management.Entera's report of having sufficient cash to fund operations through the first half of 2025 indicates a stable financial position in the short-term. However, investors should monitor the company's burn rate and future financing needs, especially in light of the planned advancement of five oral peptide programs. The successful commercialization of these programs could significantly impact revenue streams and market valuation, but this is contingent upon clinical success and regulatory approval. Medical Research Analyst Entera Bio's progress in developing the first oral PTH(1-34) osteoanabolic tablets, EB613, for osteoporosis is noteworthy due to the potential market disruption it represents. Current standard treatments for osteoporosis involve injectable therapies, which can be inconvenient for patients. An oral tablet form could enhance compliance and accessibility, addressing a significant unmet need in the treatment of this prevalent condition. The company's emphasis on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) as a primary endpoint, rather than fracture rates, aligns with contemporary regulatory strategies to expedite drug development. However, the clinical and commercial success of EB613 will depend on the acceptance of BMD as a surrogate endpoint for fracture risk, which is currently under review by the FDA.The development of EB612, a treatment for hypoparathyroidism and collaborations on GLP-2 and Oxyntomodulin peptides for gastrointestinal disorders and obesity, respectively, expand Entera's pipeline diversity. These programs target different indications with substantial patient populations, potentially reducing the company's risk profile through portfolio diversification. The innovative N-Tab™ technology platform underpinning these developments represents a significant scientific advancement in peptide drug delivery, which could have broad implications for the pharmaceutical industry. Market Research Analyst Entera's strategic focus on advancing its oral peptide programs could capture significant market share in the respective treatment areas if successful. The global osteoporosis market alone is projected to grow due to an aging population and increasing fracture rates. Entera's positioning of EB613 as a potential first-in-class oral treatment could disrupt the current market, which is dominated by injectable therapies, provided that the clinical efficacy and safety are validated in Phase 3 trials.Similarly, the development of treatments for hypoparathyroidism, short bowel syndrome and obesity represents entry into markets with high patient demand and limited treatment options. Entera's collaborations, such as those with OPKO Health, could facilitate the development and commercialization process, leveraging OPKO's expertise and resources. However, the competitive landscape, including potential market entrants and existing treatments, will be a critical factor in determining Entera's potential market penetration and pricing power. 03/08/2024 - 04:05 PM JERUSALEM, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entera Bio Ltd. (NASDAQ: ENTX), (“Entera” or the “Company”) a leader in the development of orally delivered peptides, today reported financial results and key business updates for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “2023 was an inflection point for Entera, with consistent validation of our disruptive N-Tab™ oral peptide technology platform and the unveiling of our goal to advance five potential first-in-class oral peptide programs, Phase 1 through Phase 3, into the clinic by the end of 2025. Each of these programs has been carefully selected to align with our platform and our mission to develop treatments that stand to become the number one choice for patients requiring peptide therapies, in a simple and convenient tablet format. Each of these programs is expected to have important catalysts during 2024. Following our December 2023 financing, we expect to have sufficient cash to fund operations through the first half of 2025,” said Miranda Toledano, CEO of Entera. EB613: First Oral PTH(1-34) Daily Osteoanabolic Tablets for Osteoporosis In March 2023, a Type D meeting between Entera and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) re-affirmed that a placebo-controlled phase 3 study design with Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and not fracture as primary endpoint could support a New Drug Application for EB613 In November 2023, Entera echoed the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) announcement that the Strategy to Advance BMD as a Regulatory Endpoint (SABRE) team had submitted its final qualification plan to the FDA At the Annual ASBMR Meeting in October 2023, Entera presented the differentiated pharmacokinetic profile of EB613, versus Forteo® PTH(1-34) 20 µg which requires a daily subcutaneous injection. EB613 consistently shows an increased Cmax and shorter duration of systemic exposure versus Forteo®. Furthermore, EB613’s brief “pulsatile” action appears to simultaneously stimulate both a dual bone formation and a mild anti-resorptive effect, as compared to Forteo® During the fourth quarter of 2023, Entera submitted its Phase 2 manuscript for potential publication in a major medical journal related to its phase 2, 6-month, 161-patient, placebo-controlled study in post-menopausal women with low bone mass and osteoporosis which met primary and secondary endpoints “We expect an update on the qualification process of SABRE and BMD as the surrogate endpoint for fracture in 2024. We view this as the final de-risking event from a regulatory standpoint to move EB613 to Phase 3. We believe EB613 stands as the first program to potentially avail itself of the landmark SABRE initiative which is also the first biomarker to potentially be approved as part of the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. As the first potential oral tablet osteoanabolic treatment, EB613 holds the potential to address the treatment chasm in this severe, potentially lethal disease which remains significantly undertreated despite efficacious injectable treatments. Fracture rates continue to rise globally, and we have not seen any new drugs approved for osteoporosis since 2019 due to the ethical concerns and the costs of fracture endpoint studies. Our discussions with key clinicians and patient advocacy groups and other key stakeholders in this ecosystem indicate that an oral anabolic treatment is absolutely warranted and a potential ‘game changer’ for the estimated 200 million women with osteoporosis globally. We continue to hold strategic discussions related to EB613 and look forward to initiating our pivotal phase 3 study once the final qualification of the SABRE endpoint is announced by FDA,” said Miranda Toledano, CEO of Entera. EB612: First Oral PTH(1-34) Peptide Replacement Therapy Tablets for HypoparathyroidismEB612, is being developed as the first oral PTH(1-34) peptide replacement treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Entera is currently evaluating its hypoparathyroidism program with an improved formulation of EB612 using the naked PTH(1-34) peptide and new intellectual property, tailored to optimize its PK profile and the potential for reduced daily dosing. Entera is also combining its N-Tab™ platform with an alternative PTH receptor agonist in a third party collaboration. Entera expects to submit data from the Phase 1 of its next generation EB612 program using the naked PTH(1-34) peptide in the first half of 2024. First GLP-2 Peptide Tablets for Short Bowel SyndromeUnder a collaboration agreement with OPKO Health (“OPKO”), Entera is combining its N-Tab™ technology with a proprietary long-acting GLP-2 peptide for the development of the first potential daily oral GLP-2 for the treatment of short bowel syndrome and other GI disorders such as Crohn’s and Celiac disease for which GLP-2 has relevance. Entera published pre-clinical data in May 2023 demonstrating that its oral peptide delivery platform enables gastric absorption of teduglutide (Gattex®), the only approved GLP-2 treatment, as a convenient potential tablet alternative to daily injections. Pre-IND in vivo PK data for oral GLP-2 using OPKO’s long-acting analogue is expected in the first half of 2024. First GLP-1/Glucagon Agonist (Oxyntomodulin) Peptide Tablets for ObesityUnder a collaboration agreement with OPKO, Entera is combining its N-Tab™ technology with a proprietary long-acting Oxyntomodulin (OXM) peptide for the development of the first potential daily OXM treatment for obesity and other metabolic diseases. Previously, an injectable pegylated version of this OXM peptide demonstrated significant reductions in weight loss and decreased plasma triglyceride levels with cardioprotective benefits in over 420 patients in phase 2/2B studies. Pre-IND in vivo PK data for oral OXM using OPKO’s long acting, modified analogue is expected in mid-2024. EB613: First Oral PTH(1-34) Osteoanabolic Tablets to Treat Intense Sport and Military Stress InjuriesEntera is collaborating with leading researchers in orthopedics and sports medicine to contribute its proprietary oral PTH(1-34) tablets for an investigator sponsored Phase 2 Study seeking to treat young women and men athletes that experience stress fractures as a result of intense sports training. More details on this study are expected in the second half of 2024. Financial Results for the year Ended December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2023, Entera had cash and cash equivalents of $11.0 million. The Company believes that its existing cash resources will be sufficient to meet its projected operating requirements through the second quarter of 2025, which includes the capital required to fund our ongoing operations, including R&D, the completion of the Phase 1 PK study related to our new generation platform and the GLP-2/OXM collaborative research we are conducting with OPKO. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $4.5 million, as compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $1.3 million was primarily due to a decrease of $1.5 million in pre-clinical activity and materials costs and a decrease of $0.6 million in employee compensation, including a one-time payment made to a former employee pursuant to the terms of his separation agreement. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in clinical expenses for our Phase 1 PK study related to our new generation platform and new formulations for EB612. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $4.4 million, compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of $2.8 million was mainly attributable to a decrease of $1.1 million in employee compensation, including a one-time payment to our former employee pursuant to the terms of his separation agreement, a decrease of $0.8 million as part of a restructuring of professional fees and other advisor expenses, a decrease in Board fees of $0.2 million due to the Board’s forfeiture of their fees for the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and a decrease of $0.7 million in D&O insurance costs. Operating expenses for year ended December 31, 2023 were $8.9 million, as compared to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss was $8.9 million, or $0.31 per ordinary share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $13.1 million, or $0.45 per ordinary share (basic and diluted), for the year ended December 31, 2022. About Entera Bio Entera is a clinical stage company focused on developing oral peptide or protein replacement therapies for significant unmet medical needs where an oral tablet form holds the potential to transform the standard of care. The Company leverages on a disruptive and proprietary technology platform and its pipeline includes five differentiated, first-in-class oral peptide programs, expected to enter into the clinic (Phase 1 to Phase 3) by 2025. The Company’s most advanced product candidate, EB613 (oral PTH(1-34), teriparatide), is being developed as the first oral, osteoanabolic (bone building) once-daily tablet treatment for post-menopausal women with low BMD and high-risk osteoporosis, with no prior fracture.

The company issued guidance for Q1 2024 and FY 2024, expecting revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth. Asure plans to invest in research and development to benefit small business clients and provide innovative HCM solutions. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Asure Software, Inc. demonstrate a significant year-over-year (y/y) revenue growth. Specifically, a 24% increase in total revenues and a marked improvement in net loss reduction from the previous fiscal year are key indicators of the company's improving financial health. The substantial jump in EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA by 63% and 97% respectively, suggests that the company is effectively controlling its operating expenses and optimizing its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The provided guidance for Q1 and FY 2024, projecting further revenue growth and a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin, indicates management's confidence in continued financial performance and operational efficiency.However, the contrast between the reported net losses in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in the previous year raises concerns about the company's profitability in the short term. This could be a point of interest for investors evaluating the sustainability of the company's growth trajectory. Additionally, the exclusion of the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) from future guidance suggests that Asure is adjusting its financial projections to a post-ERTC environment, which could impact its revenue streams and profitability margins. Market Research Analyst Asure's strategic focus on advancing technology through partnerships and product development, such as the 401k bundled offering with payroll and the recent invitation to join the SAP PartnerEdge Open Ecosystem, is indicative of the company's commitment to innovation and market differentiation. The emphasis on HR Compliance, a best-in-class tax platform and the Asure Marketplace™ positions the company to capture a larger market share and potentially high-margin revenue streams. This strategy aligns with current market trends, where businesses are increasingly seeking comprehensive, cloud-based HCM solutions.The planned investments in research and development, aimed at enhancing the product offerings for small business clients and providing enterprise clients with tools to navigate complex tax laws, reflect a targeted approach to meet the diverse needs of its customer base. Asure's proactive approach to expand its annual recurring revenue through acquisitions, as evidenced by the $7 million in signed agreements, is a strong move to bolster its market position and could lead to increased investor confidence. Legal Expert Asure's focus on HR Compliance and its efforts to streamline payroll tax processes through the partnership with SAP could be seen as a strategic response to the increasingly complex regulatory environment. With tax laws and labor regulations constantly evolving, Asure's ability to adapt and provide compliant solutions is crucial for its client base. The integration with SAP systems is likely to enhance Asure's payroll tax engine, offering a competitive edge by simplifying compliance for existing SAP clients and potentially attracting new customers seeking robust compliance solutions.This legal and regulatory foresight can be a significant value proposition for Asure's clients, as non-compliance can result in hefty penalties and reputational damage. By focusing on compliance, Asure not only safeguards its clients but also creates an environment of trust and reliability, which is essential for customer retention and acquisition in the HCM software market. 03/08/2024 - 12:00 PM AUSTIN, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / Asure Software, Inc.

The combined public company would list on a national securities exchange, owning interests in 10 properties with an estimated $62 million NOI for 2024. The LOI includes plans for future acquisitions of hotel properties. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst An evaluation of the potential business combination between Starwood Capital Group's investment entities and Jaws Mustang Acquisition Corp highlights significant financial implications. The Net Operating Income (NOI) projections suggest an optimistic outlook, with an expected increase from $52 million in 2023 to $62 million in 2024 for the Initial Portfolio. This growth trajectory could signal underlying operational efficiencies or market expansion, factors which are often viewed favorably by investors. The ongoing management by SH Group Hotels & Residences U.S., LLC and the De Vere internal operational team may provide continuity and stability post-transaction, potentially reducing integration risks.However, the non-binding nature of the LOI and the contingent conditions, including regulatory review and investor consents, introduce uncertainty. The market's reaction to this announcement may be tempered until a definitive agreement is reached. Additionally, the strategic focus on acquiring additional hotel properties suggests an aggressive growth strategy, which could either be an opportunity for scale benefits or a risk if not executed effectively. Market Research Analyst The hospitality sector's landscape is evolving, with a clear consumer shift towards sustainable luxury experiences. The 1 Hotels brand, with its eco-friendly luxury positioning, taps into this growing niche. The consumer demand for sustainability, coupled with luxury, could give the combined entity a competitive edge. The focus on historic and iconic properties within the De Vere Portfolio aligns with a segment of travelers seeking unique and culturally rich experiences.Market trends also indicate that the post-pandemic recovery of the hospitality industry is gaining momentum, particularly in the luxury segment. The portfolio's geographic diversity, spanning North America, Europe and Asia Pacific, allows for a broad market reach and risk mitigation against regional economic downturns. The potential listing on a national securities exchange could enhance visibility and liquidity for the combined entity, attracting a wider investor base. Legal Expert The LOI's announcement between Starwood Capital Entities and Jaws Mustang Acquisition Corp must be carefully scrutinized for legal compliance, particularly with the SEC regulations. Given the complexities of such transactions, the definitive agreement will likely include detailed terms addressing ownership structure, management agreements and operational control. The due diligence process will be crucial in identifying potential legal and regulatory hurdles that could impact the timeline or feasibility of the transaction.Furthermore, the disclosure of NOI figures and projections must adhere to SEC guidelines to ensure that investors receive accurate and sufficient information. The legal framework governing special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) like Jaws Mustang Acquisition Corp has been under increased scrutiny and any business combination will be closely examined to protect shareholder interests and market integrity. 03/08/2024 - 01:57 PM MIAMI BEACH, Fla., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Investment entities affiliated with Starwood Capital Group (collectively, the ""Starwood Capital Entities"") that own interests in a portfolio of hotels (the ""Initial Portfolio"") comprised of the 1 Hotels properties in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the De Vere Portfolio in the United Kingdom, and Jaws Mustang Acquisition Corp (NYSEA: JWSM), a special purpose acquisition company (""Jaws""), today announced that they have signed a non-binding letter of intent (""LOI"") for a potential business combination (""Business Combination""). Under the terms of the LOI, following the consummation of the Business Combination, the combined public company would be listed on a national securities exchange. 1 Hotels, created by Barry Sternlicht (Chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group) in 2015, is a mission-driven luxury lifestyle platform that places environmental sustainability at the forefront without sacrificing luxury or a premium guest experience. Each 1 Hotel is consciously designed in collaboration with eco-friendly architects and craftsmen, and each property features a high-design with low-impact that leverages reclaimed and natural materials wherever possible. According to Mr. Sternlicht, ""I wanted to capture the beauty of nature in a hotel and commit to safeguarding it as best I can, a responsibility that I believe we all share. It's 1 world. But 1 is more than a hotel, it's a philosophy and a platform for change."" The 1 Hotels portfolio has grown rapidly since inception and now comprises 11 operating properties and another 8 under development across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The De Vere Portfolio, previously acquired by investment affiliates of Starwood Capital Group, consists of a collection of country estates and ancestral family seats that have stood the test of time – each with a long tradition of welcoming and entertaining guests, from Winston Churchill to King Edward VII. These historic country estates and houses have been enhanced to accommodate a 21st Century way of living and working and are complemented by inspiring event spaces. The De Vere experience offers the very best of attentive, personal service and thoughtful touches within atmospheric mansion house surroundings. Under the terms of the LOI, the combined public company would become the direct or indirect owner of the Starwood Capital Entities' interests in the following ten properties constituting the Initial Portfolio: 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge – A waterfront retreat, with sweeping views of the East River and Manhattan skyline, and interiors featuring native greenery and reclaimed materials. This property comprises 195 guest rooms and suites.1 Hotel Central Park – A New York City sanctuary, right off Central Park and steps from the heart of Manhattan. This property comprises 234 guest rooms and suites.The De Vere Portfolio – Spanning central London, outer London, Southern England, and Northern England, these eight iconic, historic country estates and houses comprise the De Vere Wokefield Estate, De Vere Latimer Estate, De Vere Beaumont Estate, De Vere Horsley Estate, De Vere Cranage Estate, De Vere Tortworth Court, De Vere Cotswold Water Park, and De Vere Grand Connaught Rooms. These properties comprise 1,871 guest rooms and suites.It is estimated that the Initial Portfolio earned $52 million of Net Operating Income (""NOI"") at the property level for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the Initial Portfolio is projected to earn NOI at the property level of $62 million for the year ending December 31, 2024. The 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge and the 1 Hotel Central Park will continue to be externally managed by SH Group Hotels & Residences U.S., LLC and the De Vere Portfolio will continue to be managed by its internal operational team. It is expected that on an ongoing basis, the combined public company will seek to acquire additional hotel properties, including 1 Hotels properties. The Starwood Capital Entities and Jaws intend to finalize their definitive business combination agreement in the coming weeks and will announce additional details at that time. There can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be entered into or that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the terms or timeframe currently contemplated, or at all. Any such transaction would be subject to various contingencies and conditions, including the Starwood Capital Entities' requisite investor consents, third party consents and regulatory review, including from the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") and a national securities exchange.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of management for future operations of the combined public company and the Initial Portfolio, including as they relate to the potential Business Combination and related transactions, pricing and market opportunity, the completion of the potential Business Combination and related transactions, the level of redemptions by Jaws' public shareholders and the timing of the completion of the proposed Business Combination, including the anticipated closing date of the proposed Business Combination and the use of the cash proceeds therefrom. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this communication, and on the current expectations of Jaws' and the Starwood Capital Entities' management and are not predictions of actual performance. These forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as and must not be relied on by any investor as a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside the control of the parties, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Financial Data and Use of Projections and Illustrative Presentations If a legally binding definitive agreement with respect to the potential Business Combination is executed, the financial information and operating metrics contained in this presentation may be adjusted in or may be presented differently in the Registration Statement which may be filed by Jaws relating to the potential Business Combination and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, and such adjustments may be material. In addition, this communication includes estimates of certain financial metrics of the Initial Portfolio that may differ from the Initial Portfolio's actual financial metrics presented in any such proxy statement/prospectus. The financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations in this presentation are forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies. The financial projections represent the view of the Starwood Capital Entities' management as of the date hereof. While all financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations are necessarily speculative, the Starwood Capital Entities believe that the preparation of prospective or illustrative financial information involves increasingly higher levels of uncertainty the further out the projection, estimate, target or illustrative presentation extends from the date of preparation. The assumptions and estimates underlying the projected, expected or target results are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial projections, estimates and targets. The inclusion of financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentations in this communication should not be regarded as an indication that the Starwood Capital Entities, or their representatives, considered or consider the financial projections, estimates, targets and illustrative presentation to be a reliable predictions of future events. Further, illustrative presentations are not necessarily based on management projections, estimates, expectations or targets but are presented for illustrative purposes only. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics This communication includes NOI, a non-GAAP financial measure (including on a forward-looking basis). The Starwood Capital Entities are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for non-GAAP NOI without unreasonable effort, and therefore no reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP NOI financial measure is included. These non-GAAP measures are an addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Starwood Capital Entities believe that non-GAAP measures of financial results (including on a forward-looking basis) provide useful supplemental information to investors about the Initial Portfolio. The Starwood Capital Entities' management uses forward-looking non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Initial Portfolio's projected financials and operating performance. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore, the Starwood Capital Entities' non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

These results are shared at the 2024 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting in San Diego, California, March 8–12. Analyses showed that BIMZELX-treated patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in skin pain up to 48 weeks across various assessed outcomes, including the HS Symptom Questionnaire (HSSQ) skin pain item, the Patient Global Impression of Severity of Skin Pain (PGI-S-SP) and the Change in Severity of Skin Pain (PGI-C-SP).1 Additionally, patients demonstrated greater reductions in draining tunnel count compared to those on placebo at Week 16. Responses were either sustained or improved to Week 48.2 ""The majority of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa experience disease-associated pain that can impact their quality-of-life. Data from the Phase 3 studies show that after 48 weeks of bimekizumab treatment approximately six out of ten patients rated their skin pain 'much better',"" said Dr. Hadar Lev-Tov, MD, Associate Professor, Dr. Phillip Frost Department of Dermatology and Cutaneous Surgery, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Florida, U.S. ""These long-term results are encouraging, especially given that pain is a common complaint in people with HS that dermatologists struggle with daily."" ""The bimekizumab 48-week long-term data in moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa showed sustained improvements in skin pain and draining tunnel count. These positive results underscore our commitment to developing solutions that make a meaningful and lasting difference to peoples' lives,"" said Emmanuel Caeymaex, Executive Vice President, Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S., UCB. ""We are actively pursuing regulatory applications across the globe to bring bimekizumab to the hidradenitis suppurativa community."" BIMZELX is not currently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS by any regulatory authority worldwide. The efficacy and safety profile of BIMZELX in the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS have not been established and this is an investigational indication only. At baseline, adult patients (N=1,014) were randomized 2:2:2:1 (initial/maintenance) to receive, either BIMZELX 320 mg every two weeks Q2W/Q2W (n=288), BIMZELX Q2W/Q4W (n=292), BIMZELX Q4W/Q4W (n=288) or placebo/BIMZELX Q2W (n=146).1,2 Across treatment groups, the mean baseline HSSQ skin pain score was 5.8 (on a scale of 0-10, with higher score indicating more pain).1 At baseline, 72.8 percent of patients had draining tunnels with the count comparable across regimens (mean range 3.3–3.8).2 Highlights of the BIMZELX data in moderate-to-severe HS presented at AAD 2024:Impact on pain: At Week 48, HSSQ skin pain response was achieved by 64.6–75.7 percent of patients.1* At Week 48, HSSQ skin pain score of 0 was achieved by 12.7–19.8 percent of patients.1* From Weeks 0–48, HSSQ skin pain scores reduced by 36.9–43.7 percent across treatment groups.1±At Week 48, 55.9–63.7 percent of patients rated their skin pain ""much better"" using the PGI-C-SP.1* At Week 48, 3.9–7.8 percent rated PGI-S-SP ""severe"" vs. 28.5-33.3 percent at baseline and 45.6–47.4 rated PGI-S-SP ""mild"" vs. 15.1–16.7 percent at baseline.1*Impact on draining tunnel count: At Week 16, the draining tunnel percent change from baseline (CfB) was higher with BIMZELX vs. placebo (-43.9 to -45.7 vs. -21.5 percent). BIMZELX-treated patients also saw greater absolute changes in draining tunnel count vs. placebo.2The percentage and absolute CfB increased through Week 48 across all BIMZELX groups.2±At Week 16, greater proportions of BIMZELX-treated patients saw draining tunnel reductions of three or more vs. those on placebo (58.0–70.6 vs. 35.0 percent), with responses sustained or improved to Week 48 across regimens (79.4–88.7 percent).2**Observed case. ±Multiple imputation. Notes to editors: About Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurring, painful, and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.3,4 The main symptoms are nodules, abscesses, and pus-discharging draining tunnels (channels leading out of the skin), which typically occur in the armpits, groin, and buttocks.3,4 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain, which can have a major impact on quality of life.3,4 HS most commonly develops in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.3,4 Approximately one-third of people with HS have a family history of HS, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.3,4 The symptoms of pain, discharge, and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.5 These feelings can lead to embarrassment, social isolation, low self-esteem, and sexual life impairment, and impact all areas of life, including interpersonal relationships, education, and work.6 About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter, Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).7,8 The two studies had a combined enrollment of 1,014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe HS.7,8 The primary endpoint in both trials was HiSCR50 at Week 16.7,8 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16. 7,8 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count, with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count. 7,8 About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF cytokines, blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.9 Elevated levels of IL-17A and IL-17F are found in lesional psoriatic skin.9 In the U.S., BIMZELX is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.9 BIMZELX is not approved in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The efficacy and safety profile of BIMZELX in HS have not been established, and it is not approved for use in HS by any regulatory authority worldwide. Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at www.UCB-USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX. BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION9 Suicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, or other mood changes. If such changes occur, advise to promptly seek medical attention, refer to a mental health professional as appropriate, and re- evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment. InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy, monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves. TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment. Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin at baseline, periodically during treatment with BIMZELX and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected, interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis. Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors, including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs. ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX, complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX. Most Common Adverse ReactionsMost common adverse reactions (≥ 1%) are upper respiratory infections, oral candidiasis, headache, injection site reactions, tinea infections, gastroenteritis, Herpes Simplex Infections, acne, folliculitis, other Candida infections, and fatigue.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic, business and competitive conditions, the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing, costs associated with research and development, changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB, effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations, safety, quality, data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches, or disruptions of our information technology systems, product liability claims, challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates, competition from other products including biosimilars, changes in laws or regulations, exchange rate fluctuations, changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws, and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline, will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far, the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models, cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products, which are the subject of partnerships, joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe, effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also, UCB or others could discover safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover, sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment, including pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally, a breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market, or at any particular time, nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.

(Nasdaq: BIAF) closes securities purchase agreement with institutional investors, offering 1,600,000 shares of common stock and warrants at $1.5625 per share, expecting $2.5 million in gross proceeds. The company plans to utilize the funds for working capital and general corporate purposes.","bioAffinity Technologies Announces Closing of $2.5 Million Registered Direct Offering and Concurrent Private Placement Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIAF) closes securities purchase agreement with institutional investors, offering 1,600,000 shares of common stock and warrants at $1.5625 per share, expecting $2.5 million in gross proceeds. The company plans to utilize the funds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of a securities purchase agreement involving bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. represents a significant capital infusion for the company, totaling approximately $2.5 million. This capital raise, through the issuance of common stock and common warrants, indicates an active approach to securing funding for operational needs and strategic initiatives. The pricing of the common shares at $1.5625 and the warrants at an exercise price of $1.64 suggests a potential for dilution of existing shareholders but also reflects investor confidence at the agreed upon terms.Investors would be prudent to consider the potential dilutive effect of the new shares and warrants on their holdings. However, the influx of capital is likely to bolster the company's working capital and support its general corporate purposes, which could include research and development, marketing and expanding operational capacity. The involvement of WallachBeth Capital as the sole placement agent also lends credibility to the transaction, as such firms typically conduct due diligence before representing an offering.Long-term implications of this transaction could be positive if the company effectively utilizes the proceeds to accelerate growth or improve its competitive positioning. Conversely, if the funds are not managed efficiently, the increase in outstanding shares could lead to shareholder value erosion. Market Research Analyst The transaction details provided by bioAffinity Technologies highlight the company's immediate financial strategy but also open discussions on the broader market implications. The registered direct offering and concurrent private placement are mechanisms often used by companies seeking to raise capital quickly and with fewer regulatory hurdles compared to traditional public offerings.From a market perspective, the company's decision to offer common warrants alongside common stock can be an attractive proposition for institutional investors, as it provides an opportunity for future equity at a set price, potentially yielding a higher return if the company's stock price appreciates. The fact that these warrants are exercisable pending shareholder approval and have a five-year lifespan indicates a long-term investment horizon for the participants of this offering.It's also noteworthy that the offering is being conducted under a shelf registration, which allows the company to prepare for such capital raises in advance and act swiftly when market conditions are favorable. This suggests a strategic financial management approach that may be well-received by the market, signaling preparedness and agility in capital allocation. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding this transaction involves the use of a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, which has been declared effective by the SEC. The use of this mechanism suggests that bioAffinity Technologies is complying with regulatory requirements while seeking to streamline the capital-raising process.The private placement of the common warrants, relying on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D, is a common practice for transactions that are not offered to the public at large. This allows the company to sell securities to a select group of institutional investors without the need for a public offering, reducing the time and expense associated with a public issuance.It is also important to note that the press release explicitly states that the securities may not be sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption, which is a standard disclaimer to prevent any potential misinterpretation of the offering as being open to the general public. This highlights the company's adherence to securities law and its awareness of the legal intricacies involved in such financial transactions. 03/08/2024 - 12:45 PM SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- bioAffinity Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIAF and BIAFW) today announced it has closed a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors for the purchase and sale of 1,600,000 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering and common warrants to purchase up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement (together with the registered direct offering) at a combined purchase price of $1.5625 per common share. The common warrants issued pursuant to the concurrent private placement will have an exercise price of $1.64 per share, are initially exercisable on the date that shareholder approval of the exercise of the warrants is obtained and will expire five years from the date of such approval. The gross proceeds to the Company from the offering are expected to be approximately $2.5 million, before deducting underwriter fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. WallachBeth Capital is acting as sole placement agent for the Offering. The common stock was issued in a registered direct offering pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275608) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and declared effective by the SEC on November 27, 2023. The common warrants will be issued in a concurrent private placement. A prospectus supplement describing the terms of the proposed registered direct offering was filed with the SEC and is available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the prospectus supplement may be obtained, when available, from WallachBeth Capital, LLC, via email at cap-mkts@wallachbeth.com, by calling +1 (646) 237‑8585, or by standard mail at WallachBeth Capital LLC, Attn: Capital Markets, 185 Hudson St., Suite 1410, Jersey City, NJ 07311, USA. The private placement of the common warrants was made in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D thereunder. Accordingly, the securities issued in the concurrent private placement may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

(“Liberty Latin America” or “LLA”) (NASDAQ: LILA and LILAK, OTC Link: LILAB) has further demonstrated its commitment to advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace and across communities by joining the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) community. Across the region, Liberty Latin America is determined to work collaboratively to foster business practices that empower women including equal pay for work of equal value and zero tolerance for any forms of harassment in the workplace. The Company is already taking action in support of the seven WEPs with notable progress in a few areas. In 2021, the Company launched its gender-based violence (GBV) policy which is available to the public on its website for other organizations to use as part of the global effort to stop violence in all forms. In 2022, the Company partnered with the United Nations Foundation and the Spotlight Initiative to support the WithHer Fund providing resources to supporting local community development programs that are contributing to gender equality and women’s empowerment. Additionally, the Company worked together with the Society of Women Coders to launch an initiative aimed at empowering the next generation of women leaders in technology fields. The partnership provided the opportunity for 800 young women across the Caribbean and Latin America to participate in a 20-week virtual course focused on digital literacy, web development, and coding skills. In 2023, the Company's operations in Jamaica partnered with government bodies to establish a free helpline for survivors of gender-based violence and is working on plans to extend the offering to additional markets across the region in 2024. Chief People Officer, Kerry Scott, commented, “In our seventh year of actively prioritizing gender equality, we continue to utilize International Women’s Day as an important moment to share our progress including the implementation of several new policies in the region such as paid parental leave, hybrid working environments, employee assistance programs, and in 2023, establishing our employee resource group, ELLAS, which has become a very proactive group seeking to empower women to thrive and reach their full potential through representation, allyship, support, and connection.” Scott continued, “By agreeing to become a signatory of the WEPs, we continue to demonstrate our passion to make a difference and have a positive impact in our communities. We are making progress, but across our region there is still so much to do, and we plan to be on the forefront of driving the push for gender equality.” This year, Liberty Latin America will invite its 10,000+ employees to participate in a company-wide event to learn more about the value women bring to the world and how to support women so they can be themselves, have a sense of belonging, and feel empowered to bring their best. In addition, the Company will host activities across the region through its ELLAS Employee Resource Group to foster a dialogue around how to be an ally for women, including how to support the woman next to them and to inspire a sense of belonging. Finally, a range of external programs in partnership with various businesses, non-profit organizations, and government bodies have been organized to advocate for gender equality from a grass roots and community-led perspective. “International Women’s Day provides an opportunity for us to reinforce how we’re advocating and advancing equality, diversity, and inclusion in the workplace and in our communities through education and impactful actions. We can collectively forge a more inclusive world for women by embracing our differences and committing to #InspireInclusion,” Scott continued.

The shares are now trading on NYSE American under the symbol 'RYDE'. The underwriters have an option to purchase an additional 450,000 shares. The Offering is managed by Maxim Group LLC. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The successful completion of Ryde Group Ltd's initial public offering (IPO) represents a significant milestone for the company and has the potential to influence its strategic direction and growth prospects. The IPO's size, with 3,000,000 Class A ordinary shares at $4.00 each, generates $12 million in gross proceeds, which is a modest amount compared to larger tech IPOs. This suggests a targeted approach to fundraising, potentially aimed at funding specific growth initiatives or technological advancements within their mobility and quick commerce platform.Given the niche market of Singapore and the competitive landscape of mobility and quick commerce platforms, the capital raised might be allocated to enhance their technological infrastructure, expand their service offerings, or increase market penetration. The decision to list on the NYSE American, a market focused on emerging growth companies, indicates Ryde's ambition to appeal to a broader international investor base and leverage the visibility and credibility associated with a U.S. listing.The underwriters' over-allotment option, often referred to as a 'greenshoe' option, allows for the purchase of an additional 450,000 shares. This mechanism is typically used to stabilize the share price post-IPO and could indicate confidence in the stock's performance. Investors will monitor the stock's market reception and post-IPO price stability as indicators of the company's valuation and market sentiment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the key factors to consider in Ryde's IPO include the valuation implied by the offering price, the use of proceeds and the company's post-IPO capital structure. At $4.00 per share, the valuation needs to be assessed against the company's financial metrics such as revenue, growth rate and profitability, as well as compared to peers within the industry.Analyze the company's financial statements and forecasts to evaluate whether the capital raised aligns with its growth strategy and if it's sufficient to achieve its stated objectives. It's also important to scrutinize the underwriting discounts and offering expenses, as these will affect the net proceeds available to the company. Long-term investors will be particularly interested in how the IPO proceeds will contribute to the company's financial health and its ability to generate sustainable growth and shareholder value.Additionally, the roles of Sidley Austin LLP and Ortoli Rosenstadt LLP as legal counsel in the IPO process are crucial for ensuring regulatory compliance and mitigating legal risks associated with public offerings. The effectiveness of this legal guidance can have a direct impact on investor confidence and the company's reputation in the public market. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding an IPO is intricate, involving rigorous scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ryde's filing of a Form F-1 registration statement, which has been declared effective by the SEC, indicates that they have met the necessary regulatory requirements for public offerings. This process involves detailed disclosures about the company's business, financial condition and risks, which are essential for investor transparency.Prospective investors should review the final prospectus, which contains critical information about the company's operations, management and financials. The prospectus is a key document that helps investors make informed decisions. The role of legal counsel in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of these disclosures cannot be overstated, as any omissions or inaccuracies could lead to severe legal repercussions, including potential securities litigation.Furthermore, the legal complexities of the IPO process extend beyond the initial offering. Post-IPO, the company will be subject to ongoing reporting requirements and increased scrutiny from both the SEC and public shareholders. The transition from a private to a public entity requires stringent adherence to corporate governance standards and the company's ability to meet these expectations will be critical to its long-term success in the public market. 03/08/2024 - 11:30 AM SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ryde Group Ltd (“Ryde” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: RYDE), a technology company with a leading platform for mobility and quick commerce in Singapore, announced today the closing of its previously announced initial public offering of 3,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, at a price of US$4.00 per share to the public (the “Offering”), for a total of US$12,000,000 of gross proceeds to the Company, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

Blue Rhino is working with leading influencers in backyard grilling reaching over 17 million people through the second fiscal quarter. LIBERTY, Mo., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. (OTC: FGPR) (“Ferrellgas” or the “Company”) today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. “Ferrellgas account managers are one of many high performing teams within Ferrellgas. In the second fiscal quarter, our account managers provided millions of gallons of new business,” said Tamria Zertuche, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ferrellgas. “We believe our General Managers are the best in the industry. Teamed up with the account managers they have grown retail EBITDA, all the while navigating one of the warmest winters on record.” Gross profit decreased by $3.9 million, or 1%, for the second fiscal quarter compared to the prior year period. The $74.1 million decrease in revenue was partially offset by a decrease of $70.2 million in cost of product as compared to the prior year period. Our wholesale sales price per gallon partially correlates to the change in the wholesale market price of propane. The wholesale market price at our two major supply points averaged 10.1% and 15.0% less in the second fiscal quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year period. These decreases impacted both the revenue and cost of product changes for the period. As expected, propane market cost reduction and stabilization impacted our current period gross profit. Margin per gallon was $1.26 per gallon and $1.21 per gallon for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating income per gallon was $0.46 per gallon and $0.44 per gallon for the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gallons sold for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 decreased 13.6 million, or 5%, primarily due to customer attrition related to the impact of continued inflationary conditions across the nation and warmer weather during the quarter as compared to the prior year period. We recognized net earnings attributable to Ferrellgas Partners, L.P. of $95.8 million and $98.1 million in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. Operating expense as a percentage of total revenue increased 13% for the second fiscal quarter compared to the prior year period. Operating expense – personnel, vehicle, plant and office increased $2.3 million, or 1%. Lower legal costs compared to the prior year period drove the majority of the $5.9 million decrease in General and administrative expense, partially offset by costs related to the technology investments described above. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased by $9.0 million, or 6%, to $146.9 million in the second fiscal quarter compared to $155.9 million in the prior year quarter. The change was primarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in gross profit and, after adjusting for a $9.0 million decrease in Legal fees and settlements related to non-core businesses, a $5.4 million increase in Operating, general and administrative expense. In conjunction with our focus on growth, we acquired Eastern Sierra Propane in January 2024 with seller advising support from Matrix Capital Markets Group, Inc. This additional 150-mile service area in the Eastern Sierra mountains was cultivated by owner Tom Sigler over 30 years and complements our existing California service units. The strategic propane gas storage acquired through the sale will benefit our distribution network. Technology remains a strategic priority as we advance various business initiatives such as the design and implementation of the ERP system noted above. Our digital welcome package and tank monitoring installations are other customer service enhancements. As a nationwide logistics company, we will benefit from having better data, miles and minutes management and pricing tools which in turn will allow us to deliver product to our customers timely and efficiently.

SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Join Intel experts for panel discussions and talks at this year’s Open Confidential Computing Conference (OC3), a virtual event on March 13. Hosted by Edgeless Systems, OC3 is the premier event for security architects, cloud-native software engineers, IT security experts, CISOs, CTOs, security researchers and developers who want to learn about confidential computing. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240308183003/en/Intel technologists will present advances in confidential computing and participate in a CTO panel discussion at this year's Open Confidential Computing Conference. The virtual event is March 13. (Credit: Intel Corporation) Protecting systems and sensitive, confidential or regulated data, especially while in use, has never been more critical. As computing moves to span multiple environments – from on-prem to public cloud to edge – organizations need protection controls that help safeguard sensitive intellectual property (IP) and workload data wherever that data resides. Learn how Intel, together with its partners and customers, builds the trusted foundation for protecting AI workloads and computing in a data-centric world. Open Confidential Computing Conference (OC3) 2024 When: March 13, 2024 Where: Virtual Event Registration: Free to attend Confidential Cloud Native Attestation – Challenges and Opportunities Confidential computing brings with it tamper-resistant registers to measure digital ingredients, akin to what the Trusted Computing Group’s TPM 2.0 offers, such as BIOS, firmware, kernel and beyond. Clouds are varied in their infrastructure and multiple confidential computing vendors, each potentially with multiple product generations, offering confidential CPUs, GPUs and other special-purpose processing units. Further, there are at least three flavors of confidential virtual machine (CVM) use – whole confidential Kubernetes clusters, launching traditional virtual machine payloads as a CVM using KubeVirt or Virtual Kubelet, or running a confidential container, like CoCo. What should one measure, particularly with confidential clusters where workloads come and go? The trick lies in capturing invariants and keeping them separate to not have a combinatorial explosion of values to register in an attestation service as good values. Further, what is the essence that we must keep invariant to protect the workloads in the various contexts? In this talk, Mikko Ylinen, senior Linux software engineer at Intel, and Malini Bhandaru, senior principal engineer and cloud native architect at Intel, will share an overview of the landscape followed by a proposal to measure invariants in a typed data structure with a summary in the CVM tamper-resistant measurement registers and how it supports scalable attestation. It will be illustrated in the context of Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX) using established techniques, such as CoCo, Linux IMA, dm-verity or CCNP. When: Wednesday, March 13, 8-8:30 a.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform Confidential Computing in 2024 – Innovating Secure and Scalable Solutions We are on the cusp of a transformative era. Technical readiness and market momentum will converge in 2024 to accelerate growth and adoption of confidential computing. This session, presented by Anand Pashupathy, vice president and general manager of Security Software and Services at Intel, will offer a comprehensive assessment of the industry’s progress as the industry aligns with imperatives described in Intel CTO Greg Lavender’s 2023 keynote at OC3. Pashupathy will also provide an in-depth look at Intel’s strategic initiatives to address remaining adoption barriers and elevate confidential computing to new levels of security, performance and user-friendly scalability. When: Wednesday, March 13, 10:30-11 a.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform Tightening Side Channel Protections with Intel SGX AEX-Notify Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) supports the creation of shielded enclaves within unprivileged processes. Code and data within an enclave cannot be read or modified by the operating system or hypervisor, nor by any other software. However, side-channel attacks can be challenging to comprehensively mitigate. This talk by Scott Constable, research scientist, Cybersecurity and Computer Security at Intel, will give an overview of AEX-Notify, a new flexible architecture extension that makes enclaves interrupt-aware: Enclaves can register a trusted software handler to be run after an interrupt or exception (such as a fault). AEX-Notify can be used as a building block for implementing countermeasures against different types of interrupt- and fault-based attacks. AEX-Notify is available on 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors and newer products with Intel SGX and is also backward-portable to all older server products via a microcode update. The Intel SGX SDK for Linux now supports a default trusted software handler that mitigates attacks that use interrupts or exceptions to exert fine-grained control over enclave execution, for example, by forcing a single enclave instruction to execute each time the enclave is entered. When: Wednesday, March 13, 11-11:15 a.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform Asterinas: A Safe and Efficient Rust-Based OS Kernel for TEE and Beyond In the realm of OS kernels, particularly those within virtual machine (VM) trusted execution environments (TEEs), memory safety is a paramount concern. Rust, known for its safety features, aids in developing secure kernels but is not a panacea. Firstly, Rust's unsafe features, such as pointer dereferencing and inline assembly, are necessary for low-level, error-prone tasks, often permeating the codebase. Secondly, the guest kernel in a VM TEE often processes untrusted inputs (over 1,500 instances in Linux, per Intel's estimation) from the host (through hypercalls, MMIO, etc.), posing a risk of exploitable memory safety vulnerabilities. This leads us to explore how effectively a Rust-based kernel can minimize its trusted computing base (TCB) against memory safety threats, including Iago attacks. The response is Asterinas: a safe and efficient OS kernel crafted in Rust, offering Linux ABI compatibility. Asterinas introduces a groundbreaking framekernel OS architecture. This design splits the kernel into two distinct halves within the same address space: the framework and services. The framework is the sole domain allowed to utilize unsafe Rust features, providing a high-level, safe and sound API for the services, which are exclusively developed in safe Rust. The services are responsible for providing most of the OS functionalities, including enabling all peripheral devices. As the entire kernel resides in the same address space, different parts of the kernel can communicate in the most efficient way. In this talk, Chuan Song, principal engineer at Intel, and Hongliang Tian from Ant Group dive into the design and implementation of Asterinas. They will spotlight the pioneering framekernel OS architecture and show how the kernel is ported to and fortified for Intel TDX. When: Wednesday, March 13, 11:15-11:45 a.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform Seamless Attestation of Intel TDX and NVIDIA H100 TEEs for Confidential AI AI is now the most significant workload in data centers and the cloud. It’s being embedded into other workloads used for standalone deployments and distributed across hybrid clouds and the edge. Many of the demanding AI workloads require hardware acceleration with a GPU. Many AI models are considered priceless intellectual property – companies spend millions of dollars building them, and the parameters and model weights are closely guarded secrets. The datasets used to train these models are also considered highly confidential and can create a competitive advantage. As a result, data and model owners are looking for ways to protect these, not just at rest and in transit, but while in use as well. Intel and Nvidia deliver confidential computing technologies that establish independent TEEs on the CPU and GPU, respectively. For a customer, this presents an attestation challenge, requiring attestation from two different services to gather the evidence needed to verify the trustworthiness of the CPU and GPU TEEs. Intel and Nvidia are collaborating to provide a unified attestation solution for customers to verify the trustworthiness of the CPU and GPU TEEs for confidential computing based on Intel® Xeon® processors with Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX) and Nvidia Tensorcore H100 GPUs. This session presented by Raghu Yeluri, senior principal engineer and lead security architect at Intel, and Michael O’Connor of Nvidia will look at the TEE architectures and how they are enabled for seamless attestation of the two TEEs using Intel® Trust Authority and Nvidia Remote Attestation Service (NRAS). When: Wednesday, March 13, 12-12:30 p.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform The Status Quo and Potential of Confidential AI OC3 brings back this exciting panel with industry leaders, this time to discuss confidential AI. The panelists will discuss what confidential AI is, use cases, technical challenges, regulatory incentives and limits. Panel members will also make predictions about the future of this technology. Will AI be the “killer app” for confidential computing? When will confidential computing be the standard for AI? This panel will feature Greg Lavender, executive vice president, chief technology officer (CTO) and general manager of the Software and Advanced Technology Group (SATG) at Intel, alongside the CTOs of AMD and Microsoft Azure, and the vice president of Hyperscale and HPC from Nvidia. When: Wednesday, March 13, 1-1:30 p.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform Private Data Exchange – Leveraging Confidential Computing to Combat Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery This session from Hope for Justice, Intel and Edgeless Systems will unpack the Private Data Exchange, an exciting and innovative project leveraging confidential computing as a powerful tool in the fight against human trafficking and modern slavery. Organizations like Hope for Justice and Slave-Free Alliance have joined the effort to find victims, as well as perpetrators. The Private Data Exchange is an innovative project in partnership with Intel and Edgeless Systems to develop a platform that can encrypt data to protect sensitive information, knowing that behind it are the private lives of people who’ve been abused and traumatized and need protection. Intel technology enables the Private Data Exchange to leverage confidential computing, which processes sensitive data out of view from unauthorized software or system administrators. The data is encrypted and processed in memory, lowering the risk of exposure to the rest of the system, which can compromise it. Confidential computing relies on hardware-based controls, enabled by Intel SGX enclaves. This project will enable global organizations to collaborate and share analyses to prevent human trafficking, respond to situations of exploitation and ensure victims receive the support they need, while shielding their confidential information or regulated data. When: Wednesday, March 13, 2:45-3 p.m. PDT Where: Virtual through conference platform About Intel Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) is an industry leader, creating world-changing technology that enables global progress and enriches lives. Inspired by Moore’s Law, we continuously work to advance the design and manufacturing of semiconductors to help address our customers’ greatest challenges.

(NASDAQ: WIMI) is researching a blockchain optimized data storage model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) sharding. This innovative model aims to improve blockchain system performance, reduce storage costs, enhance data privacy and security, and increase data processing efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Blockchain Technology Expert The integration of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) sharding into blockchain data storage represents a significant advancement in the field of distributed ledger technologies. Sharding, as a concept, is not new to blockchain ecosystems. It is a scalability solution that partitions the database to spread the load, thereby enhancing the throughput of transactions. However, the novel approach of using ELM to optimize sharding processes could potentially alleviate the bottlenecks of blockchain performance, particularly in relation to data storage and processing speed.ELM's unique characteristics of fast training speed and strong generalization ability suggest that it could improve the efficiency of shard management and data processing within each shard. This could lead to reduced reliance on full nodes, which are typically a limiting factor in scaling blockchain networks. For businesses and investors, such technological improvements could translate into lower operational costs and enhanced data security, making blockchain solutions more viable for large-scale applications.However, the practical implementation and the actual performance gains of this ELM-based sharding model in a real-world blockchain network remain to be seen. It will be crucial to monitor the subsequent development and testing phases to gauge the model's impact on the industry. Data Security Analyst From a data security perspective, the proposed ELM sharding model by WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. could offer a more granular approach to data privacy and integrity. By partitioning data across multiple ELM nodes, the risk of a single point of failure is mitigated. This means that even if one shard is compromised, the integrity of the entire blockchain remains intact. It is a layered defense strategy that can be particularly appealing for industries that handle sensitive information, such as finance or healthcare.Furthermore, the use of machine learning algorithms like ELM within blockchain could pave the way for advanced predictive analytics and automated anomaly detection within the ledger. This could strengthen the blockchain's resilience against fraudulent activities and enhance its overall security posture. Stakeholders should consider the potential for such technologies to revolutionize data management practices within their respective industries. Financial Analyst For investors, the announcement by WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. is a forward-looking development that could have long-term financial implications. If successfully implemented, the ELM sharding model could position WiMi as a pioneer in blockchain storage solutions, potentially opening up new revenue streams and partnerships. The company's focus on reducing storage costs and improving transaction speeds addresses two critical pain points that could drive adoption and increase market share in the competitive blockchain industry.However, investors should also weigh the research and development risks involved. The transition from a traditional blockchain model to one that incorporates ELM sharding will require significant investment and could encounter technical challenges. The timeline for commercialization and the model's reception by the blockchain community will be key factors influencing the financial outcomes of this initiative. 03/08/2024 - 10:50 AM BEIJING, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider, today announced that it is researching a blockchain optimized data storage model based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) sharding. ELM is a machine learning algorithm based on artificial neural networks. The core idea of ELM is to initialize the connection weights between the input layer to the hidden layer randomly. Then through parsing, the connection weights between the output layer to the hidden layer are quickly calculated, and a simple and efficient neural network model is constructed by randomly generating the input weights and the bias of the hidden layer neurons. Compared with traditional neural network algorithms, ELM is characterized by fast training speed and strong generalization ability. Whereas sharding is a method of splitting data into multiple segments in a blockchain system, each of which can be processed and stored independently, sharding improves the performance of the blockchain system. The ELM-based sharding blockchain data storage model divides the blockchain network into multiple shards, each of which needs to store and process only part of the blockchain's data. Specifically, each slice only needs to store and verify the blocks and transaction data associated with it, without storing a full copy of the entire blockchain. This can greatly reduce storage requirements, lower storage costs, and improve the efficiency and performance of data synchronization. In this model, each slice can use ELM as its local storage and computation unit. ELM is an efficient machine learning algorithm with fast training and prediction capabilities. Each slice can use ELM to store and process its own blockchain data without relying on other slices or full nodes. This increases the efficiency of data storage and processing and reduces the dependency on full nodes. Specifically, it is first necessary to split the original blockchain data into multiple segments and store these segments on different nodes, thus realizing the distributed management of data storage as well as achieving parallel processing of data. Each node only needs to store the sharding data it is responsible for, which greatly reduces the storage pressure of nodes. Each shard can be managed by one or more ELM nodes. ELM nodes use ELM algorithms to train and process the data. ELM is a fast and efficient machine learning algorithm that can process and analyze large amounts of data in a short period of time. Each ELM node can independently process and store the data sharding it is responsible for. This sharding technology improves the parallel processing of data, thus increasing the performance of the entire blockchain system. At the same time, since each node only needs to manage a portion of the data, it can reduce the cost of data storage and processing. In addition, the ELM-based sharding technology can also provide higher data privacy and security. Since the data is partitioned into multiple segments and managed by different ELM nodes, even if one node is attacked or the data is leaked, it will not have an impact on the data integrity of the whole system. The ELM-based sharding blockchain data storage model researched by WiMi can solve the problems of storage capacity and transaction speed faced by the traditional blockchain data storage model, reduce the storage cost, improve the efficiency and performance of data synchronization, and provide a more efficient way of data management and access to further improve the performance and scalability of the blockchain system. This model is of great significance in the application of blockchain technology and data storage models. About WIMI Hologram Cloud WIMI Hologram Cloud, Inc.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 10:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / The Clorox CompanyBy Bailey Doyle, Associate Director, Marketing Transformation Some of the women who have played a key role in the company's history (pictured clockwise from top): Annie Murray, Hazel McClure, Denise Garner and Roxanne Quimby.""If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.""Sir Isaac NewtonOne of the most influential scientists of all time recognized that we rely on the contributions of the people that come before us. During Women's History Month, I want to share a few of the stories about the long line of amazing women who preceded us at Clorox, building a strong foundation for us to succeed.The reason you can find Clorox in so many households today is because of Annie Murray. She and her husband, William Murray, the first Clorox general manager, had a vision in 1916 of expanding Clorox Bleach beyond its original commercial uses. You could call Annie the first marketer of Clorox Bleach, as it was her idea to give away samples of the product at the family's grocery store in Oakland, California. She was the original ""Clorox storyteller"" - and helped change the trajectory of the company.Women continued to play an influential role in the direction of the company over the next 100-plus years.In the 1930s, Hazel McClure, Rebekah Lewis and Peggy Lewis, assistants to the company's male leadership team collectively dubbed ""The Three Graces,"" proposed Clorox's very first influencer partnership. They recommended working with home economist Jessie Deboth, whose traveling show ""School for Homemakers"" drew millions of women for cooking advice, appliance displays, sing-a-longs and networking. Clorox partnered with her to tell the brand's story through laundry demonstrations at events in large auditoriums across the U.S. While all three were awarded stock options for their contributions to the company, in 1973 Hazel made history with her appointment as Clorox's first female officer.Around the turn of the century, a team was tasked with the idea of building on our popular Clorox Clean-up spray cleaner. In its research, the team learned consumers were tired of having to don their battle fatigues every time they cleaned. Instead, they were looking for a product that would make it easier to clean ""in the flow."" This ""aha"" moment led to the invention of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. This team was led by Denise Garner, who went on to serve as chief innovation officer for the company from 2015 to 2022.Women have also played pivotal roles in the development of other brands in our portfolio. Many are familiar with Burt Shavitz, the face of Burt's Bees, but not as many people are familiar with Roxanne Quimby, the cofounder of the brand. Roxanne helped tell the Burt's story by branding his products with custom labels, promoting his products at craft fairs, and eventually selling beeswax candles and lip balms at a New York City boutique, which led to the widespread success of the flagship product. Roxanne continues to tell the Burt's Bees story of nature conservation through her land preservation efforts.These are just some of the women who have played a part in shaping our company into what it is today. I have no doubt future generations will look back and see themselves standing on some of our shoulders - and one day they will tell our stories, too.In addition to her day job, Bailey serves on the leadership team of SHOW, our employee resource group for women.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from The Clorox Company on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: The Clorox CompanyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/clorox-companyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: The Clorox CompanyView the original press release on accesswire.com Who are some key female figures in Clorox Company's history?

Women's History Month is a time for Clorox Company to honor and celebrate the contributions of key female figures in its history.

Trinity Biotech Regains Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Closing Bid Price Rule,2024-03-08T15:03:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Trinity Biotech Plc. (NASDAQ: TRIB) has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) by maintaining a minimum bid price of $1.00 per ADS for 10 consecutive business days. The prior bid price deficiency issue is now resolved.,"Trinity Biotech Regains Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Closing Bid Price Rule Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trinity Biotech Plc. (NASDAQ: TRIB) has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) by maintaining a minimum bid price of $1.00 per ADS for 10 consecutive business days. The prior bid price deficiency issue is now resolved. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement is a pivotal moment for Trinity Biotech Plc., as it directly impacts investor perception and the stock's liquidity. The adherence to Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) suggests that the company has managed to reverse the downward trend in its stock price, which could be indicative of improved market confidence or the effectiveness of strategic initiatives undertaken by management. This development is particularly important for institutional investors and index funds that may have policies against holding stocks not in compliance with exchange requirements.It is critical to analyze the underlying catalysts that led to the recovery in share price. If the increase is due to fundamental improvements in the company's financial health or growth prospects, it could signal a positive trajectory for the company's future performance. However, if the price recovery is due to temporary factors, such as a short-term promotional effort or a share buyback program, the long-term sustainability of the compliance might be questionable. Stakeholders should monitor subsequent financial disclosures and market performance to assess the durability of the compliance status. Market Research Analyst The compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) is often seen as a barometer of a company's market stability and can influence its attractiveness to potential investors. From a market research perspective, it is essential to understand the competitive landscape and how Trinity Biotech's position might change as a result of this news. The company's ability to maintain a minimum bid price over the required period could reflect improved investor sentiment, possibly driven by sector-specific trends or the company's operational advancements.Further research into the company's market share, product pipeline and competitive advantages would provide greater context to the significance of this news. Additionally, examining the trading volume during the period of compliance could offer insights into the level of market interest and the potential for continued compliance. A sustained increase in trading volume, coupled with price stability, could be indicative of a more robust investor base and improved market conditions for the company. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, Trinity Biotech's return to compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement removes the immediate risk of delisting, which is a critical legal and regulatory milestone. This compliance ensures that the company remains in good standing with the exchange's rules, which is essential for maintaining its listing and the benefits that come with it, such as access to capital markets and visibility to a broader investor base.It is important for the company to continue adhering to all other listing requirements to avoid any future compliance issues. Shareholders and potential investors should be aware that while this particular hurdle has been cleared, it is only one aspect of the company's overall legal and regulatory obligations. Continuous monitoring of the company's adherence to other Nasdaq listing rules and regulatory requirements is necessary to fully understand the legal context of its market position. 03/08/2024 - 10:03 AM DUBLIN, Ireland, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Trinity Biotech Plc. (NASDAQ: TRIB) (the “Company”) today reported the receipt of a formal notification from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") that the Company has regained compliance with Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), which requires the Company's American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per ADS. The Nasdaq staff made this determination of compliance after the closing bid price of the Company's was at $1.00 per share or greater for the prior 10 consecutive business days. Accordingly, the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) and Nasdaq considers the prior bid price deficiency matter now closed.

The company focuses on aerospace and agrivoltaics markets, highlighting competitive advantages and customer-acquisition strategies. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The revenue projections released by Ascent Solar Technologies indicate a significant upward trajectory, with expectations of year-over-year growth from $9 million to $13.2 million in 2024 to a substantial $50 million to $80 million in 2025. This suggests a bullish outlook for the company's financial performance. It's important to consider the drivers behind these numbers, such as the expanding markets of aerospace and agrivoltaics, where Ascent is positioning itself as a leader with its CIGS thin-film photovoltaic solutions.Ascent's focus on lightweight and flexible solar technology is a strategic advantage in these sectors, especially aerospace where weight is a critical factor. The company's robust patent portfolio could serve as a barrier to entry for competitors, potentially securing a larger market share. However, investors should note these figures are based on current discussions and testing, not contracted revenue, which introduces a level of uncertainty. The long-term success will depend on Ascent's ability to convert its customer discussions into binding contracts and to scale up production to meet the forecasted demand. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis perspective, the anticipated growth rates for Ascent Solar Technologies are remarkable and could significantly impact its stock valuation if achieved. The projected increase from $9 million to up to $80 million within a two-year span represents a potential revenue growth rate exceeding 800%. However, it is crucial to scrutinize the underlying assumptions of these projections, especially since they are not based on firm contracts.Investors should consider the capital requirements and operational scalability necessary to achieve such growth. Ascent's ability to manage costs while expanding production will be pivotal. Moreover, the photovoltaic industry is subject to rapid technological advancements and decreasing costs, which could impact Ascent's competitive position. A thorough analysis of the company's financial health, including its cash flow statements and balance sheet, will provide a clearer picture of its ability to fund growth and manage potential risks. Renewable Energy Expert Ascent's focus on the niche markets of aerospace and agrivoltaics within the broader photovoltaic industry is strategically significant. The company's specialization in CIGS (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide) thin-film solar cells offers distinct advantages in terms of flexibility and weight compared to traditional silicon-based solar cells. These properties are particularly beneficial in aerospace applications, where every ounce matters and for agrivoltaics, which combines agriculture and solar power to maximize land use.The potential for agrivoltaics is vast, as it addresses food security and energy production simultaneously. Ascent's innovative approach could disrupt traditional agrivoltaic practices by providing more efficient and adaptable solar solutions. However, the success of these technologies hinges on their reliability and cost-effectiveness over time.

The potential market size for treatments targeting atopic dermatitis and other immune-mediated diseases is large and successful commercialization could lead to substantial revenue streams. However, the costs associated with clinical trials, potential partnerships and marketing must also be factored into the financial forecasts. 03/08/2024 - 10:00 AM KT-621 (STAT6) and KT-294 (TYK2) have the potential to provide biologics-like activity with oral small molecule profiles KT-621 (STAT6) expected to start Phase 1 in second half of 2024 and KT-294 (TYK2) expected to start Phase 1 in first half of 2025, both with Phase 1 data in 2025 WATERTOWN, Mass., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kymera Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: KYMR), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new class of small molecule medicines using targeted protein degradation (TPD), today announced that its preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of its potent and selective heterobifunctional degraders of STAT6 (KT-621) and TYK2 (KT-294) are being presented in the poster session at the American Academy of Dermatology’s Annual Meeting in San Diego, California. Kymera’s oral STAT6 and TYK2 degraders have the potential to address multiple immune-mediated diseases and overcome the limitations of existing technologies and agents. Today’s poster presentations mark the first time that data from a STAT6 targeted agent and a TYK2 degrader have been shared at a major medical meeting. Based on the results generated to date, Kymera intends to initiate Phase 1 testing for KT-621 and KT-294 in the in the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025, respectively. Data from both Phase 1 trials are expected to be reported in 2025. “Our differentiated strategy to targeted protein degradation has resulted in an industry-leading immunology pipeline of oral degrader medicines, each with the potential to treat multiple complex immuno-inflammatory diseases. Our preclinical findings demonstrate the potential advantage of using oral degraders over other technologies to effectively drug critical signaling nodes driving inflammation in a variety of diseases,” said Nello Mainolfi, PhD, Founder, President and CEO, Kymera Therapeutics. “Importantly, we believe our STAT6 and TYK2 degraders provide the convenience of oral medicines with the potential for biologics-like activity and in doing so reach broader patient populations compared to injectable biologics or other standards of care.” The findings presented today demonstrate that in preclinical studies, KT-621, Kymera’s first-in-class oral STAT6 degrader, was exquisitely selective for STAT6 over other STATs and fully blocked IL-4/IL-13 functions in key human TH2 cellular assays with picomolar potency that was superior to dupilumab. At low daily oral doses, preclinical studies with KT-621 demonstrated near full in vivo STAT6 degradation in disease-relevant tissues that was well-tolerated. In a MC903-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model, KT-621 demonstrated robust degradation of STAT6 in spleen and marked reduction of total serum IgE comparable to the activity of dupilumab. These data demonstrate the potential of KT-621 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases with best-in-pathway potential given its dupilumab-like activity profile and the convivence of an oral pill. Additionally, in preclinical studies, KT-294, Kymera’s first-in-class highly selective oral TYK2 degrader, demonstrated picomolar degradation potency and potent inhibition of the IL-23, IL-12 and Type I IFN pathways, showing its potential to recapitulate the biology of human TYK2 loss-of-function profile. KT-294, does not impact any of the other Janus kinase (JAK) proteins and in doing so spares IL-10, unlike the TYK2 small molecule inhibitor, deucravacitinib, which is important in inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, TYK2 degradation leads to superior inhibition of the Type 1 IFN pathway compared to TAK-2791, which is relevant to the treatment of interferonopathies. The biological differentiation of the TYK2 degrader, KT-294, combined with the ability to provide deep and sustained TYK2 knockdown in vivo with low daily oral doses, has the potential to deliver a best-in-class TYK2 profile with broad activity across multiple IL-12/IL-23- and IFN-driven immune-inflammatory diseases potentially reaching pathway biologics activity. The company plans to share additional preclinical data for KT-621 and KT-294 at upcoming medical meetings in 2024. Copies of both poster presentations entitled “Potent and Selective Oral STAT6 Degraders Inhibit IL-4 and IL-13 Functions in Human Cells and Block TH2 Inflammation in a Mouse Model of Atopic Dermatitis” and “Potent and Selective TYK2 Degraders, Devoid of JAK Activity, Potently and Completely Suppress IL-12/23 and Type I IFN Signaling Pathways” are available in the Resource Library section of Kymera's website. About STAT6 Degrader STAT6 is an essential transcription factor in the IL-4/IL-13 signaling pathways and the central driver of TH2 inflammation in allergic diseases. Multiple gain of function mutations of STAT6 were identified to cause severe allergic diseases in humans. Dupilumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-4/IL-13 signaling, is an approved therapy for multiple allergic diseases. STAT6 targeting is therefore supported by both human genetics and clinical pathway validation. STAT6 functions through protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and it has been challenging to selectively and potently inhibit STAT6 with small molecule inhibitors. However, it is well suited for a targeted protein degradation approach, where a binding event is sufficient to drive degradation. KT-621 is a once daily, oral STAT6 degrader with a potential biologics-like efficacy profile, to address multiple diseases including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, among others. About TYK2 Degrader TYK2 is a member of the JAK family of kinases that binds the IL-12, IL-23 and interferon (IFN) receptors to recruit and phosphorylate STAT transcription factors. A loss of function variant is protective in autoimmune diseases and an allosteric inhibitor of TYK2, as well as biological agents targeting IL-12, IL-23 and Type I IFN, have been approved for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases, making TYK2 a highly validated target. TYK2 has a well-established scaffolding function that plays a key role in cytokine receptor surface expression and activation. By blocking both the catalytic and scaffolding functions, degradation of TYK2 has the potential to recapitulate the human loss-of-function biology of near full pathway inhibition of Type I IFN, IL-12 and IL-23, while also sparing IL-10/IL-22 and the ability to overcome the challenges of small molecule inhibitors, which have limitations due to lack of selectivity, limited target engagement, and/or lack of potent activity against Type I IFN. KT-294 is a once daily, oral TYK2 degrader with a potential biologics-like efficacy profile, to address conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus, among others. 1Gangolli et al., SID 2022 About Kymera TherapeuticsKymera is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the field of targeted protein degradation (TPD) to develop medicines that address critical health problems and have the potential to dramatically improve patients’ lives.

Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 09:05 AM NEW YORK, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (NYSE: SWZ), a non-diversified registered closed-end investment company (the ""Fund""), announced today a quarterly distribution of $0.129 per share of the Fund's common stock pursuant to the Fund's managed distribution plan (the ""Plan""). The distribution is subject to the following record, ex-dividend and payment dates: Record Date: March 19, 2024 Ex-Dividend Date: March 18, 2024 Payment Date: March 28, 2024 Pursuant to the Plan, the Fund's Board of Directors has approved the quarterly distribution of a fixed amount of $0.129 per share of the Fund's common stock. The primary purpose of the Plan is to provide the Fund's stockholders with a more consistent, but not guaranteed, fixed minimum rate of distribution on a regular quarterly basis. The Plan also may have the effect of narrowing the discount to net asset value per share at which the Fund's shares trade. Distributions under the Plan may consist of net investment income, net realized short-term and long-term capital gains, and to the extent necessary, return of capital (or other capital sources). With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the Fund will issue a notice to stockholders and an accompanying press release that will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution, as well as certain other related information. The Fund expects to issue any such notice and press release on or about the distribution payment date. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in each notice will be estimated, are likely to change over time and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for accounting and tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send each stockholder a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will inform stockholders how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes. The current distribution amount of $0.129 per share of the Fund's common stock was determined in December 2023 and equates to an annualized distribution rate of 6.00% based on the Fund's net asset value per share or NAV as of October 31, 2023. The annualized rate is expected to change over time as the Fund's NAV varies. The Board will review at least annually the terms of the Plan to determine whether to adjust the amount or the calculation of the distribution rate, which may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance and other factors. The Board may amend the terms of the Plan or terminate the Plan at any time without prior notice to the Fund's stockholders. The amendment or termination of the Plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's common stock. Unless a stockholder has otherwise elected, distributions declared pursuant to the Plan will be reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund's common stock as provided in the Fund's automatic dividend reinvestment plan.

This move indicates his belief in the business and potential undervaluation. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent purchase of shares by 1847 Holdings LLC's CEO Ellery Roberts is a notable event that warrants a closer examination from a financial perspective. The acquisition of 154,364 shares at $3.30 per share represents a significant investment by Roberts, especially considering the previous purchase at a much lower price point of $1.353 per share. This action suggests a strong belief in the company's intrinsic value and future performance. Such insider buying can often be interpreted as a positive signal to the market, potentially indicating undervalued stock or confidence in the company's strategic direction.Investors typically monitor insider transactions as they can provide insights into the leadership's expectations and sentiment towards the company's prospects. A CEO increasing their stake can be a catalyst for stock price appreciation if the market interprets it as a sign of forthcoming positive developments. However, it is essential to analyze the broader context, such as the company's financial health, market conditions and sector performance, to fully understand the implications of such insider activity. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, 1847 Holdings LLC's focus on acquiring and growing small businesses presents a unique investment thesis. The company's strategy to either spin out or integrate these businesses into its portfolio can create value through diversification and potential synergies. The CEO's recent share purchase could signal that the strategy is bearing fruit and the company may be poised for growth. It is crucial to assess the performance of the small businesses within 1847's portfolio, as their success is directly tied to the holding company's overall performance.Furthermore, the timing of the share purchase, amidst the company enjoying success with its acquisitions, could indicate that the CEO is privy to positive developments that may not yet be fully reflected in the public domain. Analysts and investors should look for upcoming financial reports and strategic announcements that may corroborate the optimism implied by the CEO's increased equity stake. Economist An economist's viewpoint would consider the broader economic implications of the CEO's share purchase. The transaction occurs within a macroeconomic framework that includes interest rates, inflation and economic growth patterns. These factors can influence investor behavior and the performance of companies like 1847 Holdings LLC. A CEO's decision to invest heavily in their own company might also reflect an assessment of the economic climate and its impact on the company's niche market of small businesses.It is pertinent to analyze whether the CEO's move aligns with current economic trends or defies them. For instance, if the economy is trending towards a downturn, the purchase might be seen as a particularly bullish move, suggesting that the CEO expects the company to outperform the market despite broader challenges. Conversely, if the economy is robust, the transaction might align with general market optimism, further reinforcing the positive outlook for the company. 03/08/2024 - 09:30 AM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / In a show of confidence, 1847 Holdings LLC.

SEE Launches Paper-based Food Packaging to Reduce Plastic Usage,2024-03-08T14:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"SEE Introduces CRYOVAC Barrier Formable Paper for Sustainable Packaging, Promising 77% Plastic Reduction","SEE Launches Paper-based Food Packaging to Reduce Plastic Usage Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary SEE Introduces CRYOVAC Barrier Formable Paper for Sustainable Packaging, Promising 77% Plastic Reduction Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Expert The introduction of SEE's new CRYOVAC brand Barrier Formable Paper represents a significant step towards environmental sustainability in the packaging industry. The shift from traditional PET/PE plastic materials to a 90% FSC-certified fiber-based solution addresses growing concerns about plastic waste and its environmental impact. The 77% reduction in plastic usage for bottom web packaging not only aligns with increasing regulatory pressures to minimize plastic waste but also caters to the consumer demand for eco-friendlier packaging.From a sustainability perspective, the move could enhance brand reputation and customer loyalty for both SEE and its clients, as consumers are more inclined to support companies with strong environmental commitments. However, the long-term success of this initiative will depend on the balance between environmental benefits and the economic viability of the paper-based packaging, including factors such as cost, durability and the ability to preserve food quality comparably to plastic alternatives. Packaging Industry Analyst The introduction of the CRYOVAC brand Barrier Formable Paper by SEE may disrupt the traditional packaging market dynamics. The paper-based packaging solution could potentially open new market segments for SEE, as businesses that prioritize sustainability could shift towards such innovative materials. This could lead to increased market share and potentially higher revenues for SEE, assuming the product meets industry performance standards and is competitively priced.However, it's important to consider the operational implications for food processors and retailers. The ease of integration into existing production lines will be a critical factor in the adoption rate of this new material. If the transition requires significant capital investment or if the material does not integrate well with current machinery, it could slow down market penetration. Additionally, the performance of the paper-based packaging in protecting and preserving food products will be closely scrutinized by the industry to assess its practicality as a replacement for conventional plastics. Market Research Analyst Consumer trends show a growing preference for sustainable and eco-friendly products, which is likely to influence purchase decisions in the food industry. SEE's move to introduce a paper-based packaging solution could significantly resonate with this demographic, potentially increasing the consumer base for their clients. Market research would suggest that such innovations can lead to a competitive advantage in the marketplace, provided that consumer education about the benefits of the new packaging is effectively communicated.It's also important to monitor the consumer response to the tactile and visual aspects of the new packaging, as these can be as influential as the environmental benefits in driving product preference. The success of this paper-based packaging could set a precedent for other companies in the industry, potentially leading to a broader shift towards sustainable packaging solutions. 03/08/2024 - 09:30 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / SEE:Originally published in Packaging ScotlandSEE has developed a new paper-based bottom web to support food processors and retailers reduce plastic usage and meet consumer demand for paper packaging.The new CRYOVAC brand Barrier Formable Paper is made from 90% FSC-certified fibres and, according to SEE, can enable 77% plastic reduction in bottom web packaging, when used in replacement of PET/PE webs.A senior marketing manager of Europe at SEE, explained, ""We're seeing a trend of food businesses reviewing packaging materials to improve circularity, reduce plastic usage and to satisfy shopper expectations for using paper-based options.

Toll-free replay number: 1-844-512-2921International replay number: 1-412-317-6671Conference ID: 13744838 About Coda Octopus Group, Inc. The Company, founded in 1994, is an established supplier to the Underwater/Subsea market. It supplies a range of hardware and software solutions to this market which includes key proprietary real time 4D/5D/6D imaging sonars, marketed under the name Echoscope® and Echoscope PIPE® addressing the underwater imaging sensor market along with new generation diving technology, Diver Augmented Vision Display (DAVD) system. The Company’s Echoscope PIPE® sonar generates real-time 3D/4D/5D images of moving objects underwater including in zero visibility water conditions. The Echoscope® technology is used globally for numerous applications in both the commercial offshore market and defense underwater markets. Applications for the Echoscope® technology include complex mapping underwater, subsea intervention, subsea asset placements, salvage and recovery, search and rescue, offshore renewables cable installations and surveys, marine construction, subsea infrastructure installation, mining applications, robotics (3D Perception and Depth), breakwater construction and monitoring, decommissioning, diving applications and port and harbor security. The recently launched new generation of diving technology, DAVD, has the potential to change the way global diving operations are performed (both in the Defense and Commercial space) because it is a fully integrated singular system for topside control and fully connected diver HUD system, allowing both the topside and diver to share a range of critical information and visualize the same underwater scene.

(NASDAQ: EPOW) secures a $14 million USD financing from China Everbright Bank to enhance liquidity, meet client demands, and increase revenue without diluting shareholder equity. The company's impressive client base includes top lithium battery manufacturers like CATL, BYD, and HiTHIUM. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The $14 million financing obtained by Sunrise New Energy Co. from China Everbright Bank represents a strategic move to enhance the company's liquidity without diluting shareholder equity. The low-interest nature of the loan suggests favorable borrowing terms, which is indicative of the company's strong creditworthiness and negotiating position. This infusion of capital is expected to facilitate the company's ability to scale up production in response to rising demand from major clients in the lithium battery sector.For investors, the immediate effect is likely to be positive, as the company can leverage this capital to fulfill orders and potentially increase market share. However, it is essential to monitor the company's ability to manage this new debt efficiently and the impact it may have on its balance sheet. Moreover, the long-term implications will depend on how effectively the capital is utilized to generate a return that exceeds the cost of borrowing. Market Research Analyst Sunrise New Energy's announcement highlights its position in the supply chain of major lithium battery manufacturers, such as CATL and BYD. The company's production capacity and the reported satisfaction of its high-profile clients suggest a robust competitive stance in the renewable energy sector. The ability to secure large orders and maintain high-capacity production lines is a testament to the company's operational efficiency and product quality.The renewable energy market, especially the lithium battery segment, is experiencing rapid growth due to the global push towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage solutions. Sunrise's increased financial leverage and capacity expansion could enable the company to capture a larger market share in this burgeoning industry. Stakeholders should consider the potential upside from the industry's growth trajectory against the inherent risks associated with rapid expansion and increased financial leverage. Economist The decision by Sunrise New Energy to opt for debt financing over equity financing is a reflection of broader economic trends where companies may prefer to avoid shareholder dilution, especially if they can secure low-interest loans. This approach can be more advantageous during periods of low interest rates, as it preserves ownership percentages while still providing necessary capital for growth.From an economic standpoint, the relationship between Sunrise and its high-profile clientele is indicative of a strong upstream demand in the renewable energy supply chain. This demand is likely to have a multiplier effect on the economy, as increased production can lead to job creation and further business opportunities within the sector. However, the company's reliance on debt financing also introduces financial risk, particularly if market conditions change or if interest rates rise, which could affect the cost of servicing the debt. 03/08/2024 - 09:25 AM ZIBO, China, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunrise New Energy Co., Ltd. (“Sunrise”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) (NASDAQ: EPOW), today announced securing a significant financing of $14 million USD from China Everbright Bank.

""Securing this bank loan underscores our Company's sterling reputation. Moreover, without diluting shareholder equity, it provides us with a substantial influx of low-interest capital, significantly boosting our cash flow. This, in turn, enables us to accommodate more orders, thereby generating increased revenue and profits.""

Positive None. Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 09:45 AM Illumina scientists tailor-made research solutions for detecting genes in difficult-to-read regions that cause both common and rare diseasesOriginally published on Illumina News CenterNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / When scientists want to sequence a DNA sample on an Illumina system, they don't try to read all 4 billion base pairs of the genome at once. Instead, they slice the DNA into short fragments of about 500 base pairs that are easier to work with and faster to read.DNA samples, in the form of a small amount of tissue or fluid, usually contain many cells, and thus many copies of the organism's genome-so once the system captures images of the fragments, it reassembles the data for one complete sequence by comparing where the fragments overlap.Think of it like tossing several identical copies of a book into a paper shredder, each one at a random angle. You can't reassemble any individual copy like you would a puzzle, because all the pieces are the same shape. (Especially if you don't have an intact book to reference.) But, since each copy of the book was shredded in different random locations from the others, you can match up fragments from different copies based on where the text overlaps.If the species of interest has never been sequenced before, scientists must rely on these overlaps, known as contiguous regions, or ""contigs,"" to build a reference genome. Fortunately, human reference genomes are available thanks to The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, and the ongoing work of the Genome Reference Consortium. Every individual human shares 99.99% of the same base pairs, so scientists can identify an individual's genetic variants by comparing them to existing references.Unfortunately, in many regions of the human genome, the sequence of base pairs is highly repetitive. Entire genes-many thousands of base pairs long-may be duplicated multiple times, with only a handful of base pair variations to differentiate the copies. Furthermore, the number of duplications of given genes, and the specific differences between the copies, frequently varies from person to person.These regions of ""high homology"" are notoriously difficult to analyze, even with a reference genome available. Fragments from them are likely to ""fit"" in several possible locations, leaving the system with low confidence that it's aligned them correctly.Unfortunately, many genetic diseases result from having an atypical number of copies of specific genes, or a variant in just one gene of a multigene family with many copies-so in order to screen for these diseases, sequencing systems and data analysis pipelines must be sophisticated enough to accurately detect variants even in high-homology regions.One way to tackle this is to perform longer reads. If the fragments are long enough to bridge the homologous region, reads can be mapped unambiguously to different copies of that region in the reference genome. For example, Illumina Complete Long Reads can create reads up to about 10,000 base pairs. But some homologous regions are still longer than that.Luckily, Illumina scientists have developed solutions to this problem even for short reads. Targeted callers are tailor-made to quickly and accurately detect the copy number (and other variants) of genes associated with specific diseases. Read on to learn about three of them-congenital adrenal hyperplasia, alpha thalassemia, and atherosclerosis-and how DRAGEN Secondary Analysis software version 4.2 pierces the fog to locate their genetic origin.CYP21A2 and congenital adrenal hyperplasiaOur adrenal glands, located atop our kidneys, help regulate the levels of sodium and potassium in our blood. They do this by synthesizing the hormones cortisol and aldosterone, with the help of the protein 21-hydroxylase.That protein is coded by the gene CYP21A2, which unfortunately sits in just one of two copies of the highly homologous RCCX region. The other copy of RCCX contains a very similar ""pseudogene,"" CYP21A1P, which has no function. This homology confuses not just gene sequencing, but human reproduction: When parental chromosomes recombine to form their child's DNA, they might mistakenly mix genetic material between the functional CYP21A2 and the nonfunctional CYP21A1P, impairing the resulting gene's ability to code for 21-hydroxylase… or they might delete the gene entirely.As with many inherited diseases, a child usually shows no symptoms as long as they have one functioning copy of CYP21A2-they're only a carrier for the condition. But having two nonfunctional copies leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).CAH caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency occurs about once in 10,000 to 15,000 live births. If a developing fetus's adrenal glands have a decreased level of 21-hydroxylase, they can't synthesize as much cortisol and aldosterone as their body needs. Then, the excess materials they would've used for synthesis accumulate and instead form androgens, or male sex hormones. This is called ""simple virilizing CAH."" Girls with excessive androgens may develop ambiguous genitalia; boys may not show any external signs and require targeted screening to diagnose.Children born without either functional CYP21A2 gene-and thus a complete lack of 21-hydroxylase-can't synthesize cortisol and aldosterone at all, and their kidneys can't retain salt. This severe ""salt-wasting CAH"" causes dehydration, diarrhea, vomiting, and adrenal crisis within days or weeks of birth, and is often fatal.The CYP21A2 targeted caller in DRAGEN 4.2 is a research-use-only tool specially geared to detect a wide range of variation in the gene: It can discern the number of copies of the RCCX region, gene deletions, gene conversions, and 33 different small variants in the gene or the pseudogene. Illumina scientists tested the caller on a large selection of publicly available data from The 1000 Genomes Project, including healthy individuals, CAH carriers, and 16 CAH cases. The caller successfully detected the RCCX copy number, full gene deletions, and small variants in every case.To learn about how the CYP21A2 caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Jonathan Belyeu, Fabian Klötzl, Eric Roller, Emma Newman, Vitor Onuchic, and Mitchell Bekritsky on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub.HBA and alpha thalassemiaBy weight, human red blood cells are composed of about 35% hemoglobin, which is responsible for transporting oxygen. (Most of the rest is water.) There are a few different combinations of hemoglobin proteins, but an essential ingredient of them all is alpha hemoglobin, encoded by the genes HBA1 and HBA2.People typically have four total copies of these genes, two on each copy of chromosome 16. Children who inherit only three copies will be carriers-they still produce enough alpha hemoglobin and don't generally need treatment. But children who inherit two or fewer copies of HBA1 and HBA2 will have some form of alpha thalassemia, an autosomal recessive blood disorder.Insufficient hemoglobin causes anemia, in which red blood cells are undersized or disintegrate entirely-and the number of missing copies of HBA1 and HBA2 directly affects alpha thalassemia's severity. A person with two missing copies has ""alpha thalassemia trait,"" which causes mild anemia. Three missing copies entails ""hemoglobin H disease,"" or HbH, which requires blood transfusion therapy. A person without any copies has ""hemoglobin Bart's hydrops foetalis,"" which is usually fatal.According to the Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, alpha thalassemia ""is probably the most common monogenic disorder in the world and is especially frequent in Mediterranean countries, South-East Asia, Africa, the Middle East and in the Indian subcontinent."" In some regions, more than 30% of the population may be carriers. Some scientists theorize that this prevalence arose because it actually confers an evolutionary advantage in these regions, since carriers are less susceptible to malaria.In all, the CDC estimates that about 5% of the world's population has some variant of alpha thalassemia, and both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend screening for the condition in people who are pregnant or who plan to reproduce.The genomic region containing HBA1 and HBA2 is highly homologous, making copy number detection and accurate read alignment difficult for gene sequencing systems. So Illumina scientists developed the research-use-only HBA targeted caller for DRAGEN 4.2, which estimates HBA copy number genotype based on several nearby regions that are not homologous. They tested the caller on hundreds of samples from The 1000 Genomes Project and found that it accurately detected 14 copy number genotypes-variations based on exactly which region of the HBA genes was deleted.In the article linked below, these scientists report being confident that this research tool will be able to aid large-scale population studies, and in turn ""help guide decisions about how to best deploy carrier and newborn screening tests.""To learn about how the HBA caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Shunhua Han, Vitor Onuchic, Massimiliano Rossi, Eric Roller, and Daniel Cameron on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub.KIV-2 and atherosclerosisWe humans require cholesterol as a vital component of our cell membranes, and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are the main vehicle our bodies use to transport cholesterol-containing fats. However, elevated LDL levels are a major factor in atherosclerosis-a buildup of fats along arterial walls-and subsequently of cardiovascular disease (CVD). According to the World Health Organization, nearly a third of all deaths are due to CVD, 85% of which involve heart attack and stroke.Lipoprotein a (LPA) is one kind of LDL. The concentration of LPA in a person's blood is highly heritable from parent to child and varies widely from one population to the next-for instance, an article in JAMA Cardiology estimates that 20% of individuals of European ancestry have elevated LPA levels. These elevated levels can be traced to a genetic cause: the number of copies of the kringle-IV 2 domain (KIV-2) in the LPA protein.Named after the twisted Danish pastry, kringle domains are sections of a protein that fold together into loops and help it bind to other proteins. KIV-2 has an astounding range of occurrence: human reference genomes usually record fewer than six copies of it in the LPA gene, but some people have 50 copies or more.Why does this region get copied so much? For now, scientists are unsure. The more copies of KIV-2 a person has, the longer their LPA proteins are… but here's the catch: The longer these proteins are, the longer they take to synthesize, so-counterintuitively-a person with more copies of KIV-2 actually has lower levels of LPA in their blood.Regardless, the extremely variable copy number of this region makes it a huge challenge for a gene sequencer to accurately describe and quantify.Working with colleagues at eight universities and laboratories across the United States, Illumina scientists developed a targeted caller that generates a highly accurate copy number measurement for this difficult region. They tested the research-use-only caller on the genomic data of 120 Mendelian trios (a child and both their parents) recorded in The 1000 Genomes Project, and the results correlated extremely closely with those generated by other methods. In the article linked below, the Illumina team presents these results as evidence that the LPA targeted caller in DRAGEN software ""will provide a valuable tool for enhanced LPA and CVD research.""To learn about how the KIV-2 caller works and the methods used to test it in greater detail, read this article by Jonathan Belyeu, Vitor Onuchic, and Mitchell Bekritsky on Illumina's Genomics Research Hub.

Average prices rose by 1.2% year-over-year. Retailers in Arizona, Montana, and Wyoming led in sales growth. The number of items sold and transactions increased compared to the previous year. The data also showed a rise in the dollar-weighted average of prices for top items purchased. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in same-store sales by 3.5% year-over-year and the sequential growth of 7.4% are indicative of a robust consumer spending environment, particularly in the retail sectors that were analyzed. This growth trajectory, especially in the face of inflationary pressures, suggests that consumer confidence remains relatively high, which can have a positive ripple effect throughout the economy. The data presents a nuanced picture, with certain regions and product categories outperforming others, highlighting the importance of geographical and product diversification for retailers.Furthermore, the 1.2% increase in average prices year-over-year, while modest, is a critical factor to consider. This suggests that retailers have been able to pass on at least some of the cost inflation to consumers without significantly dampening demand. However, it's important to note that this increase is still below the peak levels of the previous year, indicating that there may be a ceiling to how much price increase consumers are willing to tolerate.The regional differences in sales growth, particularly in Western states, underscore the impact of external factors such as weather on consumer behavior. Retailers and investors should take note of these trends as they may imply the need for tailored inventory and marketing strategies that can adapt to regional consumer demands and unforeseen events. Economist The data provided by NRSInsights, particularly the outpacing of the US Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade data by an average of 4.3 percentage points, suggests a positive discrepancy that warrants further analysis. This outperformance could be attributed to the unique market segment that NRS serves, which includes independent, small-format, urban retailers. These establishments may be capturing a different consumer segment than the larger retail chains, potentially one that is less sensitive to economic downturns or benefits from urban consumer shopping patterns.However, it is also crucial to consider that the NRSInsights data have not been adjusted for inflation or other factors that might affect comparability. Therefore, while the raw sales figures are promising, the real-term growth might be less pronounced when accounting for inflation. This could affect the long-term sustainability of the observed growth rates and should be a consideration for investors and business strategists in their decision-making processes. Retail Industry Analyst The detailed breakdown of sales performance across various categories, such as the jump in candy sales and the decline in sparkling wine/champagne, provides valuable insights into consumer preferences and spending patterns. These trends can inform inventory management and promotional strategies for retailers. The decline in certain categories like prepared foods and baking staples could indicate shifting consumer priorities or seasonal adjustments in consumption habits.Additionally, the increase in the number of items sold and the average number of transactions per store offers a positive outlook on retail traffic and consumer engagement. Retailers can leverage this data to optimize store layouts, staff scheduling and other operational factors to enhance the shopping experience and maximize sales potential.Given the significant volume of transactions processed through NRS' POS network, these findings can serve as a barometer for the health of the independent retail sector and provide benchmarks for performance comparison. The granularity of the data, covering item-level prices and transactions, offers a level of detail that can be instrumental for operational and strategic planning within the retail industry. 03/08/2024 - 09:20 AM February same-store sales per calendar day increased 3.5% year-over-year and 7.4% sequentially Retailers in certain Western states recorded the largest year-over-year gains as winter storms triggered stockpiling Average prices increased 1.2% year-over-year NEWARK, N.J., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NRSInsights, a provider of sales data and analytics drawn from retail transactions processed through the National Retail Solutions (NRS) point-of-sale (POS) platform, today announced comparative same-store sales results for February 2024. As of February 29, 2024, the NRS retail network comprised approximately 29,100 active terminals scanning purchases at independent retailers including bodegas, convenience stores, liquor stores, grocers, tobacco, and sundries sellers nationwide, predominantly serving urban consumers. February Retail Same-Store Sales Highlights (Same-store sales, unit sales, transactions, and average price data refer to February 2024 unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are provided on a “per calendar day” basis to remove from consideration variability in the number of days per month including the additional day for leap year in February 2024 compared to February 2023.) Same-store sales increased 3.5% from a year earlier (February 2023). In January 2024, average sales had increased 1.4% compared to January 2023.NRS retail stores in Arizona, Montana and Wyoming generated the highest rates of year-over-year increases.Same-store sales increased 7.4% compared to January 2024, consistent with the expected seasonal rebound from the post-holiday dip in January. Same-store sales in January 2024 had decreased 10.0% compared to December 2023.For the three months ended February 29, 2024, same-store sales increased 2.8% compared to the three months ended February 28, 2023.The number of items sold increased 4.4% compared to February 2023, the same rate of increase as for January 2024 compared to January 2023.The average number of transactions per store increased 2.0% compared to February 2023. For January 2024, the average number of transactions had decreased 0.6% compared to January 2023.A dollar-weighted average of prices for the top 500 items purchased increased 1.2% year-over-year, an increase from the 0.3% year-over-year increase recorded in January 2024, but still well below the 2023 peak level of 5.3% in September. Commentary from Suzy Silliman (SVP, Data Strategy and Sales at NRS) “Same-store sales in February – adjusting for the leap year – rebounded from the annual post-holiday retrenchment in January, to increase 7.4% sequentially and 3.5% compared to February 2023. Nearly all categories experienced sequential growth with the notable exceptions of prepared foods and baking staples which declined from January sales levels. “February’s sales are always interesting because of consumer spending patterns leading up to Valentine's Day. This February, Candy sales jumped in February after several months of sequential decreases – which was no surprise - but also increased strongly versus February a year ago. On the other hand, sales in the Sparkling Wine/Champagne category, which traditionally spike during this holiday, suffered a decrease of ~7% compared to February 2023. “Regionally, our retailers in Arizona, Montana and Wyoming saw the most significant year-over-year same-store sales growth. Looking at the data, it is likely that winter weather events in each state drove pre-storm stockpiling.” Retail Trade Comparative Data The table below provides historical comparative data with the U.S. Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade same-store sales data excluding food service: Over the past twelve months, the NRS network’s three-month moving average same-store sales have outpaced the US Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade data excluding food services by 4.3% percentage points, on average. The NRSInsights data have not been adjusted to reflect inflation, demographic distributions, seasonal buying patterns, item substitution, or other factors that may facilitate comparisons to other periods, to other same-store retail sales data, or to the U.S. Commerce Department’s retail data.

The company's KWESST Lightning™ software aims to revolutionize public safety by offering cloud-based TAK-enabled solutions for first responders and law enforcement agencies. Positive KWESST secures a contract with the Ontario Provincial Police to provide training and certification for TAK users. The contract aims to enhance real-time communications and situational awareness for frontline officers and response teams. KWESST Lightning™ software leverages military digitization capabilities to offer scalable cloud-based TAK-enabled solutions for the public safety market. The company is developing user-defined mission modules, starting with Ground Search and Rescue operations. KWESST's SaaS business model for KWESST Lightning™ offers organizations easy access to critical capabilities without capital investment or maintenance costs. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by KWESST Micro Systems Inc. about being awarded a contract to provide training and certification to the Ontario Provincial Police represents a strategic business development for the company. The contract, while modest in value, signifies the company's entry into law enforcement training, particularly in the tactical communications and situational awareness segment. This could potentially open doors for future contracts and expansions, especially considering the OPP's status as one of Canada's largest police forces.From a market perspective, the contract may signal to investors that KWESST is diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its position in the public safety market. The focus on software as a service (SaaS) for their KWESST Lightning™ platform suggests a recurring revenue model, which is generally favored by the market for its predictability and potential for scalability. The move towards cloud-based solutions also aligns with broader industry trends towards digital transformation and increased emphasis on data sharing and real-time communication in critical situations. Financial Analyst While the financial details of the contract with the Ontario Provincial Police have not been disclosed, the long-term financial implications for KWESST could be significant. Training and certification programs can serve as a customer acquisition channel for the company's SaaS offerings, potentially leading to a steady inflow of subscription revenue. The mention of a 'modest' contract value suggests that the immediate financial impact may not be substantial enough to warrant a revision of the company's financial forecasts. However, investors should consider the strategic nature of the partnership and the potential for upselling and cross-selling opportunities within the law enforcement sector.Additionally, KWESST's focus on developing mission modules for Ground Search and Rescue operations and other user-defined needs indicates a commitment to continuous product development. This approach can help maintain the company's competitive edge and enhance its marketability to other agencies, both of which are positive indicators for sustained growth and profitability. Technology Analyst The Team Awareness Kit (TAK) is a technology that provides real-time communications and situational awareness, which is crucial for tactical operations and emergency responses. KWESST's training and certification initiative with the OPP not only showcases their expertise in military digitization but also their ability to adapt these capabilities for public safety applications. The development of a scalable cloud-based TAK-enabled situational awareness app indicates a forward-thinking approach that leverages current technological trends such as cloud computing, real-time data sharing and modular software design.Investors should note the potential for KWESST's technology to become a standard within the public safety sector, given the emphasis on interoperability and ease of deployment. The adoption of SaaS models in critical operations like GSAR can improve response times and resource management, which are key value propositions for agencies looking to enhance their operational capabilities. The company's strategy to gather user feedback and refine its offerings could lead to a product that is well-tailored to the needs of the market, further solidifying its market position. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM KWESST to provide TAK based training and certification to key usersOttawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - March 8, 2024) - KWESST Micro Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: KWE) (TSXV: KWE) (TSXV: KWE.WT.U) (""KWESST"" or the ""Company"") today announced that it has been awarded a contract by the Ontario Provincial Police (""OPP"") to deliver training and certification to the force's lead Team Awareness Kit (TAK) users and trainers. The OPP is Canada's largest police force next to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and has a force of 5,800 uniformed officers.""Though the value of this contract is modest, it is a key first step in enabling the OPP to unlock real-time TAK-enabled communications and situational awareness for all response teams and frontline officers,"" said Sean Homuth, KWESST President and CEO. Under the contract, KWESST will train and certify instructors from the OPP's Field Support Bureau including representation from the Tactics and Rescue Unit, Aviation Services, K9-unit, and Emergency Response Team, teaching users across the force how to operate TAK in frontline operations.Homuth added, ""The opportunity to work closely with the OPP's premier users of TAK reaffirms KWESST's leadership in delivering TAK-enablement where it can make the biggest difference - in the hands of tactical operators and first responders to reduce response time and ultimately save lives. It's through close engagements with lead users like the OPP and other agencies that KWESST has uniquely positioned itself to deliver TAK enablement to law enforcement and first responders through its KWESST Lightning™ Software as a Service (""SaaS"") offering.""KWESST Lightning™ leverages the Company's military digitization capabilities to provide a scalable cloud-based TAK-enabled situational awareness app for the public safety market for real-time shared information among front-line responders and commanders during critical, dynamic incidents. The system will allow users to build and select from a menu of different ""mission"" modules appropriate to the incident. KWESST is already under subcontract with a national public safety agency to develop one such ""mission"" module for Ground Search and Rescue (""GSAR"") operations for the community of law enforcement and volunteer organizations who conduct searches for thousands of lost people each year. The benefit to users will be lightning-fast time to engagement, seamless interoperability with cooperating agencies, and limitless scalability in the cloud. ""Our SaaS business model around KWESST Lightning™ will make it very easy for organizations to have this capability without capital investment or maintenance costs, while achieving faster coordinated response to incidents that are often a matter of life and death,"" concluded Homuth.In October 18, 2023, the Company announced that it expected to launch the first commercially available version for GSAR by mid-2024, and will continue to develop additional user-defined mission modules. As we continue to gather valuable user feedback and also seek pilot user opportunities, the Company expects to revise its timeline for full commercial availability to late calendar Q3 2024.

Financial Analyst The commencement of INNOVATE Corp's $19.0 million rights offering represents a strategic move to raise capital and potentially dilute existing shares. This offering allows current stockholders to maintain their proportionate ownership in the company by purchasing additional shares at a discounted price. The involvement of Lancer Capital, led by the company's Chairman and largest stockholder, Avram A. Glazer, adds a layer of confidence for other investors, as it signals strong insider support and a commitment to the company's future.However, the issuance of Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock to Lancer Capital, due to limitations on common stock acquisition, introduces a complexity in the company's capital structure. This could impact the voting power of existing shareholders and the future conversion of these preferred shares could lead to further dilution. The terms of the Preferred Stock, including the liquidation preference and mandatory redemption features, are critical for investors to understand as they can affect the risk profile of the investment.Investors should also consider the 8% interest rate on the Preferred Stock, which is a significant cost of capital for INNOVATE Corp. This rate is above typical corporate bond yields, reflecting the higher risk associated with the company. The standstill agreement with Lancer Capital may also limit potential strategic actions by the company, which could affect its growth trajectory and stock price performance. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the rights offering and concurrent private placement with Lancer Capital are governed by an investment agreement, the details of which have been filed with the SEC. This document is crucial for investors to review as it includes terms, conditions and restrictions that could influence the company's operational flexibility. The standstill provisions, for example, prevent Lancer Capital from acquiring additional equity or debt securities beyond a certain threshold, which could impact the company's governance and future financing options.The transaction's adherence to the rules of the NYSE and compliance with the SEC's regulations on rights offerings and private placements is also significant. Any deviations or amendments to the offering could lead to regulatory scrutiny and potential investor litigation, which are risk factors that must be considered. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications of INNOVATE Corp's rights offering, it is essential to understand the investor sentiment towards such capital raising activities. Rights offerings are often viewed as a way for companies to raise capital without incurring significant debt, but they can also signal to the market that the company might be in need of immediate capital, which could be interpreted negatively.The backstop provided by Lancer Capital not only ensures the success of the offering but also could indicate a bullish outlook from the company's largest shareholder. However, the market will also assess the potential dilutive impact on earnings per share (EPS) and how the additional capital will be used to drive future growth. The company's stock price reaction to the news will reflect the collective market view on these factors.Furthermore, the offering's timing, set to expire on March 25, 2024 and the subsequent trading cessation of the rights on March 20, 2024, will likely lead to increased volatility in the stock's trading patterns. Market participants will closely monitor the uptake of the rights offering and any subsequent announcements regarding the use of proceeds. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM NEW YORK, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- INNOVATE Corp. (“INNOVATE” or the “Company”) (NYSE: VATE), a diversified holding company, announced today that it has commenced its previously announced $19.0 million rights offering for its common stock. All INNOVATE stockholders will have the opportunity to participate in the offering and subscribe for their basic subscription amount of newly issued shares of common stock in proportion to their respective existing ownership amounts. INNOVATE stockholders who exercise their respective full basic subscription rights will have over-subscription privileges giving such INNOVATE stockholders the option to subscribe for any shares of common stock that remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the rights offering. If the aggregate subscriptions (basic subscriptions plus over-subscriptions) exceed the amount offered in the rights offering, then the aggregate over-subscription amount will be pro-rated among the stockholders exercising their respective over-subscription privileges based on the basic subscription amounts of such stockholders. The Company is distributing to each holder of the Company’s common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York time, March 6, 2024 (the “rights offering record date”), one transferable subscription right to purchase 0.2858 shares of the Company’s common stock at a price of $0.70 per whole share for each share of the Company’s common stock held as of the rights offering record date. Holders of the Company’s existing preferred stock and convertible notes that are entitled to participate in dividend distributions to holders of the Company’s common stock are also entitled to participate in the rights offering. The rights offering is being backstopped by Lancer Capital LLC (“Lancer Capital”), an investment fund led by Avram A. Glazer, the Chairman of the Board and the Company’s largest stockholder. Lancer Capital will not be permitted to exercise or transfer any subscription rights received by it, or to acquire other rights, in the rights offering, which rights are required to be held by Lancer Capital until the expiration thereof. Due to limitations of common stock that can be acquired by Lancer Capital, in lieu of exercising its subscription rights, Lancer Capital will purchase up to $19.0 million of the Company’s newly issued Series C Non-Voting Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”), for an issue price of $1,000 per share. In connection with the backstop commitment, and as a result of limitations in the amount of common equity that can be raised under the Company’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, Lancer Capital has agreed to purchase an additional $16.0 million of Preferred Stock in a private placement transaction to close concurrently with the settlement of the rights offering. The Preferred Stock terms will include a liquidation preference junior to the Company’s existing preferred stock and equal to the Company’s common stock (other than a preference of $0.001 per share of Preferred Stock that will be paid to the holders of the Preferred Stock before any payment or distribution is made to the holders of the common stock). If for any reason the settlement of the rights offering does not occur by March 28, 2024, then on that date Lancer Capital will purchase $25.0 million of Preferred Stock. Upon the settlement of the rights offering, to the extent that Lancer Capital would have, based on the number of shares of common stock actually sold upon exercise of the rights, purchased less than $25.0 million of Convertible Preferred Stock under the backstop commitment and the concurrent private placement, the Company will redeem such excess Preferred Stock from Lancer Capital at the redemption price of $1,000 per share. The Preferred Stock can be convertible into common stock at the price equivalent to the subscription price under the rights offering contingent on shareholder approval, which will be voted on at the next annual meeting. If the Preferred Stock is not converted to common stock, it may be redeemed at the Company’s option and must be mandatorily redeemed on the sixth anniversary of issuance, in each case at a cash redemption price per share of $1,000 plus accrued, uncompounded interest of 8% per annum, which is due only upon redemption and not on conversion. The investment agreement includes customary standstill provisions that restrict the ability of Lancer Capital and its affiliates from, among other things, acquiring (i) our equity securities that would result in having beneficial ownership of more than that percentage of the then-outstanding common stock beneficially owned immediately following the closing of the rights offering, (ii) equity securities of our subsidiaries or (iii) any debt securities or indebtedness of us or our subsidiaries until 90 days after the closing of the rights offering. Lancer Capital’s backstop commitment and the concurrent private placement will be effected in the manner set forth in the investment agreement entered into with the Company in connection with the commencement of the rights offering, a copy of which has been filed by the Company with the SEC. The offering will expire at 5:00 PM Eastern Time on March 25, 2024, unless extended by the Company. Trading in the rights will cease at 5:00 PM Eastern Time on March 20, 2024. The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the rights offering at any time prior to its expiration date. The shares of common stock to be issued upon exercise of the rights, like the Company's existing shares of common stock, will be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “VATE.” The Company expects that the information agent for the rights offering will mail rights certificates and a copy of the prospectus and prospectus supplement for the rights offering to stockholders as of the rights offering record date beginning on or about March 8, 2024. Holders of shares of common stock in “street name” through a brokerage account, bank or other nominee will not receive physical rights certificates and must instruct their broker, bank or nominee whether to exercise subscription rights on their behalf. For any questions or further information about the rights offering, please call Okapi Partners LLC, the information agent for the rights offering, at (855) 208-8902 (toll-free). Neither the Company nor its Board of Directors has, or will, make any recommendation to stockholders regarding the exercise or sale of rights in the rights offering. Stockholders should make an independent investment decision about whether or not to exercise or sell their rights based on their own assessment of the Company’s business and the rights offering. INNOVATE expects to use the proceeds from the rights offering for general corporate purposes. The rights offering will be made pursuant to INNOVATE’s effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on September 29, 2023 and declared effective on October 6, 2023, and a prospectus supplement containing the detailed terms of the rights offering to be filed with the SEC.

The rights offering will be made only by means of a prospectus and a related prospectus supplement. Copies of the prospectus and related prospectus supplement, when they become available, will be distributed to all eligible stockholders as of the rights offering record date and may also be obtained free of charge at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by contacting the information agent for the rights offering. The preferred stock to be issued to Lancer Capital pursuant to the backstop commitment and the concurrent private placement will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

About Delcath Systems, Inc., CHEMOSAT and HEPZATO KIT Delcath Systems, Inc. is an interventional oncology company focused on the treatment of primary and metastatic liver cancers. The company's proprietary products, HEPZATO KIT (Hepzato (melphalan) for Injection/Hepatic Delivery System) and CHEMOSAT® Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan percutaneous hepatic perfusion (PHP) are designed to administer high-dose chemotherapy to the liver while controlling systemic exposure and associated side effects during a PHP procedure. In the United States, HEPZATO KIT is considered a combination drug and device product and is regulated and approved for sale as a drug by the FDA. HEPZATO KIT is comprised of the chemotherapeutic drug melphalan and Delcath's proprietary Hepatic Delivery System (HDS). The HDS is used to surgically isolate the liver while simultaneously filtrating hepatic venous blood during melphalan infusion and washout. The use of the HDS results in loco-regional delivery of a relatively high melphalan dose, which can potentially induce a clinically meaningful tumor response with minimal hepatotoxicity and reduce systemic exposure. HEPZATO KIT is approved in the United States as a liver-directed treatment for adult patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (mUM) with unresectable hepatic metastases affecting less than 50% of the liver and no extrahepatic disease, or extrahepatic disease limited to the bone, lymph nodes, subcutaneous tissues, or lung that is amenable to resection or radiation. Please see the full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING for the HEPZATO KIT. In Europe, the device-only configuration of the HDS is regulated as a Class III medical device and is approved for sale under the trade name CHEMOSAT Hepatic Delivery System for Melphalan, or CHEMOSAT, where it has been used in the conduct of percutaneous hepatic perfusion procedures at major medical centers to treat a wide range of cancers of the liver.

Two samples yielded 1,225 g/t Ag with 3.2 g/t Au (slag sample 334067, 4.49 kg) and 744 g/t Ag with 0.2 g/t Au (sample 334066, 3.65 kg) from sample material next to the workings. The host rocks are intensely argillized and silicified volcanics showing an association with a larger hydrothermal system that trends within the newly acquired Pilar expansion area. The samples also show higher polymetallic association with sample 334067 returning 0.42% Cu, 3.4% Zn, and over 20% Pb (assay over limit was reached, additional analysis is required to determine total Pb content). A broader alteration zone that extends 3.3 kilometers by 1.5 kilometers has seen very limited work to date however early results indicate significant mineralization in several locations including 2m at 5.6 g/t Au and 106 g/t Ag, 0.3 g/t Au and 55 g/t Ag, and 0.1 g/t Au and 63 g/t Ag. The massive target area will continue to see first pass evaluation to advance towards drill targeting.""The results today further showcase the potential for significant mineralization beyond Pilar's Main Zone."" commented Brodie Sutherland, CEO. ""The North Alteration Zone is providing more evidence of a broad target area. The high silver values along with other pathfinder elements are indicating significant potential for targets at depth. Much of the area remains unexplored to date, however each time we evaluate more, we are returning with significant findings. Further to the south where placer mining remains active, there is clear evidence for new trends parallel Pilar's Main Zone. These trends are beginning to be evaluated and early mapping and assessment are uncovering more of the potential. We are excited about the potential to generate multiple quality targets for future drill testing, driving new discoveries."" Figure 1. Pilar Project Planview map showing the southern block made up of the Pilar Main Zone and several parallel trends untested with coinciding active placer mining developments. The largest placer mining development is 2km to the northeast of Pilar and has seen no systematic modern exploration. To the north, a large alteration zone that spans 3.3 km by 1.5 km (North Alteration Zone) has returned high-grade gold and silver values in the first few sampling programs across the newly acquired area.Summary of New Surface Discoveries:Pilar Extension North and Northeast:Surface sampling returned 3.5 g/t Au and 645 g/t AgPlacer Mining CorridorsNew 3-kilometer corridor with multiple target zonesNew Surface Discovery in 3-kilometer long alteration zone returned:2-meters of 5.6 g/t Au and 106 g/t Ag0.2 g/t Au and 744 g/t Ag3.2 g/t Au and 1,225 g/t Ag0.3 g/t Au and 55 g/t Ag0.1 g/t Au and 63 g/t Ag Photos 1 & 2.

Coupled with encouraging gold and silver recovery results from metallurgical test work, Pilar is primed to be a potential near-term producer. Pilar is interpreted as a structurally controlled low-sulphidation epithermal system hosted in andesite rocks. Three primary zones of mineralization have been identified in the north-west part of the property from historic surface work and drilling and are referred to as the Main Zone, North Hill and 4-T. The Main Zone and 4-T trends are open to the southeast and new parallel zones have been recently discovered. Structural features and zones of mineralization within the structures follow an overall NW-SE trend of mineralization. Mineralization extends along a 1.2-km trend, only half of that trend has been drill tested so far. To date, over 23,000 m of drilling has been completed.Pilar Drill Highlights:2022 Phase III Diamond Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):116.9m @ 1.2 g/t Au, including 10.2m @ 12 g/t Au and 23 g/t Ag108.9m @ 0.8 g/t Au, including 9.4m @ 7.6 g/t Au and 5 g/t Ag63.4m @ 0.6 g/t Au and 11 g/t Ag, including 29.9m @ 0.9 g/t Au and 18 g/t Ag2021 Phase II RC Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):39.7m @ 1.0 g/t Au, including 1.5m @ 14.6 g/t Au47.7m @ 0.7 g/t Au including 3m @ 5.6 g/t Au and 22 g/t Ag29m @ 0.7 g/t Au35.1m @ 0.7 g/t Au2020 Phase I RC Drilling Highlights include (all lengths are drilled thicknesses):94.6m @ 1.6 g/t Au, including 9.2m @ 10.8 g/t Au and 38 g/t Ag;41.2m @ 1.1 g/t Au, including 3.1m @ 6.0 g/t Au and 12 g/t Ag ;24.4m @ 2.5 g/t Au and 73 g/t Ag, including 1.5m @ 33.4 g/t Au and 1,090 g/t Ag15,000m of Historic Core & RC drilling.

The mural, which spans more than 1,500 feet on the surface of the sound barrier outside Stellantis' Detroit Assembly Complex - Mack plant along Beniteau Street, features stunning imagery of iconic local landmarks and the people who shaped the community. ""This is an amazing opportunity to celebrate this great community on the east side,"" said Dr. Massey, a Detroit resident. The mural project is part of the Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) reached between Stellantis, the city of Detroit and the Neighborhood Advisory Committee in 2019 when the company committed to building the first new assembly plant in the city in more than 30 years. Commercial Contracting Corporation (CCC) and PPG partnered with Stellantis and Dr. Massey on the project, providing equipment and supplies. ""The mural is really spectacular and we're grateful to Dr. Massey for capturing this community's culture and history, resulting in some truly stunning artwork,"" said Ron Stallworth, public affairs lead for Wayne County, Stellantis North America. ""And we're grateful to our neighbors in the community for sharing their stories with us and allowing us to bring this amazing project to fruition."" One section of the mural pays tribute to local civil rights pioneer Sarah Elizabeth Ray, a Black woman who was denied a seat on one of the Boblo ferries and subsequently won her fight for integration before the U.S. Supreme Court. In another piece, the faces of several men are featured, representing another historic neighborhood mural ""The Wall of Dignity."" ""It was so important to have those in the mural; they're part of the narrative and the history of the community,"" Dr. Massey said. Another section displays a man standing alongside a classic Dodge truck. The man and truck image represents an ""everyman,"" but honors a former resident of the area. His son watched the creation of the first mural and provided Dr. Massey with a photo of his late father Henry Williams, an employee at the former Chrysler plant. The son, Francisco Williams, was moved upon seeing his family and neighborhood history captured so beautifully in the mural. ""Every time I look at this, it makes me want to cry,"" Williams said, noting that the house pictured in the background of the scene on the mural is his eastside childhood home where he was born and raised. According to Dr. Massey, he had many, similar positive interactions with community members throughout the creative process and painting the mural. ""It's those types of stories and those types of things that really resonate in the community, in how this community really embraced the mural,"" Dr. Massey said. ""They were truly excited about it because it tells their story and celebrates this community to the highest level."" The northern section of the mural runs adjacent to Southeastern High School, so it's no surprise that the educational landmark is well represented in the artwork. While working on the project, Dr. Massey sat down with Southeastern art students to get some inspiration for what they thought best represented their school and community. The result is a majestic display of the school's mascot, the Jungaleers, proudly represented through a trio of ferocious roaring, purple-maned lions. An image of the historic school building and its 3030 address on Fairview Street is also displayed. ""The students were very enthusiastic about some of the things that they wanted to see,"" Dr. Massey said. ""They took a lot of pride in it, because that's their school."" Other featured images include the carousel on the Detroit Riverwalk and the city's 313 area code.

DECLARES DISTRIBUTION Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The Mexico Fund, Inc. (MXF) declares a distribution of $0.22 per share, continuing its Managed Distribution Plan (MDP) in 2024. Since 2008, it has paid $26.38 per share in cash distributions. The distribution breakdown includes net investment income, capital gains, and return of capital.

The current fiscal year cumulative total return is 18.04%, and the cumulative distribution rate is 0.99%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by The Mexico Fund, Inc. regarding its distribution of $0.22 per share is a significant event for shareholders. This distribution reflects a portion of the Fund's earnings allocated to be returned to investors. The continuation of the Fund's Managed Distribution Plan (MDP) suggests a stable or growing income stream, which can be an indicator of the Fund's operational success. The critical factor here is the composition of the distribution, which includes net investment income, capital gains and a return of capital. The return of capital component, although small, can sometimes imply that not all the distribution is sourced from earnings, which could be a concern if it were a larger percentage.When analyzing the distribution breakdown, the majority comes from net investment income and realized capital gains, which is generally seen as a positive sign of the Fund's investment performance. The Fund's Average Annual Total Return over the past five years and the Current Annualized Distribution Rate provide investors with a measure of the Fund's historical performance and the yield on their investment, respectively. The Current Fiscal Year Cumulative Total Return offers a glimpse into the Fund's short-term performance, which appears robust.It's essential to note that distributions are not guaranteed and may be modified based on the Fund's earnings. Investors typically view consistent and predictable distributions favorably, as they provide a regular income stream. However, the Board's discretion to amend or terminate the MDP without prior notice introduces an element of uncertainty. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the nature of the distributions is a critical element for shareholders. The Fund's requirement to indicate the source of each distribution is in compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. Investors must understand the tax implications of each component of the distribution. For example, net investment income is typically taxed at ordinary income rates, while capital gains may be subject to lower tax rates if held for more than a year. The return of capital is not taxed immediately but reduces the shareholder's cost basis, which could affect capital gains taxes when the shares are sold.Investors should be aware that the Fund's estimate of the source of distributions is subject to change and the actual amounts could differ once the fiscal year concludes. Accurate tax planning requires understanding these estimates and preparing for potential adjustments. Market Research Analyst The Fund's distribution announcement can impact investor sentiment and market behavior. The distribution yield, compared to the industry benchmarks, can influence the attractiveness of the Fund to income-focused investors. The Fund's performance metrics, such as the Average Annual Total Return and the Current Fiscal Year Cumulative Total Return, are essential indicators of the Fund's competitiveness in the market.Investors often compare these returns against peer funds and broader market indices to gauge performance. A higher-than-average return can attract new investors, while a lower return might raise concerns about the Fund's investment strategy and asset management. Furthermore, the market will likely monitor the Fund's ability to maintain its distribution levels, as any changes could signal shifts in the Fund's operational efficiency or financial stability. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM COLUMBIA, Md., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Mexico Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MXF), announced that the Board of Directors (Board) declared a distribution of $0.22 per share to stockholders of record on April 17, 2024, which is payable in cash on April 25, 2024.

Since the implementation of the MDP in September 2008, the Fund has paid a total of $26.38 per share in cash distributions to stockholders. The amount of distributable income for each fiscal period depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Fund during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Fund is required to indicate the source of each distribution to stockholders.

The Phase 1 trial results demonstrate sabirnetug's proof-of-mechanism and potential as a next-generation treatment for AD. Positive Positive CSF biomarker results validate sabirnetug's proposed mechanism of action Sabirnetug demonstrates selective target engagement of AβOs in early AD Significantly lowered CSF levels of neurogranin and pTau181 observed with sabirnetug treatment Correlation between AβO target engagement and biomarker changes supports drug effect Development of a novel assay to measure sabirnetug-AβO complex in CSF shows dose-related increases in target engagement Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The positive findings from the Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD trial for Acumen's sabirnetug, indicated by lowered CSF levels of neurogranin and pTau181, suggest a promising therapeutic potential for early Alzheimer's disease treatment. These biomarkers are critical indicators of synaptic and neuronal integrity, with neurogranin reflecting synaptic damage and pTau181 being a hallmark of tau pathology. The reported dose-dependent trend reinforces the pharmacological impact of sabirnetug, which, if consistent in larger trials, could signify a breakthrough in AD treatment.Furthermore, the development of a novel assay for measuring direct target engagement of amyloid beta oligomers by sabirnetug is a significant advancement in AD research. This assay could serve as a model for future studies, offering a more precise measure of drug efficacy. It is crucial to monitor the progression of the upcoming Phase 2 trial, as these early-stage results need to be validated in a larger cohort to confirm the drug's effectiveness and safety profile. Biotech Financial Analyst Acumen Pharmaceuticals' progress in the development of sabirnetug is likely to be closely monitored by investors, given the high unmet medical need and the significant market potential for Alzheimer's treatments. The positive biomarker data from the Phase 1 trial could act as a value inflection point for Acumen's stock, particularly if the results translate into clinical benefits in the Phase 2 trial.It is essential to consider the competitive landscape of Alzheimer's treatments, where previous drugs have had mixed success, impacting investor sentiment. The industry has faced challenges with translating promising early-stage results into successful Phase 3 outcomes, which is a critical consideration for risk assessment. Acumen's clear milestones for initiating further trials in 2024 provide a timeline for potential investors to watch for continued development and investment opportunities. Neurologist The clinical relevance of sabirnetug's impact on CSF biomarkers cannot be overstated. The ability to lower neurogranin and pTau181 levels could indicate a deceleration of synaptic dysfunction and tau pathology, respectively, which are central to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. The reported correlation between target engagement and biomarker changes is encouraging, as it suggests a direct therapeutic effect rather than an epiphenomenon.It is important to remain cautious, as the translation of biomarker improvements to clinical outcomes, such as cognitive function, has historically been challenging in AD research. The planned Phase 2 trial will be pivotal in determining whether these biomarker changes can indeed predict a tangible clinical benefit for patients with early AD, which would be a significant step forward in the field. 03/08/2024 - 08:50 AM - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker results are highly supportive of sabirnetug’s downstream pharmacological effects in the brain in early AD - Poster presentation showcases method used to develop a first-of-its-kind assay to assess sabirnetug’s binding to amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) in Alzheimer’s disease - Company on track to initiate Phase 2 trial evaluating sabirnetug in the first half of 2024 and Phase 1 subcutaneous study in mid-2024 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABOS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic that targets soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), today presented cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data from the sabirnetug (ACU193) Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD trial in an oral presentation at the International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and related neurological disorders (AD/PD) in Lisbon, Portugal, and online. Acumen also presented a poster showcasing the method used to develop a first-of-its-kind assay to measure target engagement of an AβO-selective antibody. Acumen’s sabirnetug is the first humanized monoclonal antibody to clinically demonstrate selective target engagement of AβOs, a soluble and highly toxic form of Aβ that accumulates early in AD and triggers synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Positive topline results from 62 participants dosed in the Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD trial (NCT04931459) were reported in July 2023, and additional insights from exploratory analyses have further confirmed sabirnetug’s proof-of-mechanism and broad therapeutic potential as a next-generation treatment for early AD. Sabirnetug (ACU193) Lowers CSF Neurogranin & pTau181 Levels in INTERCEPT-AD Study in Early AD Several key CSF biomarkers are associated with the pathological changes that occur in AD, and evidence suggests these biomarkers may better reflect the underlying pathology of AD than imaging alone.i,ii Results from CSF samples collected before and after drug exposure in the INTERCEPT-AD study were presented and assessed for biomarkers indicative of amyloid pathology (Aβ42/40 ratio), tau pathology (pTau181, pTau217), neuronal injury (total tau) and synaptic injury (neurogranin). Sabirnetug had an observed dose-dependent trend in the multiple ascending dose cohorts on CSF levels of pTau181, pTau217 total tau, neurogranin and the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, consistent with the downstream pharmacologic effects after just three administrations of the drug. Key findings include: Improvements in biomarkers associated with AD pathology, including significantly lowered CSF levels of neurogranin (-13.9%) and pTau181 (-13.0%) and trending toward an increasing Aβ42/40 ratio using 60 mg/kg Q4W as compared to the placebo group;A nominally significant correlation between target engagement of AβOs and change in neurogranin across all doses, supportive of drug effect; andA trend in correlation between target engagement of AβOs and change in p-tau181 across all doses, also supportive of drug effect. These findings support a biological link between sabirnetug and neurogranin and pTau181 and are consistent with sabirnetug’s proposed mechanism of action and intended target engagement of AβOs, as sabirnetug’s effects on these two biomarkers are more closely related to binding of AβOs than plaque reduction. “We’re thrilled to return to AD/PD this year since completing the Phase 1 INTERCEPT-AD trial with results from our biomarker assessment, which further validate our confidence in sabirnetug’s proposed mechanism of action,” said Daniel O’Connell, Chief Executive Officer of Acumen. “As the Alzheimer’s treatment landscape continues to evolve, we’re seeing just how important biomarkers are to better characterize and understand the underlying pathology of disease, and we look forward to exploring the relationship between these biomarkers and clinical outcomes in a longer-term Phase 2 study.” Target Engagement in INTERCEPT-AD: Development of a Novel Assay Measuring Sabirnetug (ACU193)-Amyloid Beta Oligomer Complexes in Human CSF Additionally, Acumen presented a poster detailing its method to develop the first assay to directly measure target engagement of AβOs by an immunotherapy (as measured by sabirnetug-AβO complex in CSF) in the INTERCEPT-AD trial. The novel assay configuration was tailored to selectively detect sabirnetug-AβO complex in CSF as a direct measure of target engagement, showing clear dose-related increases in target engagement across all cohorts. This data also informed development of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model, which ultimately demonstrated that the highest doses used in INTERCEPT-AD (60 mg/kg Q4W and 25mg/kg Q2W) approached maximal target engagement, as was presented in October 2023. “Despite longstanding evidence implicating soluble AβOs as a significant driver of AD pathology, historically it’s been difficult to measure and characterize this form of Aβ,” said Erika Cline, Ph.D., lead author and Manager of Bioanalytical Methods at Acumen Pharmaceuticals. “As Acumen progresses the clinical study of the first-in-clinic antibody with high selectivity for AβOs, the development of the first assay to detect direct target engagement of AβOs is crucial to deepen our understanding of how sabirnetug acts in vivo.” Acumen is on track to initiate a Phase 2 trial evaluating sabirnetug in the first half of 2024 and a Phase 1 subcutaneous study in mid-2024. About Sabirnetug (ACU193)Sabirnetug (ACU193) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) discovered and developed based on its selectivity for soluble AβOs, which are a highly toxic and pathogenic form of Aβ, relative to Aβ monomers and amyloid plaques. Soluble AβOs have been observed to be potent neurotoxins that bind to neurons, inhibit synaptic function and induce neurodegeneration. By selectively targeting toxic soluble AβOs, sabirnetug aims to directly address a growing body of evidence indicating that soluble AβOs are a primary underlying cause of the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer’s disease. Sabirnetug has been granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. About INTERCEPT-ADINTERCEPT-AD was a Phase 1, U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability, and establishing clinical proof of mechanism, of sabirnetug in patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Sixty-five individuals with early AD (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD) enrolled in this first-in-human study of sabirnetug. The INTERCEPT-AD study consisted of single-ascending-dose (SAD) and multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) cohorts and was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and target engagement of intravenous doses of sabirnetug. More information can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT identifier NCT04931459. About Acumen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Acumen, headquartered in Charlottesville, VA, with additional offices in Indianapolis, IN and Newton, MA, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapeutic that targets toxic soluble amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Acumen’s scientific founders pioneered research on AβOs, which a growing body of evidence indicates are early and persistent triggers of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Acumen is currently focused on advancing its investigational product candidate, sabirnetug (ACU193), a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets toxic soluble AβOs, following positive results in INTERCEPT-AD, a Phase 1 clinical trial involving early Alzheimer’s disease patients.

(HPP) announces the reinstatement of dividends for the first quarter of 2024, with $0.05 per share for common stock and $0.296875 per share for Series C preferred stock. The decision reflects the company's improved liquidity, strengthened balance sheet, and anticipated taxable income distribution requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reinstatement of a dividend by Hudson Pacific Properties signifies a noteworthy shift in the company's capital allocation strategy. The declared dividend of $0.05 per share for common stock indicates a direct effort to provide shareholder value. Typically, a dividend reinstatement occurs when a company has confidence in its financial stability and future earnings. This decision likely reflects Hudson Pacific's improved liquidity and a stronger balance sheet, which are critical for sustaining dividends.For investors, the reinstatement could be viewed as a positive signal regarding the company's financial health and its management's commitment to returning capital to shareholders. However, the modest size of the dividend, at an annual rate of $0.20 per share, may suggest a conservative approach. This could indicate that the company is balancing its need to invest in growth opportunities against the desire to reward shareholders.Furthermore, the payment of dividends on preferred stock, with a higher annual rate, underscores the company's obligation to meet the fixed dividend expectations of preferred shareholders, which often rank above common stock dividends in terms of priority. The specific rate of 4.750% for Series C cumulative preferred stock reflects the company's cost of preferred equity, which is a consideration for the overall cost of capital and investment decisions. Real Estate Market Analyst The announcement by Hudson Pacific Properties, a real estate firm catering to tech and media tenants, is indicative of the broader real estate market's recovery and stability, especially in sectors that support high-growth industries. The company's focus on end-to-end real estate solutions for a niche market may have contributed to its financial resilience and ability to distribute dividends.Investors and stakeholders should note the company's strategic positioning within the real estate sector, which could afford it a competitive edge in attracting and retaining high-value tenants. The tech and media industries have shown robust growth and may continue to demand specialized real estate solutions, which Hudson Pacific is poised to provide.The dividend reinstatement should be contextualized within the real estate investment trust (REIT) regulatory framework, which requires REITs to distribute a majority of taxable income to shareholders. The anticipated taxable income distribution requirements for 2024 mentioned by the CEO could be reflective of regulatory compliance, as well as a strategic move to maintain REIT status and associated tax benefits. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.

The company expects 2023 K-1 tax packages to be available around March 30, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Tax Expert The proposed H.R. 7024 legislation appears to have significant implications for CVR Partners' fiscal strategy. A reduction in taxable income can lead to a decrease in tax liability, potentially enhancing the company's net income and cash flow. This legislative change could result in an improved financial position for CVR Partners, allowing for increased reinvestment in operations or distribution to unitholders. Stakeholders should consider the potential for a more favorable tax environment to contribute to the company's financial health, but also remain aware of the volatility of legislative processes and the possibility that the bill may not pass or could change substantially before becoming law. Financial Analyst Investors should note the potential for CVR Partners to experience a delay in the distribution of 2023 K-1 tax packages, which are essential for individual tax filing purposes. While this delay may not directly affect the company's operations, it could create a temporary inconvenience for unitholders. It is also indicative of the broader impact that pending legislation can have on a company's administrative processes. From a market perspective, the anticipation of a lower tax burden could be factored into the stock price, as markets often react to news of potential future savings. However, the actual impact on the stock will depend on the final outcome of the legislation and the company's subsequent financial performance. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market context, the fertilizer industry is sensitive to regulatory changes, given its environmental impact and the critical nature of its products for agriculture. A favorable tax scenario for CVR Partners could enhance its competitive position within the industry. However, stakeholders should also consider the potential for regulatory changes to affect industry norms and the competitive landscape. It's essential to monitor the progress of H.R. 7024 and other similar legislative initiatives, as they could herald shifts in the operating environment for companies like CVR Partners and the agriculture sector as a whole. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CVR Partners, LP (NYSE: UAN), a manufacturer of ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate (“UAN”) solution fertilizer products, today announced that it continues to monitor Congress and the Biden Administration’s consideration of the proposed H.R. 7024 legislation that, as currently written, would lower CVR Partners’ taxable income for 2023, compared to existing tax law.

The project aims to develop a 125,000-square-foot facility for elderly and assisted living residents, with plans for future phases and additional building amenities.","Safe and Green Development Corp Secures Financing for Norman Berry Expansion in Atlanta, Georgia Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Safe and Green Development Corporation (SGD) provides an update on the Norman Berry Village property in Atlanta, GA, securing financing for expansion. The project aims to develop a 125,000-square-foot facility for elderly and assisted living residents, with plans for future phases and additional building amenities. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Development Analyst The acquisition of the right of way (ROW) and the adjacent parcel by Safe and Green Development Corporation is a strategic move that enhances the Norman Berry Village project's potential. The expansion of the site to a six-acre plot allows for a more comprehensive development, which can lead to a higher density of use and, consequently, increased revenue potential. The partnership with CMC Development Group, a recognized local firm, adds credibility to the project and can expedite the approval processes, reflecting positively on project timelines and cost efficiency.This development is significant as it directly affects the company's asset base and future income streams. The focus on constructing a facility that caters to elderly and assisted living is tapping into a growing market segment, driven by an aging population. The project's phased approach also indicates a strategic plan for growth and expansion, which can be seen as a positive indicator of the company's long-term vision and operational scalability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the Norman Berry Village project aligns with the broader trends in the real estate market, where there is an increasing demand for senior and assisted living facilities. The demographic shift towards an older population creates a growing need for such specialized housing solutions. By investing in this segment, SG DevCo is positioning itself in a niche that is expected to see continued growth, which may attract investor interest and potentially impact the company's stock valuation positively.Additionally, the location in Atlanta, GA, is a key factor. Urban development projects in growing metropolitan areas often lead to appreciation of property values. The involvement in such a prime location could signal to investors the company's potential for capital gains and an increased asset valuation over time. Financial Analyst Securing financing for property acquisition is a critical step in real estate development, indicating the project's viability and the company's creditworthiness. Investors should consider the terms of the financing, as they can significantly affect the project's profitability. The immediate impact on SG DevCo's balance sheet will be the addition of the property's value as an asset, offset by the corresponding liability of the financing.Long-term implications include the potential for increased cash flows from the developed property, which can contribute to the company's earnings. However, construction and development carry inherent risks, including cost overruns and delays, which could impact the projected financial outcomes. Investors should monitor the company's progress reports and any changes in the real estate market that might affect the project's success. 03/08/2024 - 09:00 AM MIAMI, Fla, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Safe and Green Development Corporation (NASDAQ: SGD)(“SG DevCo” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce an update on the Norman Berry Village property in Atlanta, GA.

CMC was crucial in receiving approval from the city of Eastpoint to purchase the project’s Right of Way which will enable us to develop a six-acre site on Norman Berry Drive in a timely manner, all of which has made this project move forward quickly.” concluded Mr. Villarreal. Norman Berry Village is a prime location for development. The project includes constructing a 125,000-square-foot facility that will accommodate a combination of 68 single and double occupancy residences for elderly and assisted living residents including many additional building amenities. There are planned additional phases of construction for the Norman Berry Village project's design, and the completed project is expected to feature two buildings housing 134 units, offering a blend of one and two-bedroom apartments.

(NYSE:VEL) released its Q4 and full-year 2023 results, noting a typographical error in the earnings release. The corrected ratio shows a Recourse debt to equity ratio of 1.2 times. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The correction from 'Non-recourse' to 'Recourse' debt to equity ratio is a significant detail that investors and analysts use to assess a company's financial leverage and risk profile. Recourse debt allows lenders to pursue the borrower's other assets if the collateral does not cover the debt value, implying a higher risk for the company. This adjustment in the earnings release can influence the perceived creditworthiness of Velocity Financial, Inc. and may affect investor sentiment. A debt to equity ratio of 1.2 times is within a reasonable range for many industries, but the specific impact on the company's stock would depend on the norms within the financial sector and the company's historical ratios. Risk Management Expert Understanding the distinction between recourse and non-recourse debt is crucial in risk assessment. The original misstatement could have led stakeholders to underestimate the potential liabilities of Velocity Financial, Inc. The corrected information provides a clearer picture of the company's obligations and the risks to which equity holders are exposed. Stakeholders should reassess their risk models and consider the implications of the company's actual leverage. It is also important to evaluate the company's history of reporting accuracy, as frequent errors could undermine confidence in management's transparency and reliability. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Velocity Financial, Inc.

The Company has also reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, raising concerns about financial stability. Financial Analyst The acceptance of KULR Technology Group's compliance plan by NYSE American is a critical juncture for the company, indicating a path forward amidst financial challenges. The prolonged plan period until June 2025 offers KULR a substantial timeframe to address the stockholders' equity shortfall and operational losses. It is essential to monitor the company's quarterly reports during this period, as these will serve as indicators of the company's financial health and its ability to execute the recovery plan effectively.Investors should note that the company's current stockholders' equity of $1.2 million falls significantly short of the NYSE American's $6 million requirement. This gap suggests the need for strategic financial management, potentially including raising capital through debt or equity financing, restructuring, or operational cost-cutting. The company's history of operational losses further underscores the urgency for a turnaround strategy. The market's response to this news will likely be cautious optimism, contingent on KULR's forthcoming financial performance. Market Research Analyst KULR Technology Group operates within the sustainable energy management sector, a market characterized by rapid innovation and growing demand. The company's ability to regain compliance is not only a financial concern but also a reflection of its competitiveness in this dynamic industry. The acceptance of the compliance plan offers KULR an opportunity to reinforce investor confidence by demonstrating progress in product development, market penetration and revenue growth.Given the industry's focus on sustainability and technology advancements, KULR's future announcements regarding new partnerships, patents, or breakthroughs in energy management solutions could influence market perception and stock performance.

Historically, Global’s tax packages have been available by the middle of March for the preceding tax year; however, the timing of the availability of Global’s 2023 tax packages is dependent upon actions of the U.S. Congress and the Biden administration with regard to the potential passage (or rejection) of the recently proposed H.R. 7024 legislation that includes changes in tax law which would be applied retroactively to the 2023 tax year. As currently written, certain provisions in H.R. 7024 would lower Global's taxable income for 2023 compared to existing tax law.

Common Stock Expected to Trade on a Post-Split Basis on March 21, 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CSPi (NASDAQ:CSPI) announces a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend on outstanding common stock, with a record date of March 6, 2024. Shareholders will receive one additional share for every share held, leading to approximately 9,753,900 shares outstanding post-split. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Stock splits are a strategic move by companies to make their shares more accessible to a broader range of investors by reducing the price per share without affecting the overall market capitalization. In the case of CSPi's two-for-one stock split, this could potentially enhance liquidity and may be viewed as a signal of management's confidence in the company's future performance. However, it's important to note that stock splits do not inherently add value to a company. They simply increase the number of shares outstanding and decrease the share price proportionally.From a market perspective, the increased share count to approximately 9.75 million could make the stock more appealing to retail investors who might have considered the pre-split price too high for their portfolios. This could potentially increase trading volume and volatility around the split date. For long-term investors, the split itself should be neutral, as the value of their holdings remains unchanged, but the psychological perception of a lower price per share could influence market sentiment positively. Financial Analyst When evaluating the financial implications of a stock split like CSPi's, it's crucial to assess the post-split trading behavior. Historically, stocks tend to experience a temporary increase in share price following a split, attributed to improved affordability and increased interest from investors. However, this bump is not guaranteed and should not be considered a long-term trend. Investors should focus on the company's fundamental metrics such as earnings growth, revenue performance and market position to make informed decisions.Additionally, the timing of the split may be indicative of strategic planning by CSPi's management. Implementing a stock split ahead of positive growth forecasts can maximize the potential benefits. Conversely, if the company's performance does not meet market expectations post-split, the reduced share price could suffer. Stakeholders should monitor CSPi's performance closely following the split to gauge the impact on the company's valuation. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, CSPi's stock split process involves critical dates that determine shareholder eligibility for the dividend shares. The record date and the distribution date are pivotal in ensuring that shareholders receive their entitled additional shares. It is the responsibility of the shareholders to understand these dates and consult with their brokers to confirm eligibility. The company's clear communication regarding the split mechanics helps to prevent any legal disputes that may arise from misunderstandings about the distribution of the new shares.Furthermore, CSPi's adherence to the guidelines set by Equiniti Trust Company, LLC, the transfer agent, is integral to the smooth execution of the stock split. Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and stock exchange rules is essential to maintain investor confidence and avoid potential legal complications that could negatively impact the company's reputation and stock performance. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM LOWELL, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / CSPi (NASDAQ:CSPI), an award-winning provider of security and packet capture products, managed IT and professional services and technology solutions, is expected to trade on a post-split basis at the market open on March 21, 2024.

Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM Vancouver, BC, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Skyharbour Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: SYH) (OTCQX: SYHBF) (Frankfurt: SC1P) (“Skyharbour” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that its partner company, North Shore Uranium (“North Shore”), has commenced its drill program at the Falcon Property (“Falcon” or the “Property”) located at the eastern margin of the Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan. North Shore is planning to drill three targets associated with electromagnetic (“EM”) conductors. Information pertaining to the drill program and a summary of the Property were provided by the Company on February 28, 2024 and December 19, 2023. Location Map of Falcon Project:https://skyharbourltd.com/_resources/maps/Sky-SouthFalconOption.jpg?v=0.1 The drill program is being managed by TerraLogic Exploration Inc. The final three targets selected for drilling, which lie along a strong, dominantly northeast-trending EM conductor system, are shown in the image below. For each target, a subsurface geophysical model of the EM conductor has been prepared and a hole, which is drilled at an angle, has been designed to intersect the conductor. Electromagnetics with 2024 Drill Targets P03, P08 and P12: https://www.skyharbourltd.com/_resources/images/Electromagnetics-with-2024-Drill-Targets.jpg Falcon Uranium Project: The Falcon Property, which constitutes part of North Shore’s Falcon Property, contains eleven mineral claims comprising approximately 42,908 hectares approximately 50 km east of the Key Lake mine. Nine of the claims are from Skyharbour’s original South Falcon Uranium Project and the remaining two claims are from Skyharbour’s Foster River Project. Historical uranium mineralization discovered at Falcon is shallow and is hosted in several geological settings including classic Athabasca-style basement mineralization associated with well-developed EM conductors. At the EWA target, up to 0.492% U3O8 and 1,300 ppm lead was encountered in outcrop grab samples (Sask. Mineral Deposits Index [SMDI] 5038). Historical grab sampling at Knob Lake (SMDI 1014) also encountered up to 0.01% U3O8 in an outcrop of pegmatite, while anomalous nickel, copper, and molybdenum were found in historical grab samples from the Fraser North target area (SMDI’s 1125 and 1126). A well-defined northeast-trending, locally folded, electromagnetic conductor system runs throughout the Property, which was defined by airborne and ground geophysical surveys by JNR Resources (“JNR”) in the 2000’s. In 2008 JNR conducted a drill campaign at the property area. Of the 47 holes drilled that year, 28 holes (totaling 7,348 metres) were drilled on the South Falcon Uranium Property at the Walker (14 holes), Walker South (7 holes), and EWA target areas (6 holes). At the Walker and South Walker targets, which lie along the aforementioned EM conductor system, structurally disrupted and variably altered metasediments (including graphitic pelitic gneisses) with anomalous boron, copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, arsenic, and vanadium were encountered in several drill holes. During this same drill campaign, the Fraser Lakes Zone B uranium deposit was discovered approximately four kilometres east of the Walker South target on a refolded extension of the EM conductor system. At the EWA target, which lies along a separate northeast-trending EM conductor, anomalous uranium, boron, lead, and molybdenum were encountered in structurally disrupted pegmatites; the best result was 0.235% U3O8 over 0.5 m (within a 3.5 m interval of 0.113% U3O8) in hole WYL-08-501 (Sask. Mineral Assessment File 74H02-0045). Furthermore, in 2022, Skyharbour completed a FALCON® airborne gravity gradiometer and magnetic survey over nine of the eleven claims at the Falcon Property. This new geophysical data will assist North Shore in prioritizing areas along the EM conductor system for drilling. Over 30 kilometres of the EM conductor system remains untested on the Falcon Property. North Shore’s initial focus will be on the two claims formerly part of the Foster Project (geophysics), and on generating drill targets on three claims at the southeastern end of the EM conductor systems including Knob Lake, which shows similarities to the Fraser Lakes Zone B deposit approximately 6 km to the northeast and several other high-priority targets elsewhere along the main EM conductor system. Significant potential exists on the project for basement-hosted, unconformity-related uranium deposits like those further to the north in the Wollaston Domain (i.e. Eagle Point, Rabbit Lake, Key Lake and others), as well as for pegmatite/granite-hosted (i.e. alaskite-type) U-Th-REE mineralization like at the Fraser Lakes Zone B deposit on Skyharbour’s adjacent South Falcon East Property, currently under option to Tisdale Clean Energy. The Option Agreement: North Shore may acquire an initial 80% interest in the Property by issuing common shares of the Resulting Issuer (“Shares”) having an aggregate value of CAD $1,225,000; making aggregate cash payments of CAD $525,000; and incurring an aggregate of CAD $3,550,000 in exploration expenditures on the Property over a three-year period. Once North Shore has earned an initial 80% interest in the Property, North Shore may acquire the remaining 20% interest in the Property within 90 business days by issuing Shares having a value of CAD $5,000,000, and making a cash payment of CAD $5,000,000 to Skyharbour. If North Shore does not elect to acquire the remaining 20% interest, a joint venture will be formed with Skyharbour holding a 20% participating interest. North Shore will be the operator of the exploration programs during the earn-in stage and for the joint venture if formed. Two claims totaling 10,673 hectares that form part of Skyharbour’s Foster River Property are subject to a one percent (1%) NSR royalty payable to Skyharbour. The remaining nine claims totaling 32,235 hectares that comprise Skyharbour’s South Falcon Point Property are subject to a two percent (2%) NSR royalty payable to Denison Mines Corp. (“Denison”) with North Shore having the right to purchase one percent of the royalty from Denison at anytime by paying $1 million. All Shares will be subject to a four-month-and-one-day statutory hold period in accordance with applicable securities laws. Qualified Person: The technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by David Billard, P.Geo., a Consulting Geologist for Skyharbour as well as a Qualified Person.

ReStore Exo-Suit Publications Demonstrate Improved Walking Outcomes Versus Conventional Stroke Therapy,2024-03-08T13:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"Two recent research publications highlight the effectiveness of the ReStore Exo-Suit in improving walking ability for post-stroke patients. The studies show significant improvements in walking speed and distance, emphasizing the clinical value of Lifeward's technology for rehabilitation.","ReStore Exo-Suit Publications Demonstrate Improved Walking Outcomes Versus Conventional Stroke Therapy Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Two recent research publications highlight the effectiveness of the ReStore Exo-Suit in improving walking ability for post-stroke patients. The studies show significant improvements in walking speed and distance, emphasizing the clinical value of Lifeward's technology for rehabilitation. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from the clinical trials involving the ReStore Exo-Suit signify a notable advancement in post-stroke rehabilitation technology. The statistically significant improvements in walking speed and distance are critical endpoints in stroke recovery, as they directly correlate with a patient's independence and quality of life. Such outcomes not only endorse the efficacy of the ReStore Exo-Suit but also suggest a potential shift in the standard of care for stroke rehabilitation.From a medical research perspective, the persistence of improved walking metrics four weeks post-intervention is particularly compelling. This indicates that the ReStore Exo-Suit may facilitate long-term neuroplastic changes, which are essential for sustained recovery. Furthermore, the emphasis on propulsion mechanics highlights the device's ability to target specific deficits in stroke survivors, potentially leading to more individualized and effective rehabilitation strategies. Healthcare Industry Analyst The positive outcomes reported for the ReStore Exo-Suit could have significant implications for the healthcare industry, especially in the context of rehabilitation services. The ability of the Exo-Suit to maintain improvements post-intervention could reduce the overall duration and intensity of therapy needed, potentially lowering healthcare costs and increasing the throughput of rehabilitation facilities.In terms of market impact, Lifeward's active engagement with CMS for determining a final payment amount for the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton indicates a strategic move towards securing reimbursement pathways. This is a critical step for market penetration and could set a precedent for future technology-based rehabilitation devices. The mention of a next-generation product pipeline also suggests a long-term growth strategy that could appeal to investors looking for companies at the forefront of innovation in medical technology. Financial Analyst The clinical trial results for the ReStore Exo-Suit are likely to resonate positively with investors, given the potential for product adoption and market expansion. The demonstrated clinical value and the durable improvements post-intervention could lead to increased demand for the Exo-Suit, thereby driving revenue growth for Lifeward. Moreover, the company's experience in establishing Medicare coverage for its ReWalk Exoskeleton bodes well for the ReStore Exo-Suit's commercialization strategy.Investors should closely monitor the company's progress with CMS regarding payment amounts, as favorable outcomes could significantly enhance Lifeward's financial position. The dual focus on advancing clinical outcomes and expanding reimbursement coverage reflects a comprehensive approach to market leadership in the rehabilitation space, which could be a key driver of long-term shareholder value. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM Randomized clinical trial demonstrates significant improvements in walking ability for patients receiving therapy with the ReStore Exo-Suit as compared to a matched control group receiving conventional stroke therapy. Additional study demonstrates that the improvements in walking speed and distance following high-intensity gait training with the ReStore Exo-Suit were maintained by individuals post-stroke 4 weeks after the intervention had concluded. Combined results highlight the clinical value of the ReStore Exo-Suit and its related breakthrough propulsion-augmenting technologies within the Lifeward product development pipeline. MARLBOROUGH, Mass. and YOKNEAM ILLIT, Israel, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ReWalk Robotics Ltd. (DBA Lifeward™), (Nasdaq: LFWD) (“Lifeward” or the “Company”), a global market leader delivering life-changing solutions to revolutionize what is possible in rehabilitation, recovery, and the pursuit of life’s passions in the face of physical limitation or disability, today highlighted two recent research publications that demonstrate the effectiveness of the unique propulsion training capabilities of the ReStore Exo-Suit for post-stroke rehabilitation. “We are encouraged by the tremendous clinical value we see in the ReStore Exo-Suit technology and its ability to retrain and augment propulsion for individuals recovering from stroke,” stated Larry Jasinski, CEO at Lifeward. “We believe these recent studies can broaden the use of robotic therapy in the rehabilitation of patients post-stroke and speak to the potential value of the next generation of products for home use in our development pipeline which are based upon the same ReStore technology. We expect that the experience and infrastructure that we have developed for establishing Medicare coverage of the ReWalk Exoskeleton will also facilitate patients’ access to our future technologies. In parallel, we continue to work actively with CMS to determine a final payment amount for the ReWalk Personal Exoskeleton using the current pricing information we submitted in November 2023.” The most recent publication, from the University of Pécs in Hungary, titled “Investigation of the Effectiveness of the Robotic ReStore Soft Exoskeleton in the Development of Early Mobilization, Walking, and Coordination of Stroke Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial” examined key walking metrics for two groups of post-stroke patients, randomized to either a conventional therapy program or a program which included training with the ReStore Exo-Suit. The ReStore intervention group demonstrated significant improvements compared to the control group, including a 56% increase in 10-meter walking speed, and a 68% improvement in 6-minute walking distance, and the improved performance was demonstrated to persist at the post-intervention follow up assessment. A second study from Boston University was presented in an abstract titled “Durable Improvements in Post-Stroke Walking Speed and Distance Following High-Intensity Training with Soft Robotic Exosuits.” This study demonstrated that a 4-week program of intensive gait training with the ReStore Exo-Suit for individuals post-stroke (N=25) resulted in clinically meaningful increases in walking speed (average: 0.17 m/s) and walking distance (34.4 m) which endured a month after the individual had completed the training program. These improvements in speed and distance were accompanied by significant improvements in propulsion mechanics of the paretic limb.

Chris Tyson, Executive Vice President at MZ North America, along with Directors Larry Holub and Brooks Hamilton, will advise Hypercharge's investor relations team in all facets of investor relations including, but not limited to, the coordination of roadshows and investment conferences across key cities and building brand awareness with financial and social media outlets.Chris Tyson commented: ""Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in global transportation trends, characterized by a surge in passenger EV sales. The U.S saw a historic year for EVs in 2023, skyrocketing past one million units sold, a 50.7% increase year-over-year. The Inflation Reduction Act will invest $7.5 billion in EV charging, $5 billion of which is for building a ""backbone"" of high-speed chargers spaced no less than every 50 miles along America's major roads, freeways, and interstates. The booming market landscape in North America enables Hypercharge to capitalize on the demand for critical charging infrastructure for an electrified future. With global EV car stock forecasted to reach almost 350 million by 2030, and with international benchmarking suggesting the need for up to one public charger per 10 EVs, the estimated number of required public charging ports is over 35 million worldwide. It will be critical to include or increase charging points at commercial and residential buildings such as apartment complexes, offices, parking lots and commercial centers. This creates untapped value which presents an exciting opportunity, and we look forward to sharing this with our network of institutional, family offices and retail investors.""Larry Holub added: ""Hypercharge delivers a complete Level 2 and DC Fast Charging EV solution through robust hardware, intuitive software, and expert services. Its charging stations are scalable and efficient, supported by innovative software, all backed by turnkey services and 24/7 customer support. The Hypercharge difference lies in three core strengths: a hardware-agnostic model for a capital-light business, a robust preferred partner program of electrical contractors, parking lot management companies, dealership distributors, and affiliates driving its largest sales channel, and market-leading innovation connecting its network seamlessly with third-party apps and services. Its versatile business model accelerates adoption with a carbon credit program, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that provides recurring revenue, and Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providing zero upfront investment for clients.""""Hypercharge is leading the rapid expansion of EV charging infrastructure with over 2,800 ports sold across North America at the end of 2023,"" said David Bibby, President and CEO of Hypercharge. ""We are establishing a strategic and growing footprint across Canada and the U.S. market. Having firmly established our presence in Canada, we are poised to replicate this success south of the border. In response to our accelerated growth, we launched Hypercharge Home, a residential Level 2 EV charging station for at-home use, Eevion, a cloud-based platform that integrates the Hypercharge EV charging network into any app, platform, or system, and the Hypercharge Carbon Credits Program, supporting the growth of earning potential for customers equipped with Hypercharge EV charging stations. Our business model and innovative strategies are designed for profitability, and we are highly focused on executing on our sales roadmap to grow recurring revenues and drive gross profit margin. We look forward to working with Chris and the entire team at MZ Group to communicate our ability to leverage our platform to take advantage of electrification market trends and build long-term value for our shareholders.""The consultancy agreement with MZ Group has a term of four months with renewal clauses for additional month-to-month intervals and may be terminated with thirty days advance notice prior to the end of the then current term. MZ Group will be paid a monthly fee of US$7,500 plus cash bonuses for performance-based milestones achieved during the engagement period.For more information on Hypercharge, please visit hypercharge.com.

iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited Announces Shareholders' Approval of Merger Agreement,2024-03-08T13:45:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited (NASDAQ: ICLK) announced shareholder approval for a merger agreement, with 99.77% of votes in favor. The merger will make the company privately-held, delisting its ADSs from stock exchanges.","iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited Announces Shareholders' Approval of Merger Agreement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited (NASDAQ: ICLK) announced shareholder approval for a merger agreement, with 99.77% of votes in favor. The merger will make the company privately-held, delisting its ADSs from stock exchanges. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval of the merger agreement by iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited's shareholders is a pivotal event that signals a significant change in the company's ownership structure and market presence. The overwhelming shareholder support, with approximately 99.77% of the votes cast in favor, underscores the confidence the investors have in the strategic rationale behind the merger. This transaction, once completed, will transition iClick from a public entity listed on NASDAQ to a private company, effectively removing its shares from public trading.The immediate implications for shareholders include the cessation of liquidity and marketability associated with the company's ADSs. This could potentially impact the valuation of their investment, as private companies are typically valued differently than public ones. Additionally, shareholders should be aware of the potential for changes in company strategy and operations post-merger, as the new ownership may have different objectives and approaches to management.In the long term, the move to privatization might allow iClick more flexibility in pursuing strategic initiatives without the pressures of quarterly earnings reports and market expectations. However, it may also limit the company's capital-raising options and reduce transparency for stakeholders. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of a merger, especially one involving companies in different jurisdictions like iClick, require careful consideration. The merger must comply with the legal requirements of the Cayman Islands, where iClick is registered and any other applicable regulatory bodies. The nearly unanimous vote at the EGM suggests that the proposed terms of the merger were well-received by the shareholders, likely due to thorough due diligence and a belief that the merger terms are in their best interest.For the merger to proceed, all conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement must be satisfied or waived. This includes regulatory approvals, which can be complex given the cross-border nature of the transaction. The legal framework and conditions precedent are designed to protect all parties involved, including minority shareholders and ensure that the merger is executed in a fair and lawful manner.It is also important to note that upon completion of the merger, the company's reporting obligations will change and shareholders may experience a shift in their rights and entitlements. The legal ramifications of this shift should be communicated clearly to the shareholders to ensure they are fully informed of the changes. Market Research Analyst The decision to take iClick private can be seen as a strategic move that reflects broader market trends, where certain firms opt for the private route to gain more control and flexibility in their operations. This trend is often observed in markets where companies face significant competitive pressures or where public market valuations do not align with management's assessment of the company's intrinsic value.Market research suggests that private ownership could enable iClick to focus on long-term growth strategies without the short-term performance pressures from the public markets. However, this could also potentially limit the company's exposure to a broader pool of investors and the benefits that come with public company status, such as increased brand recognition and credibility.Analyzing the impact on the broader industry, this merger could potentially signal a consolidation trend within the marketing cloud platform sector, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. Stakeholders in similar companies should monitor these developments closely as they may have implications for competitive dynamics and industry investment flows. 03/08/2024 - 08:45 AM HONG KONG, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- iClick Interactive Asia Group Limited (""iClick"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ICLK), a leading enterprise and marketing cloud platform in China that empowers worldwide brands with full-stack consumer lifecycle solutions, today announced that at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") held today, the Company's shareholders voted in favor of, among other things, the proposal to authorize and approve the execution, delivery and performance of the previously announced agreement and plan of merger, dated as of November 24, 2023 (the ""Merger Agreement""), by and among the Company, TSH Investment Holding Limited (""Parent""), and TSH Merger Sub Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (""Merger Sub""), and the plan of merger required to be filed with the Registrar of Companies of the Cayman Islands (the ""Plan of Merger""), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving company and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the ""Merger""), and to authorize and approve the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Plan of Merger, including the Merger. Approximately 54.97% of the Company's total outstanding Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, par value US$0.001 per share (each, a ""Class A Share"" and ""Class B Share,"" respectively), including Class A Shares represented by the Company's American depositary shares (the ""ADSs""), attended the EGM in person or by proxy.

The Company will work with the other parties to the Merger Agreement towards satisfying all other conditions precedent to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger as quickly as possible.

(NASDAQ: GPCR) reported financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with a year-end cash balance of $467.3 million. The company highlighted successful Phase 2a data for GSBR-1290 in obesity and type 2 diabetes, with plans for Phase 2b trials. They also outlined upcoming milestones for other programs targeting metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases. The company raised $485.0 million in equity capital in 2023, with strong financials to fund operations through 2026. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Structure Therapeutics Inc. indicate a significant year-over-year increase in both research and development (R&D) and general and administrative (G&A) expenses. The rise in R&D expenses from $36.2 million to $70.1 million reflects the company's commitment to advancing its GLP-1R franchise and other research programs. This strategic investment suggests a focus on long-term growth through the development of their pipeline, which could enhance future revenue streams if their drugs are successful in clinical trials and receive market approval.However, this increase in spending has resulted in a larger net loss, growing from $51.3 million to $89.6 million year-over-year. Investors should consider the company's current cash position of $467.3 million against these losses. With an expected funding runway through 2026, the company appears to have sufficient capital to support its operations and key clinical milestones in the near-to-mid term without the immediate need for further financing, which is reassuring for stakeholders. Nonetheless, the success of their clinical trials and subsequent commercialization efforts will be crucial for financial sustainability in the long run. Medical Research Analyst Structure Therapeutics' progress in the clinical development of GSBR-1290, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, is noteworthy given the therapeutic potential in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The reported clinically meaningful data demonstrating significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight are promising indicators of the drug's efficacy. In the context of obesity and T2DM treatments, these metrics are critical as they directly correlate with improved patient outcomes and reduced risks of complications associated with these conditions.The company's pipeline expansion, including the development of amylin agonists and GIPR selective agonists, represents an innovative approach to addressing obesity and associated diseases. The combination therapy approach with GLP-1R agonists could potentially provide a more comprehensive and effective treatment regimen. The tolerability and safety profile of these drugs will be key factors in their success, as the market tends to favor treatments with fewer adverse effects. The initiation of Phase 2b studies for GSBR-1290 and the development of other oral small molecule programs targeting amylin, GIP and apelin receptors are significant steps toward addressing unmet medical needs in these therapeutic areas. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Structure Therapeutics' focus on oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases taps into a substantial market with significant unmet needs. The obesity treatment market alone is projected to grow substantially, driven by increasing prevalence and awareness. The company's emphasis on oral administration could give it a competitive edge, as current treatments predominantly involve injectables, which are less patient-friendly. If GSBR-1290 and other candidates in their pipeline prove to be effective and safe in later-stage trials, they could capture a considerable market share and potentially disrupt the current treatment paradigm.Additionally, the company's exploration of combination therapies such as GLP-1R/GIPR combinations and its oral small molecule apelin receptor program for selective or muscle-sparing weight loss could appeal to a broad patient population seeking more personalized and effective treatment options. The successful development and commercialization of these therapies could lead to significant market differentiation and value creation for Structure Therapeutics. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM Topline GSBR-1290 Phase 2a 12-week obesity data, as well as data from formulation bridging and titration optimization study, on track for latter half of the second quarter 2024 Phase 2b study in obesity expected to begin as planned in the fourth quarter 2024 Year-end cash balance of $467.3 million expected to fund operations and key clinical milestones through 2026 SAN FRANCISCO, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Structure Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: GPCR), a clinical-stage global biopharmaceutical company developing novel oral small molecule therapeutics for metabolic and cardiopulmonary diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent corporate achievements. “In 2023 we demonstrated clear proof-of-concept with our lead GLP-1 receptor agonist, GSBR-1290, for obesity and type 2 diabetes. As a differentiated oral small molecule we have the scalability and manufacturing advantages to potentially meet the significant unmet need currently observed in the GLP-1 space,” said Raymond Stevens, Ph.D., Founder and CEO of Structure Therapeutics. “With a year-end cash balance of $467.3 million providing runway through the end of 2026, we are well-positioned to initiate and complete our Phase 2b trials for GSBR-1290 and accelerate development of our oral small molecule programs targeting amylin, GIP, and apelin receptors.” Recent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones GSBR-1290 for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and Obesity In December 2023, the Company reported clinically meaningful data from the Phase 2a study in T2DM demonstrating significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight at 12 weeks. Interim Phase 2a data from the obesity cohort demonstrated significant reduction in weight at 8 weeks. Across both cohorts, GSBR-1290 was generally well-tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events over 12 weeks and low study discontinuation rates due to adverse events related to study drug (2.8% in T2DM and 0% in obesity).Topline data from the obesity cohort of the Phase 2a study, including full 12-week efficacy data for 40 participants and safety and tolerability for all 64 participants. This study is fully enrolled and data are expected in the latter half of the second quarter of 2024.In preparation for later stage clinical trials, a formulation bridging and titration optimization study to evaluate capsule versus tablet pharmacokinetics (PK) and explore different titration regimens of GSBR-1290 is ongoing. This study is fully enrolled and data are expected in the latter half of the second quarter of 2024.The Company plans to initiate a global Phase 2b obesity study of GSBR-1290 in the fourth quarter of 2024.The Company plans to initiate a Phase 2 study in T2DM in the second half of 2024. GLP-1R Combination Programs: Amylin, GIPR, Apelin (APJR) Oral Small Molecule Amylin Program: The Company is developing amylin agonists for use either alone or in combination with GLP-1R agonists to treat obesity and associated diseases, and expects to select a development candidate in the second half of 2024.Oral Small Molecule GIPR Program: The Company is developing a GIPR selective agonist and GLP‑1R/GIPR combinations to treat obesity and associated diseases, and expects to select a development candidate in the first half of 2025.Oral Small Molecule Apelin Receptor (APJR) Program: The Company is evaluating its Phase 2 ready ANPA-0073, a biased agonist targeting APJR used in combination with weight loss medicines, for selective or muscle-sparing weight loss. ANPA-0073 is also being evaluated for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The Company has completed a Phase 1 single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose study, in which ANPA-0073 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse event reported. LPA1R Program for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) The Company is developing LTSE-2578, an oral small molecule antagonist that targets lysophosphatidic acid 1 receptor (LPA1R). Preclinical studies have demonstrated substantial anti-fibrotic activity in mouse models of fibrotic lung disease, and the Company expects to initiate a first-in-human study of LTSE-2578 in the second quarter of 2024. Corporate In 2023, the Company raised approximately $485.0 million of equity capital: $185.0 million in gross proceeds from the initial public offering in February, and $300.0 million in gross proceeds from the private placement equity financing in October. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $467.3 million at December 31, 2023. The Company expects its current cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operations and expected key clinical milestones through at least 2026. R&D Expenses: Research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $20.0 million, as compared to $8.4 million for the same period in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, R&D expenses were $70.1 million, as compared to $36.2 million for the full year 2022. The increase was primarily due to the advancement of the Company’s GLP-1R franchise and other research programs, clinical study activities and increases related to employee expenses, primarily due to an increase in personnel. G&A Expenses: General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $11.0 million, as compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, G&A expenses were $32.7 million, as compared to $16.4 million for the full year 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in professional services and employee related expenses as the Company expanded its infrastructure to drive and support the growth in its operations as a publicly-traded company. Net Loss: Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 totaled $24.5, with non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $2.1 million, compared to $11.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 with non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million.

For Bakkt, which is a publicly-traded company, such strategic partnerships could improve its competitive positioning and drive revenue growth, thereby potentially impacting its stock performance positively. Moreover, the emphasis on regulated custody services could resonate well with regulatory bodies, possibly reducing the risk of adverse regulatory actions against Bakkt. Cybersecurity Expert The integration of Bakkt as a key agent in a collaborative custody model underscores the increasing importance of cybersecurity in the cryptocurrency space. Multi-signature vaults are a sophisticated security feature that requires multiple keys to authorize transactions, thereby reducing the risk of asset theft or unauthorized access. Bakkt's involvement in this system not only enhances the security of digital assets but also showcases the company's commitment to adopting advanced cybersecurity measures.For the broader industry, this move could set a precedent for security standards in digital asset custody, encouraging other players to adopt similar multi-signature and collaborative security frameworks. The potential benefits of such a system include a reduced likelihood of security breaches and a stronger defense against hacking attempts, which have historically plagued the cryptocurrency industry. These enhancements in security measures could lead to a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and secure asset class among skeptical investors. Market Research Analyst This partnership reflects a strategic response to the growing demand for cryptocurrency services among large institutions. As regulatory uncertainty persists, the need for diverse and secure custody options becomes paramount. By joining Unchained's network, Bakkt is tapping into a niche market of enterprise-grade custody services, which could see significant growth as the cryptocurrency market matures and more institutional players enter the space.The move by Bakkt could also signal a shift in market dynamics where companies are increasingly looking to offer value-added services beyond mere trading. The ability to provide secure custody solutions may become a key differentiator in the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency service providers. This could influence the strategic decisions of other market participants and drive innovation in the sector, leading to improved services for investors and potentially higher adoption rates for cryptocurrency investments. 03/08/2024 - 08:15 AM ALPHARETTA, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bakkt Holdings, Inc.

Private Placement constituted a related party transaction under MI 61-101. Use of net proceeds from the Private Placement not specified in detail. No specific financial figures provided regarding revenue or profitability expectations. Market Research Analyst The merger between GameSquare Holdings, Inc. and FaZe Holdings Inc. represents a strategic consolidation within the gaming and esports industry, which is experiencing rapid growth and attracting significant advertising revenue. This merger not only increases GameSquare's audience reach to one billion but also enhances its service offerings to include marketing, creative services and analytics solutions tailored for the gaming sector. The focus on Gen Z, Gen Alpha and Millennial demographics is particularly noteworthy as these groups are increasingly difficult for brands to engage through traditional media channels.The addition of prominent gaming personalities to GameSquare's roster, including Ninja and TimTheTatman, is expected to bolster the company's brand and attract partnership opportunities. The significant reduction in operating costs reported by FaZe, amounting to $31 million annually, suggests an emphasis on operational efficiency which could improve profitability margins and shareholder value in the long term. However, the short-term impact of market trends on results should be monitored closely by investors. Financial Analyst The financial aspects of the merger, including the $10 million private placement and the issuance of 7,194,244 units at $1.39 each, are critical for evaluating GameSquare's financial health post-merger. The inclusion of warrants exercisable at $1.55 provides potential for additional capital inflow but also dilutes current shareholders' equity. The backstop agreement with Goff Jones ensures full subscription to the private placement, indicating confidence from certain investors but also raising questions about the influence of related parties in the transaction.Investors should consider the proforma market capitalization of approximately $47 million against the backdrop of the company's growth initiatives and the potential for revenue synergies. The use of net proceeds from the private placement for growth initiatives and general corporate purposes needs to be tracked for its effectiveness in driving company growth and operational scalability. Legal Expert The transaction's compliance with securities regulations, particularly the four-month hold period under Canadian securities laws and Regulation D of the Securities Act in the U.S., is a safeguard for investors and indicates the company's adherence to legal standards. The re-domestication from British Columbia to Delaware could have implications for corporate governance and tax considerations, which are relevant for evaluating the future administrative structure and potential benefits or complications arising from this change.Furthermore, the related party transaction involving certain insiders, while exempt from formal valuation, was approved at a special meeting, suggesting transparency in the transaction. However, investors should remain aware of the potential for conflicts of interest in such arrangements and seek to understand the long-term implications of these insider participations. 03/08/2024 - 08:15 AM Becomes One of the Largest Gaming and Esports Organizations Based on Audience ReachIncreased Scale and Expanded Capabilities Creates Next Generation Media Company Positioned to Drive Compelling Outcomes for Creators and Maximize Brand Partners' Return on InvestmentGameSquare Strengthens Balance Sheet with $10 Million PIPE and Recently Announced Non-Core Asset SalesReturns FaZe Clan's founders: FaZe Banks, FaZe Temperrr, and FaZe Apex to lead the brand and reestablish authenticityFRISCO, TX AND LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / GameSquare Holdings, Inc.

The company reports strong business fundamentals with 1700% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2023. Shareholders' equity was $35.9 million as of September 30, 2023. The reverse split aims to attract more investors and tighten the public float. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of LM Funding America, Inc.'s 1-for-6 reverse stock split is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at addressing the company's stock price in relation to NASDAQ's minimum bid price requirement. This action can be interpreted as a remedial step to prevent potential delisting, which could have severe repercussions on the company’s ability to attract investment and maintain shareholder value.From a financial perspective, the reverse split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, but it does adjust the share price upward, theoretically making the stock more appealing to institutional investors who may be prohibited from purchasing stocks below a certain threshold. Additionally, a higher per-share price may reduce volatility and improve the perception of the company's financial stability.However, investors should be cautious as reverse splits can sometimes be viewed as a red flag indicating underlying business challenges. It's essential to consider the context provided by the company's claim of strong business fundamentals and significant year-over-year revenue growth when assessing the potential impact of this reverse split on the stock's future performance. Market Research Analyst The reverse stock split by LM Funding America, Inc. could potentially tighten the public float—the number of shares available for trading. A reduced float often leads to less liquidity, which might increase the stock's bid-ask spread and could result in higher volatility. It's imperative to analyze how this strategic decision aligns with the company's reported growth and whether it aligns with broader market trends in the cryptocurrency mining and specialty finance sectors.Furthermore, the company's positioning in the market and its ability to execute its business model post-reverse split will be crucial in determining its attractiveness to the broader investor universe it seeks to tap into. The reverse split may be a short-term solution, but long-term value creation will depend on the company's operational performance and the viability of its business model in the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency mining and finance technology. Legal Expert LM Funding's reverse stock split follows a shareholder-approved amendment to the company's Certificate of Incorporation, showcasing a legal and procedural adherence to corporate governance practices. The reverse split is a legally sanctioned tool used by companies to manage their capital structure and stock price, reflecting a board's fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the company and its shareholders.Shareholders should note that while their pro-rata ownership remains unchanged, the implications of the reverse split, such as potential changes in liquidity and market perception, must be monitored closely. It's also important for shareholders to understand the legal processes and rights associated with such corporate actions, including the rounding up of fractional shares and the effects on individual holdings. 03/08/2024 - 08:30 AM TAMPA, FL , March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LM Funding America, Inc. (NASDAQ:LMFA) (""LM Funding"" or ""LMFA""), a cryptocurrency mining and technology-based specialty finance company, today announced a 1-for-6 reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock, effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern time on March 12, 2024. Beginning March 12, 2024, LM Funding’s common stock will trade on a split-adjusted basis. Bruce M. Rodgers, Chairman and CEO of LM Funding, stated, ""We believe that our business fundamentals are currently strong and that we continue to make good progress, as evidenced by our 1700% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. Notably, as previously reported, the stockholders’ equity of LM Funding was $35.9 million, or $2.45 per share (or $14.70 per share after giving effect to the reverse split announced today), as of September 30, 2023, and yet our current share price remains below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement of $1.00. We believe this share consolidation will not only ensure we meet the continued listing requirements, but also help us to attract a broader universe of investors, including institutional investors and retail brokers that encounter share price restrictions. Importantly, the pro-rata ownership of each shareholder will remain unchanged as a result of the reverse split, and we believe this share consolidation will tighten our public float and enhance our capital structure as we continue to execute on our business model.” At LM Funding’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”) held on November 9, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved a proposal to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of its common stock at a ratio within the range of one-for-two (1:2) to one-for-ten (1:10), as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. On February 23, 2024, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution approving and authorizing a 1-for-6 reverse split, and on March 7, 2024, LM Funding filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect the reverse stock split effective as of March 12, 2024. There will be no change to the total number of authorized shares of LM Funding Common Stock as set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended. LM Funding’s shares of common stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LMFA.” The new CUSIP number for the Company’s common stock post reverse stock split is 502074503. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split, every 6 shares of LM Funding’s issued and outstanding common stock will automatically be converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued. Any fraction of a share of common stock that would be created as a result of the reverse stock split be rounded up to the next whole share.

Records Fifth Consecutive Month of Net Take Rate Growth Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NaaS Technology Inc. achieves a positive NTR of 0.75% in February 2024, marking the fifth consecutive month of Net Take Rate growth. The company exhibits an 80% increase in charging volume in 2023, showcasing exceptional business expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The continuous growth in the Net Take Rate (NTR) for NaaS Technology Inc. is a strong indicator of the company's improving profitability within its interconnectivity services. An NTR that has progressed from negative to positive in just five months suggests a significant turnaround in the company's operational efficiency. The 80% increase in charging volume year-over-year is a testament to the growing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging services, which in turn reflects broader trends in the EV market. This growth in volume, coupled with a positive NTR, implies that NaaS is not only expanding its user base but also managing to monetize its services more effectively. The emphasis on operational excellence and customer loyalty programs appears to be translating into financial gains.However, the unaudited nature of this data warrants caution. Investors should be aware of the potential for adjustments that could affect the perceived performance. Moreover, while the positive NTR is a promising sign, it is still relatively modest at 0.75%. This figure should be contextualized within industry benchmarks for NTRs to fully assess the company's performance. The EV charging market is competitive and rapidly evolving and thus, continuous innovation and strategic partnerships will be crucial for NaaS to maintain and enhance its market position. Financial Analyst An NTR of 0.75% reflects a nuanced but positive shift in the financial dynamics of NaaS Technology Inc. It indicates that the company is successfully navigating the balance between attracting customers through incentives and generating revenue from its transactions. For shareholders, the trend towards a positive NTR is a potential indicator of value creation, as it suggests that the company's strategy to enhance profitability is bearing fruit. The interconnectivity services, which are crucial in an increasingly interconnected EV ecosystem, appear to be a growing revenue stream for NaaS.Investors should consider the implications of this growth trajectory on the company's long-term financial health and the stock's potential performance. The consistent increase in NTR may lead to improved margins and, consequently, could have a positive impact on the company's earnings per share (EPS). However, the focus should not solely be on NTR but also on the underlying drivers such as customer acquisition costs, the scalability of the charging network and capital expenditures required to sustain growth. A comprehensive financial analysis would require evaluating these factors in conjunction with the NTR to gauge the company's overall financial stability and growth prospects. EV Industry Expert The reported figures by NaaS Technology Inc. highlight significant trends within the electric vehicle (EV) charging industry. An 80% increase in charging volume indicates a rapidly growing user base, which aligns with global trends towards EV adoption. The company's ability to grow its NTR amidst this expansion is particularly noteworthy as it suggests an effective strategy in scaling operations while maintaining profitability. The positive network effect mentioned is crucial in the EV charging industry, where the value of the service increases as more users and charging stations are added to the network.However, the long-term success of NaaS will depend on its ability to maintain this growth in a sustainable manner, especially as the market becomes more competitive with new entrants and technological advancements. The company's commitment to operational excellence and customer loyalty is commendable, but the challenge will be in maintaining these standards as the network scales. Strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, as well as potential regulatory changes, could significantly impact the company's market position and should be monitored closely by industry stakeholders. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM Achieved a positive NTR of 0.75% in February 2024, records fifth consecutive month of Net Take Rate growth.Showcased exceptional business expansion with an 80% increase in charging volume in 2023.BEIJING, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NaaS Technology Inc.

Moreover, securing such a large-scale agreement would likely improve investor confidence in the company's business model and growth prospects.However, the extension also suggests that there may be complexities in finalizing the agreement, which could introduce some uncertainty. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as any further delays or a failure to secure the agreement could negatively impact the company's future earnings potential and stock price. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the announcement of an extended negotiation period could have mixed implications. While it does not directly affect the current financials, it is a forward-looking indicator. The potential 100MW agreement over 10 years is significant when considering the typical scale of datacenter contracts. It could represent a substantial portion of Applied Digital's future revenue and thus, greatly influence the company's valuation.Investors should consider the competitive landscape of the High-Performance Computing infrastructure market when evaluating the potential impact. If Applied Digital successfully closes the deal, it could position the company as a key player in the HPC space, which is seeing increasing demand due to the rise of big data, AI and cloud computing. Technology Infrastructure Expert The technical implications of a 100MW datacenter are significant, particularly in the High-Performance Computing sector, which demands robust and reliable infrastructure. The scale of such an operation would likely require Applied Digital to invest in cutting-edge cooling technologies, energy-efficient designs and potentially renewable energy sources to manage the environmental impact. This could set a precedent in the industry and possibly attract other clients looking for sustainable and high-capacity datacenter solutions.Moreover, the long-term nature of the agreement underscores the anchor tenant's confidence in Applied Digital's capability to deliver and maintain HPC infrastructure. If the company can leverage this to enhance its reputation, it could see benefits not just from this deal but also from increased marketability to potential clients in the future. 03/08/2024 - 08:05 AM DALLAS, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital Corporation (Nasdaq: APLD) (""Applied Digital"" or the ""Company""), a designer, builder, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure designed for High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) applications, announced today it has extended the original 45-day negotiation period announced in January on the conditional agreement with an anchor tenant to provide datacenter capacity at its Ellendale, North Dakota campus until March 30, 2024.

(NYSE: VVV), the quick, easy, trusted leader in preventive automotive maintenance, is working to redefine the vehicle care experience and excited to share important automotive preventive maintenance tips during Women's History Month. In research studies, women have expressed an uneasiness when approaching vehicle service and general dissatisfaction with a lack of accessible, straightforward maintenance knowledge in the broader automotive care industry. As women make up more than half of all drivers in the United States, Valvoline is taking steps to increase their vehicle care confidence. ""Many women worry they do not have enough familiarity with automotive care to make informed decisions on what their vehicle needs when they take it in to be serviced. In fact, at Valvoline, we have coined this as 'oil change-xiety' – that anxious feeling you get when your routine maintenance light comes on,"" said Laura Carpenter, Valvoline's Chief Customer Officer. ""We believe much of this feeling may stem from a lack of awareness about routine automotive care. Women's History Month is the perfect opportunity for our female technicians to help empower women, and all customers, with automotive preventive maintenance tips that we hope will ensure everyone can approach their vehicle care with confidence."" The three tips Valvoline is sharing throughout Women's History Month include: When It's Time to Change an Air Filter: Air filters get dirty and over time, a clogged air filter restricts air flow to the engine. This can result in poor acceleration and poor overall vehicle performance.When to Have Tires Rotated: Rotating tires isn't necessary with every oil change. However, regular tire rotations help keep tire tread even, which extends the life of tires.What a Fuel System Cleaning Is: A fuel system cleaning removes dirt and deposits that build up over time. Performing a fuel system cleaning according to a vehicle manufacturer's recommendation helps restore power and efficiency and can also improve fuel economy.""I have been in the automotive industry for more than 20 years,"" said Sandra Bonge, Market Manager of Valvoline's Dallas-Fort Worth and central Texas retail service centers. ""I have always loved working on vehicles, and I want all customers – especially women – to feel confident when they come into Valvoline for an oil change or any other routine maintenance, and know they can count on us for quick, easy and trusted service.""

The dividend is payable on April 30, 2024, to holders of record as of March 28, 2024.","Veralto Announces Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Veralto (VLTO) declares a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share, reinforcing its commitment to shareholders. The dividend is payable on April 30, 2024, to holders of record as of March 28, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share by Veralto is a direct indication of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate sufficient cash flow. Dividends are typically disbursed from the company's earnings and the ability to do so consistently can be viewed as a positive signal to investors regarding the company's profitability and stability. It's also important to consider the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the price per share. This figure helps investors understand the return on investment from dividends alone.Furthermore, the consistency and potential growth of dividends over time are key factors that income-focused investors look for. In the context of Veralto, stakeholders should assess the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A payout ratio that is too high could indicate that the company is not reinvesting enough back into its operations for future growth, while a ratio that is too low may suggest that the company is retaining more earnings for growth or that it is undervalued. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Veralto's announcement can have implications for investor sentiment and stock performance. Dividend announcements often influence a company's stock price as they can be interpreted as a sign of confidence by the board in the company's future earnings. Moreover, dividends can also attract a certain class of investors, particularly those seeking regular income streams, such as retirees.It's also relevant to analyze how Veralto's dividend compares with its peers within the water and product quality solutions industry. If the dividend is competitive, it may enhance the company's attractiveness in the eyes of potential investors. Additionally, the timing of the dividend payment close to the end of the fiscal quarter may have strategic implications, potentially affecting the stock's liquidity and volatility around the ex-dividend date when the stock price adjusts for the dividend payout. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM WALTHAM, Mass., March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Veralto (NYSE: VLTO), a global leader in essential water and product quality solutions dedicated to Safeguarding the World's Most Vital Resources™, announced today that its board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share of its common stock, payable on April 30, 2024 to holders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2024.

Dr. Kashif Latif, Principal Investigator, Medical Director, and practicing physician in Endocrinology from AM Diabetes & Endocrinology in Bartlett, TN, is scheduled to give an oral presentation on People Reported Outcomes (“PROs”) from the U.S. Eversense Post Approval Study on Saturday, March 09, 2024 at 11:30 CET at Fortezza da Basso, Hall D. “This study is the first real-world evaluation of how people using Eversense feel about their diabetes and how Eversense helps them manage their condition over two years of repeated sensor insertions and removals. We are pleased the data shows high satisfaction scores, improved diabetes distress scores, and no evidence that repeated insertions and removals impact satisfaction,” said Francine Kaufman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Senseonics. “As patients and providers consider the best options to help manage diabetes, presenting this additional compelling data continues to raise the awareness of the benefits of Eversense. We look forward to sharing the results with our colleagues at ATTD.” The Post Approval Study was a prospective, multicenter 2-year evaluation of Eversense CGM System use in adults 18 years of age and older with either type 1 or 2 diabetes (T1D or T2D). Participants were initially inserted with the 90-day Eversense CGM System and then transitioned to the 180-day Eversense E3 CGM System after approval in 2022, in accordance with labeling at the time over their 2 years of study participation. The DDS-17 (a questionnaire designed to measure four critical dimensions of distress with diabetes: emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress and physician distress) was administered to participants at the start of the study. Both the DDS-17 and CGM-Sat (a 44-item questionnaire designed to measure the impact of using CGM on diabetes management and family relationships regarding satisfaction with emotional, behavioral and cognitive effects of CGM use) were administered at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years by design. In the study, 273 study participants with a mean age of 57, 80% of whom were people with T1D, were enrolled between March of 2019 and February of 2022 across 16 clinical sites in the United States. About Eversense The Eversense® E3 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System is indicated for continually measuring glucose levels for up to 180 days in persons with diabetes age 18 and older. The system is indicated for use to replace fingerstick blood glucose (BG) measurements for diabetes treatment decisions. Fingerstick BG measurements are still required for calibration primarily one time a day after day 21, and when symptoms do not match CGM information or when taking medications of the tetracycline class. The sensor insertion and removal procedures are performed by a health care provider. The Eversense E3 CGM System is a prescription device; patients should talk to their health care provider to learn more.

Key highlights include completion of updated loan origination system, increased total collections by 9.3%, and a strategic partnership with Cox Automotive. Despite challenges in sales volumes, the company focuses on improving profitability and shareholder value. Positive Completion of updated loan origination system. Total revenue decreased by 7.9% to $299.6 million. Total collections increased by 9.3%. Allowance for credit loss adjusted to 25.74%. Net charge-offs decreased to 6.8% from 5.9%.

Focus on long-term profitability and shareholder value. Negative Sales volumes fell short of expectations. Loss per share increased significantly. Decrease in total revenue. Net charge-offs increased sequentially. Sales units decreased by 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter. Total credit application volume down by 8.3% year over year. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by America's Car-Mart indicate a revenue decline of 7.9% and a loss per share of $1.34, which contrasts with the diluted earnings per share from the same quarter last year. This performance could signal underlying challenges in the automotive retail sector, potentially due to economic pressures on consumers or increased competition. The decrease in retail units sold is a critical metric, as it directly impacts the company's top-line growth. Investors should consider the company's strategy to improve sales and whether it can effectively manage costs and navigate the macroeconomic environment.Moreover, the increase in total collections by 9.3% and the adjustment of the allowance for credit loss are positive signs of the company's ability to manage its credit risk. However, the rise in net charge-offs could be a concern, indicating that a higher percentage of finance receivables are being written off as uncollectible. This could affect future profitability and cash flow. The strategic partnership with Cox Automotive could offer new avenues for growth or operational efficiencies, which may be beneficial in the long term. Market Research Analyst The automotive retail industry is sensitive to economic cycles and America's Car-Mart's performance may reflect broader consumer sentiment and purchasing power. The decline in sales volume and reduced credit application volume suggest that consumers may be more cautious in their spending, possibly due to economic uncertainty or tighter credit conditions. The increase in the average retail sales price could also imply that the company is attempting to offset lower unit sales with higher margins per unit.It is also worth noting the implementation of an updated loan origination system (LOS), which could improve the efficiency and risk assessment of the company's financing operations. The initial results from the LOS could provide insights into its potential impact on future financial performance. The strategic partnership with Cox Automotive may also reflect an industry trend towards consolidation and collaboration to leverage shared resources and technology. Economist The financial results from America's Car-Mart can be interpreted within the context of the current economic landscape. A reduction in consumer spending on durable goods such as cars often precedes or accompanies broader economic slowdowns. The reported decline in unit sales and revenue, along with an increase in the allowance for credit losses, may suggest that consumers are facing financial constraints, potentially from rising interest rates or inflationary pressures.Furthermore, the strategic partnership with Cox Automotive could be seen as a strategic move to strengthen the company's competitive position in a challenging market. This partnership may enable Car-Mart to access more advanced technology and data analytics, which could lead to improved operational efficiency and better customer targeting. However, the success of such partnerships and technology implementations often depends on the execution and integration within the company's existing operations. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM ROGERS, Ark., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- America’s Car-Mart, Inc.

TOTAL REVENUE – A 7.9% drop in revenue was primarily driven by the decrease in retail units sold. Interest income contributed favorably and was up 16.0% year-over-year. A portion of the decline in revenue was masked by the average retail sales price being up 7.5%. SALES – Sales for the quarter were 11,664 units vs. 14,508 units, down 19.6% compared to the prior year quarter. Total credit application volume was down 8.3% year over year, which represented about half of the sales decline. Two fewer selling days during the quarter, and weather in January accounted for approximately 3-4% of the decrease in sales volume compared to the prior year quarter. GROSS PROFIT – Gross profit per unit was $7,043, compared to $6,373 for the prior year’s third quarter. This improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from better operational execution in pricing discipline and continued improvements on the cost of vehicle repairs. The Company experienced headwinds in gross profit related to lower prices in the wholesale market and an increased volume of wholesale vehicles related to the higher credit losses in the prior quarter. Despite these headwinds, gross profits per retail until sold were still up 10.5% year-over-year. NET CHARGE-OFFS – Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 6.8% compared to 5.9% during the prior year's third quarter. Sequentially, net charge-offs improved 40 basis points from 7.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a reference, the quarterly performance of net charge-offs for the five-year period preceding the pandemic have ranged from 5.9% - 8.7%, signaling a return to more normal pre-pandemic levels. Both the frequency and severity of losses played an equal part in overall net charge-offs performance for the quarter. Delinquencies (accounts 30 days or more past due) improved year over year by 40 basis points to 3.3% of finance receivables as of January 31, 2024, and sequentially by 30 basis points from 3.6% of finance receivables as of October 31, 2023. ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES – The Company decreased the allowance for credit loss as a percentage of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue and pending accident protection plan claims, from 26.04% at October 31, 2023 to 25.74% at January 31, 2024, providing a $3.9 million benefit to the provision for credit losses during the current quarter, resulting in a positive impact to basic earnings (loss) per share of $0.50. The key drivers of the adjustment were a lower overall inflationary outlook and lower delinquencies at quarter end. UNDERWRITING – A majority of sales originated during the quarter were through our new LOS. The Company continued to enhance and update processes within the system to attract higher down-payments, shorter terms, and a stronger consumer profile relative to its legacy system. The average originating term for the quarter was 43.3 months, down from the sequential quarter at 44.1 months. This was up from an average term of 42.5 months for the prior year's third quarter. SG&A EXPENSE – SG&A expense was $43.6 million compared to $44.7 million for the prior year quarter. This also delivered a $1.3 million benefit sequentially aided by the cost control activities implemented in the previous quarter. These actions assisted in bringing SG&A per average account down 6.7% ($421 compared to $451) compared to the prior year period. We continue to focus on expense management and the overall efficiency of the business. ACQUISITIONS – The Company completed the purchase of Central Auto Sales in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which was announced in December. We are actively working on other opportunities we expect to materialize during the calendar year. TRANSACTION – In February, the Company entered into a strategic partnership with Cox Automotive which is expected to drive better outcomes regarding vehicle acquisition, reconditioning, transportation, and remarketing activities. Cox Automotive is recognized as the world’s largest automotive services and technology provider. FINANCING – The Company paid off its April 2022 asset-backed non-recourse notes during the quarter. During the quarter, Kroll Bond Rating Agency upgraded the rating on all notes from our 2023-1 issuance. Lastly, we completed our fourth asset-backed non-recourse term securitization on January 31, 2024, issuing $250 million in bonds with a weighted average fixed coupon rate of 9.5%. The net proceeds were used to pay outstanding debt and make the initial deposits into the related collection and reserve accounts to benefit the noteholders. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company renewed and extended its revolving credit agreement to September 2025 with a total commitment of $340 million with a group of seven banks. CASH-ON-CASH RETURNS – The Company continues to originate finance receivable pools with attractive cash-on-cash returns. The following table provides details regarding the cash-on-cash returns for our existing loan pools: Cash-on-Cash Returns1 Loan Origination YearPrior ProjectedCurrent Projected/ActualVarianceProjected IRR2% of A/R RemainingFY2017*61.0%*63.3%0.0%FY2018*67.6%*67.4%0.0%FY2019*69.9%*69.2%0.1%FY2020*74.0%*66.4%0.4%FY202175.0%73.6%-1.4%56.4%4.7%FY202261.0%58.3%-2.7%41.1%19.8%FY202356.7%55.0%-1.7%36.2%43.9%FY202459.5%61.3%1.8%37.2%80.4% * 2017 -2020 Pools' Current Projection reflects actual cash-on-cash returns 1 ""Cash-on-cash returns"" represent the return on cash invested by the Company in the vehicle finance loans the Company originates and is calculated with respect to a pool of loans (or finance receivables) by dividing total “cash in” less “cash out” by total “cash out” with respect to such pool. “Cash in” represents the total cash the Company expects to collect on the pool of finance receivables, including credit losses. This includes down-payments, principal and interest collected (including special and seasonal payments) and the fair market value of repossessed vehicles, if applicable. “Cash out” includes purchase price paid by the Company to acquire the vehicle (including reconditioning and transportation costs), and all other post-sale expenses as well as expenses related to our ancillary products. The calculation assumes estimates on expected credit losses net of fair market value of repossessed vehicles and the related timing of such losses as well as post sales repair expenses and special payments. The Company evaluates and updates expected credit losses quarterly. The credit quality of each pool is monitored and compared to prior and initial forecasts and is reflected in our on-going internal cash-on-cash projections.

(SPLP) reported fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results with revenue totaling $466.9 million and $1.9 billion, respectively. Net income for the quarter was $42.7 million, and $154.0 million for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.4 million for the quarter and $240.6 million for the year. The company's net cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million for the quarter and $21.2 million for the year. Total debt stood at $191.4 million, with net cash totaling $56.4 million. Positive Strong revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Net income for the quarter and year remained positive, although showing a decrease from the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA increased in both the quarter and year, indicating improved operational efficiency. The company maintained a healthy net cash position and liquidity. Total debt increased slightly compared to the previous year. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Steel Partners Holdings L.P. (SPLP) for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 indicate a mixed financial performance. While the company's annual revenue grew by 12.4% to $1.9 billion, there was a notable decrease in net income from $206.2 million in 2022 to $154.0 million in 2023. This decline in profitability could be attributed to lower realized and unrealized gains on securities and the absence of a significant one-time gain from a divestiture that occurred in the previous year. The Adjusted EBITDA margin slightly decreased from 13.5% to 12.6%, suggesting a potential pressure on operational efficiency.From a liquidity perspective, SPLP appears to be in a strong position with an increase in net cash position, signaling an improved balance sheet strength. However, the modest increase in total debt and total leverage ratio from 1.4x to 1.5x could be a point of interest for stakeholders, indicating a slight uptick in financial leverage. Overall, these results could influence investor sentiment and stock performance, with particular attention to how SPLP manages operational costs and capitalizes on revenue growth to improve net income in future quarters. Market Research Analyst Steel Partners Holdings L.P. has reported a significant increase in revenue, particularly in the Financial Services and Supply Chain segments. This growth suggests successful expansion efforts and potential market share gains in these industries. However, the decline in sales from the Diversified Industrial and Energy segments could raise concerns about the company's competitive position and market dynamics in these areas.The adjusted free cash flow increase to $236.0 million from $146.3 million represents a strong cash generation capability, which is crucial for future investments and shareholder returns. The company's strategic focus on high-performing segments and the management's ability to navigate the challenges in less performing segments will be critical in sustaining growth and profitability. Stakeholders may also consider the company's capital expenditure, which is relatively stable, indicating ongoing investments to maintain and grow the business without overspending. Legal Expert Steel Partners Holdings L.P.'s financial report includes a discussion on income taxes and the impact of tax-deferred transactions and valuation allowances on the company's deferred tax assets. The significantly lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, could reflect strategic tax planning and internal restructuring. It is important for investors to understand the potential volatility in tax provisions and the impact of tax strategies on the company's financial position.Additionally, the report mentions asset impairment charges related to idle machinery and equipment, which underscores the importance of monitoring asset utilization and the potential need for restructuring operations to optimize asset performance. These factors can have implications for the company's long-term financial health and should be considered when assessing SPLP's investment potential. 03/08/2024 - 08:11 AM Fourth Quarter 2023 Results Revenue totaled $466.9 million Net income was $42.7 million Net income attributable to common unitholders was $41.3 million, or $1.75 per diluted common unit Adjusted EBITDA* totaled $59.4 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin* was 12.7% Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.5 million Adjusted free cash flow* totaled $87.6 million Total debt was $191.4 million; net cash,* which also includes our pension and preferred unit liabilities, less cash and investments, totaled $56.4 million Full Year 2023 Results Revenue totaled $1.9 billion Net income was $154.0 million Net income attributable to common unitholders was $150.8 million, or $6.43 per diluted common unit Adjusted EBITDA* totaled to $240.6 million; Adjusted EBITDA margin* was 12.6% Net cash provided by operating activities was $21.2 million Adjusted free cash flow* totaled $236.0 million NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Steel Partners Holdings L.P.

The increase was driven primarily by favorable impact of the recently added Supply Chain segment and higher revenue for the Financial Services segment, partially offset by lower sales from the Diversified Industrial segment and lower revenue from the Energy segment. Revenue in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $210.0 million, or 12.4%, as compared to 2022, as a result of higher revenue from the Financial Services segment and favorable impact of the recently added Supply Chain segment, partially offset by lower sales from the Diversified Industrial segment and lower revenue from the Energy segment. Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $2.7 million, or 1.0%, as compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to the recently added Supply Chain segment, partially offset by lower revenue for the Diversified Industrial and Energy segments, discussed above. Cost of goods sold in the year ended December 31, 2023 increased $6.1 million, or 0.6%, as compared to 2022, resulting from the recently added Supply Chain segment, partially offset by lower revenue for the Diversified Industrial and Energy segments discussed above. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A"") for the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased $25.9 million, or 25.2%, as compared to the same period last year. The SG&A increase was primarily driven by: (1) $18.1 million increase in the Financial Services segment primarily due to higher credit performance fees due to higher credit risk transfer (""CRT"") balances and higher personnel expenses related to incremental headcount and (2) $9.3 million for the recently added Supply Chain segment. The increases were partially offset by $3.7 million lower Corporate SG&A expenses primarily due to lower legal expenses as compared to the last year period. SG&A in 2023 increased $121.6 million, or 31.7%, as compared to 2022. The SG&A increase was primarily driven by: (1) $86.8 million increase in the Financial Services segment primarily due to higher credit performance fees due to higher CRT balances and higher personnel expenses related to incremental headcount, (2) $25.2 million increase for the Supply Chain segment, and (3) $24.1 million increase for the Diversified Industrial segment primarily due to net pension expense, despite the impact of the divestiture of the SLPE business of $5.0 million. These increases were partially offset by lower Corporate SG&A expenses of $15.4 million due primarily to lower legal fees as compared to the last year period. Asset Impairment Charges The Company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These charges were primarily related to idle machinery and equipment from the Diversified Industrial segment. The Company recorded asset impairment charges of $0.9 million and $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The 2023 charges were primarily driven by idle machinery and equipment associated with the Building Materials and Electrical Products business units within the Diversified Industrial segment. The 2022 charges were primarily related to the implementation costs of an ERP project associated with the Kasco business within the Diversified Industrial segment. Interest Expense Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $18.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively. The lower interest expense for the three months and the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to lower average debt levels, partially offset by higher average interest rates. Realized and Unrealized Gains on Securities, Net The Company recorded gains of $0.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $57.4 million in 2022, and gains of $7.1 million and $34.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The changes in realized and unrealized gains on securities, net over the respective periods are primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on the Company's portfolio of securities. All Other Expenses, Net All other expense, net totaled $27.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The incremental all other expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher finance interest expense of $16.6 million, partially offset by lower provisions for credit losses of $7.6 million related to the Financial Service segment, as compared to 2022. All other expense, net totaled $124.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The incremental all other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to higher finance interest expense of $63.5 million and higher provisions for credit losses of $28.6 million related to the Financial Service segment, as compared to 2022. Income Taxes The Company recorded income tax provisions of $0.03 million and $17.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is primarily due to a decrease in U.S. tax expense related to unrealized gains on investment from related parties which are eliminated for financial statement purposes, as well as the partial release of valuation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets. For the year ended December 31, 2023, a tax benefit of $1.7 million was recorded, as compared to a tax provision of $73.9 million in 2022. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a benefit of 1.0% as compared to a provision of 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to certain tax-deferred transactions associated with internal restructurings undertaken by the Company and the partial release of valuation allowances on the Company's deferred tax assets, partially offset by increased state and foreign income taxes associated with the Company's operations. As a limited partnership, we are generally not responsible for federal and state income taxes, and our profits and losses are passed directly to our limited partners for inclusion in their respective income tax returns. The Company's tax provision represents the income tax expense or benefit of its consolidated corporate subsidiaries.

Net Income Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $42.7 million, as compared to $73.1 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to lower realized and unrealized gains on securities, net, partially offset by higher income from the Financial Service segment resulting from higher revenue and favorable impact of added Supply Chain segment, as well as lower income tax expense. See above explanations for further details. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $154.0 million, as compared to $206.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $85.7 million in 2022, primarily related to the divestiture of the SLPE business from the Diversified Industrial segment and lower realized and unrealized gains on securities, net, partially offset by higher income from the Financial Services segment resulting from higher revenue and favorable impact of the recently added Supply Chain segment, as well as lower income tax expense. See above explanations for further details.

Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 12.7% in the quarter from 10.6% in the three months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the higher revenue impact of the Financial Services segment, favorable impact from the newly acquired Supply Chain segment, and lower SG&A costs from Corporate as compared to the same period of 2022. Adjusted free cash flow was $87.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $30.3 million for the same period in 2022.

Adjusted free cash flow was $236.0 million, as compared to $146.3 million for the same period in 2022.

Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measurements The financial data contained in this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measurements as defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC,""), including ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" ""Net Cash (Debt)"" and ""Adjusted Free Cash Flow."" The Company is presenting these non-GAAP financial measurements because it believes that these measures provide useful information to investors about the Company's business and its financial condition. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors because they are measures used by the Company's Board of Directors and management to evaluate its ongoing business, including in internal management reporting, budgeting and forecasting processes, in comparing operating results across the business, as internal profitability measures, as components in assessing liquidity and evaluating the ability and the desirability of making capital expenditures and significant acquisitions, and as elements in determining executive compensation. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss from continuing operations before the effects of income or loss from investments in associated companies and other investments held at fair value, interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash pension expense or income, and realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments, and excludes certain non-recurring and non-cash items. The Company defines Net Cash (Debt) as the sum of total debt, loan guarantee liability, accrued pension liabilities and preferred unit liability, less the sum of cash and cash equivalents (excluding those used in WebBank's banking operations), marketable securities, and long-term investments. The Company defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or used in operating activities of continuing operations less the sum of purchases of property, plant and equipment, and net increases or decreases in loans held for sale. However, the measures are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""U.S. GAAP""), and the items excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Therefore, these non-GAAP financial measurements should not be considered substitutes for net income or loss, total debt, or cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Because Adjusted EBITDA is calculated before recurring cash charges, including realized losses on investments, interest expense, and taxes, and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business, it should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business. There are a number of material limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool, including the following: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's tax provision or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or loss from the Company's investments in associated companies and other investments held at fair value; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's interest expense; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses in the period recorded, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the cash requirements for such replacement; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's net realized and unrealized gains and losses on its investments; Adjusted EBITDA does not include non-cash charges for pension expense and equity-based compensation; Adjusted EBITDA does not include amounts related to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities; Adjusted EBITDA does not include certain other non-recurring and non-cash items; and Adjusted EBITDA does not include the Company's discontinued operations. In addition, Net Cash (Debt) assumes the Company's cash and cash equivalents (excluding those used in WebBank's banking operations), marketable securities, and long-term investments are immediately convertible in cash and can be used to reduce outstanding debt without restriction at their recorded fair value, while Adjusted Free Cash Flow excludes net increases or decreases in loans held for sale, which can vary significantly from period-to-period since these loans are typically sold after origination and thus represent a significant component in WebBank's operating cash flow requirements. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its U.S. GAAP financial measures and using these measures only as supplemental information. The Company believes that consideration of Adjusted EBITDA, Net Cash (Debt), and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, together with a careful review of its U.S. GAAP financial measures, is a well-informed method of analyzing SPLP. Because Adjusted EBITDA, Net Cash (Debt), and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not measurements determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA, Net Cash (Debt), and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Despite challenges in the floorcovering industry, Dixie Group is optimistic about growth initiatives and market share gains. Positive The Dixie Group, Inc. reported an operating income of $5.0 million for 2023. Gross profit margin improved to 26.7% in 2023 from 17.7% in 2022. Net sales for the year were $276.3 million, down 9% year over year. The Company reduced costs by $35 million in 2023 and plans to cut $10 million more in 2024. Dixie Group aims to start extruding nylon in 2024 to lower costs and mitigate raw material disruptions. Negative Net sales for the year 2023 decreased by 9% compared to 2022. The Company's net loss in 2023 was $2.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Interest expense increased to $7.2 million in 2023 from $5.3 million in 2022 due to higher comparative interest rates. Financial Analyst Examining The Dixie Group's financial results reveals a notable improvement in operating income, transitioning from a significant loss in the previous year to a positive figure in 2023. This indicates a successful turnaround in operations, likely driven by strategic cost reductions and efficiency improvements. The increase in gross profit margin by nine percentage points is particularly impressive, signifying enhanced profitability per unit of sales. This could be attributed to the company's consolidation efforts and a decrease in raw material costs.However, the reduction in net sales by 9% year over year, even when adjusted for the extra week in 2022, suggests that the company is not immune to broader economic pressures, such as high interest rates affecting the housing and remodeling markets. The company's ability to reduce debt by 16.9% and its successful sale and leaseback transaction are positive indicators of financial stability and liquidity management. These actions, coupled with a reported alignment of order entries with the previous year, may reassure investors of the company's resilience and potential for sustained performance amidst economic challenges. Market Research Analyst The Dixie Group's performance in the context of the floorcovering industry indicates a strategic gain in market share despite a general downturn in the industry. This could reflect the company's competitive positioning and the effectiveness of its growth initiatives, such as new product launches and brand marketing campaigns. The mention of operational improvements and planned cost reductions for 2024 suggests a proactive approach to maintaining competitiveness.Investing in extrusion capabilities for nylon production is a strategic move that may reduce reliance on external suppliers and mitigate future raw material disruptions. This vertical integration could lead to further cost savings and supply chain stability, which are crucial in an industry susceptible to fluctuations in raw material availability and pricing. Economist The Dixie Group's financial results must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. High interest rates have a dual impact on the floorcovering industry: they reduce consumer spending on housing and remodeling and they increase the cost of borrowing for companies. The Dixie Group's ability to improve gross margins despite these headwinds is commendable. However, the increase in interest expense reflects the challenging interest rate environment.While the company has managed to decrease its debt levels, the economic outlook will continue to play a significant role in its operational success. The resilience shown by The Dixie Group in terms of gross profit margin improvement and debt reduction may position it favorably for when the economic environment improves, potentially leading to an upturn in consumer spending and industry sales. 03/08/2024 - 08:10 AM DALTON, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / The Dixie Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXYN) today reported financial results for the year ended December 30, 2023.The Company announced an operating income of $5.0 million for fiscal year 2023Gross profit margin in the fiscal year 2023 was 26.7% compared to 17.7% in the fiscal year 2022Year over year net sales in the fourth quarter were up 1.8% on an average weekly basisFor the year 2023, net sales for the Company were $276,343,000 as compared to $303,570,000 for the fiscal year 2022. Fiscal year 2023 included 52 weeks as compared to the fiscal year 2022 at 53 weeks. On an average weekly basis, sales in 2023 were $5,314,000 per a week compared to $5,728,000 per a week in 2022. The operating income on the year was $5,048,000 compared to an operating loss of $28,156,000 in the prior year. The net loss from continuing operations on the year was $1,952,000 in 2023, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $33,415,000, or $2.21 per diluted share, in 2022. The net loss on the year was $2,718,000, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $35,079,000, or $2.32 per diluted share, in 2022.In the fourth quarter of 2023, net sales were $66,674,000 compared to $70,535,000 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. On an average weekly basis, sales averaged $5,129,000 over the 13 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to an average of $5,038,000 over the 14 weeks in the fourth quarter of 2022. The net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3,160,000 with an income of $3,430,000 from continuing operations. This compares to a loss of $18,455,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022 with a loss of $17,681,000 from continuing operations.Commenting on the results, Daniel K. Frierson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Adjusted for the additional week in our prior fiscal year, weekly sales in the fourth quarter were approximately 2% better in 2023 as compared to 2022. Net sales for the year 2023 were down 9.0% over prior year, but were down 7.2% on an adjusted weekly basis. The lower net sales amount was the result of a slowdown in the floorcovering industry driven by high interest rates which have dramatically impacted the housing and residential remodeling markets. We believe the overall flooring industry experienced a significantly higher reduction in year over year sales volume, indicating we are continuing to gain market share in our core markets.During 2023, we were able to reduce costs over $35 million and we have a plan to further reduce costs in 2024 by $10 million. Our gross margins in the fiscal year 2023 improved by nine percentage points to 26.7% of net sales as compared to 17.7% of net sales in the fiscal year of 2022. This significant improvement to gross margins in 2023 is, in part, the result of our cost reductions and plant consolidation efforts that were substantially complete in the first quarter of the year. The facility consolidations have better aligned production with demand and lowered costs through more efficient absorption of fixed costs and headcount reductions and we have experienced operational improvements in our manufacturing facilities.As part of our 2024 cost improvement initiatives, and in order to better position our company strategically, we will start operations on our own extrusion of nylon in the first quarter of 2024. This action will moderate the impact of any disruptions of raw materials in the future and lower our costs.In addition to lowering costs and improving operations throughout 2023, we also continued to invest in our growth initiatives which have enabled us to gain market share. As we enter 2024, we are pleased with the growth we are seeing from our key growth initiatives and the resilience of our nylon carpet category. We have new product launches planned in each product segment, and we will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of our Fabrica brand with a strong marketing and promotional campaign. Our early 2024 market season has been very good with strong levels of attendance and great reception to our new products.Throughout 2023, we took numerous actions to drive sales and improve our operations while continuing to invest in our future through growth initiatives and extrusion capabilities. We believe the actions we have taken have better prepared us for the current difficult economic environment and have positioned us for the eventual upturn which we will inevitably experience. To date, for the first quarter of 2024, order entry is closely in line with orders in the same period a year ago."" Frierson concluded.The Company's fiscal year 2023 consisted of 52 weeks as compared to fiscal year 2022 consisting of 53 weeks. Net sales in fiscal year 2023 were $276.3 million as compared to $303.6 million in 2022, or a year over year reduction of 9%. On an average weekly basis, net sales decreased by 7.2%.The gross margin in 2023 was 26.7% as compared to 17.7% in the fiscal year 2022. The gross margin in 2022 was negatively impacted by our former primary raw material provider's decision to exit the business. The change in raw materials resulted in higher manufacturing costs and inefficiencies related to product development and testing in 2022. In 2023, we experienced significant improvement in gross margins as the result of lower raw material costs and favorable operating results primarily due to our facilities consolidation efforts that were substantially completed in the first quarter of this year. Gross margins in the fourth quarter of 2023 were 27.0%, or 13 percentage points higher than the gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 at 14.0%. Selling and administrative costs for the fiscal year were lower by $2.8 million or 3.7% lower in 2023 as compared to 2022 primarily due to lower sample costs in 2023.The Company's net receivables decreased $1.3 million from the balance at fiscal year end 2022 primarily due to more favorable timing of customer payments in 2023. Net inventories decreased $7.5 million or 8.9% from the fiscal year end 2022 due to lower costs and lower planned inventory volume. The total balances in accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by $1.3 million over prior year end primarily driven by lower year over year costs. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $1 million compared to $4.6 million in 2022. Interest expense was $7.2 million in the fiscal year 2023 compared to $5.3 million in the prior fiscal year. Higher comparative interest rates in the current year drove the increase in interest expense. The debt level at the end of 2023 was $82.5 million or a 16.9% decrease compared to the year end 2022 at $99.3 million. Our availability under our line of credit with our senior lending facility was $14.1 million at December 30, 2023.In December of 2023, the Company completed a sale and leaseback of its distribution facility in Adairsville, Georgia. The sale resulted in a gain of over $8 million and a reduction of the Company's existing debt of approximately $16 million.This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Sabre Announces Exchange of Approximately $43.6 Million of Existing Senior Secured Notes due in 2025 for Additional 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2027,2024-03-08T13:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Sabre Corporation's subsidiary, Sabre GLBL Inc., exchanged $36.2 million of existing notes for $50.1 million of new notes and $256,000 in cash.

The 2027 Notes issued in the exchange total $903.1 million and bear interest at 8.625% until maturity in 2027. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The exchange of different tranches of senior secured notes by Sabre GLBL, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sabre Corporation, indicates a strategic debt restructuring effort. By consolidating its 2025 notes into the newly issued 2027 notes, Sabre GLBL may be aiming to streamline its debt profile and extend its debt maturities, which can alleviate short-term liquidity pressures and potentially improve its credit ratings. The exchange also suggests that Sabre GLBL is taking advantage of investor demand for higher-yielding debt, given the higher interest rate of the 2027 notes compared to one tranche of the existing notes.From a financial perspective, the lack of cash proceeds from the issuance indicates that this transaction is purely a debt-for-debt swap, which is often used to manage and optimize a company's capital structure. The addition of cash to cover accrued interest is a standard practice in such exchanges. Investors and analysts should monitor Sabre GLBL's future interest expenses and debt service capabilities, as the higher interest-bearing 2027 notes could impact the company's financial statements, particularly its income statement and cash flow statements. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of this transaction are evident in the use of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, which allows for the sale of privately placed securities to qualified institutional buyers. This facilitates faster and more efficient transactions without the need for public registration. The exchange agreements with institutional accredited investors and non-U.S. persons indicate Sabre GLBL's compliance with international and domestic regulations governing securities.Additionally, the fact that the 2027 notes are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all assets of Sabre GLBL and its guarantors underscores the strong creditor protection measures in place. This could be appealing to risk-averse investors and might provide Sabre GLBL with more favorable borrowing terms in the future. The joint and several guarantees by Sabre Holdings Corporation and Sabre GLBL's restricted subsidiaries further strengthen the creditworthiness of the 2027 notes. Market Research Analyst The issuance of the additional 2027 notes by Sabre GLBL reflects broader market trends where companies with substantial debt are looking to refinance at potentially lower rates or push out maturities to manage their debt obligations effectively. The interest rate of 8.625% on the 2027 notes is indicative of the current credit market conditions and investor appetite for higher yields amid a potentially rising interest rate environment.Investors should consider the overall industry landscape, as companies like Sabre may face increased competition and market volatility, which could affect their ability to service debt. Furthermore, the redemption option starting in 2025 at a premium suggests that Sabre GLBL is confident in its future cash flows, allowing it to potentially retire debt ahead of schedule if conditions are favorable. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM SOUTHLAKE, Texas, March 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ: SABR) (""Sabre"") today announced that Sabre GLBL Inc.

(DMTK) presents groundbreaking research at the 2024 AAD Annual Meeting, showcasing the ability of non-invasive gene expression analyses to rule out melanoma in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI and detecting somatic mutations in healthy-appearing sun-exposed skin as an indicator of increased skin cancer risk. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The research presented by DermTech at the AAD meeting regarding non-invasive gene expression analyses for melanoma detection in patients with darker skin types is a significant advancement in dermatology. The high negative predictive value (NPV) exceeding 99% for both Fitzpatrick skin type groups indicates a reliable method for ruling out melanoma, which is paramount since early detection is critical for patient prognosis. The efficacy of the DermTech Melanoma Test (DMT) across all skin types could potentially reduce disparities in melanoma outcomes, as darker-skinned individuals often face later diagnoses due to diagnostic challenges. The clinical implications of this are substantial, as it suggests that the DMT could be integrated into routine screenings, particularly for high-risk populations, potentially leading to earlier interventions and better survival rates. Genetic Research Scientist The second study on somatic mutations in healthy-appearing sun-exposed skin represents a breakthrough in understanding skin cancer risk. By identifying genetic alterations at known cancer-associated hotspots such as TP53 and NOTCH1, the DNA-SCAR model provides a novel approach to assessing individual skin cancer risk beyond traditional clinical variables. This could revolutionize how we predict and prevent skin cancer, especially in populations with significant sun exposure. The ability to non-invasively assess genetic markers for cancer risk has vast potential for personalized medicine, allowing for targeted surveillance and preventative strategies tailored to an individual's genetic risk profile. Market Research Analyst The implications of DermTech's research for the business landscape are notable. The precision dermatology sector is poised for growth and DermTech's innovative non-invasive testing could capture a significant market share. As the demand for personalized medicine and non-invasive diagnostics increases, DermTech's technology aligns well with these trends. The potential for the DMT to be adopted as a standard of care for melanoma screening could drive revenue growth and enhance the company's competitive edge. However, it is essential to monitor the adoption rate by clinicians and the possible integration of this technology into healthcare systems. The publication in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology further lends credibility to the research, which could positively influence investor perception and stock market performance, subject to peer review and clinical adoption. 03/08/2024 - 08:05 AM SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DermTech, Inc. (NASDAQ: DMTK) (DermTech or the Company), a leader in precision dermatology enabled by a non-invasive skin genomics technology, today announced the presentation of two research abstracts at the 2024 American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, taking place March 8th-12th in San Diego, California. The first research abstract, “Non-invasive gene expression analyses to rule out melanoma in patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI” will be presented March 9th at 8:45am PT by Maral K. Skelsey, MD, lead author and Clinical Professor of Dermatology at Georgetown University’s Medical School. In this research, the negative predictive value (NPV) for both Fitzpatrick skin type group I-III and Fitzpatrick skin type group IV-VI was greater than 99%, and the 95% confidence interval indicated that there was no significant difference between the skin phototype groups. “This real-world clinical study demonstrates that the DMT can help clinicians improve outcomes for cutaneous melanomas in patients of all skin types,” commented Dr. Skelsey. “This is especially important because ruling out melanoma in individuals with Fitzpatrick IV-VI skin types can be particularly challenging.” The second research abstract titled, “Skin cancer risk is increased by somatic mutations detected noninvasively in healthy-appearing sun-exposed skin” will be presented March 9th at 10:05am PT by lead author John Whitaker, Ph.D., Senior Director of Bioinformatics at DermTech. The research found that somatic mutations in healthy-appearing sun-exposed skin indicate an increased risk for skin cancer. Furthermore, these mutations capture skin cancer risk information that is not accounted for by other risk factors. A complete description of this research has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology and will be published on March 19th: (https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(24)00176-3/fulltext) This research study used non-invasively sampled DNA from healthy-appearing skin, in a reference cohort of 1,038 individuals, to measure the occurrence of somatic mutations at skin cancer-associated hotspots located within TP53 and NOTCH1. The number of detected mutations was combined with clinical variables known to be associated with skin cancer risk to create a skin cancer risk model (DNA-Skin Cancer Assessment of Risk, DNA-SCAR). DNA-SCAR’s risk calculation was validated by comparison to the U.S. population and was trained to predict personal history of skin cancer from age, family history, skin tone and mutation count.

The shares subject to the second award will vest in four annual 25% installments, provided that such vesting is contingent upon the conversion of the PIK Notes and will be delayed, as necessary, to prevent the aggregate number of vested shares from exceeding 10% of the total number of shares of common stock actually issued upon conversion of the PIK Notes.

(OCCI) reported a decrease in net investment income and core net investment income for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in interest income. However, the net asset value per common share increased to $7.68. The company declared monthly cash distributions and preferred stock dividends. The total fair value of the investment portfolio was $177.6 million, with a CLO equity cash flow yield of 20.12%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported decrease in net investment income (NII) and core net investment income (Core NII) for OFS Credit Company could signal a potential shift in the company's revenue-generating capabilities. The decline in interest income and total waterfall payments from CLO equity investments are indicative of a changing interest rate environment or alterations in the credit quality of underlying loans. Investors should consider the implications of these figures on the company's ability to sustain dividends and its overall financial health.Additionally, the increase in net asset value (NAV) per share suggests a positive revaluation of the company's assets or a reduction in liabilities. This could be seen as a favorable sign for shareholders, reflecting an increase in the intrinsic value of their investments. However, it is important to scrutinize the drivers of this NAV increase, particularly in the context of the company's portfolio yield and the broader market conditions. Market Research Analyst The investment portfolio's fair value as a percentage of amortized cost (78.8%) and the earned income yield of 14.81% are significant metrics for assessing the quality and performance of OFS Credit's CLO investments. These figures suggest a high-yield investment strategy, which may carry higher risk, especially in volatile credit markets. The portfolio's composition and changes in weighted-average effective yield can provide insights into the risk profile and interest rate sensitivity of the investments.Market trends such as tightening debt spread levels and fluctuations in collateral loan prices have direct impacts on the company's unrealized gains and losses. These market dynamics, coupled with the company's investment activities, should be thoroughly analyzed to understand their potential effects on future earnings and valuation. Legal Expert The Amended Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) offering shares at a 5% discount to market price could be an attractive option for shareholders, potentially leading to increased participation in the plan. It's important to consider the legal and regulatory implications of such changes, ensuring compliance with securities laws and regulations. The impact of this amendment on shareholder dilution and stock liquidity are also critical factors that must be evaluated.Furthermore, the company's adherence to disclosure requirements and the clarity of financial reporting, especially when presenting non-GAAP measures like Core NII, are essential for maintaining investor trust and avoiding legal scrutiny. Clear communication about the methodology behind these measures helps investors make informed decisions. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- OFS Credit Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: OCCI) (“OFS Credit,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), an investment company that primarily invests in collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity and debt securities, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS Net investment income (“NII”) of $4.6 million, or $0.29 per common share, for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. This compares to NII of $5.3 million, or $0.36 per common share, for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in net investment income per common share was primarily due to a decrease in interest income. See additional information under “Results of Operations” below. Core net investment income (“Core NII”)1 of $7.2 million, or $0.45 per common share, for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. This compares to Core NII of $9.1 million, or $0.62 per common share, for the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in Core NII was primarily due to a decrease in total waterfall payments from CLO equity investments of $1.3 million, to $8.8 million. Net asset value (“NAV”) per common share of $7.68 as of January 31, 2024, an increase of $0.13 from NAV of $7.55 as of October 31, 2023. During the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, the earned income yield of our investment portfolio at amortized cost was 14.81%. OTHER RECENT EVENTS As previously announced, on February 1, 2024, our board of directors (the “Board”) declared monthly cash distributions of $0.10 per common share for each of the three months in the quarter ending April 30, 2024.

See additional information under “Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income” below. MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY “We are pleased to announce an increase in our net asset value to $7.68 per common share as of January 31, 2024,” said Bilal Rashid, Chief Executive Officer. “We believe our long-dated and fixed-rate preferred stock financing, at below current market rates with a weighted average stated rate of 5.62%, affords us operational flexibility to create stockholder value in this interest rate environment.” PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES As of January 31, 2024, the total fair value of our investment portfolio was approximately $177.6 million, which was equal to approximately 78.8% of amortized cost. For the quarter ended January 31, 2024, our CLO equity cash flow yield was 20.12% based on amortized cost.

The decrease in interest income was primarily due to non-recurring interest income recognized upon the repayment of a loan accumulation facility during the prior quarter. Expenses During the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, total expenses increased by $0.1 million to $3.8 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional fees and other expenses, and partially offset by a decrease in incentive fees. Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) During the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, net gain on investments of $2.3 million was comprised of net unrealized appreciation of $4.2 million, partially offset by net realized losses of $1.9 million. Net unrealized appreciation of $4.2 million was primarily due to meaningful tightening in debt spread levels and an increase in underlying collateral loan prices during the quarter.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us, our current and prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs, and our assumptions. Words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “will,” “may,” “continue,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “targets,” “projects,” and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements, including those risks, uncertainties and factors referred to in documents that may be filed by OFS Credit from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), such as elevated interest and inflation rates, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the escalated armed conflict in the Middle East, instability in the U.S. and international banking systems, the risk of recession or a shutdown of U.S. government services and related market volatility, on our business, our portfolio companies, our industry and the global economy. Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and, as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this press release should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including Annual and Semi-Annual Reports on Form N-CSR and monthly portfolio investments reports filed on Form N-PORT for the third month of each of our fiscal quarters. Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income We provide information relating to Core NII (a non-GAAP measure) on a supplemental basis. This measure is not provided as a substitute for GAAP NII, but in addition to it. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even in the event of similar terms being utilized to identify such measures. Core NII represents GAAP NII adjusted for differences in applicable cash distributions received on our CLO equity investments relative to income recognized in accordance with GAAP. OFS Capital Management, LLC, our investment adviser, uses this information in its internal analysis of results and believes that this information may be informative in gauging the quality of the Company’s financial performance, identifying trends in its results, and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons. Income from investments in the “equity” class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method; this is based on an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows, at current amortized cost, including those CLO equity investments that have not made their inaugural distribution for the relevant period end. The result is an effective yield for the investment in which the respective investment’s cost basis is adjusted quarterly based on the difference between the actual cash received, or distributions entitled to be received, and the effective yield calculation. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by the Company during the period (referred to below as “CLO equity adjustments”). Furthermore, in order for the Company to continue to qualify for tax treatment as a regulated investment company, we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. Therefore, Core NII may provide a better indication of our estimated taxable income for a reporting period than GAAP NII; we can offer no assurance that will be the case, however, as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until our tax returns are prepared after the close of a fiscal year. We note that this non-GAAP measure may not serve as a useful indicator of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility, and, as such, our taxable income may differ materially from our Core NII. The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP NII to Core NII for the fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023 (unaudited): For the Fiscal Quarter Ended January 31, 2024 For the Fiscal Quarter Ended October 31, 2023 Amount Per Common Share Amount Amount Per Common Share Amount Net investment income $ 4,590,357 $ 0.29 $ 5,330,023 $ 0.36 CLO equity adjustments 2,649,680 0.16 3,798,856 0.26 Core NII $ 7,240,037 $ 0.45 $ 9,128,879 $ 0.62 OFS® and OFS Credit® are registered trademarks of Orchard First Source Asset Management, LLC OFS Capital Management™ is a trademark of Orchard First Source Asset Management, LLC.

Despite disappointing results, positive shifts were seen in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. The company is investing in innovation and relocating Milltronics to enhance customer service. Positive Positive shifts in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Investment in innovation and cutting-edge technology. Relocation of Milltronics for improved customer service. Increase in Asian Pacific sales by 39%. Orders in the Americas increased by 6%. Gross profit at 22% of sales. Effective tax rate decreased to 27%. Working capital increased to $196,281,000. Negative Net loss of $1,648,000 for Q1 2024. Sales decrease of 18% compared to the prior year. Decrease in European sales by 20%. Decrease in orders by 6%. Decrease in gross profit percentage due to lower sales volume. Increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $37,936,000. Financial Analyst The reported net loss of Hurco Companies, Inc. for the first fiscal quarter of 2024, juxtaposed with the net income from the previous year, represents a significant shift in the company's financial performance. A detailed examination of the financial statements would be imperative to discern the underlying factors contributing to this downturn. An 18% decline in sales and service fees is a substantial contraction, which could signal underlying market challenges or operational inefficiencies. The favorable currency impact, while providing some relief, does not offset the overall negative trend.Investors would be prudent to scrutinize the company's liquidity position, as indicated by the decrease in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in working capital suggests a potential buildup of inventory, which could either indicate anticipation of future sales growth or an inability to sell existing inventory. The effectiveness of Hurco's strategic decisions, such as the relocation of Milltronics and investments in AI for autonomous machining, will be critical in determining future performance and should be monitored closely. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the contrasting trends in geographic regions are noteworthy. The decrease in sales in the Americas and Europe could reflect regional economic factors or competitive pressures, while the growth in the Asian Pacific region suggests a stronger market presence or alignment with local demand. The reported increase in orders from the Americas and Asia Pacific indicates potential recovery or market share gains in these regions. However, the decline in European orders may be of concern, potentially indicating a loss of competitiveness or adverse market conditions in that region.Understanding industry-specific dynamics, such as the demand for high-performance VMX machines and lathes, is crucial to evaluate Hurco's product mix and strategic focus. The company's reliance on proprietary software and controls for its Hurco and Milltronics brands, contrasted with Takumi's third-party industrial controls, could impact its competitive edge and customer appeal. The company's strategic focus on innovation and technology, including AI and next-generation controls, aligns with industry trends towards automation and precision manufacturing. However, the effectiveness of these investments in driving sales and improving operational efficiency remains to be seen. Economist Examining Hurco's performance within the broader economic context, the industrial technology sector is often cyclical, with demand influenced by macroeconomic trends such as industrial production, capital expenditures and international trade. The current performance may reflect broader economic headwinds or sector-specific challenges. The company's international presence exposes it to varying economic conditions across different regions, as evidenced by the mixed regional sales performance.The reported decrease in the effective tax rate due to changes in the geographic mix of income and loss suggests tax optimization strategies and the impact of international operations on the financials. Investors should consider the potential for economic recovery in the global machine tool market, as referenced by the CEO, while also accounting for the risks associated with economic uncertainty and potential shifts in trade policies that could affect international sales and supply chains. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM INDIANAPOLIS, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hurco Companies, Inc. (Nasdaq: HURC) today reported results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024. Hurco recorded a net loss of $1,648,000, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to net income of $1,330,000, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023. Sales and service fees for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $45,059,000, a decrease of $9,623,000, or 18%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of $779,000, or 1%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Greg Volovic, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We were disappointed with first quarter results but are continuing to invest in the future growth of our business. I am particularly heartened by the positive shift we witnessed in both the Americas and the Asian Pacific regions this quarter. Seeing orders in these regions surpass sales and outpace prior year figures is a promising sign. I am hopeful this momentum will also extend into Europe as we get further into 2024. Meanwhile, our commitment to innovation remains unwavering. We are investing in cutting-edge technology, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to advance autonomous machining, continuing the development of next generation controls, and positioning our brands to support the ever-evolving needs of our customers. Finally, our decision to strategically relocate Milltronics to Indianapolis will lead to enhanced customer service and support by bringing our engineering expertise closer to our U.S. Milltronics customers, sales, and service teams. As always, we are keeping a keen eye on our liquidity position and balance sheet strength to capitalize on opportunities presented by the anticipated recovery in the global machine tool market.” The following table sets forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2024, and 2023 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended January 31 20242023$ Change% ChangeAmericas$16,650$22,013($5,363)(24)%Europe22,75028,592(5,842)(20)%Asia Pacific5,6594,0771,58239%Total$45,059$54,682($9,623)(18)% Sales in the Americas for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased by 24%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023, primarily due to a decreased volume of shipments of Hurco, Milltronics, and Takumi machines. The decrease in sales was mostly attributable to decreased shipments of VM and toolroom machines, as well as lathes. European sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased by 20%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023, and included a favorable currency impact of 3%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The decrease in European sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was primarily attributable to a decreased volume of shipments of higher performance Hurco VMX machines and lathes in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, a decreased volume of shipments of Milltronics machines in the European region, as well as a lower volume of sales of accessories manufactured by our wholly owned subsidiary, LCM Precision Technology S.r.l. (“LCM”). Asian Pacific sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased by 39%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 2%, when translating foreign sales to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The increase in Asian Pacific sales primarily resulted from a higher volume of shipments of Hurco and Takumi machines in China, India, and Taiwan. Orders for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $50,218,000, a decrease of $3,012,000, or 6%, compared to the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023, and included a favorable currency impact of $786,000, or 1%, when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars.

European orders for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 decreased by 21%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included a favorable currency impact of 3%, when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars. The decrease in orders was driven primarily by decreased customer demand for Hurco VM machines, higher-performance VMX machines, and lathes and Takumi machines in Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Asian Pacific orders for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 increased by 61%, compared to the corresponding prior year period, and included an unfavorable currency impact of 3%, when translating foreign orders to U.S. dollars. The increase in Asian Pacific orders was driven primarily by an increase in customer demand for Hurco and Takumi machines in China, India, and Taiwan. Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $9,695,000, or 22% of sales, compared to $12,718,000, or 23% of sales, for the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the lower volume of sales of vertical milling machines in the Americas and Europe where we typically sell more of our higher-performance VMX series machines and lathes. Additionally, gross profit was negatively impacted by the allocation of fixed costs on lower sales and production volumes. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $11,515,000, or 26% of sales, compared to $11,484,000, or 21% of sales, in the corresponding fiscal year 2023 period, and included an unfavorable currency impact of $168,000, when translating foreign expenses to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 due to the lower volume of sales year-over-year. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 27%, compared to 31% in the corresponding prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in geographic mix of income and loss that includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates and a discrete item related to stock compensation. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $37,936,000 at January 31, 2024, compared to $41,784,000 at October 31, 2023. Working capital was $196,281,000 at January 31, 2024, compared to $193,257,000 at October 31, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by increases in inventories, net and prepaid and other assets and decreases in accrued payroll and employee benefits and accounts payable, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable, net.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM HOUSTON, TX, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – SMG Industries Inc. (“SMG” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: SMGI), a growth-oriented transportation services company specializing in the full-service logistics market, today announced its strategic decision to voluntarily deregister its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). SMG’s management believes that “going dark” is a prudent step aligned with the Company’s short-term planning and long-term vision. By eliminating the Company’s Exchange Act reporting obligations, SMG aims to streamline its financial operations, reporting obligations, reducing administrative costs, and allowing the business to focus on core business activities. The Company believes this decision will allow the back office to operate more efficiently and allocate resources more effectively. With a more streamlined cost profile, SMG’s management will be better able to invest in its business and mitigate excessive costs around public reporting requirements, thus providing a future benefit to the Company’s stockholders. On or about March 15, 2024, the Company intends to file a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to voluntarily effect the deregistration of its common stock. The Company is eligible to deregister by filing a Form 15 because it has fewer than 300 holders of record of its common stock. Upon the filing of the Form 15, the Company’s obligation to file certain reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, will immediately be suspended. The Company expects the deregistration to become effective 90 days after filing the Form 15 with the SEC. “We remain committed to delivering value to our stockholders. Going dark allows us to focus on the operations of the business and reduce costs by an estimated $1,000,000 per year. Currently, we do not believe we are receiving meaningful benefits from being a public reporting company. We appreciate the continuing support of our stockholders and look forward to achieving our long-term vision including this short term plan,” stated Tim Barnhart, CFO. As a result of this decision, the Company’s common stock will be moved from the OTCQB to the Expert Market of the OTC Markets Group. The board of directors of SMG considered the fact that the Company’s common stock would become more illiquid as a result of this decision and that stockholders may experience difficulties in selling their shares of common stock. The decision to proceed, however, took into consideration the current as well as potential future costs of remaining a reporting company versus the benefits to the longer-term health and future of the Company. About SMG Industries Inc. SMG Industries Inc. is a growth-oriented transportation services company specializing in the full-service logistics market. As a family of transportation companies, SMG Industries offers comprehensive logistics solutions, serving as a single service provider for shipments of all sizes, both domestically and internationally.

(NASDAQ: ONTX) announced the presentation of preclinical studies at AACR 2024, focusing on characterizing rigosertib's mechanisms impacting cancer pathways. The studies highlighted rigosertib's impact on RAS-MAPK signaling, ROS-related proteins, and inflammation-related targets, potentially aiding in developing treatment regimens for challenging cancers. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The exploration of rigosertib's molecular targets presents a significant step in understanding its mechanism of action and potential synergies in cancer treatment. Rigosertib's influence on RAS-MAPK signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related proteins suggests a multi-faceted approach to oncogenesis inhibition. Particularly, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome could indicate a novel pathway for modulating the tumor microenvironment, potentially enhancing the efficacy of existing therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors.From a research perspective, the utilization of Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA-MS) is noteworthy. This methodology allows for the precise identification of drug targets within living cells, which is crucial for validating the direct effects of rigosertib on its targets. The findings from these preclinical studies could be pivotal in designing future clinical trials, especially in cancers where current treatments are inadequate. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the potential clinical implications of rigosertib's preclinical findings are of great interest. The focus on difficult-to-treat cancers is particularly relevant, as these conditions often have limited therapeutic options and poor prognoses. The modulation of RAS-MAPK signaling is a promising avenue, considering that abnormalities in this pathway are common in various malignancies and have been associated with resistance to therapy. Furthermore, the activation of JNK via ROS mediation and the subsequent reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment through NLRP3 could represent a novel approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity.Understanding the interplay between rigosertib and the inflammatory response is critical, as inflammation can either support or inhibit tumor growth. The evidence pointing to rigosertib's ability to activate inflammation-related targets suggests a potential dual role in both direct cancer cell inhibition and the modulation of immune responses within the tumor milieu. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the development of rigosertib could address a significant unmet need in the oncology sector. The ability to target cancers with limited treatment options could position Onconova Therapeutics favorably in the market. The preclinical success of rigosertib, especially if translated into clinical benefits, may lead to increased investor confidence and potentially enhance the company's valuation.Furthermore, the strategic presentation of these findings at a prominent conference such as the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting serves not only as a platform for scientific exchange but also as a signal to stakeholders of the company's commitment to advancing its pipeline. The focus on translational science underscores the company's dedication to bridging the gap between laboratory findings and clinical application, which is a key factor in attracting partnerships and funding. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM Translational science to characterize pathways impacted by rigosertib may help to guide future clinical studies and combination treatment regimen for difficult-to-treat cancersNEWTOWN, Pa., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ONTX), (“Onconova” or “the Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel products for patients with cancer, today announced that the Company will present an abstract related to preclinical studies conducted by the Company and its collaborators to further characterize the mechanism of rigosertib at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2024 (AACR 2024), taking place April 5-10, 2024 in San Diego, CA. “The ability to impact multiple targets is an important characteristic of Onconova’s two lead clinical programs, rigosertib and narazaciclib. We are pleased to present new preclinical studies that explore the molecular targets for rigosertib, in clinical development through a series of investigator initiated studies (IIS),” commented Steven Fruchtman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Onconova. “The studies provide additional prospective on the main cellular pathways impacted by rigosertib, including RAS-MAPK signaling and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related proteins. In addition, the studies highlight rigosertib’s impact on the tumor microenvironment through the activation of inflammation–related targets, such as an NLRP3. We hope to apply this translational science to help guide the clinical program to enable the potential use of rigosertib in difficult-to-treat cancers.” Poster Information:Poster Title:Rigosertib promotes anti-tumor activity of cancer cells via CETSA revealed novel targets and activates NLRP3-dependent inflammatory responses (2033/16)Session:Microenvironment, Immunity, and DNA Repair in Therapeutic Response (PO.ET05.02)Date/Time:Monday, April 8 9:00a-12:30p PT Brief Overview: Onconova and its collaborators conducted a series of biochemistry and molecular and cell biology assays to study rigosertib’s molecular and inflammation-based targets. The team used a specialized mass spectrometry assay (a Cellular Thermal shift Assay or CETSA-MS) as one of the tools to identify new targets which were then validated as novel targets of rigosertib. Conclusions: This work identified a series of cellular and inflammatory targets that may be affected by rigosertib. In particular, the research highlighted target activity through RAS-MAPK signaling, ROS-mediation JNK activation, and tumor microenvironment reprogramming through NLRP3 activation, which may contribute to preclinical and clinical synergistic effects with checkpoint inhibitors. The identification of these targets and signaling pathways may be helpful in the design of clinical trials to address difficult-to-treat cancers. About Onconova Therapeutics, Inc. Onconova Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel products for patients with cancer. The Company’s product candidates, narazaciclib and rigosertib, are proprietary targeted anti-cancer agents designed to disrupt specific cellular pathways that are important for cancer cell proliferation.

Negative Decrease in net income from continuing operations compared to the previous year Decrease in revenues from continuing operations for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year Financial Analyst The reported financials by SigmaTron International indicate a mixed performance with a modest revenue increase in the third quarter but a notable decline in net income and earnings per share. The decrease in net income from $2.7 million to $0.6 million and a sharp drop in earnings per share from $0.44 to $0.10 are significant indicators of reduced profitability. This could be attributed to changes in the company's cost structure or sales mix, which may have led to lower margins.The year-to-date figures underscore a more concerning trend with a 4 percent decline in revenue and a drastic reduction in net income from $8.9 million to $0.9 million, alongside a decline in earnings per share from $1.47 to $0.14. The reduction of inventory by $30 million could be a strategic move to improve working capital and manage expenses in response to the softening demand, which is a prudent step in uncertain economic conditions.Investors and stakeholders should consider the potential long-term benefits of the new projects that are expected to come to market in fiscal 2025. However, the immediate impact of these delayed projects may weigh on the company's short-term performance and stakeholders should be prepared for potential fluctuations in stock performance based on these results and future projections. Market Research Analyst The electronic manufacturing services (EMS) industry is sensitive to economic cycles and SigmaTron International's report of general softness from their customer base reflects broader economic uncertainties. The company's acknowledgment of a historically weak third quarter, coupled with the soft short-term backlog, suggests that industry demand is currently tepid. This has implications for other players in the EMS sector as well.Furthermore, the delay in new project launches, while not immediately beneficial to SigmaTron's performance, indicates a pipeline of potential growth. The EMS market is highly competitive and the ability to secure and launch new projects is critical for long-term success. SigmaTron's optimism for fiscal 2025 could be seen as a positive signal for the industry's growth trajectory, assuming these projects materialize as expected. Economist The financial results of SigmaTron International provide a microcosmic view of the broader economic environment. The company's experience of softness in the short-term backlog and general customer base softness could be symptomatic of wider economic headwinds. As an economist, analyzing these results in the context of the current economic cycle, it is essential to consider factors such as consumer spending, business investment and trade flows, which can all impact the EMS industry.The strategic decision to reduce inventory is consistent with a cautious approach in an uncertain economy. It suggests that SigmaTron is attempting to maintain flexibility and manage cash flow more effectively in anticipation of potential downturns. The company's performance and outlook could serve as an indicator for economic analysts monitoring the industrial sector's health and the economy's direction. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM ELK GROVE VILLAGE, Ill., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SigmaTron International, Inc.

For the third quarter ended January 31, 2023, net loss from discontinued operations was $25.8 million. For the nine months ended January 31, 2023, net loss from discontinued operations was $29.8 million. Diluted net loss per share from discontinued operations for the third quarter ended January 31, 2023 was $4.25 and was $4.91 for the nine month period ending January 31, 2023. Commenting on SigmaTron’s third quarter, fiscal 2024 results, Gary R. Fairhead, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, said “I’m pleased to report pre-tax profits of $676,742 for our third quarter of fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our second quarter press release, as we were heading into the quarter, our short-term backlog was soft and our third quarter historically is our weakest quarter. Accordingly, it was good to be profitable. We did see a modest increase in revenue compared to the third quarter of the prior year, but at lower margins. This is related to both mix and cost structure. As you can see, our year-to-date revenue is still running significantly behind the prior year. We are continuing to see that trend in the short-term. There is a general softness from our customer base overall. I think it reflects the uncertainty of the general economy overall and we will continue to manage expenses and working capital accordingly. The Company has reduced inventory by $30 million during the first nine months of our fiscal year. “In addition to the modest softness overall, several new projects have not come to market as anticipated. They all remain on track to launch but just further out. This should bode well for fiscal 2025 but short-term, they will not contribute to our performance. However, we remain optimistic about those projects as well as several new ones that are under discussion with our customers. “The report on the electronic component marketplace remains the same as the second quarter. There are still supply chain issues but there have been some modest improvements. The uncertainty related to the geopolitical situations as well as the upcoming elections have negatively affected the overall economy. We remain positive regarding the future but there will definitely be some short-term volatility for the next quarter or two.” About SigmaTron International, Inc.

Net loss of $10.0 million for the year, compared to a net income of $17.9 million in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. reflect a significant shift from a net income position in 2022 to a net loss in 2023. This change is primarily due to the absence of the large upfront payment received under the Viatris License Agreement in the previous year, which was a one-time event. The reported net loss of $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net income of $17.9 million in the prior year, is a considerable reversal, impacting earnings per share from a positive $0.90 to a negative ($0.46).The company's cash position of approximately $50.5 million, which is projected to fund operations into mid-2025, indicates a runway of about 1.5 years. This is a critical factor for investors as it suggests that, barring any additional financing or revenue-generating activities, the company may need to seek additional capital within that timeframe. The milestone payment of $10 million from Viatris, a result of FDA approval for RYZUMVI™, is a positive development; however, it's a non-recurring revenue source and therefore the sustainability of future revenues is uncertain.Investors should also consider the increase in general and administrative expenses, which rose significantly due to payroll, stock-based compensation and other related costs. While these increases are often seen in growing companies, they do contribute to the net loss and should be monitored for efficiency and alignment with the company's strategic goals. Medical Research Analyst Ocuphire's update on the clinical development of APX3330 for diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a pivotal aspect in evaluating the company's potential. DR is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness; thus, a successful treatment could address a large unmet medical need. The alignment with the FDA on the registrational primary endpoint for APX3330 and the submission of a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for Phase 3 trials are important steps toward potential commercialization. However, the market should note that clinical trials are inherently risky and the drug's market potential will only be realized upon successful completion of Phase 3 trials and subsequent FDA approval.Furthermore, the FDA's approval of RYZUMVI™ for the treatment of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis and the continued development of phentolamine ophthalmic solution (PS) for other indications, funded by Viatris, suggest a diversification of the company's portfolio. This could mitigate risk and offer multiple streams of potential future revenue, although the actual market impact of these products will depend on the outcomes of ongoing Phase 3 trials and market acceptance post-launch. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector, particularly in the field of ophthalmology, is highly competitive with a constant need for innovation and successful product development. Ocuphire's strategic focus on retinal and refractive eye disorders positions the company in a specialized market with significant growth potential. The successful launch of RYZUMVI™ in the first half of 2024 could provide an early revenue stream and validate Ocuphire's commercial capabilities.However, the company's long-term success hinges on the progression of its late-stage clinical programs, particularly APX3330. The market's response to Ocuphire's updates will likely be cautious optimism, tempered by the understanding that clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals are uncertain and can significantly influence the company's valuation and stock performance. Investors should monitor the company's ability to manage its cash burn rate, as well as the execution of its clinical and commercial strategies, which are critical for sustaining investor confidence. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich., March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: OCUP), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of retinal and refractive eye disorders, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “Ocuphire had a successful 2023, with notable achievements on the regulatory and development fronts, paving the way for further progress in the year ahead,” said George Magrath, M.D., M.B.A., M.S., CEO of Ocuphire. “Our strategic focus is on the advancement of our retina pipeline, and we are preparing our late-stage clinical program to progress APX3330 in diabetic retinopathy (“DR”). We believe APX3330 may represent a promising oral treatment option for delaying disease progression in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy who otherwise are monitored and untreated until they progress to sight-threatening disease.” Clinical and Regulatory Updates APX3330 In January 2023, Ocuphire reported top-line efficacy and safety results from the ZETA-1 Phase 2 trial conducted in 103 subjects with DR, including moderately severe and severe non-proliferative DR (“NPDR”) and mild proliferative DR (“PDR”), as well as patients with diabetic macular edema without loss of central vision. Trends toward efficacy were seen on the ≥3-step worsening on a binocular diabetic retinopathy severity scale (“DRSS”) Person Scale. APX3330 also demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability in diabetic patients.In October 2023, Ocuphire held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and aligned on the registrational primary endpoint of 3-step or more worsening on binocular DRSS Person scale.In February 2024, Ocuphire submitted a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) to seek agreement on the clinical trial protocol and statistical analysis plan for Phase 3. Specifics on the study design and the anticipated timing will be shared if and when an agreement is reached with the FDA. Phentolamine ophthalmic solution 0.75% (“PS”) In September 2023, Ocuphire and Viatris, Inc. (“Viatris”) announced FDA approval of PS under the brand name RYZUMVI™ for the treatment of pharmacologically-induced mydriasis. In 2023, the Company received a cash payment in the amount of $10 million from Viatris upon achieving this regulatory approval milestone in connection with its license agreement with Viatris. RYZUMVI is expected to launch in the first half of 2024.The Company received an agreement from the FDA under a SPA for the clinical trial protocol and planned statistical analysis of the LYNX-2 Phase 3 trial to evaluate PS for the proposed indication for the treatment of decreased visual acuity under dim (mesopic) light conditions after keratorefractive surgery. Viatris is expected to continue Phase 3 development of this indication in the first half of 2024.The VEGA-2 Phase 3 study achieved a primary endpoint in presbyopia. Viatris is expected to continue Phase 3 development in the first half 2024.Development of PS in treatment of presbyopia and in decreased visual acuity under dim (mesopic) light conditions after keratorefractive surgery is expected to be funded by Viatris, under terms of the license agreement with Viatris. Corporate Updates In August 2023, Ocuphire entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“LPC”), pursuant to which Ocuphire has the sole right, but not the obligation, to direct LPC to purchase up to $50 million of shares of our common stock.In November 2023, Ocuphire appointed George Magrath, M.D., M.B.A., M.S., as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors. Dr. Magrath succeeded Rick Rodgers, M.B.A., Interim Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Rodgers remains a member of the Board of Directors.In November 2023, Ocuphire appointed Joseph (Joe) K. Schachle, M.B.A., as Chief Operating Officer.In February 2024, Ocuphire appointed Nirav Jhaveri, C.F.A, M.B.A. as Chief Financial Officer and Ashwath (Ash) Jayagopal, Ph.D., M.B.A. as Chief Scientific and Development Officer. Financial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Ended December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2023, Ocuphire had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $50.5 million. Based on current projections, management believes the present cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into mid-2025. License and collaboration revenue was $1.7 million and $19.0 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $39.9 million for both the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. Revenue during 2023 was derived in part from a milestone payment of $10.0 million received from Viatris and attributed to the FDA’s approval of RYZUMVI for the treatment of pharmacologically induced mydriasis. The balance of the revenue recognized during calendar year 2023 related to the output of research and development services in connection with the Viatris License Agreement. Revenue during calendar year 2022 was derived from the Viatris License Agreement signed in the fourth quarter, and to a lesser extent, from the reimbursement by Viatris of research and development services. General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million and $12.0 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $2.1 million and $7.3 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. The increase year-over-year was attributed to payroll related costs, stock-based compensation, other personnel related costs, professional services fees, legal support, and business development activities and other costs. General and administrative expenses included $2.4 million and $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Research and development expenses were $3.8 million and $17.7 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $3.6 million and $14.4 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to increased clinical costs for PS, increased manufacturing and toxicology activities for APX3330 and PS, higher payroll costs including stock-based compensation, and other operating expenses. These were offset by a decrease in regulatory activities. Pursuant to the Viatris License Agreement, Ocuphire’s budgeted research and development expenses related to the development of PS are fully reimbursed by Viatris. Research and development expenses included $1.1 million and $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Net loss was $4.8 million (or ($0.21) per basic and diluted share) and $10.0 million (or ($0.46) per basic and diluted share), for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. This compared to net income of $33.9 million (or $1.63 per basic share and $1.58 per diluted share) and $17.9 million (or $0.90 per basic share and $0.87 per diluted share), for the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively. For further details on Ocuphire’s financial results, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). About Ocuphire Pharma Ocuphire is a clinical-stage ophthalmic biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small-molecule therapies for the treatment of retinal and refractive eye disorders. Ocuphire’s lead retinal product candidate, APX3330, is a small-molecule inhibitor of Ref-1 (reduction oxidation effector factor-1 protein). Ref-1 is a regulator of the transcription factors HIF-1α and NF-κB. Inhibiting REF-1 reduces levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (“VEGF”) and inflammatory cytokines which are known to play key roles in ocular angiogenesis and inflammation. APX3330 is an oral tablet to be administered twice per day for the treatment of DR. A Phase 2 study in subjects with DR and an End-of-Phase 2 meeting have recently been completed, and a SPA is planned to be submitted. DR affects approximately 10 million people with diabetes and is projected to impact over 14 million Americans by 2050. DR is classified as NPDR, the early stage of the disease in which symptoms may be mild or non-existent or PDR, which is the more advanced stage of diabetic eye disease that can be highly symptomatic with loss of vision. Approximately 8 million DR patients have NPDR that will progress to PDR, if left untreated. Despite the risk for visual loss associated with this disease, over 90% of NPDR patients currently receive no course of treatment apart from observation by their eye care specialist until they develop sight-threatening complications. This is partially attributed to the currently approved therapies for this disease. APX3330 as an oral tablet has the potential to be an early, non-invasive treatment for the 8 million NPDR patients in the U.S. Treatment with APX3330 is expected to delay or prevent progression of NPDR, thereby reducing the need for expensive intravitreal injections with anti-VEGF therapies and reducing the likelihood of vision loss due to DR. Ocuphire has also in-licensed APX2009 and APX2014, which are second-generation analogs of APX3330. The unique mechanism of action of these Ref-1 inhibitors, which reduce both angiogenesis and inflammation, could potentially be beneficial in treating other retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and geographic atrophy. Ocuphire is currently evaluating local delivery routes in addition to the systemic (oral) route as part of its pipeline expansion in retinal therapies. Ocuphire also has a partnership with Viatris, Inc. to develop and commercialize PS (initially known as Nyxol). PS is a non-selective alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist designed to reduce pupil size by uniquely blocking the alpha-1 receptors found on the iris dilator muscle without affecting the ciliary muscle. PS was approved by the FDA for the treatment for pharmacologically-induced mydriasis under the brand name RYZUMVI™ in September 2023. PS is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of presbyopia and for the treatment of decreased visual acuity under dim (mesopic or low) light conditions after keratorefractive surgery.

Declares Cash Dividend for First Quarter 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Negative) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Silver Spike Investment Corp. (SSIC) declares a cash dividend of $0.25 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The dividend dates are Record Date on March 20, 2024, and Payment Date on March 28, 2024. The Company offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) for automatic reinvestment of dividends unless stockholders opt for cash. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a cash dividend by Silver Spike Investment Corp. signals a positive cash flow and profitability status, which can be an attractive point for income-focused investors. The dividend yield, calculated as the annual dividends per share divided by the price per share, is a critical metric in evaluating the attractiveness of Silver Spike's stock as an income-generating investment. A $0.25 per share quarterly dividend suggests a $1.00 annual dividend, which investors will compare against the current stock price to assess yield.Furthermore, the introduction of a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) allows investors to compound their holdings by reinvesting dividends into additional shares. This can be beneficial for long-term growth as it reflects a reinvestment strategy that could potentially enhance the value of an investor's stake in the company over time, assuming the company's stock price appreciates. Market Research Analyst The announcement of dividend payments can impact investor sentiment and the company's stock market performance. Historically, stocks that pay dividends are often considered less volatile and more stable, which might attract a different investor profile compared to non-dividend-paying stocks. The stability of Silver Spike's dividends, especially in the context of its sector and market trends, will be closely monitored by investors as an indicator of the company's financial health and managerial confidence in its cash-generating ability.Additionally, the timing of the dividend declaration and the payment dates are essential for investors who follow the 'Dividend Capture' strategy, which involves purchasing a stock before the ex-dividend date and selling it after the dividend is paid to capture the dividend payout without a significant investment in the stock. Economist Dividend declarations can reflect broader economic conditions. In a stable or growing economy, companies may have more confidence in sharing profits with shareholders through dividends. Conversely, in a downturn, companies might reduce or suspend dividends to conserve cash. Silver Spike's ability to pay dividends could indicate its resilience to economic fluctuations and its position within the specialty finance industry.Moreover, the DRIP's impact on share price should be considered. While reinvestment of dividends increases the number of outstanding shares, which could dilute the share value, it also reflects shareholder confidence in the company's future prospects. This confidence can have a positive feedback loop on the company's stock performance, albeit this must be balanced against the potential dilutive effect. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM NEW YORK, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Silver Spike Investment Corp. (“Silver Spike” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: SSIC), a specialty finance company that has elected to be treated as a business development company, today announced that Silver Spike’s board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2024.

The study showed the limitations of surrogate markers compared to Daxor's 98% accurate BVA system, emphasizing the importance of accurate blood volume measurement in optimizing therapy. Positive Daxor Corporation presents new data validating the benefits of blood volume analysis (BVA). The study highlights the limitations of surrogate markers in measuring blood volume. Daxor's BVA system is shown to be 98% accurate in measuring blood volume. The study emphasizes the importance of accurate blood volume measurement in optimizing therapy for heart failure patients with impaired renal function. Daxor's technology provides clinicians with actionable data to improve outcomes and reduce the cost of care. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent study from Duke University Medical Center highlights the significance of accurate blood volume analysis (BVA) for heart failure patients, particularly those with impaired renal function. The findings underscore the limitations of surrogate markers like right atrial pressure and capillary wedge pressure, which have been traditionally used to guide volume decisions in clinical settings. The study's emphasis on the heterogeneity of volume status across different levels of renal function and the weak correlation between pressure and volume point to the necessity for more precise diagnostic tools in managing heart failure.From a medical research perspective, the introduction of a 98% accurate BVA system by Daxor could represent a paradigm shift in the standard of care for heart failure patients. The ability to detect dilutional anemia, a condition more prevalent in patients with worse renal function, further solidifies the clinical utility of BVA. The implications of these findings could lead to improved patient outcomes through more tailored treatment plans, potentially reducing the duration and cost of care for a significant patient population. Healthcare Economist From an economic standpoint, the validation of Daxor's BVA technology has the potential to influence healthcare spending on heart failure management. Heart failure is associated with high hospitalization rates and healthcare costs, particularly due to complications like renal impairment. By providing a more accurate assessment of a patient's volume status, BVA could enable clinicians to optimize treatment regimens, possibly reducing the frequency of hospital readmissions and the need for more invasive procedures.Furthermore, the improvement in individualized care could lead to better resource allocation within healthcare systems. The long-term economic benefits could be substantial, considering the prevalence of heart failure and the associated costs. The adoption of BVA technology could also drive market demand for Daxor's products, potentially impacting the company's financial performance and investor interest. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Daxor's BVA diagnostic tool is positioned in a niche yet critical segment of the healthcare market—heart failure diagnostics. With the validation from a reputable institution like Duke University Medical Center, Daxor is likely to experience increased credibility and visibility within the medical community. This could translate into greater adoption rates of their BVA system and expansion into new clinical areas.The study's results could also prompt a reevaluation of current diagnostic standards, possibly leading to updated clinical guidelines that favor BVA technology. Such changes could have a ripple effect on the diagnostic market, influencing competitor strategies and accelerating innovation. Stakeholders, including investors, should monitor the adoption curve and any shifts in regulatory recommendations that could further solidify Daxor's market position. 03/08/2024 - 08:00 AM Only Daxor’s BVA Diagnostic Was Shown to Accurately Reflect Blood Volume Compared to Inferior Surrogates Oak Ridge, TN, March 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Daxor Corporation (Nasdaq: DXR), the global leader in blood volume measurement technology, today announces new data from Duke University Medical Center validating the benefits of blood volume analysis (BVA) in optimizing individualized therapy for heart failure patients with impaired renal function. Data were presented on 259 patients from three centers at the Technology and Heart Failure Therapeutics Conference (THT), which brought together the world’s leading experts in heart failure innovations at the Westin Boston Seaport in Boston, Massachusetts March 4-6, 2024. The lead investigator from Duke, Veraprapas Kittipibul M.D., commented during his award-winning presentation that surrogate markers such as “right atrial pressure and capillary wedge pressure had minimal utility to measure blood volume.” The study definitively showed the limitations of these commonly used measures of pressure to guide volume decisions, compared with Daxor’s 98% accurate BVA system. The study, titled, ‘Blood Volume Profiles and Correlations with Pressures in Heart Failure with Impaired Renal Function,’ aimed to answer if the degree of renal impairment in heart failure patients impacts volume status, the pressure-volume relationship, and the prevalence and types of anemia. Veraprapas Kittipibul M.D., lead investigator of the study concluded that: Heterogeneity in volume exists across renal function which can only be accurately measured with BVA.Patients with large volume expansion had worsening renal function, showing the urgent need for care.Pressure-volume correlation is consistently weak across renal function, showing that BVA is the right tool.Anemia, especially dilutional anemia, is more prevalent in worse renal function, also detectable by BVA. “The cornerstone of heart failure care is volume management, and an accurate diagnosis of this is crucial, especially in patients at significant risk for kidney disease,” said Michael Feldschuh, CEO and President of Daxor. “Our BVA technology provides clinicians with 98% accurate, actionable data to optimize treatment plans and individualize care, improving outcomes while reducing duration and cost of care.” About Daxor Corporation Daxor Corporation (Nasdaq: DXR), is the global leader in blood volume measurement technology focused on blood volume testing innovation.

(NASDAQ: ARWR) initiates Phase 1/2a study for ARO-DM1 in patients with type 1 myotonic dystrophy. ARO-DM1 shows promise in reducing DMPK expression and correcting spliceopathies, potentially improving muscle strength and function. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for ARO-DM1 represents a significant milestone in the development of treatments for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Given that DM1 is the most prevalent adult-onset muscular dystrophy and currently lacks disease-modifying therapies, the potential market for a successful treatment is substantial. A medical research analyst would assess the therapeutic mechanism of action, which involves RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the expression of the DMPK gene. RNAi technology has gained traction in the pharmaceutical industry due to its specificity and ability to silence disease-causing genes. The reported preclinical success, with over 80% silencing of DMPK in skeletal muscle, suggests a promising therapeutic effect that could translate into clinical benefits.However, the transition from preclinical models to human subjects is fraught with uncertainty. The analyst would monitor the safety profile and efficacy data as the trial progresses, as these will be critical in determining the potential for ARO-DM1 to meet the unmet need in DM1 treatment. Investors will be particularly interested in the trial's interim results, which could indicate the drug's future prospects and impact on Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals' valuation. Biotech Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the progression of ARO-DM1 into human trials is a pivotal event that could influence Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals' stock performance. A biotech financial analyst would consider the costs associated with the development of ARO-DM1, the potential revenue upon successful market entry and the competitive landscape. Given that DM1 affects a relatively small population, ARO-DM1 could be considered for orphan drug status, which may offer financial incentives such as tax credits, grant funding and market exclusivity upon approval.Investors will also scrutinize the trial design, particularly the inclusion of a placebo-controlled group, which adds robustness to the study and may facilitate regulatory approval if results are positive. The analyst would perform a risk assessment, factoring in the high attrition rate of drugs in early-stage development, but also the high reward potential of a breakthrough therapy in a market with high unmet medical need. Market Research Analyst Understanding the broader market implications of ARO-DM1's development is essential for stakeholders. A market research analyst would evaluate the prevalence of DM1, the current standard of care and the demand for improved therapies. With no approved disease-modifying treatments for DM1, the introduction of ARO-DM1 could disrupt the current treatment paradigm, which focuses on symptom management. If the drug demonstrates efficacy and safety in clinical trials, it could capture a significant share of the DM1 treatment market.The analyst would also consider the potential for ARO-DM1 to be applied to other muscle-wasting disorders, which could expand the drug's market potential. Moreover, the success of ARO-DM1 could validate Arrowhead's RNAi platform, potentially leading to increased investment in the company's pipeline and partnerships focused on RNAi therapeutics. 03/08/2024 - 07:30 AM - Preclinical data show ARO-DM1 reduces muscular DMPK expression and corrects spliceopathies, which could lead to improved muscle strength and function PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) announced today that it has dosed the first subjects in a Phase 1/2a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating study (NCT06138743) to evaluate single and multiple ascending doses of ARO-DM1, the company’s investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic, in up to 48 subjects with type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1). DM1 is the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy. Patients with DM1 have muscle weakness and wasting, myotonia, cataracts, and often develop cardiac conduction abnormalities. Additionally, patients may become physically disabled and have a shortened life span. There is currently no approved disease-modifying therapy for DM1. Treatments have focused on symptomatic management, including physical therapy, exercise, ankle-foot orthoses, and assistive devices, such as wheelchairs. ARO-DM1 is designed to reduce expression of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene in the muscle. Pathogenesis of DM1 is driven by an expanded CUG trinucleotide repeat in the 3’-untranslated region of DMPK transcripts. These abnormal transcripts cause mis-regulated splicing, known as spliceopathy, for certain messenger RNAs which are directly linked to the clinical manifestations of DM1. Preclinical data recently presented at the 2024 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Clinical & Scientific Conference showed that in nonhuman primates, ARO-DM1 achieved greater than 80% silencing of DMPK in skeletal muscle, which was maintained for longer than 85 days. In a mouse model of DM1 harboring a pathogenic DMPK transgene, a modified species-specific version of ARO-DM1 (S-ARO-DM1) decreased the DMPK-CUG expression and corrected the spliceopathies.
