US futures slipped after the S&P 500 rally stalled at the end of last week, weighed by profit taking in megacap tech stocks. Australia 10-year yields dropped six basis points after Treasuries climbed on Friday.Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said in an interview published Friday that the economy is headed in the right direction, and it will likely be appropriate to cut rates later this year.“The week ahead may bring more trouble than calm – as March starts with a world concerned about sticky inflation, doubting the wisdom of waiting central bankers and fearing larger conflicts leading to further global trade disruptions,” Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, wrote in a note to clients.This week, investors will be bracing for the impact from heavy Treasury and corporate issuance and month-end positioning. There’s also a slate of economic data to be srutinized, including the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index on Thursday that’s the Federal Reserve’s favored inflation gauge.Fed speakers are likely to reiterate William’s comments that the central bank doesn’t feel pressure to begin cutting rates anytime soon.“Recent CPI inflation and employment information have clouded the timing and magnitude of rate cuts in the financial markets,” Stephen Gallagher, chief US economist at Societe Generale SA wrote in a note to clients. “Affirming that rate cuts are likely sustains hopes for cuts in the coming months, albeit not in March.”Story continuesElsewhere, Zambia said it reached a deal on debt restructuring with China and India as emerging market investors pile into African debt in a hunt for yield. Meantime, the US and China are discussing new measures to prevent a wave of emerging market defaults, including ways to preemptively extend loan periods before countries miss payments.Key events this week:WTO ministerial conference, Abu Dhabi, MondayHungary may ratify Sweden’s NATO accession, MondayJapan CPI, TuesdayTaiwan export orders, TuesdayBOE Governor Andrew Bailey speaks, TuesdayRBNZ rate decision, WednesdayHong Kong GDP, WednesdayEurozone economic, consumer confidence, WednesdayUS GDP, WednesdayG-20 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meet, WednesdayAustralia retail sales, ThursdayFrance, Germany and Spain CPI, ThursdayCanada GDP, ThursdayBrazil unemployment, ThursdayUS PCE Deflator, ThursdayChina official PMI, Caixin manufacturing PMI, FridayEurozone CPI, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksS&P 500 futures fell 0.1% as of 8:20 a.m. Tokyo timeAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3%Nikkei 225 futures rose 0.9%Hang Seng futures were little changedCurrenciesThe euro was little changed at $1.0822The Japanese yen was unchanged at 150.51 per dollarThe offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2062 per dollarThe Australian dollar was little changed at $0.6563BondsAustralia’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 4.14%CryptocurrenciesBitcoin was little changed at $51,786.35Ether was little changed at $3,108.59CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude was little changedSpot gold was little changedThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe High Cost of Eating Out in AmericaWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First PlaceHow Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect ConsumersCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Indeed, the core services ex-housing PCE measure, which Fed members like to reference, could well rise 0.6% m/m for the biggest gain since December 2021.

One manager had his short-selling orders abruptly rejected by brokers. Another was cut off from the stock market completely. Regulators turned up on trading floors at multiple funds to monitor transactions in person.Most Read from BloombergBYD Unveils $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, LamborghiniZelenskiy Says 31,000 Troops Killed as Ukraine Seeks US Aid Decision Within MonthBuffett Says ‘Eye-Popping’ Results Unlikely With Record CashTrump Advances 2024 Bid Besting Haley in Her Home StateNorwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to OutbreakAs one fund put it, three sessions of chaotic trading “felt like a whole year to us.”The scenes, extraordinary even by the standards of a market that has long operated under the Communist Party’s shadow, played out in recent weeks in a clampdown that’s rewriting the rules of computer-driven trading in China. The country’s once-booming quant industry has become the latest casualty of Beijing’s campaign to stop a $4 trillion selloff in stocks.While the measures have helped prop up share prices at least temporarily, they raise bigger questions of how far Xi Jinping’s government will go to meet short-term goals at the expense of maintaining some pretense of a free market that’s attracted billions of dollars from Wall Street firms in recent years.For international investors becoming increasingly skittish about China, the sudden trading restrictions give them one more reason to stay away.China saw a record six months of outflows from the equity market until this month, while foreign direct investment is at a 30-year low following unprecedented crackdowns on the tech and property sectors that have stifled growth. China risks losing out further to countries like India and Japan, which are enjoying a surge in investment.Read More: Japan Shares Open New Chapter as Nikkei Reclaims Its 1989 PeakStory continues“These seemingly panic actions by authorities risk undermining all the good work done in the past two decades to give China access to global pools of capital,” said Gary Dugan, chief investment officer at Dalma Capital Management Ltd. in Dubai. He said the moves will make “even the most battle-hardened investors” question whether China is worth the risk.The new restrictions are sweeping. Quant funds, which rely on computer algorithms to carry out trades, will be scrutinized and new entrants will have to report their strategies to regulators before trading. Beijing will also expand the scope of reporting to offshore investors via a mainland-to-Hong Kong trading link.China’s securities watchdog meantime set up a task force to monitor short selling and could issue warnings to firms that profit from the wagers, people familiar have said. It even took the extreme step of halting some major institutional investors from selling more shares than they buy during the first and last 30 minutes of trading, they added.“Quant managers were hit by the biggest Black Swan in quant history,” Shanghai-based Semimartingale Private Fund Management LP wrote, recapping the wild market swings in a letter seen by Bloomberg.The crackdown adds to a series of moves aimed at halting a multiyear plunge in equities, which have been slammed by the housing crisis, weak economic growth and lingering tensions with the US. It also echoes the heavy-handed approach that has been used to clamp down on sectors from internet to education platforms.“The risk premium on Chinese stocks has to go up going forward because some institutions are going to be unwilling to trade this market,” said Arthur Budaghyan, emerging markets chief strategist at BCA Research. “And this is on top of geopolitical concerns that many foreign investors have had about investing in Chinese stocks.”In recent weeks, Beijing turned its sights on quant funds, which have used their big data models to outperform the market for much of the last three years.In an early sign of what was to come, Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Jan. 22 asked authorities to take more “forceful” measures to stabilize markets as the CSI 300 index hit a five-year-low. Beijing then made a surprise move two weeks later to oust the head of the securities regulator, replacing him with a veteran bureaucrat known as the “broker butcher” for his past crackdowns.Concerned that quant funds were exacerbating declines by unloading big blocks of shares or making short bets, Beijing started by banning some funds from placing sell orders while limiting their ability to make short trades. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said it had discovered multiple cases of market manipulation and “malicious short selling.”“It was so annoying,” said Alex Wong, whose Shanghai-based fund was unable to sell borrowed stocks to execute short trades for about two days as small caps tumbled. “I truly felt like smashing the keyboard and slamming the door.”These restrictions, along with sudden shifts in the market, combined to throttle the quant funds as China headed into its Lunar New Year break this month.As a Man Group analyst explained, a popular trade for these funds involves buying small-cap stocks, which are more prone to mispricing and more profitable for computer programs to exploit. To hedge their broad market exposure, the funds would short index futures.This strategy was upended by a sharp decline in small cap stocks, prompting quant products with heavy exposure to trim holdings. The massive selloff triggered losses in derivatives known as “snowballs,” causing a “quant quake” panic and forcing brokerages to dump index futures as well.All that volatility pushed up hedging costs for so-called market-neutral products, some of which were leveraged to the hilt by as much as 300%. That forced them to unwind positions, fueling a cascading spiral in the market.Read more: China Has a Quant Quake Because There’s No Citadel: Shuli RenAs funds stampeded to the exits, authorities upped their ante to tame the rout, making it even worse for the quants. Government-led funds, known as the “national team,” stepped in to prop up exchange-traded funds, boosting large stocks but leaving small caps behind. The gyrations made the market unpredictable for computer models trained on reading historical data.“A series of external interventions and changes made it hard for quant models to make predictions, or even adapt,” Shanghai-based Mingxi Capital, a quant fund that manages more than 1 billion yuan ($139 million), wrote in an article on its Wechat account. “The models switched from doing it right to getting it wrong repeatedly.”Weak ReturnsThe funds took a beating as a result. Top quants managing more than 10 billion yuan lagged the CSI 500 Index by an average 12 percentage points in the two weeks ended Feb. 8, according to industry data cited in a Huatai Securities Co. report.More extreme measures ensued. One high-frequency trading firm’s internet access was temporarily suspended, according to a brokerage employee, while others saw their borrowed shares for short bets recalled, according to people familiar.The crackdown came to a head on Feb. 20, when China’s two main stock exchanges froze the accounts of a major quant fund for three days. Regulators sought to make an example of Ningbo Lingjun Investment Management Partnership after it dumped a combined 2.57 billion yuan in shares within a minute as trading resumed following the holiday.Read more: China Stocks Cap Best Winning Run Since 2020 as Rally ExtendsFor now, the strong-armed measures are working to halt the slide. China’s main equity index has risen nine straight sessions — the longest string of gains in six years - including every day last week following the quant crackdown.Longer term, the moves call into question whether quants will want to operate in a country with such arbitrary changes. The sector has surged in recent years, managing some 1.58 trillion yuan in combined assets. While the industry is dominated by domestic funds, international firms like Two Sigma Investments and Winton Group Ltd. have been expanding, along with DE Shaw & Co.“After escaping the fire, don’t go back,” Li Bei, founder of macro hedge fund Shanghai Banxia Investment Management Center wrote on the company’s Wechat account Friday, warning investors not to pile back into China’s small stocks.Read more: Bridgewater Says China Stock Selloff Made Valuations AttractiveThe changes pave the way for more consolidation, and it will be increasingly hard for smaller players to survive as state participants exert heavier influence.“Quants need consistent market operating rules and regulations that hold through all market conditions,” said Dalma Capital’s Dugan. “That is not the case in China at this point.”In their public comments, some Chinese quant fund managers have signaled their support for the measures, which they say will weed out risky players. They note that the US also limited short-selling during the global financial crisis, as have other countries. Yet the way China implemented the moves — the lack of consistency or transparency by using verbal “window guidance” to funds — will only deter global investors.“The A-share market is so micro-managed, monitored and controlled by the administrators,” said Zhiwu Chen, a finance professor in Hong Kong and a former member of the international advisory board of the CSRC, referring to the domestic market.Open MarketChina’s securities watchdog said that the measures were targeted at “abnormal trading” and not to restrict stock selling.“Stock market rises and falls, investors buy and sell, that’s the norm. Regulators do not interfere with normal market transactions,” the CSRC said in a statement Thursday. The regulator’s intention isn’t to “beat quants to death,” local media reported, citing a CSRC official.Still, the trading panic dealt a blow to the image that regulators worked so arduously to craft over three decades, to convince investors that China was committed to a more professional and open market, in line with international standards.Instead, the list of maligned industries keeps growing. Tech firms like Ant Group Co. have been reined in, while Wall Street banks face growing limits on data, giving them pause after years of expansion in the world’s second-largest economy.Over the next decade, China needs “capital from the rest of the world,” said George Boubouras, head of research at K2 Asset Management Ltd. It’s “basically sent a signal that market transparency and the search for it is not allowed as much.”--With assistance from Zheng Li, Henry Ren, Heng Xie, Amanda Wang and Chongjing Li.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe High Cost of Eating Out in AmericaWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First PlaceHow Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect ConsumersCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Elsewhere, jet fuel demand in the US is picking up just in time for a busy travel season, while oil’s February advance is on the cusp of evaporating. A slew of energy industry conferences take place in London, including International Energy Week.Most Read from BloombergBYD Unveils $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, LamborghiniZelenskiy Says 31,000 Troops Killed as Ukraine Seeks US Aid Decision Within MonthBuffett Says ‘Eye-Popping’ Results Unlikely With Record CashNorwegian Cruise Ship Halted at Mauritius Due to OutbreakTrump Advances 2024 Bid Besting Haley in Her Home StateHere are four notable charts and one map to consider in global commodity markets as the week gets underway.Jet FuelSpring break should be a busy one for airlines, according to one indicator. The four-week rolling average for US jet fuel demand is at the highest seasonal level since the Covid-19 pandemic caused air travel to collapse in 2020, according to Energy Information Administration data. At the same time, jet fuel prices are tracking lower. A similar trend is seen around the world. Global jet fuel demand is expected to grow about 6% this year as international travel continues to recover, refiner Phillips 66 forecasts.Food Security, Trade and ClimateOn the agenda as WTO ministers meet is an effort to ratify the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies that was adopted at a June 2022 gathering. Last week, Haiti became the 61st WTO member to formally accept the pact. The accord sets new binding multilateral rules to curb harmful subsidies (including for fuel) that are a key factor in the widespread depletion of the world’s fish stocks and have implications for food security and the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Two-thirds of the 164 WTO members need to sign the agreement before it can be ratified. Other topics up for discussion include agriculture, trade and sustainable development, and e-commerce moratoriums.Story continuesBase MetalsBase metals have suffered since hitting a record high in March 2022, but the tide may be turning, according to one technical indicator. The LMEX Index — a gauge for the six main metals traded on the London Metal Exchange — has rallied almost 4% since hitting a 2024 low earlier this month. That has put a so-called golden cross into view, a bullish signal where the 50-day moving average climbs above its 200-day counterpart. Of course, the last time the pattern appeared just over a year ago, the advance proved short-lived.OilA rally at the start of the month is slipping away amid competing themes for oil markets. While bullish tailwinds of rising Middle East tensions and lower OPEC+ output helped push futures higher, concerns over flagging consumption in top importer China have offset the gains. West Texas Intermediate futures are up less than 1% in February, while Brent saw its monthly advance erase on Friday. For the year, both benchmarks are trading in a tight $10-a-barrel range, causing some traders in exchange-traded funds tracking oil to pull their cash.Precious MetalsWhile gold has attracted much of the attention in precious metals circles amid its record rally, silver has been slumbering away in a tight range this year. At almost $23 an ounce, it’s more than halfway below its peak reached in 1980 and trading beneath two key moving averages (after forming a bearish death cross technical pattern earlier this month). Change could be on the horizon: Hedge funds flipped to net bullish from bearish, according to the latest US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.--With assistance from Brendan Murray.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe High Cost of Eating Out in AmericaWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First PlaceHow Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect ConsumersCan the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?Plug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV Market©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

Motley Fool,Missed Out on Nvidia? Buy These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/missed-nvidia-buy-artificial-intelligence-192600925.html,Companies profiting from AI hold considerable potential for outsize gains.,"Without a doubt, many artificial intelligence (AI) investors are kicking themselves for missing out on Nvidia's big gains. With the stock up 280% in the last year and over 1,800% in five years, it is one of the major beneficiaries in the AI space.Nonetheless, Nvidia is not the only AI stock in the chip industry, and AI is so much more than semiconductors. With the breadth of AI investing options, the industry should continue to bring opportunity. Three Fool.com contributors have ideas on where AI investors can look next: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).Amazon has many ways to win when it comes to AIJake Lerch (Amazon): There are hotter AI stocks out there, but Amazon remains one worth watching, and buying. Here's why:First, the company is the largest cloud services provider. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is estimated to have about 31% of the worldwide cloud services market. That's important because new generative AI tools and applications often utilize cloud services like AWS. As the AI revolution rolls on, Amazon is poised to profit thanks to its lead in the cloud infrastructure market.Second, Amazon's massive e-commerce business dovetails nicely with many different AI applications. For example, the company has already introduced Rufus, a new AI-powered shopping assistant designed to help people by answering questions, making pricing comparisons, and generating product recommendations. In addition, Amazon is using AI in many other areas of its operations, such as:Streamlining prescription drug delivery time and cost through Amazon Pharmacy.Lowering the company's environmental impact through AI-generated recommendations to reduce packaging use.Improving shopping recommendations via Amazon Fashion.Updating Alexa-enabled devices to enhance conversation and dialogue between users and Alexa.On top of all of that, Amazon remains one of the world's best-run companies. Shares are up 73% over the last 12 months, while revenue growth has bounced back to a solid 13%.Story continuesIn short, Amazon remains a smart choice for AI-focused investors.The Trade Desk benefits from AI and digital advertising tailwindsJustin Pope (The Trade Desk): Artificial intelligence is a hot topic today, but it began disrupting the advertising business several years back when The Trade Desk was in its infancy. Brands and other companies can buy advertising on The Trade Desk's platform, which uses AI and user data to match ads to potential customers. This is far more effective than traditional advertising, which would broadcast to broad audiences on television, radio, or in print.The Trade Desk has thrived, growing profitably since its 2016 initial public offering. The reason? The Trade Desk sits in an ideal spot in the industry. Advertising dollars are shifting to digital mediums and while competitors like Meta Platforms and Alphabet operate with limited transparency, The Trade Desk offers more information to its clients, and that is winning over customers.TTD Revenue (TTM) ChartTotal worldwide ad spending in 2023 was an estimated $830 billion, which means that The Trade Desk's $9.6 billion in gross ad spending translates to just over 1% of market share. That leaves a tremendous growth runway for this company operating outside the closed ecosystems of big technology companies.The Trade Desk's long-term growth opportunities and profitable business model make the stock a no-brainer AI investment you can hold for the long term.Tesla likely has some AI-driven surprises under the hoodWill Healy (Tesla): Investors may tend to look at Tesla as an automaker, but it's actually a diverse business also developing battery technology, solar energy solutions, and AI breakthroughs.Instead of relying on chip companies like Nvidia for its technology, Tesla has developed its own semiconductor and robotics solutions. Among these are the Dojo chip, designed to power neural networks, and the FSD (full self-driving) chip, which would power fully autonomous vehicles.CEO Elon Musk wants to launch a robotaxi business based on Tesla technology. With robotaxis, analysts at Cathie Wood's Ark Invest believe Tesla's revenue could reach a minimum of $600 billion by 2027, over seven times the 2023 level of $82 billion.Wood believes that growth would take Tesla's stock price to $2,000 per share, a more than tenfold gain from today's levels.While that may seem outrageous, and Musk has a track record of being overly ambitious in his promises, Wood predicted a split-adjusted price target of $267 per Tesla share in 2018. Within less than three years, Wood's prediction came to pass, so she could be right again.Tesla's stock price has pulled back as Tesla has cut prices on electric vehicles (EVs) to boost sales and stay competitive with emerging rivals. That pessimism has taken its P/E ratio down to 45, a low valuation rarely seen in the stock's history.Although profits are expected to fall 1% this year, analysts predict a 36% increase in 2025. These earnings forecasts give some validation to Wood's thesis. Some of that optimism may be related to the release of the lower-cost, compact Model 2 EV expected for 2025, and investors are also likely to jump in as the company improves its AI and self-driving capabilities.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.
