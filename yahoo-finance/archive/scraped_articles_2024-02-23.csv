This Fund Says It Cracked the CodeStocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets WrapAT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network ExpansionUS Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private SpacecraftThe talks — including ways to preemptively extend loan periods before countries miss payments — are broadly aimed at both easing the $400 billion-plus annual debt service burden for poor countries and finding an alternative to the high borrowing rates those nations now face in the market.In addition to extending repayment times, other ideas being discussed include increasing financing from the World Bank and other multilateral banks. A key point is to roll out those measures before countries default and enter formal restructuring talks with creditors.Any resulting joint proposal on global sovereign debt issues between Washington and Beijing would likely need the support of the full Group of 20, as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank — the trifecta that’s struggled to resolve global debt distress issues since the pandemic.It would also eventually require broad buy-in from private creditors, who have captured a bigger share of emerging market sovereign lending and expect a bigger say at the negotiating table.One goal of the talks, two of the people said, is to bring a proposal to G-20 leaders when they meet in Rio de Janeiro in November. Another person cautioned the talks are still in an early stage and it’s unclear if they’ll result in anything concrete. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.Story continuesThe Treasury Department declined to confirm the specifics of the discussions, saying in a statement that “we talk frequently with China about sovereign debt concerns. And we talk to many countries about how to make sure the international financial architecture is meeting low-income country financing needs.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her nation “attaches great importance to the debt issues of developing countries.” The US and China discuss the topic “via multilateral and bilateral channels,” she added Friday at a regular press briefing in Beijing.The Ministry of Finance in Beijing didn’t respond to requests for comment.Debt DeadlockA joint US-China approach would be a breakthrough as the two sides are the most powerful forces acting on many nations’ debt workouts: Washington dominates the global financial architecture through the Treasury Department’s influence at the IMF and World Bank, while Beijing essentially has veto power over many deals as the biggest creditor to developing countries.The discussions come amid growing concerns over the slow progress of restructuring talks for countries like Zambia and Ghana, which are now engaged in a process known as the Common Framework, a program to restructure debts launched in 2020 by the G-20, World Bank and IMF.The framework’s ambitions included bringing traditional lenders from the so-called Paris Club — mostly rich, Western creditor nations — around the table with emerging creditors, notably China and the private sector.But that process has drawn criticism for moving forward at a dangerously sluggish pace, leaving defaulted countries suspended for years while dissuading others near bankruptcy from seeking help given the grinding process.Read more: Why G20’s Plan for Indebted Nations Isn’t HelpingFor example, Zambia defaulted in 2020 and has still not finalized an overhaul of its debts. It appeared to have reached an agreement for restructuring more than $3 billion of debt late last year, only to have it fall apart amid a standoff between Beijing and bondholders.The talks between the US and China began before a meeting in California in November between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping and have continued into this year, according to one of the people.Debt issues were discussed during US Treasury Undersecretary Jay Shambaugh’s visit to Beijing earlier this month.Developing nations spent a record $443 billion on debt service payments in 2022, according to the World Bank, which has warned the situation risks tipping them into crisis and creating a “lost decade” of economic stagnation.About a dozen developing nations are in default or have global bonds trading at levels that suggest the market is bracing for the country to miss payments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.International capital markets have started to reopen for some emerging-market borrowers, but at rates that are likely to only worsen budget burdens.

TipRanks,CALF ETF Shows Investors Can Win with Small-Cap Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calf-etf-shows-investors-win-071952978.html,"Large-cap tech stocks are in the spotlight, but investors can also win with small-cap stocks, as demonstrated by the Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (BATS:CALF). The ETF has quietly been a hit with investors, taking in record inflows in January 2024, which was remarkably its 46th-straight month of inflows.

According to Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, no other small-cap ETF has taken in more cash over the past 12 months. CALF is quickly becoming a major player in the world of ETFs, as it now has $8.7 billion in assets under management (AUM).I’m bullish on this small-cap ETF based on its winning track record, its inexpensive holdings, and its unique strategy, which we’ll discuss in depth below.What Is the CALF ETF’s Strategy? According to the fund’s sponsor, Pacer, CALF “aims to provide capital appreciation over time by screening the S&P SmallCap 600 for the top 100 companies based on free cash flow yield.”This focus on free cash flow and free cash flow yield makes CALF stand out from your run-of-the-mill small-cap ETF.Free cash flow is simply the cash a company has left over after paying for expenses, interest, taxes, and long-term investments. This cash can be used to create value for shareholders by making share repurchases, paying dividends, or even making acquisitions.Free cash flow yield is derived by taking a company’s free cash flow per share and dividing it by its share price. Generally speaking, the higher the free cash flow yield, the more attractive the stock looks.Pacer explained, “The ability to generate a high free cash flow yield indicates a company is producing more cash than it needs to run the business and can invest in growth opportunities.”While Pacer has another fund focused on free cash flow yield called the Pacer U.S. Cash Cows 100 ETF (BATS:COWZ), an additional benefit of taking this strategy and focusing specifically on small-cap stocks is that it can offer “exposure to companies with higher growth that are often under-researched.” Pacer says that this focus gives investors exposure to a part of the market where “high-quality stocks are trading at a discount.”Story continuesSo how does CALF select these high free cash flow-yielding stocks that it invests in? Let’s take a look at its investment process.CALF’s Investment Process CALF starts out by looking at all 600 stocks in its investment universe, the S&P Smallcap 600 Index. It then screens these companies for the top 100 names based on their free cash flow yield over the trailing 12 months.Screening for these top 100 companies creates a portfolio of holdings that is significantly cheaper, and that produces a much higher cash flow yield than the initial 600 stock universe. As of CALF’s last quarterly rebalance, the 600 stocks in its initial investment universe had an average price-to-earnings multiple of 15.0 and an average free cash flow yield of 4.3%. But by screening for the top 100 stocks by free cash flow yield, this new list has an average price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.0 and a free cash flow yield of 13.2%.CALF then tips the scales further toward value and higher free cash flow yield by weighting these 100 holdings by cash flow, creating a final portfolio with a slightly lower average price-to-earnings ratio of 9.3 and a slightly higher free cash flow yield of 14.4%. Note that to maintain a well-rounded portfolio, CALF caps these position sizes at 2% when it rebalances each quarter.What type of results does this elaborate investment process generate? It turns out that it has produced a pretty impressive track record over time, as we’ll discuss in the next section.How Is CALF Performing?As of the end of the most recent quarter, CALF generated an annualized three-year return of 17.3% and an impressive annualized five-year return of 17.4%.These are excellent returns that beat both its benchmark and the broader market over both time frames. For comparison, using the same timeframe, CALF’s benchmark, the S&P SmallCap 600 Value Index, returned 10.2% on an annualized basis over the past three years and 11.3% on an annualized basis over the past five years. These are solid returns, but CALF soundly outperformed them over both timeframes.Similarly, as of the most recent quarter, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO), a good proxy for the broader market, returned 10.0% over the past three years and 15.7% over the past five years, meaning that CALF outperformed it over both time frames.A Balanced, Inexpensive PortfolioSo, what does CALF’s portfolio look like? As mentioned above, CALF holds 100 stocks, and because it caps positions at 2% when it rebalances, its top 10 positions make up just 21.9% of assets. Below is an overview of CALF’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.While these are small-cap stocks that may not be household names to many investors, the fund’s top holding, Abercrombie and Fitch (NYSE:ANF), demonstrates why its strategy of focusing on companies that produce high free cash flow yield can be effective. After being undervalued for a long time, Abercrombie and Fitch is up 300% over the past year.CALF’s largest exposure is to the consumer discretionary sector, with a weighting of 37.3%. Its second-largest exposure is to industrials, with a weighting of 17.2%. While you won’t find any of the market’s hottest large-cap tech stocks in the fund, given its small-cap focus, information technology is present here and has a weighting of 10.6%, the fund’s third-largest sector exposure. Lastly, energy is the final sector with a double-digit weighting of 10.5%.What Is CALF’s Expense Ratio?CALF’s expense ratio of 0.59% means that an investor will pay $59 in fees on a $10,000 investment in CALF annually. While this is a bit high, CALF has produced excellent, market-beating results over a multi-year time frame, meaning that it is likely worth it.Is CALF Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?Turning to Wall Street, CALF earns a Hold consensus rating based on 48 Buys, 44 Holds, and 10 Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average CALF stock price target of $50.75 implies 7.2% upside potential.The Takeaway: A Different Way to WinCALF is a great ETF that has used its unique strategy of focusing on small-cap stocks with high free cash flow yields to beat its benchmark and the broader market over the past three and five years.I remain bullish on the ETF based on its unique and effective investment process, which is proving itself over time, the long-term track record it is generating, and the attractive valuations of its holdings. While large-cap tech and growth stocks are deservedly in the market’s limelight, CALF shows that there is more than one way for investors to win in the market.Disclosure"

Japanese markets are closed Friday for a public holiday.China remained an exception. The CSI 300 Index was on pace for its first drop in nine sessions, and both it and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index swung from a rise to a fall.The largely bullish mood in Asia followed gains overnight in the US, where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, along with MSCI’s all-county index, closed at new records. A buoyant outlook for Nvidia Corp., the most valuable chipmaker, helped it surge 16% amid artificial-intelligence mania, while fresh data showed the world’s largest economy is still going strong.Nvidia’s $277 billion one-day boost to its market capitalization on Thursday was the biggest single-session increase in value ever — eclipsing a recent $197 billion gain by Meta Platforms Inc.“The major catalyst for markets, absent rate cuts throughout the year, would by necessity be earnings, and here Nvidia wowed investors and traders alike,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. “It was clear from their top down, and straight to the bottom line, that demand for AI infrastructure is growing exponentially.”The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index gained for a fourth day amid the first signs of property-sector improvement for the country in 10 months. China’s home prices declined at a slower pace for both new and existing-units in January, according to data released on Friday.Story continuesMarkets were also parsing indications that China’s economic slowdown is getting entrenched, with data published Thursday showing the number of foreclosed properties for sale in China rose at a faster pace in January.“The Chinese authorities can’t live with the stock market as weak as this, but it is really is only a trading rebound I think,” said Garry Evans, BCA Research’s chief strategist for global asset allocation. “At the moment, the China’s economy still looks very weak.”Back in the US, traders took more hawkish Fed commentary in stride. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.32% Thursday. Trading in cash Treasuries is closed in Asia Friday due to the Japanese holiday.“At some point, as we gain greater confidence that disinflation is ongoing and sustainable, that changing outlook will warrant a change in the policy rate,” Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said at an event at Princeton University.AI Computing BoomNvidia’s market capitalization has now increased by more than $700 billion this year — with its value now topping $1.9 trillion — as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.The tech rally has propelled the valuation of the Nasdaq 100 to an elevated level versus history, with a similar picture for the S&P 500. Lofty valuations could ultimately curb more gains as investors weigh how much they’re willing to pay for stocks valued on future growth.In commodities, oil slipped as investors weighed signs of a tightening market against persistent concerns around demand.

This Fund Says It Cracked the CodeStocks Rally as AI Craze Sweeps Across the World: Markets WrapAT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network ExpansionUS Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private SpacecraftA record cut to a key lending rate earlier this week announced by the People’s Bank of China was just the latest unexpected move since Governor Pan Gongsheng took office last summer. At a press briefing last month, he shocked with an outsized cut to banks’ reserve requirement ratio.The moves reflect the PBOC’s effort to step up support without abandoning its restrained approach to stimulus. The central bank’s scope for action remains restricted by risk that a bolder approach would weaken the currency, spur another build-up in debt and burn through policy room that’ll be needed later on if the longest streak of deflation since the 1990s and prolonged property downturn worsen.“The pattern of surprise PBOC policy announcements is likely intended to gain more attention and shift sentiment, thus getting more bang for the buck,” said Duncan Wrigley, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “We see a rising chance that PBOC will seek to surprise the market again.”So far, the strategy has yet to have a sustained impact on markets.The onshore benchmark CSI 300 Index gained just 0.2% on the day of the lending rate cut, while initial gains following the RRR reduction evaporated over the next few days as investors remained concerned over economic risks. The yuan has been stable in a range between 7.1 and 7.2 this year. Government bond yields have dropped on bets for more easing in China.Story continues“Stronger policy action to support the underlying economy may still be required to lift overall sentiment,” said Sonija Li, an analyst at MIB Securities Hong Kong Ltd.The latest moves and recent efforts to stabilize the $7 trillion stock market rout represent a greater resolve by Pan and other government leaders to boost market confidence. Yet some investors say stronger policies to address the economy’s growth challenges are needed for them to have a lasting impact.“Pan seems willing to take slightly larger steps when shifting policy than his predecessor did,” said Adam Wolfe, emerging markets economist at Absolute Strategy Research. But the PBOC “will remain a cautious institution,” Wolfe said, adding that he doesn’t expect any sharp changes in policy this year.The PBOC answers to the State Council, China’s cabinet, and isn’t an independent central bank like many of its global peers. That’s another restraint on Pan and the central bank’s room to maneuver.There’s a risk that relying on surprises to boost policy effect could reduce transparency. That threatens to undermine efforts by Yi Gang, Pan’s predecessor, to establish a clearer policy framework and regular communication with the market.“The more surprising these moves are, the less consistency there might be,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co, an investment bank in Beijing.What Bloomberg Economics Says...“China has more monetary stimulus in the pipeline...The surprisingly deep cut in the five-year loan prime rate Tuesday showed banks had room to lower borrowing costs. Our analysis — using term spreads in corporate bonds as a reference — shows they still have more space — as much as 20 basis points — even if the PBOC stands pat.”— Chang Shu and David Qu, economistsRead the full report here.Another risk is that when the PBOC falls short of market expectations, investors could take the negative surprise harder, according to He Wei, China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics. The PBOC’s decision to buck expectations and not cut interest rates in January, for example, hit investor sentiment hard, he said.“Markets are happy when policy moves exceed expectations,” He said. “The problem is when you have disappointing moves and no real explanations for them, investors will tend to assume the worst.”--With assistance from Zhu Lin, Masaki Kondo and Iris Ouyang.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA24’s Risky Hollywood MomentPlug-In Hybrids Are Booming in the World’s Biggest EV MarketHow Capital One’s $35 Billion Discover Merger Could Affect ConsumersWhy Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First PlaceUS Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
