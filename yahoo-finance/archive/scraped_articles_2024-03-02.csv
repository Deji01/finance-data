Motley Fool,"After Skyrocketing 800% in the Past 12 Months, Is It Time to Buy Carvana Stock?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skyrocketing-800-past-12-months-193300067.html,Shares of this once-struggling car retailer have come roaring back.,"To say that Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) shareholders have had a bumpy ride would be putting it lightly. The online used car retailer saw its shares skyrocket in the first four years after it hit the public markets in 2017, with the market cap reaching $31 billion in August 2021. But macroeconomic headwinds that started in 2022 crushed the business, and the automotive retail stock cratered. Through 2022 and 2023, the stock dropped 77%,There's a renewed sense of hope, though. Carvana stock soared 800% from Feb. 27, 2023, to Feb. 27, 2024, driven by upbeat financial results.Is it time to buy this stock?Looking at the latest numbersOn Feb. 22, Carvana reported revenue and unit volume of $2.4 billion (down 15% year over year) and 76,000 (down 13%) during the last three months of 2023. Both figures missed Wall Street estimates. And the company's volume has now dipped in two consecutive years.But Carvana impressed shareholders in another important area. The business has focused relentlessly on cutting costs, with fulll-year selling, general, and administrative expenses declining 34% in 2023. ""Right-sizing"" operations has been a focal point for the management team.Efficiencies helped Carvana hit a financial milestone. It posted positive net income of $150 million in 2023, giving bullish investors plenty to cheer about. This was after the company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion in 2022.Looking ahead, management expects retail unit volume to be higher in Q1 and for the full year of 2024 when compared to the same periods last year. Investors got excited.Staring at a huge marketCarvana's goal to completely disrupt the way people buy and sell cars hasn't changed. Despite its volatile financial results in the past couple of years, the company's addressable market remains massive. In the U.S., 36 million used cars were sold last year. The industry is also extremely fragmented.A business that is able to improve the user experience can win over customers. With its emphasis on providing shoppers with a fast, convenient, and transparent way to buy and sell vehicles, Carvana stands out in this regard.Story continuesAt the same time, the company has historically invested aggressively to build out its logistics footprint, and this hasn't come cheaply, particularly when trying to create a vertically integrated organization. But understanding the expansionary runway, the leadership team wants to develop scale advantages, which justify the huge capital outlays.It's worth pointing out that at the end of 2023, Carvana was available in 316 markets across the country, the exact same number as 12 months prior. So in order for the leadership team to get the company's financial position in a better place, it's completely halted growth plans. Of course, this is not the right strategy for the business over the long term, as shareholders will start to demand that progress toward expansion is being made. It will be important for investors to pay close attention to how executives strike the right balance between growth and profitability in the years ahead.High risk, high rewardAs of this writing, Carvana shares sit 78% below their all-time high from about 2 1/2 years ago. They trade at a price-to-sales ratio of 1.2, which is slightly above the historical average. This is after the stock has come roaring back.However, don't rush to scoop up the shares just yet as Carvana remains an extremely high-risk investment opportunity.To its credit, the company is making notable progress bringing costs under control, but growth has completely stalled. This points to how sensitive Carvana is to macro factors. The current long-term debt burden of $5.5 billion also doesn't help the situation. Investors always have to worry what direction the economy is headed in. If there's a recession, the company would unquestionably be in trouble.This stock has sizable upside, but the downside is too hard to ignore. And that's why I'm not a buyer today.Should you invest $1,000 in Carvana right now?Before you buy stock in Carvana, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carvana wasn’t one of them.

(AP) — The lawyers who successfully argued that a massive pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk was illegal and should be voided have asked the presiding judge to award them company stock worth $5.6 billion as legal fees.The attorneys, who represented Tesla shareholders in the case decided in January, made the request of the Delaware judge in court papers filed Friday.The amount would apparently be far and away the largest such award, if approved. Lawyers in class-action suits stemming from the collapse of Enron got a record $688 million in legal fees in 2008.“We are ‘prepared to eat our cooking,’” the Tesla plaintiff attorneys wrote in the court filing, arguing the sum is justified because they worked purely on a contingency basis for more than 5 years. If they lost they would have gotten nothing. The benefit to Tesla “was massive,” they said.The requested award represents 11% of the Tesla stock — worth some $55 billion — that Musk was seeking in the compensation package, which Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled illegal in January. Not only does the request take nothing from the electric car company's balance sheet, it is also tax deductible, the attorneys argued. They are also seeking $1.1 million in expenses.In her ruling, Judge McCormick accepted the shareholder lawyers' argument that Musk personally dictated the landmark 2018 pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent.It would have nearly doubled Musk's stake in Tesla. He currently holds 13%."
Motley Fool,2 Fintech Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in March,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-fintech-stocks-screaming-buys-191700238.html,These stocks both look like great buys but for two very different reasons.,"The S&P 500 is hovering around its all-time high as we head into March, but that doesn't mean that all stocks have become expensive. There are some excellent opportunities for risk-tolerant long-term investors, especially in the financial technology, or fintech, industry. Here are two companies, in particular, that look like incredible buys as winter comes to a close.A true disruptor with strong resultsLemonade (NYSE: LMND) is an insurance company that aims to disrupt the traditional model by using technology to alleviate consumer pain points. For example, claims can be processed in seconds instead of days in many cases and getting (and accepting) insurance quotes is a seamless process.In the fourth quarter, Lemonade reported surprisingly strong results. It surpassed the high end of its guidance range for revenue, in-force premium, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The latter showed that losses are narrowing rather quickly.Management said it expects to be cash-flow positive during 2025 and that the business will achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2026. With nearly $1 billion in cash and investments, the company has plenty of runway to get there.Not only did all of these metrics look great, but the company's loss ratio came in at 77% -- a big improvement over the 89% figure from the fourth quarter of 2022 and just above its 75% long-term target. (To be fair, the fourth quarter is seasonally strong for insurance profitability.)Despite the generally stellar results from the business, Lemonade's stock went down by more than 20% after the report. Not only did management's revenue guidance come in a little weaker than investors were hoping for in 2024, but the company said it's returning to growth mode in 2024 and increased growth expenses could put pressure on profitability.Even so, the company's numbers are all heading in the right direction. If management can keep the business growing and deliver on its profit targets, it could be a massive win for patient investors.Story continuesA deep-value fintech with lots of potentialIn many ways, PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) recent results were rather strong. Even though its active user base declined by 2% year over year in the fourth quarter, the company grew total payment volume by 15%, thanks to its focus on engaging its most loyal customers.The company is very profitable, generating about $5 billion in free cash flow annually. This goes along with the more than $17 billion in cash on its balance sheet.PayPal's stock has been beaten down in recent years, as user growth slowed and the company's future growth strategy has been unclear. As a result, PayPal is down about 80% from its 2021 highs.New CEO Alex Chriss, who took over a few months ago, is already rolling out several artificial intelligence (AI)-driven growth initiatives. For the time being, however, it remains to be seen whether he can return the company to meaningful revenue and earnings growth.PayPal is expected to generate $5.10 per share in earnings during 2024, so the stock trades for less than 12 times forward earnings. Long-term investors who add shares while this massive business is in the middle of a strategy shift could be handsomely rewarded.Buy for the long termI have no idea what Lemonade and PayPal stock will do in the coming weeks or months. I own shares in my portfolio because I believe in the long-term growth potential of both businesses and think both stocks will be worth considerably more in 5-10 years than they are today. I expect a bit of a roller-coaster ride along the way, but patient and risk-tolerant investors eventually might be thrilled they added these shares at current levels.Should you invest $1,000 in Lemonade right now?Before you buy stock in Lemonade, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lemonade wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"3 Must-Know Facts About Etsy, Before You Buy the Stock",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-must-know-facts-etsy-183700724.html,"This e-commerce platform is uniquely positioned, but it's facing some challenges.","In the last five years, the Nasdaq Composite Index has climbed 112%, a spectacular gain that investors can be pleased with. But not all stocks have done this well.Take Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). Its shares are only up 24% since February 2019. They even missed the market's impressive rally in 2023. Investors have completely soured on Etsy, which currently trades at a dirt cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.6.Before you buy this top e-commerce stock, here are three facts you need to know about the business.1. Marketplace business modelA typical retailer buys inventory from various suppliers, marks up the prices, then sells it to their customers. Etsy doesn't operate this way. Instead, it runs an online marketplace that connects 96.5 million active buyers and 9 million active sellers, collecting fees in the process.Consequently, Etsy doesn't own merchandise, warehouses, or trucks. This frees up capital, making Etsy an asset-light company that benefits from powerful network effects. This is a unique business model in the retail industry, more akin to eBay or Amazon's third-party marketplace, and less like Walmart or Target.Etsy's platform has shown an impressive ability to scale up in a profitable manner. The company reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4% in 2023, up from 11.8% in 2014. Each marginal transaction that occurs on the marketplace should carry high margins, given that the technological infrastructure is largely built out already.2. Macroeconomic headwindsEtsy specializes in unique, vintage, and handcrafted merchandise in a variety of product segments. During the pandemic's height, when people were flush with cash, mobility restrictions were put in place, and the economy was in a zero-rate environment, gross merchandise sales (GMS) and revenue skyrocketed.In the current economic backdrop, it's been a wildly different story. Etsy was able to grow revenue 7.1% in 2023 thanks to higher fees, but GMS declined 1.2% year over year. Ongoing macro headwinds continue to pressure consumer discretionary spending.Story continuesUnderstanding the current struggles, the leadership team recently announced that it was laying off 11% of the workforce to better match expenses with demand trends.""While the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we need to acknowledge and adjust for today's realities,"" CEO Josh Silverman said. ""We are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment.""If there's a recession on the horizon, no matter how low economists think the chances are, it's hard to be optimistic about how Etsy will fare in the near term. People might delay making purchases until they feel confident about the state of the economy.3. Massive addressable marketAccording to executives, Etsy's total addressable market (TAM) is valued at $466 billion. Using its 2023 GMS sum, the business commands just a tiny 2.8% of this massive amount. Investors should take forecasted market opportunity metrics with a grain of salt. Management teams use these to drum up interest from new and existing shareholders, often severely overestimating the total. Keep this in mind, even with Etsy.The Etsy management team's TAM figure includes all online sales for relevant product categories in its seven core markets, which include the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, France, Australia, and India. While it's probably not realistic to assume Etsy can capture this entire opportunity, it still shows you that the end market is huge. To me, that still indicates sizable growth potential ahead.If Etsy is on your watch list, you can use these three facts outlined here to make a better decision about the stock.Should you invest $1,000 in Etsy right now?Before you buy stock in Etsy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Etsy wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Reasons to Buy Moderna Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-buy-moderna-stock-181000927.html,The company can still deliver excellent returns.,"The past four years have been a roller-coaster ride for Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA). The mRNA-focused vaccine maker rose to prominence following a successful attempt at developing a coronavirus vaccine.However, the stock fell out of favor once sales of the company's only product on the market started moving in the wrong direction. Moderna's shares are down by 30% in the past year, but their total return over the past four years is 230%, and there remain good reasons to invest in the company.MRNA Total Return Level Chart1. Gaining market shareThough the coronavirus vaccine market is no longer as lucrative as it once was, it isn't going away completely. COVID-19 was one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. in 2023. Millions of people, particularly those who have underlying conditions that make them more at risk of hospitalization and death, will continue to get inoculated every year.So Moderna should continue to generate sales from this market. Things are looking good on that front: The numbers show that Moderna is improving its position in the coronavirus vaccine space. The biotech had a 48% share of the U.S. market in the fall of 2023, compared to 37% in the comparable period of 2022.Moderna has substantially closed the gap on its biggest rival, Pfizer. In 2022, Moderna had sales of $18.4 billion, compared to $37.8 billion for Pfizer. Last year, it was $6.7 billion to $11.2 billion in sales, still in favor of Pfizer. But that's a much smaller difference than in 2022.Things are a bit more complicated for 2024. Moderna expects $4 billion in sales for the year, but that won't be solely from its COVID-19 franchise. At least $3 billion should be from coronavirus-related sales. And even if you take the lower end of that COVID franchise guidance, the company would still gain ground on Pfizer's estimated $5 billion in coronavirus vaccine revenue this year.Even though the coronavirus vaccine market won't be as important for Moderna in future years, the company's success in gaining ground against its most notable competitor is great.Story continues2. A potential catalystModerna seems close to launching a non-coronavirus product. Last year, the company's investigational vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mRNA-1345, reported positive results in a phase 3 clinical trial. The biotech submitted applications to various regulatory authorities, including in the U.S., and expects a response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May.The RSV market is still new; the first vaccines earned approval just last year. But RSV is especially dangerous for seniors and Moderna estimates this market could hit peak sales of $10 billion. It was worth just $2.5 billion in 2023.As CEO Stéphane Bancel pointed out in an earnings call this month with analysts, ""This is quite impressive given it was the first year the RSV vaccines were available. They were not even available for a full year, and the products were not approved in many countries."" In other words, Moderna isn't too late to the party. The company's RSV vaccine could contribute meaningfully to its top line and help it decrease its reliance on its coronavirus franchise.3. A deep pipelineBeyond mRNA-1345, Moderna has several products in its late-stage pipeline that could hit the market within the next three years. It is running a phase 3 study for a vaccine for cytomegalovirus, an area where there are no approved options yet. Moderna is also developing a combination COVID-influenza vaccine that's in late-stage studies.The biotech teamed up with another major player in the industry, Merck, to test its cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, in a phase 3 study. In a midstage study, mRNA-4157, in combination with Merck's famous cancer drug Keytruda, was able to decrease the risk of recurrence or death in melanoma patients.There is significant potential in Moderna's late-stage pipeline and the biotech has many programs in phase 2 studies that should make substantial progress in the years ahead. In total, Moderna has more than two dozen candidates in the works. That's one more reason why, despite recent struggles, Moderna looks like an excellent biotech stock to buy and hold.Should you invest $1,000 in Moderna right now?Before you buy stock in Moderna, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Moderna wasn’t one of them.

Yahoo Finance,How Trump has talked about stocks under Biden — in 5 stages,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-trump-has-talked-about-stocks-under-biden--in-5-stages-180052595.html,"Donald Trump has not been shy about discussing stocks since he left office in 2021, with his rhetoric changing dramatically depending on the market's ups and downs.","Donald Trump has not been shy about discussing the stock market since he left office in 2021, with his rhetoric changing dramatically depending on Wall Street's ups and downs.He kept taking credit for a rally even after he departed Washington; he compared a 2022 downturn to the Great Depression; he downplayed the recovery; and he is now back to taking credit (while also predicting a crash).There are in total at least five distinct phases of how Trump has talked about the performance of Wall Street in the 37 months since Biden succeeded him, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis of his comments.What the analysis shows is how Trump's comments one day can be diametrically opposed to what he said months or weeks before.But his continued focus on this issue points to a campaign season ahead where market fluctuations may be oft-discussed, especially after President Joe Biden recently bragged on the market highs after years of avoiding the topic.""If he's elected,"" Trump said in 2020 while pointing across the debate stage at Biden, ""the stock market will crash.""It didn't, of course. Far from it.Here are the ways Trump has revised and extended his remarks in the years since.Stage 1: Taking credit as the market rose in 2021The S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed at 3,798.91 on Jan. 19, 2021, just before Biden was sworn into office. The market would spend much of the rest of the year headed upward, with the index ending 2021 at 4,766.18, an increase of more than 25%.With Trump's prediction of a crash clearly not panning out, the now-former president chose instead to keep taking credit.In a February 2021 speech — after having been out of office for over a month — Trump was still talking about ""our stock market.""""Your 401(k)s are again at record levels, higher than ever before actually,"" he told a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference.Former President Donald Trump before speaking during the final day of the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb 28, 2021, in Orlando, Fla. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)Trump also often claimed — in a theme that he has echoed countless times up to today — that he doesn't get enough credit for the rebound in stock prices in late 2020 after a fall in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.Story continues""We did something amazing and the stock market was higher in the end,"" he said just last month during a town hall on Fox News.Stages 2 and 3: Blaming Biden as the market turns south and downplaying a reboundThe years 2022 and 2023 were bumpier times for markets.The S&P 500 closed at a record high of 4,796.56 on Jan. 3, 2022. It was a high-water mark that wouldn't be bested for over two years and Trump pivoted during that time to blaming Biden.""We are a failing nation,"" he told a crowd of Ohioans in November 2022, pointing to the lower stock market as key evidence.""Does anybody have a 401(k)? Raise your hand if you're happy with it,"" he added before an Iowa crowd in March 2023. ""I'll tell you this, they were happy when I was running this country.""He also stretched credulity by comparing 2022, which saw the market fall by 18%, to the crash that began in 1929 that cost stocks 90% of their value between 1929 and 1932.Former President Donald Trump speaks during an event at the Adler Theatre on Monday, March 13, 2023, in Davenport, Iowa. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) (The Washington Post via Getty Images)The good news for investors (and Biden) was that the market soon recovered and notched gains throughout 2023. It began breaking all-time records by the end of the year.This led to a brief — and very un-Trumplike — phase where the former president tried to downplay the stock market as an important indicator.""The stock market is making rich people richer,"" he disapprovingly told a crowd in Durham, N.H., in December soon after the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hit a new record high and topped 37,000 for the first time.He offered similar comments in Reno the next day and charged Biden with overseeing an economy ""collapsing into a cesspool.""Stages 4 and 5: Taking credit and predicting a crash (again)But Trump pivoted again early this year as he began winning primary contests.He took advantage of market highs in January that coincided with his victories in Iowa and New Hampshire.He claimed, without evidence, that the highs were due to his wins and the increasing chances of a second Trump administration.""As soon as it becomes clear on election night that we've defeated crooked Joe Biden, you will see your 401(k) soar and you already see it,"" Trump told a New Hampshire crowd the day after winning the Iowa caucus. He claimed prices rise ""every time we have a good poll or every time we have a night like we did last night.""But stocks were actually down on Jan. 16, the day after Trump's Iowa victory. That day's trading session was focused on other issues such as bad news for Boeing (BA), which dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 230 points. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also saw declines that day.Trump-linked stocks like Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC), on the other hand, were up that day.Former president and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump speaks at a watch party during the 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses in Des Moines, Iowa, on January 15, 2024. (JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JIM WATSON via Getty Images)Now as Trump has settled into the role of the likely GOP nominee, his rhetoric has shifted again. Call it stage five. He's returned to his claim that the election of Biden will result in an economic crash.Trump's rallies often end with the former president speaking in dramatic tones over a soaring orchestral song. A recent addition to that climactic routine has been a new mention of stocks.""We are a nation whose stock market's continued success is contingent upon MAGA winning the next election,"" he told a crowd in New Hampshire in January as the music swelled.The full-circle nature of Trump's commentary was underlined a few weeks later in South Carolina when he again returned to an old favorite: the Great Depression.""If we don't win the next election, the stock market will crash just like it did in 1929,"" he said.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.Click here for politics news related to business and moneyRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
Motley Fool,The Case For Taking a Shot On GoPro Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-taking-shot-gopro-stock-173700708.html,"The worst-case scenario appears to be fully priced in, and there's still measurable value.","Let there be no confusion -- buying a stock because you think the company is an acquisition target isn't investing. It's certainly not in line with our Foolish philosophy, which (among other things) suggests holding proven, quality brands for the long haul. All-or-nothing bets just aren't our thing.Every once in a blue Moon, however, a potential buyout candidate just so happens to be one because the market appears to be undervaluing that company's brand, operation, and future prospects.That's arguably where GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) is right now. The stock's miserable performance over the past decade may have wrung out the majority of its possible downside, and then some. The market may even be underestimating where the company could be within just a few years.That still doesn't make it a great fit for every investor's portfolio. Indeed, it's probably not a name that makes sense for lots of investors. But if you're sensing a potential high-risk/high-reward opportunity in beleaguered shares of GoPro stock though, you're not crazy.More hype than was ever meritedTo say GoPro failed to live up to its 2014 initial public offering's hype is quite an understatement. Shares traded near $28 at their debut, and then quickly soared to almost $100 as investors clamored for a piece of the young action camera company. Now the stock is testing record lows just above $2. That's a 98% pullback from its peak.What went wrong? It's not too tough to figure out -- the world just didn't need anywhere near the number of action cameras GoPro suggested would be needed. This year's expected revenue of $1 billion is well below 2015's annualized high of $1.8 billion.Analysts aren't calling for any sales growth next year either. The consensus among the few analysts still keeping tabs on this stock suggests that a swing back to a slight profit is in the cards for 2025, but even then it's just not enough to matter -- at least, not yet.Story continuesThere's still a bullish case to be made here, however, even if it is a tad unusual. That's GoPro's value to a prospective buyer versus its low cost. The entire company could be bought right now for little more than a song. Even if a prospective suitor doesn't see this, there's a chance the market as a whole might.It's certainly affordable enoughAs of the most recent look, GoPro's market capitalization is right at $330 million. That's far less than the average acquisition within the technology arena, including Microsoft's $1 billion acquisition of digital ad platform Xandr in 2021 and Alphabet's 2022 purchase of augmented reality name Raxium for a cool $1 billion. Deals of this size just don't turn heads anymore. The acquirer can often just write a check to make it happen.That's not to suggest GoPro could simply be bought in its entirety for a little more than $300 million. There's also its debt and other liabilities to cover. The company's got roughly $280 million in near-term bills to pay, plus another $133 million in long-term liabilities. On the flipside, GoPro's also sitting on nearly $1 billion worth of real assets like inventory, accounts receivable, property, and some $200,000 worth of cash.While assets never quite seem to be worth as much as hoped in the event of a sale (and liabilities have a funny way of being greater than first figured), the plausible net difference between GoPro's assets and liabilities is still greater than the company's current market capitalization.The brand and underlying tech are the prizeThe real prize here, however, isn't the company's assets and existing operation. It's the brand name itself, along with its underlying technology. In the right hands, GoPro's action camera brand could be so much more than it currently is. What that might look like still isn't entirely clear, admittedly.We do know that the company's tech is top-of-the-line; its cameras are consistently rated as the best within the action camera category. What's missing, however, is a big enough digital ecosystem to give GoPro camera owners good reason to not only use their devices, but also a reason and ways to share their videos with others. In this vein, GoPro's subscription-based video sharing and viewing platform's user base and annual revenue is stagnating at only 2.5 million and $100 million, respectively.Perhaps something more along the lines of Alphabet's YouTube would prove a more potent (revenue-bearing) platform. We've certainly seen Alphabet do something like this before. It acquired then-struggling fitness tracker company Fitbit in 2021 under very similar circumstances. And it's continued to promote the brand's fitness devices, steering its users toward Google's broader online ecosystem.Apple has also been suggested as a potential GoPro suitor although that pairing's potential synergies aren't quite as clear. And yet, it doesn't even have to be another organization that unlocks the action camera company's potential. GoPro could also do the same for itself even if it might take a bit more work, some fresh capital, and a little more outside-the-box thinking.It's already doing such work, in fact. Some of its newer initiatives include lower-priced, entry level cameras. It's also developing new sponsorships and partnerships, any of which could be the one that sparks an explosion of interest in its tech. For instance, in January it acquired motorcycle helmet maker Forcite, entering a $6 billion market supported by consumers that love to film their rides.The bigger point is, there's still something can be done with the brand and its tech. Whether it's the company itself or a suitor that makes it happen, GoPro shares are pretty darn cheap given the strides it's made in the past decade. The fact that GoPro is already operating near breakeven only bolsters the bullish argument.Just keep in mind that this isn't the right stock for everyone as it brings above-average risk along with above-average volatility. Anyone who can stomach the risk will still want to keep a position relatively small.Should you invest $1,000 in GoPro right now?Before you buy stock in GoPro, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and GoPro wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Rivian Automotive Stock Has 26% Upside, According to This Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-automotive-stock-26-upside-170400396.html,The electric vehicle maker will have to solve its cost problem to boost investor confidence.,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) received several downgrades from analysts in the wake of its fourth-quarter earnings report released on Feb. 21. Revenue more than doubled last year, but rising interest rates are starting to take a toll on electric vehicle (EV) demand. Management expects production in 2024 to be flat year over year at 57,000 units.Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock to $14 from $24. The new price target is 26% higher than Rivian's current share price. Despite the negative sentiment around the stock right now, Morgan Stanley is still optimistic about Rivian's future, as it maintained an overweight (buy) rating on the stock.Why Wall Street analysts remain bullish on Rivian's long-term prospectsThe average analyst recommendation still has a buy rating on the stock. Optimism on the company's future is based on Rivian's emerging brand in electric vehicles and sophisticated online car buying experience. It also continues to be backed by Amazon, which held 158 million shares of Rivian class A common stock at the end of 2023.Vehicle sales are always going to fluctuate with the direction of interest rates, but the real reason investors are souring on Rivian is that the company is losing a lot of money. It needs to scale up its vehicle production to leverage its cost structure and turn a profit. But Rivian's adjusted free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, which was greater than the $1.3 billion it generated in revenue.Wall Street's short-term focus shouldn't mean much to long-term investors, but analysts' opinions can significantly impact the sentiment around the stock price. Rivian's weak outlook means the stock isn't likely to rebound until interest rates come down, or the company shows improvement in bringing costs down.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.
