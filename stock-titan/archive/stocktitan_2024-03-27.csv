The study showed a favorable safety profile and consistent efficacy across multiple endpoints, supporting proof-of-concept. The decision is backed by promising biomarker data, indicating a potential alternative treatment for patients with unmet medical needs. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The advancement of efgartigimod into Phase 3 for primary Sjogren's disease represents a significant milestone in argenx's clinical development pipeline. The progression is based on a comprehensive analysis of the Phase 2 RHO study, which indicates a favorable safety profile and efficacy across multiple clinical endpoints. The impact of these findings is substantial due to the lack of approved therapies targeting the underlying mechanisms of Sjogren's disease, a condition that predominantly affects women and is characterized by its diverse and often misdiagnosed symptoms.From a medical research perspective, the utilization of the Composite of Relevant Endpoints for Sjogren's Syndrome (CRESS) and the EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Activity Index (ESSDAI) in the RHO study design is noteworthy. These endpoints are important for assessing systemic disease activity and patient-reported outcomes, which are central to evaluating the potential benefits of new therapies in autoimmune diseases. The positive correlation between these endpoints and biomarker data enhances the credibility of the results and supports the therapeutic hypothesis of efgartigimod's mechanism of action.As the study moves into Phase 3, the focus will be on confirming these findings in a larger patient population and further establishing the drug's safety and efficacy profile. The long-term implications for stakeholders include the potential for efgartigimod to become a first-in-class treatment for Sjogren's disease, addressing a significant unmet medical need and potentially improving the quality of life for patients suffering from this chronic condition. Biotech Financial Analyst The transition of efgartigimod into Phase 3 trials holds financial implications for argenx SE and its investors. The positive outcomes from the Phase 2 RHO study suggest a strong potential for the drug to meet an unmet need in the market for primary Sjogren's disease treatments. This progression could positively influence investor sentiment and the valuation of argenx, as the market often responds favorably to advancements in drug development that have the potential to address untapped markets.Investors should consider the costs associated with Phase 3 clinical trials, which are typically more substantial than earlier phases due to the larger scale and longer duration. However, the investment in these trials could be justified by the potential market size for Sjogren's disease treatments. The financial success of efgartigimod will depend on several factors, including the final clinical trial results, the drug's safety profile, market acceptance and the competitive landscape. If approved, efgartigimod could provide a new revenue stream for argenx, enhancing its portfolio and market position in the immunology sector.It is also important to note that the biotech industry is subject to high volatility based on clinical trial outcomes. Therefore, while the advancement to Phase 3 is promising, it is essential for stakeholders to remain aware of the inherent risks and uncertainties that accompany drug development. Healthcare Market Analyst The advancement of efgartigimod for primary Sjogren's disease into Phase 3 trials is indicative of the drug's potential to capture a significant share of the autoimmune disease treatment market. The current landscape for Sjogren's disease is characterized by a lack of targeted therapies, which presents a considerable opportunity for argenx. The company's strategic focus on immunology and severe autoimmune diseases aligns with the growing demand for innovative treatments in this area.Market analysis suggests that if efgartigimod is successful in Phase 3 and gains regulatory approval, it could disrupt the current treatment paradigm for Sjogren's disease. The drug's ability to address multiple efficacy scales and its favorable safety profile could make it a preferred option for healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, the focus on biomarker measures in the RHO study could facilitate personalized medicine approaches, further differentiating efgartigimod in the market.Long-term market success will hinge on strategic pricing, effective marketing and the establishment of strong distribution channels. Payer acceptance and reimbursement will also play critical roles in the commercial viability of the drug. As the healthcare market continues to evolve, with an increasing emphasis on outcomes-based medicine and patient-centric care, treatments like efgartigimod that demonstrate clear clinical benefits and align with these trends are well-positioned for success. 03/27/2024 - 02:00 AM RHO study supports proof-of-concept in primary Sjogren’s disease Decision informed by favorable safety profile and consistency across efficacy and biomarker measures March 27, 2024, 7:00 AM CET Amsterdam, the Netherlands – argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases, today announced its plan to continue the development of efgartigimod to Phase 3 in adults with primary Sjogren’s disease (SjD), following the analysis of topline data from the Phase 2 RHO study. Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting. “We are excited to be advancing efgartigimod’s development in Sjogren’s disease based on the totality of the data generated from the RHO study,” said Luc Truyen, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Consistent with our indication selection strategy, we confirmed our IgG biology hypothesis with these data, and now have a demonstrated clinical effect across multiple efficacy scales to support proof-of-concept. Sjogren’s disease can be debilitating, predominantly affects women, and given its heterogeneous nature, is often misdiagnosed with its symptoms poorly understood. With no current approved therapies to treat the underlying disease, the unmet need is substantial, and we recognize the opportunity to advance a new potential alternative treatment to these patients.” The decision to advance the clinical development of efgartigimod in SjD was supported by the safety, efficacy and biomarker results from the study. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials. Efficacy assessments showed a treatment effect across multiple clinical endpoints, which were also consistent with biomarker data. RHO Study Design The Phase 2 RHO study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adults with SjD. In order to enter the study, patients needed to test positive for anti-Ro autoantibodies and maintain residual salivary flow. Thirty four patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either efgartigimod or placebo for up to 24 weeks. Multiple endpoints and biomarkers were evaluated in the signal-finding study, including the primary endpoint of CRESS (Composite of Relevant Endpoints for Sjogren’s Syndrome). Within CRESS there are five components spanning: systemic disease activity as measured by the ESSDAI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Activity Index), patient reported outcomes as measured by the ESSPRI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index), tear and salivary gland function and serology. To be a CRESS responder, patients needed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in at least 3 of the 5 composite items. Additional datapoints were gathered including the clinESSDAI, STAR (Sjogren’s Tool for Assessing Response), biomarker data, and the change in lymphocytic infiltrate levels through parotid biopsies. About Sjogren’s Disease Sjogren’s Disease (SjD) is a chronic, slowly progressive inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of exocrine glands. SjD can be severely debilitating and have a negative impact on patient quality of life, with common symptoms reported as dry eyes and mouth, fatigue, joint point and impaired cognitive function. In addition, a substantial subset of patients suffer from extraglandular systemic disease. While the presence of anti-Ro and anti-LA IgG autoantibodies are considered a hallmark of disease, the underlying cause of SjD is believed to be multi-factorial, triggered by environmental factors, leading to auto-immunity and chronic inflammation. SjD predominantly impacts women with a 9:1 female:male incidence ratio. Given the heterogeneous nature of the disease, the treatment journey can be challenging with long delays and high rates of misdiagnosis. There are no FDA-approved treatments targeting the disease itself, leaving current treatments to focus primarily on individual symptom management. About Efgartigimod Efgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies, including neuromuscular disorders, blood disorders, and skin blistering diseases, in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. Efgartigimod is marketed as VYVGART® for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in more than 30 regions globally and immune thrombocytopenia in Japan.

This aligns with UBS's strategy to wind down its Non-Core and Legacy portfolio. UBS expects a net gain of around USD 0.3 billion, while Credit Suisse AG anticipates a net loss of around USD 0.9 billion. The agreement marks Atlas' evolution into an independent platform. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction detailed in the announcement represents a strategic shift for UBS and Apollo, with implications for their financial health and operational focus. UBS's decision to sell off USD 8 billion of senior secured financing facilities to Apollo is a move to streamline its operations by divesting from its Non-Core and Legacy (NCL) portfolio. This action aligns with UBS's broader strategy to simplify its business model and reduce its risk-weighted assets, which is likely to be positively received by investors seeking stability and a clear focus from financial institutions.From a financial perspective, the net gain of approximately USD 0.3 billion that UBS expects to recognize in the first quarter of 2024 is significant. It not only reflects the immediate financial benefit of the transaction but also suggests a savvy negotiation on the part of UBS, capitalizing on the value of these assets. However, the net loss of around USD 0.9 billion expected to be recognized by Credit Suisse AG indicates a stark contrast in financial outcomes between the two entities, likely stemming from different accounting treatments under IFRS and US GAAP. Investors should note these accounting discrepancies as they may influence the perceived performance and valuation of these companies. Market Research Analyst Looking at the market implications, UBS's move to offload parts of its NCL portfolio to Apollo can be seen as part of a larger trend where banks are seeking to become more agile by shedding non-core assets. This trend is partly driven by regulatory pressures to maintain higher capital ratios and partly by a strategic shift towards more profitable core businesses. For Apollo, the acquisition of these financing facilities is a clear indicator of its ambition to grow its Atlas platform, showcasing a strategic pivot towards investment grade asset-backed origination. This could signal to the market Apollo's intention to become a more significant player in this space.The announcement also highlights the success of Atlas in capital raising and origination, which may attract investor interest due to the platform's proven capability to generate substantial originations and secure capital for client assets. The record figures cited for Atlas's origination and capital raising activities suggest robust performance and growth potential, which may influence investor sentiment and the valuation of Apollo's shares in the market. Risk Management Expert From a risk management perspective, this transaction is indicative of UBS's commitment to reducing its leverage ratio denominator and risk-weighted assets, which are critical measures of financial stability. By selling these senior secured financing facilities, UBS is effectively transferring the associated credit risk to Apollo. This move should improve UBS's capital efficiency and potentially its credit ratings, which could lead to lower borrowing costs and a more favorable risk profile. For Apollo, while the acquisition increases its exposure to the credit market, it also represents a calculated expansion into a field where it sees potential for growth. The management of these newly acquired assets will be a test of Apollo's risk assessment and mitigation strategies, which will be closely watched by stakeholders. 03/27/2024 - 01:45 AM ZURICH & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: Ad hoc announcement of Credit Suisse AG pursuant to Article 53 of the SIX Exchange Regulation Listing Rules UBS (NYSE:UBS) (SWX:UBSN) and Apollo today announced that they have entered into an agreement pursuant to which ATLAS SP (Atlas) has concluded its Transition Services Agreement with UBS and UBS will close out its Investment Management Agreement with Atlas. As part of this agreement, Apollo will purchase USD 8 billion of senior secured financing facilities from UBS. This mutually beneficial agreement aligns with UBS’s strategy of winding down and simplifying its Non-Core and Legacy (NCL) portfolio and with Apollo’s continued momentum in growing Atlas as a standalone origination platform. For UBS, these actions will allow the bank to further accelerate its plans to unwind and more efficiently simplify its NCL portfolio, while minimizing any disruption to clients, and reduce risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio denominator in NCL. UBS Group expects to recognize a net gain in the first quarter of 2024 of around USD 0.3 billion from the conclusion of these agreements and the assignment of the senior secured financing facilities while Credit Suisse AG is expected to recognize a net loss of around USD 0.9 billion. The differences reflect adjustments UBS Group made under IFRS as part of the purchase price allocation at the closing of the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group, as well as provisions made by UBS Group in the second and third quarter of 2023 that are not recognised under Credit Suisse AG’s US GAAP accounting policies. For Atlas and Apollo, the agreement marks Atlas’ evolution into a fully independent platform focused on investment grade asset-backed origination. Commenting on the transaction, Sergio P. Ermotti, UBS Group CEO said: “We’re pleased with this mutual agreement with Apollo. As we execute on our integration plans, this is another example of our relentless focus on working with clients and counterparties to free up capital from Non-Core activities and reducing costs and complexity.” Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo, also commented: “We are pleased to finalize the Atlas transition in partnership with UBS, in an economically neutral manner for our firm. This caps off a quarter marked by record origination and capital raising for Atlas, where we have generated USD 24 billion originations since inception and have secured capital to support over USD 40 billion of client assets.” Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This media release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The partnership between Arqit Quantum Inc. and Vayana TradeXchange represents a strategic move in the financial technology sector, particularly in the area of supply chain finance. The utilization of Arqit's TradeSecure™ technology could potentially streamline the process of securing working capital for businesses engaged in international trade, tapping into a $17 trillion market.From a financial perspective, this partnership may lead to increased efficiency and reduced transaction costs, which can improve the profit margins for both exporters and importers. The focus on digital negotiable instruments (DNIs) aligns with the global trend towards the digitalisation of financial services, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging DNIs, businesses could have quicker access to liquidity, which is essential for maintaining cash flow and operations, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).Investors and stakeholders in Arqit Quantum Inc. may view this partnership as a positive development, given the potential for market expansion and the company's compliance with new digital asset legislation. However, it is important to monitor the adoption rate of the technology and the partnership's ability to scale, as these will be key indicators of its long-term success and impact on the stock performance of Arqit. Legal Expert The adherence to the UN’s Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) by countries like India, Singapore, the UAE and the UK is a significant legal milestone that facilitates the use of digital negotiable instruments. This legal framework provides the necessary legal recognition for DNIs to serve as a substitute for traditional paper-based contracts, which has historically been a barrier to the digital transformation of trade finance.Arqit's compliance with these legal standards, as well as their focus on provable security, addresses a critical concern in the digitalisation of assets: cybersecurity. The legal review completed by Arqit ensures that their digital finance instruments meet the stringent requirements that come with handling sensitive financial transactions. It is this legal robustness that may give them a competitive edge in the market and could become a deciding factor for businesses when choosing a trade finance platform.However, the long-term impact of these legal changes and their acceptance by the broader financial community will be important to the partnership's success. It is important for stakeholders to keep an eye on regulatory developments and international harmonization of laws pertaining to digital assets, as these can significantly influence the trajectory of digital trade finance. Market Research Analyst The market for supply chain finance is growing steadily and the introduction of digital negotiable instruments could act as a catalyst for further growth. The partnership's initial focus on key markets like India, Singapore, the UAE and the UK is strategic, as these nations are at the forefront of trade finance digitalisation. This regional focus aligns with the broader trend of economic digital transformation, which has been identified as a key driver for future economic growth.With India's export trade projected to reach $2 trillion by 2030, the demand for efficient trade finance solutions is expected to surge. This presents a significant opportunity for Arqit and Vayana TradeXchange to capture a sizable portion of the market. The ability of DNIs to provide a secure and efficient means of accessing working capital could make them highly attractive to a wide range of businesses, potentially leading to rapid adoption and market penetration.Nonetheless, it is essential to consider the competitive landscape and potential challenges such as technology adoption barriers, the readiness of financial institutions to embrace DNIs and the need for continuous innovation to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving market. Monitoring the partnership's performance metrics and market response will be key in evaluating its impact on the business landscape. 03/27/2024 - 12:00 AM LONDON, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arqit Quantum Inc.

Positive None.

The purpose of the meeting is to vote on several specific items: the election of three nominees to the Board of Directors (the Board); adjustments to the Company's share capital; matters related to the Board and Executive Committee compensation and discharge; and textual amendments to conform the Articles of Association to the new corporate law. We believe such measures enjoy support of the Company's largest shareholder and will enhance the Company's flexibility for future financial operations and business opportunities.AGENDA1. Election of new members of the Board of DirectorsShareholders will vote on the election of Mr. Peter de Svastich, Mr. Gregory Van Beek, and Mr. Thomas Elzinga as new members of the Board, for a term of office extending until completion of the next Annual General Meeting expected in June 2024. The three nominees are being proposed by Global Emerging Markets (GEM), the Company's largest shareholder with approximately 23% of the Company's outstanding share capital. Detailed presentations about the Board nominees can be found in the comprehensive agenda, available here .Ms. Patrice Jean and Mr. Thomas Plitz, current Board members, announced their intent to conclude their service upon the election of the Board nominees. Mr. Selvaraju, Chairman of the Board, and Ms. Lock, member of the Board and interim CEO of the Company, will continue their service.2. Capital Reduction by Reduction of Nominal ValueThe Board proposes to reduce the nominal value of the Company's share capital from CHF 56'163'348.00 to CHF 1'404'083.70 by reducing the nominal value of each share from CHF 4.00 to CHF 0.10. This technical adjustment comes as the share currently quotes at a price below its par value. This situation presents practical implications, including limiting the Company's ability to raise capital. The number of outstanding shares, as well as shareholders' financial and patrimonial rights, will not be affected by the reduction in par value. The modification of the share capital shall render the capital band provisions under the Articles of Association void.3. Reinstatement and Extension of the Capital BandSubject to and contingent upon the approval of the reduction of nominal value (second agenda item above), the Board proposes to reinstate and increase the Company's capital band to 7'000'000 shares and extend its duration until April 25, 2029, maintaining a capital band authorizing capital increases of not more than 50% of the ordinary share capital. The proposed capital band will allow the Board to maintain full flexibility in connection with possible future financing and business opportunities.4. Increase of the Conditional Share CapitalSubject to and contingent upon the approval of the reduction of nominal value (second agenda item above), the Board proposes to increase the existing conditional share capital to 7'000'000 shares, maintaining a total conditional share capital of around but not more than 50% of the ordinary share capital. The allocation of the conditional capital is proposed as follows: 1'000'000 shares are designated for the potential granting of stock options to attract and retain key personnel, aligning their interests with those of the shareholders, and 6'000'000 shares are reserved for issuing of financial instruments convertible into shares in support of future financing and business opportunities.5. Votes on the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Executive CommitteeThe Board proposes that the General Meeting approves a maximum amount of CHF 500'000 for compensation of the members of the Board for the period from the Annual General Meeting 2023 until the Annual General Meeting 2024, and a maximum amount of CHF 4'000'000 for the members of the Executive Committee for the financial year 2024. These compensation envelopes are inclusive of fixed and variable compensation, stock options, and other benefits.6. Discharge of the Board of Directors and the Executive CommitteeThe Board proposes that the General Meeting grants discharge to each and all members of the Board and of the Executive Committee, including former members, for the financial years 2022 and 2023. Pursuant to Swiss corporate law, discharge for the financial year 2023 will be limited to facts disclosed by the Company or known by the Company's shareholders as of the time of the meeting.7. Amendments to the Articles of Association related to the New Corporate LawThe Board proposes textual amendments to article 23 para. 1 and article 25 para. 3 of the Articles of Association for alignment with the new corporate law.The formal notice of convocation to the EGM, including voting guidelines, will be sent on or around April 4, 2024, to registered shareholders.

Nasdaq Study Shows Structural Reform Needed to Unlock Global Carbon Markets,2024-03-27T07:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Nasdaq's global survey on the voluntary carbon market reveals challenges in price transparency, market inefficiencies, and fragmentation, hindering market scale. Carbon credit registries are crucial to addressing these issues and unlocking industry potential.","Nasdaq Study Shows Structural Reform Needed to Unlock Global Carbon Markets Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nasdaq's global survey on the voluntary carbon market reveals challenges in price transparency, market inefficiencies, and fragmentation, hindering market scale. Carbon credit registries are crucial to addressing these issues and unlocking industry potential. Positive None. Negative Challenges in issuance, verification, trading, reporting, and retirement processes constrain demand and market evolution. Low confidence in pricing of carbon assets hampers trading efficiency and supply modeling. Inconsistency across credit types, manual interactions, and lack of standardization limit market accessibility and scale. Widespread fragmentation with multiple registries leads to isolated liquidity pools and increased costs. Registries are identified as key facilitators for market improvement, driving confidence through quality assurance and standardization. Environmental Economist The findings from the Nasdaq survey shed light on the economic complexities of the voluntary carbon market (VCM). The primary concern highlighted is the lack of price transparency, which is a fundamental issue in any market as it leads to inefficiencies and hinders the discovery of the true market price. This is particularly problematic in a market that is pivotal to the global response to climate change. The survey indicates that market fragmentation and inefficiencies are also major barriers to scaling up, which is concerning given the urgent need to grow these markets to meet climate goals.From an economic standpoint, the reliance on manual processes and the lack of standardization contribute to high transaction costs, which can deter market participation and investment. These structural issues are creating bottlenecks that prevent the market from achieving the necessary scale. The role of carbon credit registries is important in this context, as they can facilitate standardization and automation, leading to reduced transaction costs and increased market confidence. However, the challenge remains in coordinating a global effort to reform these registries and align market participants towards common standards. Market Infrastructure Analyst The voluntary carbon market's infrastructure is evidently in need of modernization. The survey highlights that 66% of commercial banks lack confidence in pricing, which is a significant impediment to capital deployment. This is indicative of a broader issue where the current market structure doesn't support efficient risk modeling or capital allocation. The reliance on manual interactions for project listings is another concern, as it suggests that the market is lagging behind other financial markets in terms of technological adoption.Exchange trading is identified as a potential solution to increase transparency and liquidity, with a majority of respondents favoring this model. This aligns with broader financial market trends where centralized trading venues enhance price discovery and market efficiency. The support from governments and regulatory authorities for exchange venues is a positive sign, yet the focus must also shift to improving post-trade infrastructure. The role of registries as facilitators of market confidence and standardization cannot be overstated, as they hold the key to unlocking the market's potential through the adoption of new technologies and international standards. Sustainability Strategy Consultant The survey's implications for businesses and investors are multifaceted. The growing demand for carbon credits, driven by ESG priorities, indicates a shift in corporate strategy towards sustainability. However, the current market limitations are stifling this demand, which suggests that companies may face challenges in meeting their sustainability targets. The desire of corporates to double their exposure to carbon credits also signifies the increasing importance of carbon markets in corporate sustainability strategies.For the market to evolve in a way that supports these corporate ambitions, it will require not just technological improvements but a strategic overhaul of market practices. Companies looking to expand their activity in the VCM must advocate for and participate in the development of a more standardized and transparent market. In doing so, they can ensure their investments in carbon credits are both impactful and aligned with their ESG goals. The survey underscores the need for a coordinated approach among all market participants to overcome the current challenges and enable the VCM to reach its full potential. 03/27/2024 - 03:00 AM Price transparency, market inefficiencies, and fragmentation remain critical structural barriers to scale Carbon credit registry reform is the most important facilitator of growth NEW YORK, March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today published the results of a global survey examining the voluntary carbon market (VCM) ecosystem, with responses from over 130 decision-makers across project owners, financial investors, commercial banks, brokers, and market operators, produced in partnership with the ValueExchange. The survey reveals that the market for voluntary carbon credits is growing and attracting more diverse participants, but price transparency, market inefficiencies and fragmentation are preventing scale. Carbon credit registries are seen as having the power to address many of these challenges and unlock the potential of the industry. Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of European Market Services, at Nasdaq said: “Global carbon markets are at a critical juncture. Truly scalable, trusted carbon markets can have a profound and lasting impact; the question is how we get there. By identifying the structural inefficiencies holding the market back, we can propose long-term solutions and help build global consensus. Addressing these barriers to scale can only come from a coordinated push from policymakers, market infrastructure providers, and participants across the financial services ecosystem.” Demand for carbons credits is being constrained Demand for carbon credits arises from a broad range of players and objectives: 67% of corporates are driven by their ESG priorities, 50% of commercial banks purchase credits to decarbonize their investment portfolio, and 45% of investors are primarily seeking a financial return. There is also a clear desire for companies to expand their activity with more than half of corporates expressing a desire to double their exposure to the asset class. However, despite the diversified demand for carbon credits, current market structures are stifling demand as well as the broader evolution of the market. Challenges in issuance, verification, trading, reporting, and retirement processes prevent 18% of all survey respondents from participating in today's voluntary carbon markets. A further 11% saw their volumes capped at less than half of their targets due to the same issues, with 40% constrained by at least a quarter. Price transparency, inefficiencies, and market fragmentation Nearly one-third (30%) of all respondents had low confidence in the pricing of carbon assets, leaving them unable to efficiently discover price or benchmark credits on the demand side. A lack of pricing transparency prevents brokers from trading and investors from holding the asset, leaving volumes capped at an artificially low level. This rate of low confidence rises to 66% in commercial banks, which constrains supply because financiers can’t accurately model risk or efficiently deploy capital. The overall structure of voluntary carbon markets is characterized by inconsistency across credit types, with a heavy reliance on manual interactions and onerous data collection tools. This lack of standardization not only hampers trading but also limits the accessibility of local markets to foreign investors. The persistent need to perform manual due diligence and pricing for individual projects remains a significant barrier to scale: For example, 63% of respondents handled project listings via phone and email, but 79% would ideally like to manage such activities through a registry platform. Higher costs stemming from non-standardization and manual methods will inevitably drive commercial banks, corporates, and investors to seek out larger deals, cutting out smaller project owners, leading to decreased deal volumes and bottlenecked financing. These challenges are further compounded by widespread fragmentation. Almost half of survey respondents across project owners, financiers, intermediaries, and investors are forced to interact with four or more registries. With little to no standardization or interoperability, this market inefficiency and fragmentation forces small “puddles of liquidity""—each isolated, devoid of scale, and requiring entirely bespoke, manual resources to interact. How global carbon markets can achieve scale A clear and proven source of transparency for all securities is exchange trading, which is the preferred market model for 58% of all respondents. Positively, pioneering exchange venues are receiving extensive support from governments, regulatory authorities, and banks, addressing some market constraints. However, much more work is needed to address post trade infrastructure. Two-thirds of respondents (66%) see registries as the most important facilitator to improving markets and leading change. As the guarantors of quality in the voluntary carbon markets, registries have two core levers to drive confidence. The first is their traditional strength of project verification and methodology, where evolution continues. And second, as the key enabler of buyer confidence, is their ability to drive standardization in the products that they hold, in the data that describes them, and in the availability of that data across multiple platforms. Through standardization they can enable automation and connectivity, which accelerates due diligence, increases price transparency, and reduces transaction costs. In doing so they can address the fundamental confidence issues that undermine the industry today and help to put the world’s voluntary carbon markets on a scalable growth path. Magnus Haglind, Senior Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology, at Nasdaq said: “Without a credible foundation for building trust, liquidity, and connectivity across voluntary carbon markets, they cannot scale. We must evolve the structure of the market, drawing on the institutional knowledge and framework of other global asset classes, to establish an institutional ecosystem around carbon credits. Registries lie at the heart of the solution, with the ability to embrace new technologies, set internationally consistent standards, and accelerate the market’s growth trajectory.

Nasdaq Media Contact:Andrew Hughes+44 (0)7443 100896Andrew.Hughes@nasdaq.com -NDAQG- What are the main challenges hindering the scale of the voluntary carbon market according to Nasdaq's survey? The main challenges include price transparency, market inefficiencies, and fragmentation.

The company has 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days.","Viomi Announces Receipt of Minimum Bid Price Notice from Nasdaq Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Viomi Technology Co., (NASDAQ: VIOT) received a notification from Nasdaq about non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. The company has 180 days to regain compliance by maintaining a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days. Positive None. Negative Viomi Technology Co., received a notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, indicating potential financial challenges. The company faces the risk of delisting from Nasdaq if it fails to meet the compliance requirements within the specified timeframe. Market Analyst The notice received by Viomi Technology from Nasdaq regarding the non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule is a signal of potential risk to investors and could have implications on investor confidence. When a company's share price falls below $1, it often reflects underlying concerns about the company's financial health, market position, or future prospects. While the company has a 180-day period to regain compliance, the pressure is on to improve its stock performance, which might involve strategic initiatives or financial restructuring.From a market perspective, such notifications can lead to increased volatility in the stock's trading. Investors may react to the perceived risk of delisting, which could lead to a further decline in share price or increased trading volume as investors adjust their positions. However, if Viomi successfully implements measures to boost its stock price, this could potentially lead to a positive reevaluation of the company's value. Financial Analyst Viomi's current challenge with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement could impact its access to capital and cost of financing. The market often interprets the threat of delisting as a negative indicator, which can affect not only the stock's liquidity but also the company's ability to raise funds through equity financing. It is important for investors to monitor the company's financials and any strategic moves it makes to address this issue.Investors should also consider the company's performance relative to its peers in the IoT and smart home technology sector. A comparative analysis might reveal whether Viomi's stock price issue is a symptom of broader market trends or specific to the company's operations and strategy. Compliance Specialist The notification from Nasdaq is a procedural outcome of the exchange's regulatory framework designed to maintain market standards. For Viomi, the path to compliance likely involves either a reverse stock split or improving its financial performance to organically boost the stock price. The company's statement about taking 'all reasonable measures' to regain compliance is expected, but the actual steps and their feasibility will be critical for stakeholders.Investors should be aware of the timeline and specific criteria for regaining compliance. The requirement that the closing bid price of the ADSs must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days introduces a layer of complexity, as short-term fluctuations could extend the compliance period or even require additional measures to maintain the required bid price level. 03/27/2024 - 04:00 AM GUANGZHOU, China, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Viomi Technology Co., Ltd (""Viomi"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: VIOT), a leading IoT @ Home technology company in China, today announced that it has received a written notification from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") dated March 26, 2024, indicating that because the closing bid price of the Company's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") for the last 30 consecutive business days was below US$1.00 per share, the Company no longer meets the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement, set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).

Bowman plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions, and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.'s public offering at $34.00 per share, with an expected gross proceed of approximately $45.0 million, is a significant event for both the company and its investors. The capital raised through this offering is earmarked for general corporate purposes, which includes organic expansion, potential acquisitions and repayment of debts. This strategic move indicates Bowman's focus on growth and operational scalability.From a financial perspective, the decision to allocate funds towards organic expansion and acquisitions could lead to increased market share and revenue streams. However, investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with acquisitions such as integration challenges and the possibility of not achieving the expected synergies. The repayment of borrowings will improve the company's balance sheet and could lead to a reduction in interest expenses, potentially improving net income margins.The involvement of reputable financial institutions such as BofA Securities and Baird as joint lead book-running managers, along with Roth Capital Partners and others, adds credibility to the offering. It's important to note that the sale of shares by company executives could be perceived in different ways; while it could indicate a cash-out event, it might also be part of personal financial planning. Investors should consider the company's past performance and future prospects when evaluating the potential impact of this offering on the stock price. Market Research Analyst The infrastructure services industry is currently experiencing a period of consolidation, with firms like Bowman Consulting Group Ltd. seeking to expand their market presence. The public offering price of $34.00 per share reflects the company's valuation in the context of industry standards and investor expectations. The additional option granted to underwriters to purchase up to 220,588 shares indicates a potential for over-allotment, which could provide additional capital but also dilute existing shareholders.Market trends suggest that companies with a robust acquisition strategy can achieve rapid growth, but it is essential to monitor how effectively Bowman integrates any acquired entities into its existing operations. The infrastructure sector is also subject to regulatory changes, which could impact Bowman's project pipeline and profitability. Investors should keep a close eye on legislative developments that may affect the industry.The timing of the offering, set to close on April 1, 2024, should be considered in relation to current market conditions and the company's performance trajectory. If the timing aligns with a bullish market sentiment and the company's strong financial results, it could result in favorable outcomes for both Bowman and its investors. Conversely, market volatility or subpar performance could lead to less advantageous conditions for the offering's success. 03/26/2024 - 11:35 PM RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.

The portfolio combines near term volume growth with a pipeline of development projects that should drive material revenue growth and offers a compelling expected returns profile.The purpose of the buyback is to take advantage of a capital allocation opportunity as the Board is of the view that the shares are trading at a substantial discount to net asset value offering a compelling expected returns profile underpinned by a portfolio of high-quality royalties. The capital outlay will primarily be funded by the proceeds of from the Company's recent partial LIORC stake sale.The Buyback Programme is in line with the newly announced capital allocation framework which is designed to directly link dividends to free cash flows, maintain balance sheet strength, provide an attractive dividend yield, and retain the flexibility to allocate capital to enhance the Company's royalty portfolio via. accretive royalty acquisitions.Marc Bishop Lafleche, Chief Executive Officer of Ecora, commented:""Cyclical market lows present an opportunity for Ecora to buy-back its shares which are currently trading at a substantial discount to NAV.

All Ordinary Shares purchased under the Buyback Programme will be purchased within the price parameters as specified in the relevant shareholder authorities. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the existing authorities is 25,790,340 ordinary shares.Due to the limited liquidity in the Ordinary Shares, a buy-back of Ordinary Shares on any trading day may represent a significant portion of the daily trading volumes in the Ordinary Shares and may exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume specified in the provisions of the UK version of the Market Abuse Regulation (596/2014/EU)[1] dealing with buyback programmes and accordingly the Company may not benefit from the exemption in Article 5(1) of that regulation.The purchases will take place on the London Stock Exchange only and not on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

We will achieve this through building a diversified portfolio of scale over high quality assets that drives low volatility earnings growth and shareholder returns.The mining sector has an essential role to play in the energy transition, with commodities such as copper, nickel and cobalt - key materials for manufacturing batteries and electric vehicles. Copper also plays a critical role in our electricity grids. All these commodities are mined and there are not enough mines in operation today to supply the volume required to achieve the energy transition.Our strategy is to acquire royalties and streams over low-cost operations and projects with strong management teams, in well-established mining jurisdictions. Our portfolio has been reweighted to provide material exposure to this commodity basket and we have successfully transitioned from a coal orientated royalty business in 2014 to one that by 2026 will be materially coal free and comprised of over 90% exposure to commodities that support a sustainable future. The fundamental demand outlook for these commodities over the next decade is very strong, which should significantly increase the value of our royalty portfolio.Ecora's shares are listed on the London and Toronto Stock Exchanges (ECOR) and trade on the OTCQX Best Market (OTCQX: ECRAF).[1] This is part of UK law by virtue of the European Union Withdrawal Act 2018.This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Bonds will have an issue price between 102.7%-103.7% of their principal amount, with a 1.00% annual coupon, and will be redeemed at par on 9 April 2029. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.'s exchangeable bonds issuance is a strategic financial move. The offering, tied to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton shares, provides investors with an alternative to direct equity investment. The bonds' cash settlement feature eliminates the need for physical delivery of LVMH shares, simplifying the exchange process and potentially making them more attractive to investors seeking exposure to LVMH without the complexities of direct share ownership.With an A2/P-1 rating by Moody's, the bonds are considered upper-medium grade, which may appeal to conservative investors. However, the ratings are subject to change, which could affect investor confidence. The pricing strategy, with an issue price over par and a coupon of 1.00%, reflects a conservative yield, potentially attracting investors in a low-interest-rate environment.The bonds' impact on the stock market could be twofold. Firstly, the issuance could lead to a temporary increase in LVMH's share price due to the hedging activities by the underwriting banks. Secondly, the premium set over the reference share price might indicate Citigroup's outlook on LVMH's stock performance, potentially influencing investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst The decision to list and admit the bonds to trading on the Open Market of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange or another stock exchange reflects Citigroup's strategy to enhance liquidity and accessibility for European investors. This move could increase the attractiveness of the bonds, potentially impacting their trading volume and price stability after issuance.Furthermore, the involvement of Citigroup Global Markets Limited as both the Calculation Agent and a participant in market-making activities raises questions about potential conflicts of interest. While these arrangements are common in the industry, they underscore the importance of transparency and the potential influence on market dynamics. Investors should be aware of these relationships as they may impact the pricing and valuation of both the bonds and LVMH shares.Overall, the issuance of these exchangeable bonds could signify Citigroup's confidence in LVMH's stability and growth prospects. The impact on the business landscape will depend on investor reception and the performance of LVMH's shares leading up to the exchange price determination. 03/27/2024 - 03:45 AM LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc.

Companies remain overconfident despite facing evolving threats, with 73% expecting a cyber incident in the next 12-24 months. The study highlights challenges like point solution overload, unsecure devices, cyber talent gap, and the need for increased cybersecurity investments. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Expert The findings from Cisco's 2024 Cybersecurity Readiness Index serve as a stark reminder of the vast gap between perceived security and actual preparedness within organizations. The report's indication that a mere three percent of organizations have achieved a 'Mature' level of readiness underscores the urgency for a systemic overhaul of cybersecurity strategies.From a cybersecurity standpoint, the reliance on point solutions is a critical issue. These solutions often operate in silos, leading to fragmented security postures that hinder quick and effective incident response. The data suggests a need for a more integrated approach, leveraging platforms that can provide a holistic view of the threat landscape and streamline the detection and response process.Additionally, the report's focus on the importance of AI Fortification is noteworthy. AI-driven technologies have the potential to significantly enhance threat detection capabilities and automate responses, which is important given the current cyber talent gap. However, the effectiveness of AI in cybersecurity hinges on the availability of quality data and the ability to integrate across various security systems. IT Infrastructure Analyst The report's revelation that over half of the surveyed companies plan to upgrade their IT infrastructure in the near future indicates a significant shift in resource allocation towards cybersecurity. This shift is not just about increasing budgets but also about investing in the right technologies that can adapt to the evolving threat landscape.Organizations are recognizing the need to move away from a patchwork of point solutions to more robust, scalable security platforms. This transition is expected to streamline operations and potentially reduce the complexity that currently hampers security teams. Furthermore, the emphasis on upgrading existing solutions and deploying new ones suggests a trend towards modernization, where legacy systems are replaced or augmented with cutting-edge technologies capable of withstanding sophisticated cyber threats. Human Resources Specialist in Cybersecurity The Cybersecurity Readiness Index highlights a persistent talent gap in the cybersecurity industry, which is a critical factor in an organization's ability to defend against cyber threats. The report shows that a significant number of companies have multiple cybersecurity roles unfilled, which can severely impact their defensive capabilities.As companies ramp up their cybersecurity budgets, it is imperative that they also focus on talent acquisition and retention strategies. Investing in employee training and development, creating clear career pathways and fostering a culture that values security are all essential steps towards closing this gap. Moreover, organizations may need to look into alternative solutions such as partnering with universities or offering internships to build a pipeline of skilled cybersecurity professionals. 03/27/2024 - 03:17 AM News Summary: Only three percent of organizations globally have the 'Mature' level of readiness needed to be resilient against today's cybersecurity risks.Readiness is critical as 73% of respondents said a cybersecurity incident is likely to disrupt their business in the next 12 to 24 months.Companies are taking action to address this as 97% of companies expect to increase their cybersecurity budgets in the next 12 months.SAN JOSE, Calif., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Only three percent of organizations across the globe have the 'Mature' level of readiness needed to be resilient against modern cybersecurity risks, according to Cisco's (NASDAQ: CSCO) 2024 Cybersecurity Readiness Index. Released today, the Index highlights that readiness is down significantly from one year ago, when 15% of companies were ranked mature. The 2024 Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index was developed in an era defined by hyperconnectivity and a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Companies today continue to be targeted with a variety of techniques that range from phishing and ransomware to supply chain and social engineering attacks. And while they are building defenses against these attacks, they still struggle to defend against them, slowed down by their own overly complex security postures that are dominated by multiple point solutions. These challenges are compounded in today's distributed working environments where data can be spread across limitless services, devices, applications, and users. However, 80% of companies still feel moderately to very confident in their ability to defend against a cyberattack with their current infrastructure - this disparity between confidence and readiness suggests that companies may have misplaced confidence in their ability to navigate the threat landscape and may not be properly assessing the true scale of the challenges they face. 2024 Cisco Cybersecurity Readiness Index: Underprepared and Overconfident Companies Tackle an Evolving Threat Landscape The Index assesses the readiness of companies on five key pillars: Identity Intelligence, Network Resilience, Machine Trustworthiness, Cloud Reinforcement, and AI Fortification, which are comprised of 31 corresponding solutions and capabilities. It is based on a double-blind survey of more than 8,000 private sector security and business leaders across 30 global markets conducted by an independent third party. The respondents were asked to indicate which of these solutions and capabilities they had deployed and the stage of deployment. Companies were then classified into four stages of increasing readiness: Beginner, Formative, Progressive and Mature. ""We cannot underestimate the threat posed by our own overconfidence,"" said Jeetu Patel, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Security and Collaboration at Cisco. ""Today's organizations need to prioritize investments in integrated platforms and lean into AI in order to operate at machine scale and finally tip the scales in the favor of defenders."" Findings Overall, the study found that only three percent of companies are ready to tackle today's threats, with two-thirds of organizations falling into the Beginner or Formative stages of readiness. Further: Future Cyber Incidents Expected: 73% of respondents said they expect a cybersecurity incident to disrupt their business in the next 12 to 24 months. The cost of being unprepared can be substantial, as 54% of respondents said they experienced a cybersecurity incident in the last 12 months, and 52% of those affected said it cost them at least US$300,000.Point Solution Overload: The traditional approach of adopting multiple cybersecurity point solutions has not delivered effective results, as 80% of respondents admitted that having multiple point solutions slowed down their team's ability to detect, respond and recover from incidents. This raises significant concerns as 67% of organizations said they have deployed ten or more point solutions in their security stacks, while 25% said they have 30 or more.Unsecure and Unmanaged Devices Add Complexity: 85% of companies said their employees access company platforms from unmanaged devices, and 43% of those spend one-fifth (20%) of their time logged onto company networks from unmanaged devices. Additionally, 29% reported that their employees hop between at least six networks over a week.The Cyber Talent Gap Persists: Progress is being further hampered by critical talent shortages, with 87% of companies highlighting it as an issue. In fact, 46% of companies said they had more than ten roles related to cybersecurity unfilled in their organization at the time of the survey.Future Cyber Investments Ramping Up: Companies are aware of the challenge and are ramping up their defenses with over half (52%) planning to significantly upgrade their IT infrastructure in the next 12 to 24 months. This is a marked increase from just one-third (33%) who planned to do so last year. Most prominently, organizations plan to upgrade existing solutions (66%), deploy new solutions (57%), and invest in AI-driven technologies (55%). Further, 97% of companies expect to increase their cybersecurity budget in the next 12 months, and 86% respondents say their budgets will increase by 10% or more.To overcome the challenges of today's threat landscape, companies must accelerate meaningful investments in security, including adoption of innovative security measures and a security platform approach, strengthen their network resilience, establish meaningful use of generative AI, and ramp up recruitment to bridge the cybersecurity skills gap.

The report highlights manufacturing as the top industry in AI traffic, with the US leading in enterprise AI tool usage. ChatGPT is the most popular AI application, and Zscaler emphasizes the need for improved data security in the AI landscape. Positive 600% growth in AI/ML transactions from April 2023 to January 2024 Manufacturing leads in AI transactions, followed by Finance and Insurance ChatGPT is the top GenAI application for enterprises The US leads in enterprise AI tool usage globally Zscaler stresses the importance of data security in the AI landscape Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst The exponential growth in enterprise AI transactions highlighted by the ThreatLabz report underscores the escalating reliance on AI tools within various industries, particularly manufacturing, finance and services. This trend is indicative of the broader digital transformation that is reshaping business operations, driving efficiency and fostering innovation. However, the adoption of AI also amplifies the attack surface for cyber threats, necessitating advanced security measures. The report's emphasis on the need for Zero Trust security models is a testament to the evolving cybersecurity landscape where traditional perimeter-based defenses are no longer sufficient. Enterprises must adopt a data-centric approach to security, ensuring that each transaction is verified and secure, irrespective of its origin. Furthermore, the report's findings on the geographical distribution of AI transactions reflect differing regional approaches to technology adoption and regulation. The US leading in AI transactions may be a reflection of its robust tech industry and regulatory environment conducive to AI development. In contrast, the high volume of transactions in India suggests a strategic emphasis on technology as a driver of economic growth. Data Privacy Expert The 569 TB of data shared with AI tools, as reported by ThreatLabz, raises significant concerns regarding data privacy and the protection of sensitive information. The integration of AI into business processes must be accompanied by robust data governance policies to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Particular attention should be paid to the types of data being processed by AI tools, as they often include proprietary business information or personal data protected under various global privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA. The report's call for better data security is a important reminder that as the volume of data increases, so does the responsibility of enterprises to safeguard it against both internal and external threats. It is imperative for organizations to not only secure their data but also to ensure compliance with data protection laws, which can vary significantly across different regions. The need for international cooperation in establishing standards for AI data security is evident, as AI tools often operate across borders, complicating the regulatory landscape. AI Technology Analyst The prominence of ChatGPT and other AI applications in enterprise transactions reflects the rapidly advancing field of generative AI and its integration into business workflows. The report indicates that enterprises are not only adopting these tools but are doing so at a scale that suggests a transformative impact on how businesses operate. Generative AI's ability to create content, automate interactions and enhance decision-making is revolutionizing industries. However, this also introduces new challenges, such as ensuring the integrity of the data fed into these systems and guarding against the risks of data poisoning and AI-generated misinformation. The report's findings on the sector-specific adoption of AI tools provide valuable insights into how different industries are leveraging AI to gain a competitive edge. For instance, manufacturing's use of AI for predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization is a clear example of AI's potential to create significant efficiencies and cost savings. 03/27/2024 - 03:01 AM ThreatLabz AI Report Reveals Enterprises Sharing 569 TB of Data to AI Tools, Stressing the Need for Better Data Security Enterprise AI/ML transactions increased from 521 million monthly in April 2023 to 3.1 billion monthly by January 2024.Manufacturing generates the most AI traffic, totaling 21% of all AI transactions in the Zscaler security cloud, followed by Finance and Insurance (20%) and Services (17%).The most popular AI/ML applications for enterprises by transaction volume are ChatGPT, Drift, OpenAI, Writer, and LivePerson.The top five countries generating the most enterprise AI transactions are the US, India, the UK, Australia, and Japan. SAN JOSE, Calif., March 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZS), the leader in cloud security, today announced the release of its 2024 AI Security Report, which draws on more than 18 billion AI transactions across the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange™ cloud security platform from April 2023 to January 2024. Zscaler ThreatLabz researchers analyzed how enterprises use AI/ML tools and mapped trends across sectors and geographies, highlighting how businesses are adapting to the shifting AI landscape and managing security around the use of AI tools. Today's enterprises must secure a transformation driven by generative AI (GenAI) bidirectionally: by securely adopting GenAI tools in the enterprise with Zero Trust while leveraging it to defend against the new AI-driven threat landscape. AI has already become a part of business as usual, as enterprises leverage and integrate new features and tools into their day-to-day workflows, multiplying the volume of transactions and data generated. The much higher volume is reflected in the nearly 600% increase in transactions as well as the 569 terabytes of enterprise data sent to AI tools that ThreatLabz analyzed between September 2023 and January 2024. “Data is the lifeblood of every enterprise and the gold of this new era in the AI revolution,” said Deepen Desai, Chief Security Officer, Zscaler. “With the visibility provided by the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange’s nearly 500 trillion daily signals combined with Avalor* Data Fabric, we believe Zscaler is uniquely positioned to fight AI with AI and improve Zero Trust security across the enterprise.” AI transactions grow exponentially From April 2023 to January 2024, ThreatLabz saw AI/ML transactions grow by nearly 600%, rising to more than 3 billion monthly across the Zero Trust Exchange platform in January. Despite the mounting security risk and increasing number of data protection incidents, enterprises are adopting AI tools in large numbers. Manufacturers responsible for more than 20% of enterprise AI/ML transactions Manufacturing was found to be the industry leader in AI transactions across the Zero Trust Exchange platform, driving nearly 20% of the total volume. From analyzing vast amounts of data from machinery and sensors to preemptively detect equipment failures to optimizing supply chain management, inventory, and logistics operations, AI is proving instrumental to manufacturers. The other notable verticals that comprise the top five are finance and insurance (17%), technology (14%), services sectors (13%), and retail/wholesale (5%). ChatGPT leads the way as the most popular GenAI application Research shows that ChatGPT accounted for more than half of all enterprise AI transactions (52%), while the OpenAI application itself ranked third (8%). Drift, the popular AI-powered chatbot, generated nearly 20% of enterprise traffic, while LivePerson and BoldChat also made the list. Writer was the favorite GenAI tool for creating written enterprise content. The United States leads the way in enterprise AI tools usage AI adoption trends differ globally as regulations, requirements, technology infrastructure, cultural considerations, and other factors play key roles. At 40%, the US produces the highest percentage of enterprise AI transactions globally. India was second at 16%, propelled by the country’s accelerated commitment to driving innovation. Although the UK's share of global enterprise AI transactions is only 5.5%, it leads enterprise AI traffic in EMEA with over 20%. France (13%) and Germany (12%), as expected, follow closely behind as the second and third largest enterprise AI traffic generators in EMEA. However, the United Arab Emirates is a rapidly growing technological innovator in the region that has also emerged as a prominent AI adopter. In the APAC region, ThreatLabz discovered a staggering increase of nearly 1.3 billion (135%) more enterprise AI transactions compared to EMEA. This surge can likely be attributed to India’s extensive usage and adoption of AI tools for conducting business across the tech sector, and it may suggest a higher concentration of tech jobs, stronger willingness to adopt new innovations, and fewer barriers to usage. AI empowered threat actors amplify enterprise risk and security challenges As the power of AI has advanced, it has become a double-edged sword for enterprises. While AI offers immense potential for innovation and efficiency, it also brings forth a new set of risks that organizations must grapple with–namely, risks associated with leveraging GenAI tools within the enterprise and an evolving landscape of AI-assisted threats. The utilization of GenAI tools within enterprises introduces significant risks that can be categorized into three main areas: Protection of intellectual property and non-public information: the risk of data leakageAI application data privacy and security risks: including an expanded attack surface, new threat delivery vectors, and increased supply chain riskData quality concerns: the concept of ""garbage in, garbage out"" and the potential for data poisoning Simultaneously, enterprises are constantly exposed to a barrage of cyberthreats, some of which are now AI-driven. The possibilities of AI-assisted threats are virtually limitless, as attackers can leverage AI to orchestrate sophisticated phishing and social engineering campaigns, develop highly evasive malware and ransomware, exploit vulnerabilities in enterprise attack surfaces, and amplify attacks' speed, scale, and diversity. To address this challenge, enterprises and cybersecurity leaders must effectively navigate the rapidly evolving AI landscape to harness its revolutionary potential while also mitigating the risks and defending against AI-powered attacks. Enabling secure enterprise AI adoption with Zscaler Zscaler is at the forefront of empowering enterprises to embrace the potential of AI applications while ensuring the safety of their data and maintaining an environment that’s secure against emerging channels for exfiltration.

Market Research Analyst Honeywell's acquisition of Civitanavi represents a strategic move to enhance its competitive edge in the aerospace and defense markets. The 27.1% premium on Civitanavi's share price indicates Honeywell's confidence in the value Civitanavi's technology adds to their portfolio. This acquisition is likely to be viewed positively by investors and could potentially lead to an uptick in Honeywell's stock price, as it signals an expansion of capabilities and a commitment to growth in the autonomous operations sector.The integration of Civitanavi's Fiber Optic Gyro technology, which is new to Honeywell's navigation offerings, could open up additional market opportunities and drive innovation. By leveraging Civitanavi's strong foothold in the European Union, Honeywell is likely to see an expansion of its customer base in the region. The emphasis on autonomous operations aligns with industry trends towards increased automation and could position Honeywell as a leader in this space. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the all-cash deal for Civitanavi at €200 million is a significant investment for Honeywell, but one that could offer substantial returns. The lack of a financing condition suggests a strong balance sheet and liquidity position for Honeywell, which is reassuring for investors. The market will be closely watching the tender offer, particularly whether Honeywell can secure the tender of at least 95% of Civitanavi's outstanding shares as stipulated.Investors should note that the transaction's success hinges on regulatory approvals, which can be unpredictable. However, the early commitment from Civitanavi's controlling shareholder is a positive sign. If the acquisition proceeds smoothly, it could result in revenue growth and cost synergies, enhancing Honeywell's earnings in the long term. Aerospace Industry Analyst The acquisition of Civitanavi by Honeywell is indicative of the aerospace industry's trajectory towards autonomous technology. Civitanavi's expertise in inertial navigation and stabilization solutions is highly complementary to Honeywell's current offerings. This synergy could lead to the development of more advanced autonomous systems, potentially setting new industry standards.The strategic importance of Civitanavi's Fiber Optic Gyro technology cannot be overstated, as it represents a critical component in the future of aviation and automation. Honeywell's expansion into this technology suggests a proactive approach to addressing the evolving needs of both commercial and defense customers, which could lead to increased market share and a stronger competitive position. 03/27/2024 - 02:15 AM Civitanavi's high-precision inertial navigation and stabilization solutions will help drive long-term growth across Honeywell's commercial and defense businessesCombination of Honeywell, Civitanavi technology will provide new opportunities for customers to enable autonomous operationsCHARLOTTE, N.C., March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today announced the intention to acquire the entire share capital of Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. (Civitanavi or the Company) (Euronext Milan Exchange: BIT: CNS). Honeywell will initiate a voluntary tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Civitanavi for a purchase price of €6.30 per share in cash (an equity value of approximately €200 million at closing). The acquisition will further strengthen Honeywell's capabilities to help its customers create autonomous operations in aircraft and other vehicles.

Together with Civitanavi, Honeywell will be able to offer a broader set of technologies to its customers across the globe, whether they are traditional operators seeking to increase the autonomous capability of their existing fleets or are new entrants in the Advanced Air Mobility space. The purchase price payable at closing represents a premium of approximately 27.1% to the 30-day volume-weighted average trading price of Civitanavi's stock ended on March 26, 2024, the last day of trading before the announcement of the transaction. Honeywell has already secured the commitment of Civitanavi's controlling shareholder, which owns approximately 66% of Civitanavi's outstanding shares to tender its shares. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including among the others: (i) receipt of required antitrust clearance; (ii) receipt of required clearances pursuant to the foreign direct investment regulations in Italy, United Kingdom and Canada and; (iii) the tender of at least 95% of Civitanavi's outstanding shares.

The Company bought 10,000 ordinary shares at prices ranging from £82.1000 to £83.6600 per share. The purchased shares will be canceled, leaving the Company with 164,246,233 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The repurchase of shares by a company often indicates a strategic move to manage capital allocation and convey confidence in the company's financial health. In this case, the repurchase of 10,000 shares at a price range between £82.1000 and £83.6600, with an average price of £83.1360, could be seen as a positive signal to the market. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the earnings per share (EPS) may increase, potentially leading to a higher stock price.However, the decision to cancel the repurchased shares is also noteworthy. This action permanently reduces the share count, which can be a double-edged sword. While it may lead to a more favorable EPS in the short term, it also indicates that the company is choosing to return value to shareholders through buybacks rather than investing in growth opportunities or holding the shares for future strategic use. Investors typically weigh the benefits of immediate share price support against the potential for long-term value creation through reinvestment in the business. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the execution of a share repurchase program must be evaluated in the context of the company's overall capital structure and liquidity position. The aggregate expenditure for this buyback transaction, not explicitly detailed in the announcement, is an important figure that impacts the company's cash reserves. Investors should consider how this use of cash aligns with the company's debt levels, dividend policy and overall financial strategy.It's also important to assess the timing of the buyback. The company's management has chosen to execute the buyback after receiving shareholder approval at their Annual General Meeting, indicating planned and strategic capital management. However, the market's response to such buybacks can vary and it is essential to understand the broader market conditions and sector performance to fully assess the impact of this transaction on the company's stock price. Corporate Governance Expert Share buybacks can be subject to scrutiny from a corporate governance standpoint. They must be executed transparently and in accordance with shareholder interests. The company's announcement indicates compliance with the authority granted by shareholders, which is a positive sign of adherence to good governance practices. Nonetheless, stakeholders should monitor the frequency and scale of share repurchase programs to ensure that they do not come at the expense of other corporate priorities such as R&D, employee development, or corporate sustainability initiatives.Moreover, the engagement of a reputable investment firm like Goldman Sachs International to conduct the transaction adds a layer of credibility and ensures that the buyback is executed efficiently. The detailed breakdown of purchases provided in the announcement reflects transparency, allowing shareholders to scrutinize the transaction's specifics. 03/27/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 27, 2024 / The Company announces that on 26 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

(PRI) releases the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) for February 2024, showing a slight decrease in middle-income households' purchasing power due to rising gas prices. The index was at 101.2%, down from 101.6% in January 2024 and up from 95.9% a year ago. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The introduction of the Primerica Household Budget Index (HBI) provides an interesting tool for gauging the economic health of middle-income households, which is a significant segment of the economy. The slight decline in purchasing power from January to February 2024, as indicated by the HBI, suggests a modest tightening of financial conditions for these families. This is reflective of broader economic trends, such as the uptick in gas prices, which can have a ripple effect on consumer spending and overall economic activity.It's important to note that the HBI is more than just a number; it's a reflection of the ability of households to meet their financial obligations without incurring debt. A decrease in this index could signal a reduction in discretionary spending, which might lead to a contraction in certain sectors of the economy that rely on consumer spending. However, the index still being above 100% indicates that, on average, these households are not yet in a position where they are spending more than they earn.Looking at the historical data, the peak in November 2020 followed by a sharp decrease due to inflation highlights the vulnerability of middle-income households to macroeconomic shifts. The cumulative additional spending since May 2021 is a concern as it may lead to increased debt levels if the trend continues. This is critical for businesses to monitor as it could predict future consumer behavior. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the Primerica Household Budget Index serves as a barometer for consumer confidence and potential spending patterns. Businesses, particularly those in consumer goods, retail and financial services, should pay close attention to this index as it can impact their sales forecasts and marketing strategies. A decline in purchasing power often precedes shifts in consumer priorities, with a potential increase in demand for essential goods while luxury items may see a decrease.The index's baseline comparison to January 2019 offers a pre-pandemic benchmark, which is useful for analyzing long-term trends. The fact that the HBI would be around 110% without the pandemic and inflation indicates a significant impact these factors have had on middle-income households. For businesses, this could mean adjusting their product offerings and pricing strategies to maintain relevance and competitiveness in a changing economic landscape.Additionally, the HBI can serve as a leading indicator for stock market investors, as consumer spending drives a large portion of economic growth. A sustained decline in the index could signal caution, while an uptick might suggest a favorable environment for consumer discretionary stocks. 03/27/2024 - 12:00 AM DULUTH, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Primerica, Inc. (NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, announced today the release of the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™), a monthly index illustrating the purchasing power of middle-income households with income between $30,000 and $130,000. In February 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.2%, slightly down from 101.6% in January 2024. The fast rise in gas prices, a 4.3% increase since the beginning of the year, impacted purchasing power for middle-income families in February. A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%.

A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%. (Photo: Business Wire) HBI™ HISTORICAL BACKGROUND The index baseline is set at January 2019 and can be thought of as when middle-income households set a budget based on their earned income at that time. Between 2014 and 2020, the HBI™ results recorded steady gains in purchasing power for middle-income families, with a peak of 105.1% in November 2020. This means that relative to January 2019, households were in a stronger financial position to pay their monthly bills because wage growth outpaced the cost of everyday goods. Increasing inflation then caused the index to plummet. In June 2022, it reached a post-pandemic low of 86.7%. Since May 2021, when the HBI™ dipped below 100% for the first time since the pandemic, the average middle-income household has cumulatively spent around $2,425 more than budget on basic necessities. In line with this, if the pandemic and ensuing inflation would not have been a factor, the HBI™ today would be closer to 110%. For more information on the Primerica Household Budget Index™, visit www.householdbudgetindex.com. About the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) The Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE®. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth. The HBI™ is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI™ uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent “normal” economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Periodically, prior HBI™ values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI™ data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI™ data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

The Estée Lauder Companies' brand offers clinically proven skincare and makeup solutions, along with dermatological education, marking a strategic move to enhance consumer accessibility. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Clinique into the Amazon Premium Beauty store represents a strategic move to leverage the growing e-commerce platform and reach a broader customer base. The collaboration between a legacy brand and a leading online retailer is indicative of the shifting retail landscape where digital presence is becoming increasingly important for consumer goods companies. The move could potentially increase Clinique's sales volume due to Amazon's vast customer reach and sophisticated logistics network.From a market research perspective, entering Amazon's Premium Beauty store allows Clinique to tap into a wealth of customer data and shopping behavior insights. This data can be used to tailor marketing strategies, develop new products and enhance customer experience. Moreover, the online beauty segment has shown resilience and growth even during economic downturns, suggesting that Clinique's presence in this space could provide a stable revenue stream. Financial Analyst For investors and stakeholders in The Estée Lauder Companies, Clinique's foray into the Amazon Premium Beauty store may be seen as a positive development. It aligns with the company's broader digital transformation initiatives and could contribute to top-line growth. The ability to offer quick delivery and dermatological education via Amazon's platform may also improve customer loyalty and brand strength, which are critical factors in maintaining premium pricing and margins.However, it's important to monitor the financial impact of this partnership closely. While increased sales are anticipated, the cost of doing business on Amazon, including commission fees and potential promotional costs, could affect profitability. Long-term, the partnership's success will be measured by its contribution to net earnings and whether it can offset any declines in traditional retail channels. Consumer Behavior Expert The decision by Clinique to open a storefront in the Amazon Premium Beauty store reflects an understanding of contemporary consumer behavior. Today's consumers value convenience, speed and a seamless online shopping experience. By providing these through Amazon, Clinique is not only expanding its reach but also meeting the expectations of its customers. The inclusion of educational tools like the Clinique Skin Analysis is a strategic move to enhance customer engagement and provide value beyond the product itself.Consumer trust in Amazon's platform and the preference for online shopping for beauty products have been on the rise.

CRH completes second phase of European lime divestment,2024-03-27T07:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"CRH plc completes the divestment of its lime operations in Europe, generating $1.1 billion in total consideration.","CRH completes second phase of European lime divestment Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary CRH plc completes the divestment of its lime operations in Europe, generating $1.1 billion in total consideration. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of CRH's lime operations in the UK represents a strategic move that could reshape the company's portfolio and financial standing. Lime, being a fundamental material in various industries such as steel, construction and environmental applications, indicates that this decision might be driven by a focus shift or a reallocation of resources towards more profitable or core segments. The transaction's sizeable amount of c.$1.1 billion suggests a significant impact on the company's liquidity and possibly its capital allocation strategy.Investors should observe the potential benefits such as an improved balance sheet and the opportunity for CRH to invest in higher growth areas. However, there could be drawbacks, such as the loss of a steady revenue stream and potential market share in the lime industry. The long-term implications will largely depend on how effectively CRH reinvests the proceeds from this divestiture. Financial Analyst The completion of the divestiture phase for CRH's UK lime operations is a considerable financial event. With a transaction value of around $1.1 billion, this deal will inject substantial capital into CRH's accounts. This influx of cash could lead to various financial maneuvers such as debt reduction, share buybacks, or dividends, each with distinct implications for shareholder value.Debt reduction could improve CRH's credit rating and reduce interest expenses, enhancing profitability. Share buybacks may indicate management's confidence in the company's intrinsic value, potentially leading to higher earnings per share. Increased dividends would provide immediate returns to shareholders. The exact impact on CRH's stock performance will hinge on the company's subsequent financial decisions and the market's perception of the divestiture's strategic rationale. Construction Industry Analyst The sale of the lime operations may reflect shifts in market dynamics within the construction materials industry. Lime is integral to construction and environmental sectors and its demand is often linked to infrastructure development and regulatory trends in emissions control. If CRH is divesting from this sector, it could be indicative of their strategic assessment that either the lime market is maturing or facing headwinds, or that CRH aims to concentrate on other materials with better growth prospects or synergies with their existing operations.It's essential to consider the competitive landscape and whether CRH's exit might create opportunities for competitors or alter the supply dynamics in the regions affected. Stakeholders should monitor how this divestiture influences CRH's market position and whether the company can leverage the capital from this sale to strengthen its core business areas. 03/27/2024 - 03:00 AM DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On 22 November 2023, CRH plc announced that it had reached an agreement to divest its lime operations in Europe for a total consideration of c.$1.1 billion. CRH is pleased to announce that the second phase of the transaction, comprising the Group’s lime operations in the UK, is now complete. About CRH CRH (NYSE: CRH, LSE: CRH) is the leading provider of building materials solutions that build, connect and improve our world.

In addition, the Company has published its 2023 Sustainability Report, which will shortly be available on the Company’s website. Ian Cockerill, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “I am delighted to have been appointed CEO of Endeavour at such a pivotal moment. As you can see from our 2023 results, Endeavour is well positioned with a high-quality portfolio and a resilient business model that is underpinned by a disciplined approach to capital allocation. During the year we delivered against our key objectives and produced 1.1Moz of gold, meeting our production guidance for the eleventh consecutive year, while achieving an all-in sustaining cost of $967 per ounce, maintaining our status as one of the lowest cost producers within the sector. We continued to increase the quality of our portfolio as we advanced our two high-margin development projects, the Sabodala-Massawa expansion and the Lafigué development project, which are both on budget and slightly ahead of schedule with commissioning underway at both projects. We also divested our non-core Boungou and Wahgnion mines during the year, further strengthening the quality of the portfolio and increasing its geographic diversification. Our exploration programme continues to support our robust project pipeline, with the addition of 3.4 million ounces of Indicated resources at our Tanda-Iguela discovery in Côte d’Ivoire. This 4.5 million ounce discovery is not only one of the most significant discoveries in West Africa in the last ten years, but a potential tier 1 deposit for Endeavour, that we discovered for an industry low cost of $11 per ounce. In addition to investing over $548 million in organic growth and exploration during the year, we returned $266 million to our shareholders, through dividends and share buybacks. We returned $227 dollars for every ounce of gold that we produced, reiterating our commitment to delivering attractive shareholder returns. The foundations are in place for 2024 to be a transformational year of delivery. I am focused on completing our growth projects and transitioning to a more cash generative phase, that will prioritise de-levering the balance sheet and delivering enhanced shareholder returns, ensuring that the growth that we unlock, immediately benefits all our stakeholders.” INVESTIGATION INTO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S MISCONDUCT COMPLETED As previously announced on 4 January 2024, the contract with former President and Chief Executive Officer, Sébastien de Montessus, was terminated for serious misconduct following an investigation undertaken by the Board of Directors into an irregular payment instruction issued by him, related to the disposal of the Agbaou asset undertaken by the Company. As a result of his serious misconduct, the Remuneration Committee of the Board determined to claw back remuneration totalling $29.1 million as announced on 18 January 2024. The Board of Directors of Endeavour announced today, 27 March 2024, that the investigation is now complete and the key outcomes are: No restatement of historic financial statements and no material impact on 2023 annual financial results issued today, which are the subject of an unmodified audit opinion.Investigation found that Mr de Montessus, acting with certain others who are not employees of the Group: diverted a US$5.9 million payment to a third-party company in March 2021, and concealed his actions with repeated false representations to management, the Board and auditors; caused Endeavour to make two payments totalling US$15.0 million to the same third-party company in August and November 2020, deliberately disguising them as advance payments to a contractor through repeated false representations to management. No evidence of bribery, or of any payments being made to sanctioned persons or to terrorist groups.Ultimate beneficiaries of these payments have not been discovered, despite extensive investigation, as the recipient entity was liquidated immediately after the funds were transferred. Mr de Montessus provided implausible and untrue explanations of his conduct during the course of the Investigation.The Investigation is now complete. Summary of actions taken and proposed: Mr de Montessus was terminated as CEO and President on 4 January.Clawback of remuneration totalling US$29.1 million announced on 18 January.Noting that these payments involved deliberate circumvention of our existing controls framework, the Board has nonetheless accelerated its review of internal controls in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, and has made immediate adjustments to certain controls relating to M&A activity. For further information, please refer to the 2023 Annual Report at the following link. The Board appointed Ian Cockerill, formerly Deputy Chair of the Board, as permanent Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director on 4 January. Ian brings over four decades of experience in the global natural resources sector and has held senior operational, project and executive positions at major mining companies, including Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields and Anglo Coal. SHAREHOLDER RETURNS PROGRAMME Endeavour is pleased to continue to deliver attractive shareholder returns, in line with its capital allocation framework. As previously announced, the FY-2023 dividend amounts to $200.0 million, or $0.81 per share, which represents $25.0 million more than the minimum dividend commitment of $175.0 million for the year, reiterating Endeavour's strong commitment to paying supplemental shareholder returns. Endeavour’s H2-2023 dividend amounts to $100m or $0.41 per share and was paid on 25 March 2024 to shareholders of record on 23 February 2024. Shareholder returns are being supplemented through the Company’s share buyback programme. A total of $65.7 million, or 3.0 million shares were repurchased during FY-2023, of which $25.7 million or 1.3 million shares were repurchased in Q4-2023. Furthermore, a total of $12.6 million or 0.7 million shares have been repurchased in FY-2024 up until 22 March 2024. As shown in the table below, Endeavour has returned $266.4 million to shareholders for FY-2023 through dividends and share buybacks, 52% above the $175.0 million minimum dividend commitment for the year, and equivalent to $227 per ounce produced from all operations. Since the shareholder returns programme began to be paid in Q1-2021, Endeavour has returned over $903.0 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, which represents $393.0 million or 77% more than its minimum commitment over the period.

EBITDA. Endeavour's goal is to increase its shareholder returns programme once its organic growth projects are completed, while simultaneously strengthening its balance sheet, thereby ensuring that its efforts to unlock growth immediately benefit all its stakeholders. Endeavour's next semi-annual dividend is expected to be announced in Q3-2024, along with its Q2 and H1-2024 financial results. As announced on 20 March 2024, Endeavour has received approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) to renew its Normal Course Issuer Bid (“NCIB”) for its share buyback programme. Under the NCIB, Endeavour is entitled to repurchase up to 5% of its total issued and outstanding shares as of 13 March 2024, or 12,259,943 shares, during the 12 month period of the NCIB, and up to 25% of the average daily trading volume (“ADTV”) for the six months ended 29 February 2024, calculated in accordance with the rules of the TSX for purposes of the NCIB or 96,878 shares during each trading day, excluding purchases made in accordance with the block purchase exemptions under applicable TSX policies. All ordinary shares repurchased under the share repurchase programme will be cancelled. The renewed NCIB commenced on 22 March 2024 and ends on 21 March 2025, or such earlier date as Endeavour may complete its purchases pursuant to the notice of intention filed with the TSX.Endeavour’s previously announced automatic share purchase agreement with Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (“Stifel”) will continue to allow for the purchase of ordinary shares, subject to certain trading parameters, at times when Endeavour would not be active in the market due to regulatory close periods, its own internal trading black-out periods, insider trading rules or otherwise. Outside of these periods, ordinary shares may be repurchased in accordance with management’s discretion and in compliance with applicable law.Share purchases will be made by Stifel (or through its agent, Stifel Nicolaus Canada, Inc.) on the TSX and the London Stock Exchange, as well as through other designated exchanges and alternative trading systems in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. The price paid for repurchased ordinary shares will be the market price of such ordinary shares at the time of acquisition or such other price as may be permitted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and Endeavour’s existing shareholder authority to conduct share repurchases. Endeavour intends to ask shareholders to renew that authority at its 2024 AGM. CASH FLOW SUMMARY The table below presents the cash flow for Endeavour for the three month period ended 31 December 2023, 30 September 2023, and 31 December 2022, and the twelve month period ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 with accompanying explanations below.

NOTES: 1) Operating cash flows increased by $51.8 million from $114.9 million (or $0.47 per share) in Q3-2023 to $166.7 million (or $0.68 per share) in Q4-2023 due to a higher realised gold price, lower taxes paid related to the timing of withholding tax payments and tax payments at Sabodala-Massawa, and lower exploration costs, partially offset by an increased working capital outflow. Operating cash flows decreased by $370.6 million from $1,017.1 million (or $4.10 per share) in FY-2022 to $646.5 million (or $2.62 per share) in FY-2023 due to higher operating expenses, exploration costs and the timing of tax payments compounded by a reduction in cashflows generated by discontinued operations following the disposal of the Boungou and Wahgnion mines on 30 June 2023. Notable variances are summarised below: Working capital was an outflow of $79.5 million in Q4-2023, an increase of $74.3 million over the Q3-2023 outflow of $5.2 million. The outflow in Q4-2023 was largely driven by an outflow in trade and other receivables of $63.6 million related to the timing of VAT receipts, an outflow of inventories of $15.3 million mainly related to increased stockpiles at Sabodala-Massawa and Ity and a trade and other payables outflow of $3.0 million primarily related to the timing of supplier payments at Houndé and Ity. The working capital outflow in Q4-2023 was partially offset by an inflow in prepaid expenses and other items of $2.4 million related to decreased supplier prepayments at Houndé.Working capital was an outflow of $126.9 million in FY-2023, an increase of $54.3 million over the FY-2022 outflow of $72.6 million, driven by an increase in outflows related to trade and other receivables due to the timing of VAT receipts and an increase in outflows related to increased stockpiles at Sabodala-Massawa and Ity. Gold sales from continuing operations increased from 278koz in Q3-2023 to 285koz in Q4-2023 largely due to the timing of gold sales. The realised gold price from continuing operations increased from $1,898 per ounce for Q3-2023 to $2,007 per ounce for Q4-2023. Inclusive of the Group’s Revenue Protection Programme, the realised gold price increased from $1,903 per ounce for Q3-2023 to $1,945 per ounce for Q4-2023.Gold sales from continuing operations decreased from 1,150koz in FY-2022 to 1,084koz in FY-2023, due to lower Group production from continuing operations in FY-2023. The realised gold price from continuing operations increased from $1,791 per ounce for FY-2022 to $1,939 per ounce for FY-2023. Inclusive of the Group’s Revenue Protection Programme, the realised gold price increased from $1,808 per ounce for FY-2022 to $1,919 per ounce for FY-2023. Total cash cost per ounce decreased from $848 per ounce in Q3-2023 to $837 per ounce in Q4-2023, due to lower cash costs at Mana driven by lower open pit mining costs, higher by-product credits and an increase in capitalised waste, and lower cash costs at Sabodala-Massawa following increased gold production volumes, partially offset by higher cash costs at Houndé driven by higher royalties and G&A costs.Total cash cost per ounce increased from $723 per ounce in FY-2022 to $837 per ounce in FY-2023 due to lower production and gold sold at Sabodala-Massawa and Mana, increases in fuel and consumable costs across the Group, higher royalty costs following a higher realised gold price and adverse impacts associated with the stronger EUR to USD foreign exchange rate in FY-2023. As shown in the table below, income taxes paid decreased by $71.1 million from $142.0 million in Q3-2023 to $70.9 million in Q4-2023 due largely to a decrease in taxes paid at Sabodala-Massawa, as the final tax payments related to the 2022 tax year were made in Q3-2023, and a decrease in other tax payments from $50.7 million in Q3-2023 to $30.3 million in Q4-2023 due to lower withholding tax payments linked to cash that was upstreamed from operating entities.Income taxes paid increased by $182.6 million from $158.3 million in FY-2022 to $340.9 million in FY-2023 due to an increase in Sabodala-Massawa’s provisional year-end tax payments, which benefitted in the prior year from the lower 2021 tax base due to the tax holiday at the Massawa permit that expired in 2021. Taxes also increased due to withholding tax payments on cash upstreamed from the operating entities, higher taxes paid at Ity due to changes in taxation on the Floleu permit, and the timing of provisional tax payments at Houndé and Mana for 2023 which have a higher tax base.

Cashflows used in investing activities increased by $299.4 million from $521.4 million in FY-2022 to $820.8 million in FY-2023 largely due to the increases in growth capital incurred at the Sabodala-Massawa expansion, which was launched in Q2-2022, and the Lafigué development project, which was launched in Q4-2022, as well as increases in non-sustaining capital at the Ity and Mana mines. This was partially offset by a decrease in sustaining capital at Sabodala-Massawa. Sustaining capital from continuing operations decreased from $22.5 million in Q3-2023 to $20.0 million in Q4-2023 due to lower sustaining capital expenditure at Houndé and Sabodala-Massawa following heavy mining equipment purchases made in the prior quarter.Sustaining capital from continuing operations decreased from $97.5 million in FY-2022 to $91.8 million in FY-2023 due to decreased sustaining capital at Sabodala-Massawa related to decreased waste development activities, partially offset by an increase in sustaining capital at Mana related to increased underground development and stope production activity. Sustaining capital expenditure at Ity and Houndé were broadly consistent with the prior year. Non-sustaining capital from continuing operations increased from $49.5 million in Q3-2023 to $52.5 million in Q4-2023, largely due to an increase in non-sustaining capital expenditure at Houndé related to pre-stripping activities in the Kari Pump pit, and at Ity related to increased cutback activities at the Walter pit and increased spend on the Mineral Sizer optimisation initiative. This was partially offset by decreased non-sustaining capital at Sabodala-Massawa and Mana related to decreased non-sustaining waste development.Non-sustaining capital from continuing operations increased from $192.6 million in FY-2022 to $245.3 million in FY-2023 due to increased non-sustaining capital expenditure at Ity related to the construction of the Recyn and Mineral Sizer optimisation initiatives, the embankment raise at TSF 1 and the construction of TSF 2, and at Sabodala-Massawa due to increased pre-stripping activities as new pits were opened. This was partially offset by decreased non-sustaining capital expenditure at Mana as underground mine development advanced to stope production incurring less non-sustaining capital underground waste development. Non-sustaining capital expenditure at Houndé was broadly consistent with the prior year. Growth capital increased from $116.2 million in Q3-2023 to $155.0 million in Q4-2023, as construction activities at the Sabodala-Massawa expansion and the Lafigué development project accelerated ahead of first gold production at both projects, expected in Q2-2024. Growth capital expenditure during the quarter also included $1.5 million for technical study work related to the Kalana project.Growth capital increased from $126.5 million in FY-2022 to $447.5 million in FY-2023 largely due to the acceleration of construction activities at the Sabodala-Massawa expansion, which was launched in Q2-2022, and the Lafigué development project, which was launched in Q4-2022. 3) Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $45.6 million from an outflow of $124.6 million in Q3-2023 to an outflow of $79.0 million in Q4-2023 largely due to the timing of dividend payments to shareholders and reduced dividend payments to minorities compared to the prior period. Cash flows used in financing activities in Q4-2023 included a $70.0 million repayment of the RCF during the quarter, payments of financing and other fees of $36.7 million related to the coupon payments for the senior notes and the RCF, payments for the acquisition of the Company’s own shares through its share buyback programme of $24.7 million, payment of dividends to minorities of $12.7 million, and repayment of finance and lease obligations of $7.0 million. Financing cash outflows were party offset by a $72.1 million drawdown of the Lafigué term loan. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $103.5 million from an outflow of $380.1 million in FY-2022 to an outflow of $276.6 million in FY-2023 largely due to drawings on the Company’s RCF during the year offsetting the financing cash outflows from the settlement of the Company’s convertible notes. Cash flows used in financing activities in FY-2023 included the $330.0 million settlement of the Company’s convertible notes, dividends paid to shareholders of $200.4 million, payments of dividends to minorities of $74.7 million, repayment of the drawn portions of the Company’s RCF of $70.0 million, payments of financing and other fees of $68.6 million largely related to the coupon payments for the senior notes and the RCF, payments for the acquisition of the Company’s own shares through its share buyback programme of $61.5 million, settlement of contingent considerations of $50.0 million that was paid to Barrick Gold as part of the Massawa acquisition, cash settlement of call rights of $28.5 million related to outstanding call rights from Teranga, repayment of finance and lease obligations of $20.5 million and payments for the settlement of tracker shares of $18.4 million. Financing cash outflows were partly offset by a $642.2 million drawdown of long-term debt facilities (including $535.0 million drawn from the Company’s RCF and $107.2 million drawn from the Lafigué term loan) and receipts on exercise of options and warrants of $5.9 million. EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS The table below presents the earnings and adjusted earnings for Endeavour for the three month periods ended 31 December 2023, 30 September 2023, and 31 December 2022 and the twelve month periods ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 with accompanying explanations below.

NOTES: 4) Revenue increased by $49.3 million from $530.0 million in Q3-2023 to $579.3 million in Q4-2023 due to a $109 per ounce increase in the realised gold price from $1,898 per ounce in Q3-2023 to $2,007 per ounce in Q4-2023, exclusive of the Company’s Revenue Protection Programme, further compounded by an increase in gold sales from continuing operations from 278koz in Q3-2023 to 285koz in Q4-2023 due to the timing of gold sales. Revenue increased by $45.6 million from $2,069.0 million in FY-2022 to $2,114.6 million in FY-2023 due to a $148 per ounce increase in the realised gold price, exclusive of the Company’s Revenue Protection Programme, from $1,791 per ounce in FY-2022 to $1,939 per ounce in FY-2023, which was partially offset by a decrease in gold sales from continuing operations from 1,150koz in FY-2022 to 1,084koz in FY-2023 due to lower production at the Sabodala-Massawa and Mana mines. 5) Operating expenses increased by $3.4 million from $205.3 million in Q3-2023 to $208.7 million in Q4-2023 largely due to the matching of accrued expenses from Q3-2023 associated to ounces produced in Q3-2023 and subsequently sold in Q4-2023, particularly at Sabodala-Massawa where ounces sold exceeded quarterly production. Operating expenses increased by $67.2 million from $720.0 million in FY-2022 to $787.2 million in FY-2023 due to increased mining volumes at Houndé and Mana, increased processing volumes at Houndé, Sabodala-Massawa and Ity, increased fuel and consumable costs, and the impact of the stronger EUR to USD foreign exchange rate increasing costs in FY-2023 compared to FY-2022. 6) Depreciation and depletion increased by $18.2 million from $114.4 million in Q3-2023 to $132.6 million in Q4-2023 mainly due to higher production volumes achieved at Sabodala-Massawa as mining in the Sabodala pit, which is approaching the end of its mine life, incorporated higher associated depreciation rates. Depreciation and depletion decreased by $27.6 million from $476.0 million in FY-2022 to $448.4 million in FY-2023 due to lower production volumes in combination with the lower depreciable base following the 2022 reserves and resource update. 7) Royalties increased by $8.4 million from $31.9 million in Q3-2023 to $40.3 million in Q4-2023 due to an increase in the realised gold price as noted above, higher volumes of gold sold and the previously disclosed impact of the change in the sliding scale royalty rates in Burkina Faso, which came into effect in November 2023. Royalties increased by $9.2 million from $124.5 million in FY-2022 to $133.7 million in FY-2023 due to an increase in the realised gold price as noted above and the previously disclosed impact of the change in the sliding scale royalty rates in Burkina Faso, which came into effect in November 2023, partially offset by lower volumes of gold sold. 8) Corporate costs increased slightly from $10.4 million in Q3-2023 to $11.1 million in Q4-2023 due to higher general corporate costs associated with bonus accruals, partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation due to a credit in remuneration tied to forfeited compensation from the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer. Corporate costs increased slightly from $47.7 million in FY-2022 to $49.0 million in FY-2023 due to higher employee and professional service costs partially offset by a reduction in general corporate overhead. 9) The Group recognised a non-cash impairment of mining interest and goodwill of $122.6 million in FY-2023 consisting of $65.7 million recognised against exploration properties where there is no near term activities planned and $56.9 million recognised against the Kalana project based on updated assumptions from the ongoing technical studies. The recognition of impairments against exploration properties primarily related to a $32.5 million impairment of the Kamsongo license on the Nabanga property in Burkina Faso in Q4-2023, $16.9 million recognised against the Afema exploration properties in Côte d’Ivoire that are in the process of being sold (of which $14.8 million was recognised in Q2-2023 and a further $2.1 million recognised in Q4-2023), and $16.3 million related to other exploration properties where there are no intentions to renew the licenses. In addition, a $56.9 million impairment was recognised on the Kalana project in Q4-2023 in relation to the envisaged changes to capital expenditure assumptions within the ongoing technical study. 10) The Group recognised other expenses of $54.8 million in FY-2023 consisting of $24.9 million in tax settlements primarily related to indirect taxes at Sabodala-Massawa, $18.7 million in expected credit losses from cash receivables related to the Boungou and Wahgnion divestment (see additional details in the Non-Core Asset Divestment section below), $9.3 million in impairments of other receivables from Allied Gold ($5.9 million) and VAT ($3.4 million), a $4.3 million loss on the disposal of assets, $4.1 million in expected credit losses from other receivables, $1.8 million in acquisition and restructuring costs, and $0.8 million in community donations which were partly offset by $9.1 million in insurance proceeds received in relation to community disturbances. 11) Exploration costs decreased by $9.3 million from $14.9 million in Q3-2023 to $5.6 million in Q4-2023 as the Group’s exploration programmes largely focused on analysis and interpretation of drilling results following the conclusion of the years’ drilling programmes early in the quarter. Exploration costs increased by $13.6 million from $33.9 million in FY-2022 to $47.5 million in FY-2023 largely due to the increased expense at the Tanda-Iguela greenfield property, where, as published on 29 November 2023, an extensive drilling programme consisting of 167,436 metres of drilling resulted in the delineation of a 4.5Moz Indicated resource, grading 1.97 g/t Au, which marked a 303% increase over the maiden Indicated resource estimate published in late 2022, thereby confirming its potential to be a Tier 1 asset. 12) The loss on financial instruments decreased by $91.5 million from a gain of $7.2 million in Q3-2023 to a loss of $84.3 million in Q4-2023 largely due to an increase in unrealised losses on gold collars and forward sales and the change in fair value of Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalties related to asset sales partially offset by gains on foreign exchange movements. The loss on financial instruments in Q4-2023 included unrealised losses on gold collars and forward sales of $38.9 million, unrealised losses on NSRs related to the Boungou and Wahgnion divestment of $24.3 million, realised losses on gold collars and forward contracts of $17.8 million, and unrealised losses on marketable securities of $11.7 million related to the $50.0 million investment in Allied Gold shares. Losses on financial instruments were partially offset by unrealised foreign exchange gains of $8.0 million, an unrealised gain on foreign currency contracts of $0.7 million and realised gains on foreign currency contracts of $0.4 million. The loss on financial instruments increased by $98.9 million from a loss of $19.1 million in FY-2022 to a loss of $118.0 million in FY-2023 and comprised of unrealised losses on NSRs and deferred consideration related to asset sales of $24.1 million, realised losses on gold collars and forward contracts of $21.3 million, unrealised losses on gold collars and forward contracts of $21.2 million, an unrealised loss on marketable securities of $20.5 million, a fair value loss on the conversion option of convertible notes of $14.9 million, unrealised foreign exchange losses of $13.3 million, a loss on the fair value of call rights of $9.0 million, unrealised losses on foreign currency contracts of $4.2 million, and a loss on the change in fair value of contingent considerations of $0.6 million related to Teranga’s acquisition of the Massawa property. Losses on financial instruments were partially offset by an unrealised gain on the conversion of financial assets of $6.6 million related to the listing of Allied Shares and a realised gain on foreign currency contracts of $4.0 million and a gain on other financial instruments of $0.5 million. As previously disclosed, in order to increase cash flow visibility during its construction and de-leveraging phases, Endeavour entered into a Revenue Protection Programme, using a combination of zero premium gold collars and forward sales contracts, to cover a portion of its 2023, 2024 and 2025 production. During Q4-2023, 30koz were settled into forward sales contracts for an average gold price of $1,828/oz. For FY-2024, approximately 450koz (approximately 113koz per quarter), are expected to be delivered into a collar with an average call price of $2,400/oz and an average put price of $1,807/oz. In addition, during H1-2024, a total of approximately 70koz (approximately 35koz per quarter) are expected to be settled in forward sales contracts with an average gold price of $2,033/oz.For FY-2025, approximately 200koz (approximately 50koz per quarter) are expected to be delivered into a collar with an average call price of $2,400/oz and an average put price of $1,992/oz. As previously disclosed, Endeavour entered into a Growth Capital Protection Programme designed to enhance cost certainty for a portion of its growth capital expenditure at its Sabodala-Massawa expansion and Lafigué growth projects. The Group had entered into various foreign exchange forward contracts across both the Euro and the Australian Dollar over 2023 and 2024. During Q4-2023, €13.6 million was delivered into forward contracts at a blended rate of 1.03 EUR:USD and AU$6.5 million was delivered into forward contracts at a blended rate of 0.69 AUD:USD.The total outstanding notional forward contracted quantum is approximately €13.0 million at a blended rate of 1.04 EUR:USD and approximately AU$5.7 million at a blended rate of 0.69 AUD:USD for 2024. 13) Current income tax expense increased by $21.3 million from $53.5 million in Q3-2023 to $74.8 million in Q4-2023 largely due to the recognition of withholding tax expenses of $30.1 million following local Board approvals for cash upstreaming at Ity and increased corporate taxes following higher taxable earnings during the quarter. Current income tax expense increased by $10.1 million from $257.8 million in FY-2022 to $267.9 million in FY-2023 due to higher withholding tax expenses following larger amounts of cash upstreamed this year, partially offset by lower taxable earnings in FY-2023. 14) Deferred income tax increased by $11.3 million from the deferred income tax expense of $1.6 million in Q3-2023 to a deferred income tax recovery of $9.7 million in Q4-2023 mainly due to the deferred tax impact of the impairment of the Kalana project, partially offset by the effect of foreign exchange remeasurements on deferred tax balances. Deferred income tax recovery increased by $49.6 million from $7.5 million in FY-2022 to $57.1 million in FY-2023 largely due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities that were previously recognised on mining interests. These liabilities arose from the difference between Sabodala-Massawa’s tax base and accounting base, which included fair value adjustments when it was initially acquired. In addition, the impairment of the Kalana project reduced its carrying value and the associated deferred tax liability, which also arose when the project was acquired. 15) Net comprehensive earnings from continuing operations decreased by $221.1 million from net comprehensive earnings of $73.6 million in Q3-2023 to a net comprehensive loss of $147.5 million in Q4-2023. The decrease in earnings is largely driven by the loss on financial instruments following the mark-to-market of gold collars, forward contracts and changes in foreign exchange rates in addition to the change in fair value of NSRs and marketable securities, the non-cash impairment charge on mineral interests, higher other expenses reflecting the impairment of deferred cash consideration from asset disposals and tax claims related to Sabodala-Massawa, higher tax expenses driven by the recognition of withholding taxes during the quarter and higher royalties. Net comprehensive earnings from continuing operations decreased by $214.1 million from $256.8 million in FY-2022 to $42.7 million in FY-2023. The decrease in earnings is largely driven by the loss on financial instruments following the mark-to-market of gold collars, forward contracts and changes in foreign exchange rates, the non-cash impairment charge on mineral interests, higher tax expenses, higher exploration expense, and lower earnings from mine operations due to higher operating expenses and royalties. 16) For Q4-2023, adjustments included a non-cash impairment charge of $107.8 million as discussed above, a net loss on financial instruments of $66.5 million related to the unrealised loss on forward sales and collars and change in fair value of NSRs and marketable securities, other expenses of $45.1 million primarily related to the impairment of the deferred cash consideration mentioned above and a net loss from discontinued operations of $2.4 million related to a tax payment for the disposed Karma mine, partially offset by a gain on non-cash, tax and other adjustments of $14.8 million that mainly relate to the impact of foreign exchange remeasurements of deferred tax balances. For FY-2023, adjustments included an impairment charge of $122.6 million related to the Group’s exploration permit portfolio and the Kalana project, a net loss on financial instruments of $96.7 million, related to the unrealised loss on forward sales and collars and a change in fair value of NSRs and marketable securities and the fair value loss on the convertible option of convertible notes and other expenses of $54.8 million, partly offset by a gain on non-cash, tax and other adjustments of $11.8 million that mainly relate to the impact of the foreign exchange remeasurement of deferred tax balance. 17) Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders for continuing operations decreased by $27.4 million from $69.5 million (or $0.28 per share) in Q3-2023 to $42.1 million (or $0.17 per share) in Q4-2023, due to higher tax expense, higher depreciation, higher realised losses on gold forwards and higher royalties. Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders for continuing operations decreased by $62.4 million from $292.7 million (or $1.18 per share) in FY-2022 to $230.2 million (or $0.93 per share) in FY-2023 due to lower operating margins, higher exploration costs, higher taxes and higher realised losses on gold forwards. SUMMARISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION The table below presents the summarised statement of financial position and liquidity for the Group as at 31 December 2023, and 31 December 2022, with accompanying explanations below. Table 6: Summarised Statement of Financial Position All amounts in US$ million unless otherwise specified Note As at 31 December 2023 As at 31 December 2022 ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents 517 951 Other current assets [18] 603 495 Total current assets 1,120 1,446 Mining interests [19] 4,157 4,517 Other long term assets [20] 581 451 TOTAL ASSETS 5,859 6,415 LIABILITIES Other current liabilities [21] 439 462 Current portion of debt [22] 9 337 Income taxes payable [23] 166 247 Total current liabilities 613 1,046 Long-term debt [24] 1,060 488 Environmental rehabilitation provision 115 165 Other long-term liabilities 58 54 Deferred income taxes 464 575 TOTAL LIABILITIES 2,310 2,327 TOTAL EQUITY 3,548 4,087 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 5,859 6,415 NOTES: 18) Other current assets as at 31 December 2023 consisted of $224.9 million of inventories, $269.2 million of trade and other receivables, $39.2 million of prepaid expenses and other, and $69.7 million of other financial assets. Inventories decreased by $95.8 million from $326.3 million as at 31 December 2022 to $224.9 million as at 31 December 2023, primarily due to a reduction in spare parts and supplies as a result of the divestment of the Boungou and Wahgnion mines and reclassification of certain ore stockpiles to long-term at Sabodala-Massawa as they are not expected to be processed in the next twelve months. Trade and other receivables increased by $162.3 million from $118.4 million as at 31 December 2022 to $269.2 million as at 31 December 2023, primarily due to the consideration-related receivables following the divestment of the Boungou and Wahgnion mines of $111.4 million, an increase in gold sales receivables of $24.5 million due to timing of shipments, an increase in VAT receivables of $30.6 million and an increase in other receivables of $9.5 million related primarily to the residual working capital payment outstanding for the sale of the Boungou and Wahgnion mines. These factors were partly offset by the decrease in advance payments of $13.7 million following the divestment of Boungou and Wahgnion. Prepaid expenses and other decreased by $11.9 million from $58.9 million as at 31 December 2022 to $39.2 million as at 31 December 2023, primarily due to the reclassification of the investment in Allied shares after public listing from marketable securities to financial assets and the removal of Boungou and Wahgnion related prepayments. This was in part offset by an increase in insurance and security prepayments across the continuing Group.Other financial assets increased by $53.1 million from $3.7 million as at 31 December 2022 to $69.7 million as at 31 December 2023 primarily due to the addition of the current portion of the net smelter royalty (“NSR”) and deferred portion of the consideration for the sale of Boungou and Wahgnion. 19) Mining Interests decreased by $359.9 million from $4,517.0 million as at 31 December 2022 to $4,157.1 million as at 31 December 2023 due to the divestment of the Boungou and Wahgnion assets on 30 June 2023, the impairment on the Kalana project and the impairment of exploration properties, partly offset by $762.6 million of capital expenditure on mining interests during the year. 20) Other long-term assets increased by $129.9 million from $451.3 million as at 31 December 2022 to $581.2 million as at 31 December 2023 and consisted of $323.6 million of long-term stockpiles not expected to be processed in the next twelve months at the Houndé, Ity and Sabodala-Massawa mines, $134.4 million of goodwill allocated to the Sabodala-Massawa and Mana mines, other financial assets of $123.2 million that primarily comprise the deferred cash and NSR consideration elements of the sale of Boungou, Wahgnion and Karma mines, and $41.1 million of restricted cash mainly relating to reclamation bonds. 21) Other current liabilities decreased by $23.2 million from $461.9 million as at 31 December 2022 to $438.7 million as at 31 December 2023 and consisted of $406.9 million of trade and other payables, $17.5 million of other financial liabilities consisting of foreign currency, gold forward derivative contracts, PSU and DSU liabilities, and $14.3 million of lease liabilities. Trade and other payables increased by $52.3 million due to dividends payable to the minority shareholders at Ity and an increase in payables related to the BIOX® and Lafigué growth projects, in part offset by the de-recognition of the Boungou and Wahgnion associated payables following their disposal. Other financial liabilities decreased primarily due to the settlements of the Barrick contingent liability of $50.0 million and the call-rights liability of $28.5 million, in part offset by an increase in derivative financial liabilities. 22) The current portion of debt decreased by $328.1 million from $336.6 million as at 31 December 2022 to $8.5 million as at 31 December 2023 due to the settlement of the Convertible Notes and the associated conversion option during Q1-2023, of which the principal of $330.0 million was repaid in cash at the Company’s election and 835,254 shares were issued to holders of the Convertible Notes to settle the in the money option of $19.2 million as the share price was at a premium to the strike price at maturity. 23) Income taxes payable decreased by $80.9 million from $247.1 million as at 31 December 2022 to $166.2 million as at 31 December 2023 due largely to the de-recognition of Wahgnion and Boungou associated payables, the payment of tax assessments and the timing of 2023 provisional and 2022 true-up tax payments during FY-2023, partly offset by additional income tax expense accrued during FY-2023. 24) The non-current portion of long-term debt increased by $571.8 million from $488.1 million as at 31 December 2022 to $1,059.9 million as at 31 December 2023 due to the additional draw down on the RCF and the Lafigué Term Loan facility.

Refer to the non-GAAP measure section in this press release and in the Management Report. 2Last Twelve Months (“LTM”) Trailing EBITDA adj. includes EBITDA generated by discontinued operations. 25) At quarter end, Endeavour’s liquidity remained strong at $757.1 million, consisting of $517.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, $180.0 million available through the Company’s revolving credit facility and $59.9 million available through the Lafigué term loan. 26) Endeavour’s net debt position has increased by $109.9 million, from $445.0 million at the end of Q3-2023 to $555.0 million at the end of Q4-2023. The net debt / Adjusted EBITDA (LTM) leverage ratio increased from 0.40x at the end of Q3-2023 to 0.50x at the end of Q4-2023. NON-CORE ASSET DIVESTMENT On 30 June 2023, Endeavour closed the divestment of its 90% interests in its non-core Boungou and Wahgnion mines in Burkina Faso to Lilium Mining (""Lilium""), a subsidiary of Lilium Capital which is an African and frontier markets focused strategic investment vehicle led by West African entrepreneurs. The total consideration is comprised of: $130.0 million in the form of a reimbursement of historical shareholder loans, of which a total of $33.0 million has been received to date. The remaining $97.0 million is outstanding.$25.0 million in deferred cash consideration payable in two instalments of $10.0 million, which became payable in Q1-2024 and has not been received, and $15.0 million, which will become payable in Q2-2024. A deferred cash consideration comprised of 50% of the net free cashflow generated by the Boungou mine until $55.0 million has been paid. No payments have thus far been received for this deferred cash consideration as Lilium has not had any commercial production from Boungou since their acquisition given their election to place the mine on care and maintenance due to supply chain and security challenges. An NSR on Wahgnion commencing at closing of the transaction for 4.0% of gold sold, of which a total of approximately $2.6 million has been received as at 31 December 2023. An NSR on Boungou commencing at closing of the transaction for 4.0% of gold sold, of which a total of approximately $0.5 million has been received as at 31 December 2023. Endeavour recorded an $18.7 million expected credit loss on the outstanding upfront and deferred cash considerations expected to be received from the divestment of the Boungou and Wahgnion mines in Q4-2023. The expected credit loss was calculated using an International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) provision based on a probability of default (25%) and expected loss on default (60%) applied against the outstanding cash consideration. In Q4-2023, Endeavour also recorded a $24.3 million unrealised loss on financial instruments related to the fair value change of the Boungou and Wahgnion NSRs, based on the performance of the assets since the divestment to reflect reduced resource upside assumptions within the expected NSRs proceeds. The updated life-of-mine scenario assumes production is limited to Proven and Probable reserves only.Following the completion of the divestment on 30 June 2023, and owing to the significant delay in receipt of payment for the overdue proceeds of the total consideration, Endeavour has filed certain claims against Lilium and its financial institutions as detailed below: Endeavour Canada Holdings Corporation (“ECH”) and Endeavour Gold Corporation (“EGC”), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, have certain claims (“Claims”) under the terms of (i) a sale and purchase agreement between ECH and Lilium Gold (“LG”) and Lilium Holdings Ltd (“LH”, together with LG, “Lilium”) (the “SPA”) relating to the non-core asset divestment; and (ii) two stand-by letters of credit between related financial institutions in Burkina Faso (the “Financial Institutions”) and each of EGC and ECH (the “SBLCs”), which were established to reimburse historical shareholder loans to the Endeavour group. The SPA Claim concerns the failure of Lilium to fulfil certain payment obligations under the SPA in relation to the shareholder loans as well as deferred consideration. The SBLC Claim concerns the failure of the Financial Institutions to honour their parallel payment obligations in relation to the shareholder loans under the SBLCs. The Company has filed for arbitration proceedings against both Lilium (with the London Court of International Arbitration in London) and the Financial Institutions (with the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris) on 1 March, 2024 and 29 February, 2024, respectively. Claims against Lilium are approximately $125.0 million, and claims against the Financial Institutions are approximately $99.0 million (in each case excluding interests and costs). OPERATING SUMMARY As previously disclosed, on 28 February 2024, we were saddened to report that a contractor colleague passed away on 27 February 2024, as a result of injuries sustained in an incident that occurred during maintenance activities at the Mana mine in Burkina Faso. The health, safety and welfare of our colleagues are our top priority and we extend our sincere sympathies and support to his family, colleagues and friends. Endeavour has conducted a comprehensive internal investigation into the incident and is focussed on improvements to training, front-line supervision and reviewing operational procedures.The Group demonstrated strong safety performance in FY-2023, with a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) from continuing operations of 0.05. Endeavour will continue to prioritise safety in accordance with its zero-harm target.Q4-2023 production from continuing operations amounted to 280koz and was flat over Q3-2023 as the anticipated decrease at Houndé was offset by increases at Sabodala-Massawa (albeit by less than anticipated due to the lower grades encountered in the Sabodala pit as it enters its final phase of mining) and Mana, while Ity remained flat. The all-in sustaining costs (""AISC"") decreased by $20/oz or 2.1% over Q3-2023 to approximately $947/oz despite a $24/oz increase in royalty costs linked to the higher realised gold price and the impact of the change in the sliding scale royalty rates in Burkina Faso, which came into effect in November 2023. The AISC benefitted from reductions at Sabodala-Massawa and Mana, which was offset by the increase at Houndé while Ity remained flat. FY-2023 production from continuing operations amounted to 1,072koz, achieving the guided 1,060-1,135koz range and marking the 11th consecutive year of achieving or beating production guidance. The AISC from continuing operations amounted to an industry-leading $967/oz for FY-2023. As shown in the table below, Endeavour achieved near the top-end of the guided $895-950/oz AISC range, albeit 1.8% (representing $17/oz) above due to royalties being $18/oz higher than anticipated due to a higher realised gold price ($1,939/oz compared to the guidance gold price of $1,750/oz) and the increase in the Burkina Faso royalty rate which came into effect in November 2023. Table 8: Group Production and All-In Sustaining Cost from Continuing Operations Compared to Guidance 2023 ACTUALS 2023 GUIDANCE PRODUCTION FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS 1,072 1,060 — 1,135 AISC FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE ROYALTY COSTS, $/oz 844 790 — 845 Royalty cost, $/oz1 123 105 AISC FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, $/oz 967 895 — 950 12023 AISC guidance was based on a gold price of $1,750/oz compared to the realised gold price of $1,952/oz FY-2023 production from continuing operations of 1,072koz, decreased by 89koz or 8% over the 1,161koz produced in FY-2022 due to lower production at Mana (due to the transition from an open-pit to an underground operation at the Wona deposit) and at Sabodala-Massawa (due to mining and processing of lower grade ore), while both Houndé and Ity achieved record annual production. FY-2023 AISC from continuing operations increased by $118/oz, from $849/oz in FY-2022 to approximately $967/oz in FY-2023, as AISC increased at Houndé, Mana, Sabodala-Massawa and at Corporate, in addition to a $15/oz increase in royalty costs (from $108/oz in FY-2022 to $123/oz in FY-2023), which was partially offset by a decrease in AISC at Ity. The FY-2023 AISC from continuing operations increased by $3/oz from the preliminary $964/oz published on 22 January 2024 due to a reclassification of underground development costs at Mana, which was partially offset by a reduction in corporate costs tied to the former Chief Executive Officer’s forfeited compensation.

This is largely due to the start-up of the Sabodala-Massawa BIOX® Expansion project, expected in early May and the Lafigué project, expected in Q2-2024. The AISC is expected to remain consistent with that achieved over recent quarters at an industry-low $955-1,035/oz. Group production is expected to be more heavily weighted towards H2-2024 while AISC is also expected to be lower in H2-2024 as the Group's organic growth projects are expected to significantly increase the quality of Endeavour's portfolio and performance at the Houndé mine is expected to be weighted towards H2-2024, due to the mine sequence and a temporary disruption to mining and processing activities due to a strike that occurred during Q1-2024. On 23 January 2024 a strike, led by a sub-contractor, at the Houndé mine resulted in a temporary stoppage of mining and processing activities that lasted for 11 days. The disruption is not expected to impact full year production and AISC guidance for the Houndé mine or the Group. More details on individual mine guidances have been provided in the below sections.Total mine capital expenditure for FY-2024, consisting of both sustaining and non-sustaining capital spend, is expected to be approximately $315.0 million, which marks a decrease of $19.2 million or 6% compared to the FY-2023 expenditure.Growth capital spend for FY-2024 is expected to amount to approximately $245.0 million, which marks a decrease of $202.5 million or 45% compared to the FY-2023 expenditure of $447.5 million. The FY-2024 expenditure is expected to consist of approximately $75.0 million of remaining growth capital for the Sabodala-Massawa BIOX® Expansion project and approximately $170.0 million of remaining growth capital for the Lafigué project. Exploration will continue to be a strong focus in FY-2024 with a company-wide exploration budget of $65.0 million. For FY-2024, approximately $15.0 million will be spent on the highly prospective Tanda-Iguela property in Côte d'Ivoire, which already ranks as one of the most significant discoveries made in West Africa over the last decade. Details on individual asset exploration programmes are provided in the operations section below. OPERATING ACTIVITIES BY MINE Houndé Gold Mine, Burkina Faso Table 11: Houndé Performance Indicators For The Period Ended Q4-2023 Q3-2023 Q4-2022 FY-2023 FY-2022 Tonnes ore mined, kt 1,499 1,209 1,912 5,420 5,754 Total tonnes mined, kt 11,993 10,603 12,901 47,680 45,490 Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) 7.00 7.77 5.75 7.80 6.91 Tonnes milled, kt 1,360 1,400 1,359 5,549 5,043 Grade, g/t 2.15 2.68 1.55 1.92 1.92 Recovery rate, % 90 91 92 91 93 Production, koz 84 109 63 312 295 Total cash cost/oz 837 704 793 835 701 AISC/oz 901 787 969 943 809 Q4-2023 vs Q3-2023 Insights Production decreased from 109koz in Q3-2023 to 84koz in Q4-2023, due to lower processed grades and slightly lower throughput and recoveries. Total tonnes mined increased due to higher utilisation of the mining fleet following the end of the wet season. Tonnes of ore mined increased as a higher volume of ore was mined in the Vindaloo Main pit, following waste stripping activity that completed in Q3-2023, which was partially offset by the lower volumes of ore mined from the Kari Pump and Kari West pits, which was in-line with mine sequencing.Tonnes milled decreased slightly due to a higher proportion of harder transitional and fresh ore in the mill feed.Processed grades decreased due to lower grade oxide ore sourced from the Kari Pump pit as well as a greater proportion of lower grade Kari West and Vindaloo Main ore.Recovery rates decreased slightly due to a higher proportion of transitional and fresh ore, with lower associated recoveries in the mill feed. AISC increased from $787/oz in Q3-2023 to $901/oz in Q4-2023 due to lower production and sales, driven by the lower average grade in the ore blend, this was partially offset by a decrease in mining unit costs with the increase in volumes in Q4-2023 and a reduction in sustaining capital.Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from $9.0 million in Q3-2023 to $5.4 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to waste development at the Kari West pit, plant equipment upgrades and heavy mining equipment maintenance.Non-sustaining capital expenditure increased from $3.3 million in Q3-2023 to $7.6 million in Q4-2023, and primarily related to the ongoing waste development at the Kari Pump pit and the stage 8 and 9 tailings storage facility (“TSF”) raises. FY-2023 vs FY-2022 Insights FY-2023 production totalled a record 312koz, exceeding the guided 270-285koz range, due to higher than expected grades from the Kari Pump pit as well as better than expected mill performance following the completion of processing plant optimisation initiatives that improved mill availability and reduced blockages. FY-2023 AISC amounted to approximately $943/oz, which was above the $850-925/oz guided range due to higher royalty payments, in addition to increases in consumable costs and longer waste hauling distances during the year.Production increased from 295koz in FY-2022 to 312koz in FY-2023 due to increased mill throughput, driven by optimisation initiatives, which was partially offset by slightly lower recoveries due to changes in the ore blend. AISC increased from $809/oz in FY-2022 to $943/oz in FY-2023 due to higher royalty costs, higher sustaining capital expenditure and higher mining and processing costs following fuel and consumable cost increases. 2024 Outlook Houndé is expected to produce between 260-290koz in FY-2024 at AISC of $1,000-1,100/oz.On 23 January 2024 a strike led by a sub-contractor at the Houndé mine resulted in a temporary stoppage of mining and processing activities lasting 11 days. The stoppage is expected to impact Q1-2024 production and AISC, but at this stage it is not expected to impact full year production and AISC guidance, with mine plan optimisation strategies underway in order to catch up lost production through the remainder of the year. Mining activities are expected to continue to focus on the Vindaloo Main, Kari Pump, and Kari West pits. In H1-2024, ore is expected to be primarily sourced from the Kari West pit while stripping activities focus on the Kari Pump and Vindaloo Main pits, while in H2-2024, a greater volume of ore is expected to be mined from the higher grade Kari Pump pit. Production is expected to be weighted towards H2-2024 with greater volumes of higher grade ore from the Kari Pump pit expected to be mined in H2-2024. Tonnes of ore milled are expected to decrease in FY-2024 as a lower proportion of soft oxide ore from the Kari West pit is anticipated in the ore blend as the Kari West pit advances into harder transitional and fresh ore. The increase in the proportion of harder transitional and fresh material in the ore blend is expected to result in a slight decrease in grades and processing recoveries in addition to slightly higher mining and processing unit costs, driving higher AISC compared to FY-2023. In addition, royalty costs are expected to be higher due to the higher prevailing current gold price and the change in the sliding scale royalty rates that became effective in November 2023 in Burkina Faso (with the new rate resulting in a $28/oz increase at a gold price of $1,850/oz).Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to increase from $33.9 million in FY-2023 to approximately $40.0 million in FY-2024, and primarily relates to waste stripping at the Kari Pump and Kari West pits, mining fleet component rebuilds and replacements, processing plant equipment upgrades and dewatering borehole drilling. Non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to decrease from $38.3 million in FY-2023 to approximately $20.0 million in FY-2024, and primarily relates to stripping activity associated with a push back at the Vindaloo Main pit, the stage 8/9 TSF raise and land compensation for the third TSF cell. Ity Gold Mine, Côte d’Ivoire Table 12: Ity Performance Indicators For The Period Ended Q4-2023 Q3-2023 Q4-2022 FY-2023 FY-2022 Tonnes ore mined, kt 1,721 1,246 1,662 6,790 7,044 Total tonnes mined, kt 7,349 6,020 6,043 27,891 23,946 Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) 3.27 3.83 2.64 3.11 2.40 Tonnes milled, kt 1,593 1,494 1,710 6,714 6,351 Grade, g/t 1.63 1.60 1.73 1.63 1.80 Recovery rate, % 91 93 87 92 85 Production, koz 74 73 82 324 313 Total cash cost/oz 829 826 816 777 769 AISC/oz 865 864 847 809 812 Q4-2023 vs Q3-2023 Insights Production remained flat at 74koz in Q4-2023 as higher tonnes milled and higher processing grades were offset by lower recoveries. Total tonnes mined increased, as anticipated, due to increased mining rates following the wet season in the prior quarter and increased stripping activities at the Walter pit cutback. Similarly, tonnes of ore mined increased following the end of the wet season as ore mining focussed on the Ity, Walter, Bakatouo and Le Plaque pits, with supplemental contributions from the Verse Ouest pit and stockpiles.Tonnes milled increased due to higher crusher availability following the wet season impact in the prior quarter. Processed grades increased slightly due to higher volumes of higher grade ore sourced from the Ity and Bakatouo pits in the mill feed, which was partially offset by lower grade ore sourced from the Walter and Le Plaque pits during the quarter.Recovery rates decreased slightly due to a higher proportion of fresh ore, with lower associated recoveries, in the mill feed. AISC remained flat at $865/oz in Q4-2023 as higher royalty rates associated with higher gold prices were offset by lower processing unit costs associated with increased processing volumes following the end of the wet season.Sustaining capital expenditure remained flat at $2.7 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to dewatering borehole drilling and plant equipment upgrades.Non-sustaining capital expenditure slightly increased from $23.3 million in Q3-2023 to $26.0 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to cut back activities at the Walter pit, TSF 2 construction, development of the Mineral Sizer and Recyn optimisation initiatives. FY-2023 vs FY-2022 Insights FY-2023 production totalled a record 324koz, exceeding the guided 285-300koz range, due to higher than expected throughput as a high proportion of soft oxide ore was mined, largely from the Le Plaque pit, which was supported by the continued use of the surge bin, and higher than expected recoveries. FY-2023 AISC amounted to approximately $809/oz, which was below the guided $840-915/oz range, largely due to higher than expected gold sales volumes in addition to lower than expected mining and processing unit costs as a result of higher than expected volumes of ore mined and processed.Production increased from 313koz in FY-2022 to 324koz in FY-2023 following an increase in throughput rates due to the processing of a greater proportion of softer oxide ore and an increase in recovery rates related to the cessation of mining at the Daapleu pit in 2023, which was partially offset by lower average processed grades. FY-2023 AISC decreased slightly from $812/oz in FY-2022 to $809/oz in FY-2023 due to the increase in gold sales volume and lower sustaining capital expenditure. 2024 Outlook Ity is expected to produce between 270 - 300koz at an AISC of $850 - $925/oz. Ore mining activities are expected to focus on the Ity, Bakatouo, Walter, Le Plaque and Daapleu pits, which will be supplemented with ore from the Verse Ouest pit and stockpiles. Production is expected to be slightly higher in the first half of the year due to greater availability of high grade ore from the Ity and Bakatouo pits in the mine plan and the wet season impact in H2-2024 on mining and milling rates. Throughput is expected to be slightly higher than in FY-2023, due to the commissioning of the Mineral Sizer in H2-2024, which is expected to increase throughput rates during the wet season. Milled grades and recoveries are expected to decrease slightly compared to FY-2023, due to the introduction of lower grade semi-refractory ore from the Daapleu pit. AISC is expected to increase in FY-2024 due to the guided lower levels of production and gold sales. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to be consistent with FY-2023 at approximately $10.0 million in FY-2024 and is primarily related to waste stripping activities across several pits, de-watering borehole drilling and processing plant upgrades and replacements.Non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to decrease from $102.8 million in FY-2023 to approximately $45.0 million in FY-2024, and is primarily related to pre-stripping activity at the Daapleu pit, TSF 2 earthworks and site infrastructure, in addition to the ongoing Mineral Sizer development and other smaller optimisation initiatives. The Mineral Sizer, which was launched in 2023 for a total capex of $19.0 million, is expected to be commissioned in H2-2024, and will add an additional primary crusher for the oxide ores in order to sustain higher plant throughput rates regardless of the ore blend.

Total open pit tonnes mined decreased as mining rates at the Maoula open pit decreased as the pit approaches the end of its economic mine life.Total underground tonnes of ore mined increased as stope production accelerated at the Wona and Siou Underground deposits. Underground development continued to ramp-up with 3,059 metres of development completed across both Siou and Wona compared to 2,685 metres of development completed in the prior quarter.Tonnes milled decreased as tonnes of ore mined from the Maoula open pit decreased and the plant was limited to available ore from underground sources. Average grades processed increased due to a higher proportion of higher-grade ore from stope production at the Wona and Siou underground deposits in the mill feed replacing lower grade ore from the Maoula open pit. Recovery rates increased slightly due to changes in the ore blend. AISC decreased from $1,734/oz in Q3-2023 to $1,482/oz in Q4-2023 due to higher volumes of gold sold associated with the continued ramp-up of the Wona underground mine. The Q4-2023 AISC increased from preliminary AISC of $1,301/oz published on 22 January 2024 due to a reclassification of lateral underground waste development from non-sustaining capital into operating expense, partly offset by a reclassification of underground contractor mobilisation costs from sustaining capital to non-sustaining capital.Sustaining capital expenditure increased from $4.2 million in Q3-2023 to $10.3 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to infrastructure improvements. Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased from $11.6 million in Q3-2023 to $8.8 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to underground development, underground infrastructure and the stage 5 TSF embankment raise. FY-2023 vs FY-2022 Insights FY-2023 production totalled 142koz which, as previously disclosed, was below the guided 190-210koz range and FY-2023 AISC amounted to approximately $1,427/oz, which as previously disclosed, was above the guided $950-$1,050/oz guided range, due to a slower than expected ramp up by a new underground mining contractor at the Wona underground deposit resulting in lower than expected ore tonnes mined and consequently processed grades and throughput.Production decreased from 195koz in FY-2022 to 142koz in FY-2023 largely due to lower grades milled as lower grade ore sourced from the Maoula open pit supplemented the mill feed and due to lower underground grades as the Wona underground deposit continues to ramp up, partially offset by higher underground mined tonnes. AISC increased from $994/oz in FY-2022 to $1,427/oz in FY-2023 due to lower volumes of gold sold, higher open pit strip ratio, higher underground mining unit costs and higher fuel and consumable costs. 2024 Outlook Mana is expected to produce within the 150 - 170koz range at an AISC above the guided $1,200 - $1,300/oz range.Production is expected primarily from the Siou and Wona underground mines, with open pit activities tailing off during Q1-2024. A further step-up in stoping is expected at Wona, which will be the primary contributor in 2024, with production weighted toward H2-2024. Throughput is expected to be higher than FY-2023 due to the availability of ore from Siou and Wona. AISC is expected to decrease in FY-2024 due to guided increase in production and gold sales. As previously disclosed, on 28 February 2024, and detailed above in the Operating Summary section, a contractor colleague passed away on 27 February 2024 at the Mana mine. The underground mining contractor ceased its mining operations in the Wona underground mine while the investigation was undertaken, and they resumed operations within two days. The stoppage is not expected to impact Q1-2024 performance or FY-2024 performance as processing activities were not impacted.Sustaining capital expenditure outlook for FY-2024 is $15.0 million, which relates primarily to underground development activities at Wona. Non-Sustaining capital expenditure outlook for FY-2024 is expected to be $45.0 million, a decrease from $53.6 million incurred in FY-2023. Non-sustaining spend in FY-2024 primarily consists of continued underground development at Wona as the mine reaches its stoping rate and TSF construction. Sabodala-Massawa Gold Mine, Senegal Table 14: Sabodala-Massawa Performance Indicators For The Period Ended Q4-2023 Q3-2023 Q4-2022 FY-2023 FY-2022 Tonnes ore mined, kt 1,884 1,745 1,727 6,205 6,449 Total tonnes mined, kt 11,319 11,989 12,645 45,943 49,259 Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) 5.01 5.87 6.32 6.40 6.64 Tonnes milled, kt 1,255 1,175 1,154 4,755 4,289 Grade, g/t 2.31 2.06 3.16 2.15 2.88 Recovery rate, % 89 91 88 89 89 Production, koz 85 69 103 294 358 Total cash cost/oz 686 758 559 688 577 AISC/oz 700 840 661 767 691 Q4-2023 vs Q3-2023 Insights Production increased from 69koz in Q3-2023 to 85koz in Q4-2023 due to an increase in processed grades and throughput, which was partially offset by a slight decrease in recovery rates. Total tonnes mined decreased due to a decrease in mining activities at the Bambaraya pits in-line with the mine plan, and lower waste stripping at the Sabodala pit following stripping activities earlier in the year. The decrease was partially offset by increased stripping activities at the Massawa Central Zone pits to access higher-grade refractory ore zones ahead of the expected start-up of the BIOX® Expansion project in Q2-2024, and higher mining volumes from the Niakafiri East and Sofia North Extension pits. Tonnes of ore mined increased as stripping activities earlier in the year provided greater access to ore zones at the Sabodala pit.Tonnes milled increased as the ore blend contained a higher proportion of softer oxide ore from the Niakafiri East pit and stockpiles.Average processed grades increased due to higher grade ore sourced from the Sabodala, Massawa Central Zone and Sofia North Extension pits, displacing the comparatively lower grade ore from the Bambaraya pitsRecovery rates decreased slightly due to an increased proportion of transitional ore from the Massawa Central Zone pits in the mill feed impacting recoveries. AISC decreased from $840/oz in Q3-2023 to $700/oz in Q4-2023 due to increased gold sales driven by higher average grades and throughput, in addition to lower sustaining capital incurred during the period.Sustaining capital expenditure decreased from $5.5 million in Q3-2023 to $1.3 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to waste capitalisation at the Niakafiri East pit and mining equipment rebuilds.Non-sustaining capital expenditure decreased from $10.9 million in Q3-2023 to $8.3 million in Q4-2023 and primarily related to ongoing development activities in the Massawa area, Samina grade control activities, purchase of mining equipment and early phase solar power plant construction costs. FY-2023 vs FY-2022 Insights FY-2023 production totalled 294koz, which was below the 315-340koz guidance range due to lower production than expected in Q4-2023. This was due to lower than anticipated tonnage of high-grade ore extracted from the Sabodala pit as mining rates decreased with the deeper elevations in the pit ahead of its final phase of mining and lower grade ore mined from the Massawa Central zone. FY-2023 AISC amounted to $767/oz, near the lower end of the $760-$810/oz guided range, due to lower than planned sustaining capital incurred in the year.Production decreased from 358koz in FY-2022 to 294koz in FY-2023 due to lower average grades milled, partially offset by increased throughput due to an increased proportion of oxide ore in the mill feed. AISC increased from $691/oz in FY-2022 to $767/oz in FY-2023 due largely to lower volumes of gold sold and higher mining unit costs due to increased fuel and consumable costs, partially offset by lower processing unit costs. 2024 Outlook Sabodala-Massawa is expected to produce between 360 - 400koz in FY-2024 at a post BIOX® Expansion commercial production AISC of $750 - $850/oz. Ore for the existing CIL plant is expected to be primarily sourced from the Sabodala, Sofia North Extension and Niakafiri East pits, with supplementary ore expected to be sourced from the Kiesta pit in H2-2024. Throughput in the CIL plant is expected to decrease slightly compared to the prior year due to a higher proportion of fresh ore from the Sabodala and Sofia North Extension pits expected in the mill feed. Average processed grades in the CIL plant are expected to decrease slightly compared to the prior year, in-line with mine sequencing, with an increased proportion of the mill feed sourced from the lower grade Niakafiri East pit and stockpiles. Recovery rates in the CIL plant are expected to be largely consistent with the prior year.Refractory ore for the BIOX® plant is expected to be primarily sourced from the Massawa Central and Massawa North Zone pits. Refractory ore mined in H1-2024 is expected to be stockpiled ahead of the startup of the BIOX® Expansion project, expected in early May, and will result in H2-2024 weighted production for Sabodala-Massawa. Sustaining capital expenditure is expected to increase from $23.8 million in FY-2023 to $35.0 million in FY-2024 and is primarily related to capitalised waste stripping as well as mining fleet upgrades and re-builds and process plant upgrades.Non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to decrease from $46.2 million in FY-2023 to $40.0 million in FY-2024 and is primarily related to infrastructure for the deposition of tailings in the Sabodala pit which is expected to commence in FY-2025, advanced grade control activities at Kiesta, the TSF 1 embankment raise, purchases of new mining equipment, mine infrastructure and haul roads for the Kiesta mining area.As announced on 2 August 2023, in order to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and lower power costs at Sabodala-Massawa, the construction of a 37MWp photovoltaic (“PV”) solar facility and a 16MW battery system at the Sabodala-Massawa mine, is expected to amount to non-sustaining capital of $45.0 million for FY-2024. The initial capital cost for the solar project is expected to amount to $55.0 million, of which $5.5 million was incurred in FY-2023 mainly related to detailed engineering and design. and down payments for the procurement of long-lead items. The solar plant construction is expected to be completed by Q1-2025.Growth capital expenditure is expected to be approximately $75.0 million and is related to the BIOX® Expansion project as detailed below. Plant Expansion Construction of the Sabodala-Massawa expansion project was launched in April 2022 and remains on budget and on schedule with wet commissioning underway and first gold expected in early May.Growth capital expenditure for the expansion project is $290.0 million of which approximately $259.8 million or 90% of the total growth capital has now been committed, with pricing in line with expectations. $218.3 million, or 75%, of the growth capex incurred as at the end of FY-2023, of which $186.4 million was incurred in FY-2023 and $75.0 million is expected to be incurred in FY-2024 . The progress regarding the critical path items is detailed below: The crushing, grinding and flotation circuits has been completed and successfully wet commissioned during February with crushing, grinding and flotation of ore now underway.BIOX® reactors have been completed and the first two of six 1,220m3 reactors has been filled with inoculum, with flotation concentrate from the Massawa ore now being fed through the BIOX® circuit.Construction of the neutralisation and CCD areas were completed in February.The 18MW power plant expansion was completed and handed over to the operating team during the quarter. TSF construction is largely complete with final lining activities ramping-down.Final electrical, piping, and cable pulling is on-going on all work fronts. Lafigué Project, Côte d’Ivoire Project Update Construction of the Lafigué project in Côte d'Ivoire was launched in early Q4-2022, following the completion of a DFS which confirmed Lafigué’s potential to be a cornerstone asset for Endeavour. First gold production is expected ahead of schedule in Q2-2024, rather than Q3-2024.Growth capital expenditure for the project is approximately $448.0 million, of which approximately $410.9 million or 92% has now been committed to date, with pricing in line with expectations. $320.6 million, or 72%, of the growth capex incurred to date, of which $242.1 million was incurred in FY-2023 and approximately $170.0 million is expected to be incurred in FY-2024 mainly related to construction activities at the process plant, site infrastructure and commissioning activities. The construction progress regarding critical path items is detailed below: Construction activities are well advanced with the crushing area, milling, CIL, and elution circuits completed.Delivery of all the project shipments is over 99% complete with all key items on site.The 225kV power substation is complete with the Dabakala Switchyard and overhead power lines successfully energised during December 2023.HDPE lining of the tailings storage facility is completed.Mining equipment mobilisation has advanced and mining activities commenced during Q4-2023, with approximately 2,906 kt of material moved during Q4-2023 and 8,250 kt of material moved to date.Ancillary infrastructure including admin buildings, accommodation and offices are now largely complete. 2024 Outlook First gold production at Lafigué is expected ahead of schedule in Q2-2024. Lafigué is expected to produce between 90-110koz in FY-2024 at a post commercial production AISC of $900-975/oz, which is in line with the Definitive Feasibility Study (""DFS"") assumptions. Mining activities are expected in the western and eastern flanks of the Lafigué pit, as well as the West pit. Total mined tonnes are expected to ramp-up through the year as the fleet is progressively mobilised. Ramp-up of the processing plant is expected to be completed in H2-2024 and average processed grades are expected to increase through the ramp-up period as mining advances into the Lafigué pit through the year. Recovery rates are expected to be above 90%, while processing costs are expected to decrease through the ramp-up period.As per the DFS, sustaining capital expenditure is expected to amount to $25.0 million in FY-2024 and is primarily related to capitalised waste stripping activities, advanced grade control drilling and spare parts purchases. As per the DFS, non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to amount to $5.0 million in FY-2024 and is primarily related to the commencement of a TSF lift in H2-2024, once there is sufficient waste rock available from mining operations, and waste stripping activity in the eastern flank of the Lafigué pit. Tanda-Iguela Project, Côte d’Ivoire Project Update A Preliminary Feasibility Study (“PFS”) was launched in Q4-2023, based on the November 2023 resource update, which is expected to be finalised in late 2024. Long lead items within the PFS have been started, including metallurgical sampling, geotechnical, hydrogeological and sterilisation drilling as well as environmental permitting.Metallurgical sampling and testing is underway to follow up on the preliminary phase of testwork, which demonstrated that Assafou was amenable to conventional CIL processing with the potential for high gravity recoverable gold and overall recoveries above 94%.Geotechnical and hydrogeological drilling are underway across the Assafou deposit.Sterilisation drilling is underway to the northeast of the Assafou deposit to identify and sterilise the probable location for mine and processing infrastructure.The environmental permitting process has been launched with study work underway that will form the basis of the environmental reporting. For FY-2024 a $15.0 million exploration programme is planned at Tanda-Iguela, focused on converting resources to reserves, continuing to expand the existing Assafou resources and adding new resources at Assafou and at the prospective surrounding targets within the Tanda-Iguela permits, within 5 kilometres of the Assafou deposit. Further details on the ongoing exploration programme can be found in the Exploration section below. EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES Endeavour’s FY-2023 exploration programme comprised $100.9 million of spend, with over 395,000 metres of drilling completed, of which $22.6 million was spent in Q4-2023, including over 33,000 metres of drilling.During the year, exploration activities were mainly focussed on identifying near mine opportunities to delineate new reserves and resources over the coming years and expanding resources at the Tanda-Iguela property in Côte d'Ivoire, which now hosts an Indicated resource of 4.5Moz at 1.97 g/t Au, up 303% over the maiden Indicated resource declared in Q4-2022.Endeavour remains on track to achieve its 5-year exploration target to discover 12 - 17Moz of Indicated resources over the 2021 to 2025 period, at the low discovery cost of less than $25 per ounce.

Houndé mine An exploration programme of $8.0 million was undertaken in FY-2023 with $1.4 million spent in Q4-2023 consisting of 27,723 metres of drilling across 155 drill holes. The exploration programme was focused on identifying additional resources below the Kari West deposit, evaluating the underground potential of the Vindaloo deposit and testing new near-mine targets including the Kari Bridge target. During Q4-2023, drilling continued to follow the continuity of mineralisation at depth below the Vindaloo deposit where thick mineralised lenses have been identified with the potential to delineate a high-grade underground resource. Following drilling earlier in the year, resource modelling of the Kari Bridge target, in between Kari Pump and Kari West, continued to determine the economics of mineralisation identified at this new target. An exploration programme of $7.0 million is planned for FY-2024, focused on delineating targets at depth within the Kari Area and at the Vindaloo Deeps target, as well as adding resources at the existing deposits. Ity mine An exploration programme of $16.0 million was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $1.8 million was spent in Q4-2023 consisting of 84,474 metres of drilling across 893 drill holes. The exploration programme focused on adding near-mine resources within the Grand Ity complex, in addition to reconnaissance and delineation drilling on several potential satellite targets.During Q4-2023, drilling focused on the northwest side of the Bakatouo deposit confirming the continuity of mineralisation up and down-dip. At the Mont-Ity deposit drilling identified down-dip extensions of mineralisation within skarns on the margins of the granodiorite intrusion that is beneath the current pitshell. At the Bakatouo Northeast target, drilling followed the continuity of mineralisation from the Bakatouo pit towards the other side of the Cavally river. An exploration programme of $10.0 million is planned for FY-2024 and will focus on extending near-mine resources around Grand Ity in order to test the continuity of mineralisation at depth and in between the Walter, Bakatouo, Zia and Ity pits. Drilling will also focus on extending the West Flotouo and Flotouo Extensions deposits at depth. Reconnaissance and delineation work is expected to continue at several targets on the Ity belt, including the Gbampleu and Goleu targets. Mana mine An exploration programme of $7.1 million was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $0.8 million was spent in Q4-2023 consisting of 20,728 metres of drilling across 378 drill holes. The exploration programme focused on testing high grade targets within the Wona underground deposit, expanding resources at the Maoula deposit and delineating new targets at the Nyafe target, as well as delineating regional open-pit targets within a 20 kilometre radius of the Mana processing plant.During Q4-2023, drilling at Nyafé South focused on evaluating the 500 metre long mineralised trend showing encouraging results. At the Momina target, follow-up drilling was completed on several high grade mineralised intercepts hosted within a sequence of altered and veined mafic rocks over a 250 metre long mineralised trend. Drilling successfully identified a continuation of mineralisation, which remains open along strike and at depth.An exploration programme of $2.0 million is planned for FY-2024, focused on following up on near-mine oxide mineralisation at the Kanan and Siou Nord targets, while additional target generation continues incorporating a combination of field mapping and historic data. Sabodala-Massawa mine An exploration programme of $19.3 million was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $4.0 million was spent in Q4-2023 consisting of 83,960 metres of drilling across 3,655 drill holes. The exploration programme focused on expanding near-mine resources at the Niakafiri, Kerekounda Underground and Kiesta deposits, as well as testing several near mine satellite targets along the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone.During Q4-2023, drilling focused on expanding near-mine resources at the Niakafiri West deposit delineating high-grade veins to the north. Infill drilling was undertaken at the Kerekounda East deposit to focus on resource conversion. At the Massawa North Zone deposit drilling focused on delineating high-grade mineralisation at depth, below the current pitshell to assess the underground mining prospectivity. Early-stage drilling was conducted at the Niakafiri Bridge target, in between the Niakafiri East and West deposits, and at the Fatima target.An exploration programme of $21.0 million is planned for FY-2024, focused on expanding near-mine oxide and refractory resources across the Niakafiri, Sabodala, Kerekounda-Golouma and Massawa deposits, while testing new targets at the Kanoumba complex located south of the Massawa permit. Reconnaissance drilling will also be conducted across the recently acquired Madina and Miamaya permits located east of the Niakafiri-Sabodala complex. Lafigué mine An exploration programme of $1.7 million was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $0.6 million was spent in Q4-2023, focused on advanced grade control drilling as well as some early stage reconnaissance exploration at several near-mine satellite opportunities.During Q4-2023 the exploration programme largely focused on the evaluation of the early stage WA05 and the Central Area target, where 450 metres of trenching demonstrated continuous gold mineralisation that will be followed up with drilling in 2024.An exploration programme of $4.0 million is planned for FY-2024 to follow up on the WA05 and Central Area targets located within 5 kilometres of the Lafigué deposit and to investigate future underground potential by testing mineralisation below the current pitshell. Tanda-Iguela Project An exploration programme of $36.6 million was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $5.1 million was spent in Q4-2023, consisting of 167,436 metres of drilling across 709 drill holes. The exploration programme was focused on extending mineralisation and delineating resources at the Assafou deposit and identifying potential satellite deposits within 5 kilometres of the Assafou deposit.During Q4-2023, exploration activities largely focused on finalising the 2023 drilling programme at the Assafou deposit targeting the conversion of Inferred resources to Indicated status, extension of the mineralised system at the Assafou deposit, and on delineating potential satellite targets within 5 kilometres of the Assafou deposit.As published on 29 November 2023, resources at the Assafou deposit were significantly increased during the year, confirming Tanda-Iguela’s status as the most significant gold discovery made in West Africa in the last decade. The Indicated resource now stands at 4.5Moz at 1.97 g/t Au, a 303% increase compared to the 2022 maiden Indicated resource of 1.1Moz at 2.33 g/t Au. The updated November 2023 resource is based on 183,000 metres of drilling and the Assafou deposit now spans 3.3 kilometres in length and remains open along strike and at depth. Additional drilling on identified targets has intersected mineralisation towards the northeast and the southwest, indicating that Assafou is hosted along a +20 kilometre mineralised strike length. An exploration programme of $15.0 million is planned for FY-2024, with at least 60,000 metres of drilling planned at Tanda-Iguela, of which 25,000 metres will focus on delineating further resources at Assafou and converting resources into reserves, while 35,000 metres will focus on delineating potential satellite deposits within 5 kilometres of the Assafou deposit. Greenfield Exploration A greenfield exploration programme of $12.2 million (higher than the preliminary $6.0 million that was previously published due to the reallocation of corporate permit related costs to greenfields) was undertaken in FY-2023, of which $8.9 million was spent in Q4-2023 focussed on identifying early stage opportunities across the Birimian greenstone belts within West Africa and strengthening the Company’s project pipeline .In Guinea, activities focused on preliminary analysis and site visits to prospective targets along the Sabodala-Massawa Shear Zone, where it continues to the south into Guinea.In Senegal, activities focused on identification of prospective tenures along the Main Transcurrent Zone, following the structural trend away from Sabodala-Massawa.In Cote d’Ivoire, a review of prospective greenfield opportunities was undertaken identifying several high priority permits.In Mali, limited exploration activity was completed at the Kalana project during the year, while work is still ongoing to support the technical study that is underwayAn exploration programme of $6.0 million is planned for FY-2024 focussed on advancing greenfield opportunities in Guinea, Senegal and Cote d’Ivoire. GROUP RESERVES AND RESOURCES Proven and Probable (“P&P”) reserves from continuing operations amounted to 13.9Moz at year-end 2023, a decrease of 1.3Moz or 9% compared to the previous year as exploration work prioritised the delineation of new resources and the upgrade of existing resources at the Tanda-Iguela discovery. Reserves decreased at the Sabodala-Massawa, Ity and Houndé mines due to depletion, as Ity and Houndé delivered record production, and due to model updates that incorporated higher long-term operating cost assumptions. The decreases were partially offset by an increase at Mana due to reserve additions in the Wona underground deposit that exceeded depletion during the year. Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) resources from continuing operations amounted to 26.7Moz at year-end 2023, an increase of 1.4Moz or 6% compared to the previous year largely due to a 3.38Moz increase in Indicated resources at the Tanda-Iguela project in Cote d’Ivoire, which was the Groups exploration priority during the year. This was partially offset by decreases in M&I resources at Houndé, Ity and Sabodala-Massawa due to depletion and resource model updates incorporating higher operating cost assumptions, while maintaining conservative gold price assumptions at $1,500/oz.

M&I resources decreased from 93.4Mt at 1.56 g/t containing 4.68Moz to 73.1Mt at 1.63 g/t containing 3.82Moz mainly due to depletion and model updates incorporating higher cost assumptions and lower recoveries at the Mambo and Golden Hill deposits following the completion of additional metallurgical testing.For Ity, P&P reserves decreased from 57.9Mt at 1.62 g/t containing 3.02Moz to 47.2Mt at 1.55 g/t containing 2.35Moz due to depletion as well as model and cost assumption changes across the Le Plaque and Daapleau pits to reflect more conservative cost and recovery assumptions, partially offset by additions at the Ity and Walter pits due to improved grade reconciliation. M&I resources decreased from 97.0Mt at 1.59 g/t containing 4.97Moz to 89.5Mt at 1.57 g/t containing 4.52Moz due to depletion and an optimised model of the Le Plaque pit incorporating updated cost assumptions.For Mana, P&P reserves increased from 8.3Mt at 3.20 g/t containing 0.85Moz to 9.7Mt at 2.9 g/t containing 0.91Moz, mainly due to the incorporation of additional drilling data into updated stope models in the Wona underground deposit, which was partially offset by mine depletion. M&I resources increased from 33.9Mt at 2.00 g/t containing 2.18Moz to 35.9Mt at 2.0 g/t containing 2.34Moz due to resource additions in the Wona underground deposit and optimisation of the underground mine model, partially offset by mining depletion.For Sabodala-Massawa, P&P reserves decreased from 62.8Mt at 2.02 g/t containing 4.09Moz to 53.1Mt at 2.05 g/t containing 3.49Moz due largely to depletion as well as model updates across the Niakafiri East and Massawa Central Zone deposits to reflect updated cost assumptions and lower recovery assumptions resulting from the extensive grade control programme completed at Sabodala-Massawa. The decrease was partially offset by the conversion of resources into maiden reserves at the Kiesta deposit. M&I resources decreased from 106.1Mt at 1.86 g/t containing 6.33Moz to 88.2Mt at 1.92 g/t containing 5.44Moz due to depletion and model updates incorporating updated cost assumptions at the Sofia, Niakafiri, Massawa Central Zone and North Zone pits, as well as the removal of smaller underground resources that are not expected to be mined based on current assumptions.For Lafigué, P&P reserves were flat at 49.8Mt at 1.69 g/t containing 2.71Moz and M&I resources were flat at 46.2Mt at 2.04 g/t containing 3.03Moz as production is expected to start in Q2-2024 and drilling activities through the year focused on advanced grade control and preliminary evaluation of satellite targets.For Tanda-Iguela (Assafou), M&I resources increased from 14.9Mt at 2.33 g/t containing 1.11Moz to 70.9Mt at 1.97 g/t containing 4.49Moz as an extensive 2023 drill programme resulted in a 303% increase over the maiden Indicated resource estimate published in late 2022, as detailed in the press release dated 29 November 2023, that is available here.

Should the AGM resolve in accordance with the proposal, the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB on Tuesday May 14, 2024. Proposals for election of Board members, Chairman of the Board of Directors and auditor and resolution regarding fees (items 10–13 on the agenda) The Nomination Committee has proposed that the AGM resolves on the following: The number of Board members elected by the AGM shall be seven, with no deputy members. The Nomination Committee proposes re-election of the Board members Alf Göransson, Lars Blecko, Cecilia Daun Wennborg, Liv Forhaug, Johan Lundberg and Santiago Galaz, and new-election of Marita Odélius, all for the period up to and including the AGM 2025, with Alf Göransson as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Jeanette Almberg has declined re-election. Additional information on Board member proposed for new-election, Marita Odélius, is set out below. The reasoned statement of the Nomination Committee is available on the company website, www.loomis.com. Marita Odélius (born 1961) holds a Bachelor of Economics from Uppsala University. She is a board member of Movestic Livförsäkring AB, Solid Försäkringsaktiebolag, Resurs Holding AB and Resurs Bank AB. Marita Odélius was the CEO of Fora AB between 2011 and 2021. Prior to that, she held various positions within Skandia, including as Group CFO, KPMG, and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. Marita holds 200 shares in Loomis. Fees to the Board members for the period up to and including the AGM 2025 shall amount to SEK 5,755,000 (5,300,000) in total (based on an unchanged number of committee members) to be distributed among the Board members as follows: the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall according to the proposal receive SEK 1,400,000 (1,300,000) and each of the other Board members shall receive SEK 585,000 (550,000). The remuneration for committee work shall amount to SEK 320,000 (300,000) for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, amount to SEK 150,000 (100,000) for the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, amount to SEK 150,000 (125,000) for the members of the Audit Committee and amount to SEK 75,000 (50,000) for the members of the Remuneration Committee. The accounting firm Deloitte AB is proposed for re-election for a term of one year, in accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee. In the event Deloitte AB is elected, the accounting firm has informed that the authorized public accountant Didrik Roos will be the auditor in charge. The auditor's fee is proposed to be paid according to approved invoice. Proposal for resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and transfer of own shares (item 15 on the agenda) The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares, on the following terms and conditions: i. acquisition may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm, on one or more occasions prior to the next AGM; ii. acquisition may be made of such number of shares that Loomis' holding of own shares does not at any time exceed one tenth of the total number of shares in the company; iii. acquisition may be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time (i.e. in the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price); and iv. payment of acquired shares shall be made in cash. Furthermore, the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own shares, with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights, on the following terms and conditions: i. transfer may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm and/or outside of Nasdaq Stockholm in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses, on one or more occasions prior to the next AGM; ii. transfer may be made up to such number of shares that are held by Loomis at the time of the Board of Directors' resolution on the transfer; and iii. transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time. For transfers outside of Nasdaq Stockholm, payment may be made in cash, non-cash consideration or through set-off and the price is to be determined so that the transfer takes place on market terms. The purpose of the proposed authorization, and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as regards the transfer of own shares, is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt Loomis' capital structure to the company's capital requirements and to enable financing of acquisitions by using own shares. The Board of Directors has presented a reasoned statement in accordance with Chapter 19, Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve on the other terms and conditions for repurchase and transfer of own shares. The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the person appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above proposal that may prove to be necessary in connection with execution of the Board of Directors' resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares. Proposal for resolutions on (A) reduction of the share capital by way of cancellation of repurchased shares and (B) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue without issuance of new shares (item 16 on the agenda) Loomis has, on the basis of authorizations by previous annual general meetings, acquired own shares. At the time of issue of this notice, Loomis holds 4,819,374 own shares, corresponding to approximately 6.40 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company. The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares, and to increase the share capital by way of a bonus issue in accordance with items (A) and (B) below. The resolutions are contingent of each other and are therefore proposed to be adopted as one joint resolution as follows. A. Reduction of share capital by cancellation of own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted equity. The reduction of the share capital shall be made by cancellation of 4,279,829 own shares that are held by the company. The reduction of the share capital will be SEK 21,399,145 by way of cancellation of 4,279,829 shares. The resolution to reduce the share capital under this item (A) may be effectuated without obtaining permission from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or, in the event of a dispute, a general court, as the company simultaneously effectuates a bonus issue, as set out under item (B) below, with an amount corresponding to no less than the amount the share capital is being reduced with, as set out above. Combined, these measures entail that neither the company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced. B. Bonus issue With the purpose of restoring the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital, as set out under item (A) above, the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM simultaneously resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 21,399,145 through a transfer of SEK 21,399,145 from the company's unrestricted equity. The bonus issue shall be carried out without the issuance of new shares. Statement by the Board of Directors In view of the Board of Directors' proposal for resolution on reduction of the share capital through cancellation of shares, the Board of Directors hereby issues the following statement pursuant to Chapter 20, Section 13, fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). It follows from the proposal on reduction of the share capital that the Board of Directors proposes that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 21,399,145 through cancellation of 4,279,829 shares for allocation to unrestricted equity. In order to achieve a quick and efficient cancellation procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission, the Board of Directors has also proposed that the AGM resolves on restoring the company's share capital to its current amount by increasing the share capital with SEK 21,399,145 by way of a bonus issue without issuance of new shares. The amount is to be transferred from the company's unrestricted equity to the company's share capital. Through the reduction of the share capital due to the cancellation of shares, the company's share capital is reduced by SEK 21,399,145 and through the bonus issue the company's share capital is increased by the same amount. The company's restricted equity and share capital will therefore remain unchanged after the implementation of the bonus issue. Following completion of the reduction of the share capital and the bonus issue, the total number of outstanding shares in the company will amount to 71,000,000. Authorization The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorize the Board of Directors, or the person appointed by the Board of Directors, to make such minor adjustments to the resolutions according to item (A) and (B) above as may be required for registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB and to take such other measures required to execute the resolutions. C. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION ETC.

Cybersecurity Expert The announcement by Rackspace Technology of its UK Sovereign Services is a significant development in the realm of cybersecurity and data sovereignty. The emphasis on dedicated compute and storage 'Pods' for different sectors, such as healthcare and government, addresses a growing demand for secure data handling within national borders. The isolation of these Pods is a proactive measure against inter-sector data breaches, which could be catastrophic given the sensitivity of the data involved.Moreover, the partnership with BT for secure communication services is a strategic move, enhancing the overall security posture of the offering. The adherence to UK National Cyber Security Centre and NHS England recommendations further solidifies the platform's credibility. This launch is a timely response to the heightened cyber threats and stringent regulatory requirements facing these sectors. Cloud Technology Analyst Rackspace's introduction of a digitally sovereign cloud service represents a notable shift in cloud computing, catering to a niche yet critical market of regulated industries. The service's design, which includes ITIL-based service delivery and an evergreen IT approach, suggests a robust framework for operational excellence and long-term sustainability. The ability to refresh platforms without significant CAPEX investments is particularly appealing to public sector entities that face budget constraints.The cost-effective and usage-based pricing model could disrupt traditional procurement processes within the target industries, potentially leading to increased market competitiveness. Additionally, the built-in Disaster Recovery as a service is a key differentiator that may influence the decision-making of potential customers who prioritize business continuity planning.

Summary of Key Outcomes No restatement of historic financial statements and no material impact on 2023 annual financial results issued today, which are the subject of an unmodified audit opinion.Investigation found that Mr de Montessus, acting with certain others who are not employees of the Group: diverted a US$5.9 million payment to a third-party company, and concealed his actions with repeated false representations to management, the Board and auditors; caused Endeavour to make two payments totalling US$15.0 million to the same third-party company, deliberately disguising them as advance payments to a contractor through repeated false representations to management. No evidence of bribery, or of any payments being made to sanctioned persons or to terrorist groups.Ultimate beneficiaries of these payments have not been discovered, despite extensive investigation. Mr de Montessus provided implausible and untrue explanations of his conduct during the course of the Investigation.The Investigation is now complete. Summary of Actions Taken and Proposed Mr de Montessus was terminated as CEO and President on 4 January.Clawback of remuneration totalling US$29.1 million announced on 18 January.Noting that these payments involved deliberate circumvention of our existing controls framework, the Board has nonetheless accelerated its review of internal controls in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code, and has made immediate adjustments to certain controls relating to M&A activity. Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan (“Venkat”), Chairman of Endeavour, commented: “The Board’s actions illustrate the high importance we place on integrity, governance and transparency. We will not waver from these values. The conclusion of the Investigation enables us to put this matter behind us and focus on delivery and creating value for all our stakeholders. Under the highly experienced leadership of Ian Cockerill, we are confident we will deliver on our two high-quality development projects and move towards a period of free cash generation.” Background and Scope of InvestigationAs announced on 4 January 2024, the Board had recently become aware of an irregular payment instruction issued in March 2021 for an amount of US$5.9 million owed to Endeavour in connection with the sale of the Agbaou mine. Mr de Montessus instructed Allied Gold, the purchaser of the Agbaou mine, to pay this amount to a third-party company rather than to a member of the Group, thereby settling the debt from the purchaser’s perspective. The payment was concealed from the Company by Mr de Montessus and he made repeated and deliberate false representations to management, the Board and the Company’s auditor that this amount remained owing from the purchaser. As a result, a receivable representing this amount was maintained on the Group’s balance sheet until Q3 2023, when it was written off based on further deliberate false representations by Mr de Montessus. When challenged about these facts in an interview on 4 January 2024, Mr de Montessus admitted to issuing the irregular payment instruction, to concealing the fact of the payment to the third-party company, and to knowingly misrepresenting the receivable as outstanding over a period of more than two years. As a result of his serious misconduct, the Board terminated Mr de Montessus as CEO on 4 January 2024 and the Remuneration Committee of the Board determined to claw back remuneration totalling $29.1 million as announced on 18 January 2024. The Board instructed its external advisers, Linklaters LLP and Ernst & Young LLP, to investigate the US$5.9 million payment to determine the beneficiaries of the diverted funds. The Investigation also uncovered evidence of two further payments, with a total value of US$15.0 million, to the same third-party recipient as the US$5.9 million payment. The scope of the Investigation also included the circumstances of these payments. In order to provide additional comfort in relation to the opening balance sheet position for the 2023 calendar year, the Investigation also examined receivables written off by the Group on 31 December 2022 to ascertain whether any of them had in fact been settled by way of payment to a third party, in a similar manner to the US$5.9 million payment. The external advisors conducting the Investigation were authorised by the Board to access all relevant documents, records and information of the Company and to conduct interviews with any individual deemed appropriate. Prior to the conclusion of the investigation work, Mr de Montessus was interviewed for a second time in late February. Overview of Investigation FindingsThe Investigation identified evidence that Mr de Montessus, acting with certain others who are not (and were not at any time) employees of the Group: diverted a consideration payment with a value of US$5.9 million, relating to the disposal of the Agbaou mine, to a third-party company in March 2021, and concealed this payment by subsequently making false representations to management, the Board and the Group’s auditors over a period of more than two years that the receivable was still outstanding; andhad previously, in August and November 2020, caused Endeavour to make two payments totalling US$15.0 million to the same third-party company as the US$5.9 million payment, by deliberately disguising the US$15.0 million as advance payments to a contractor through repeated false representations to management, causing an aggregate loss of that amount to Endeavour and/or the contractor. Despite extensive efforts, the Investigation was not able to establish the ultimate beneficiaries of the payments to this third-party entity. This entity was incorporated as an offshore entity in Ras al Khaimah in the UAE and was liquidated on the day after the payment of the US$5.9 million in March 2021. Through searches by professional investigation agents, thorough enquiries were made in the UAE, but the investigation work was unable to ascertain the true beneficial ownership of this entity, which was concealed from the Company by Mr de Montessus and those with whom he acted. Although Mr de Montessus attended two interviews during the Investigation, he continued to attempt to conceal his motives and actions relating to the events being investigated by providing untrue and misleading explanations for his conduct. Since 4 January 2024, Mr de Montessus has publicly stated that the US$5.9 million payment which he deliberately diverted in March 2021 was used to pay for security equipment to protect the Group’s partners and employees in a conflict zone. However, based on the information given by Mr de Montessus in interviews and the other evidence available to the Investigation (including the evidence that Mr de Montessus had caused US$15.0 million to be paid by Endeavour to the same third-party company in different circumstances in 2020), his explanation was found to be implausible and untrue. Although the Investigation did not ascertain the ultimate beneficiaries of the payments to the third-party entity, in the course of the extensive review of documentation and interviews, no evidence was identified of bribery, or of any payments to sanctioned persons or to terrorist groups. The Investigation did not identify evidence that any of the receivables written off on 31 December 2022 had in fact already been settled by payments to third parties. The findings of the Investigation do not trigger any requirement to restate prior interim quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements and associated management discussion and analysis, nor do they materially affect the 2023 annual financial results. For further information, please refer to the 2023 Annual Report at the following link. Proposed Actions The Investigation revealed strong evidence that Mr de Montessus abused his position as CEO, actively misleading both the Board and the senior executive team through repeated and deliberate false representations and concealment of information over a sustained period. His termination as CEO was therefore the most important step in protecting the Group from further conduct of this nature. Whilst the circumstances clearly indicated deliberate overriding of controls, active concealment and misrepresentation by the former CEO, the Company is evaluating its overall control environment, including the impact of “tone at the top”. In the interim, the Company has added further mechanisms, such as additional dual controls in committing the Company within the context of M&A and subsequent renegotiations, so that the risk of such events is further minimised in the future. The Audit Committee of the Board has determined that there are no material weaknesses in the Group’s Internal Controls over Financial Reporting or Disclosure Controls & Procedures. The Board has reserved its position regarding the possibility of pursuing Mr de Montessus for recovery of amounts lost by the Group as a result of his actions.

(ISPR) closes public offering, selling 2,050,000 shares at $6.00 per share, raising $12.3 million gross proceeds. Roth Capital Partners leads the offering.","Ispire Technology Announces Closing of $12.3 Million Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Ispire Technology Inc. (ISPR) closes public offering, selling 2,050,000 shares at $6.00 per share, raising $12.3 million gross proceeds. Roth Capital Partners leads the offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The closing of a public offering for Ispire Technology Inc. represents a significant capital infusion for the company, amounting to $12.3 million before fees and expenses. This capital raise is indicative of the company's growth strategy, potentially aimed at expanding its product line, accelerating research and development, or increasing market penetration. The offering price at $6.00 per share provides a benchmark for current valuation, which investors can use to assess the company's market capitalization and compare it with industry peers.Moreover, the involvement of Roth Capital Partners as the lead placement agent adds a layer of credibility to the offering, possibly attracting more institutional investors. However, investors should be mindful of the dilutive effect of the additional shares on existing shareholders and consider the company's performance metrics, such as earnings per share, which may be affected in the short term. Long-term benefits, if the capital is deployed effectively, could outweigh initial dilution. Market Research Analyst The e-cigarette and cannabis vaping industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences and regulatory landscapes. Ispire Technology's public offering suggests that they are positioning themselves to navigate these changes proactively. The funds raised could be directed towards compliance with evolving regulations and adapting to market demands. It's essential to monitor how these funds will be allocated to ensure they are used in areas that will drive growth and secure a competitive advantage.Additionally, the price point of the shares could reflect market sentiment towards the vaping industry and Ispire's brand reputation. Investors should observe industry trends, such as shifts towards healthier alternatives or natural products, as these will influence Ispire's market strategy and, consequently, its financial performance and stock value. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM LOS ANGELES, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ispire Technology Inc.

Financial Analyst The departure of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent auditor for Lifecore Biomedical is a significant event that can raise questions among investors regarding the integrity and reliability of the company's financial reporting. The role of an independent auditor is to provide assurance that a company's financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. A change in auditors can sometimes be associated with disagreements on accounting practices or concerns raised by the outgoing auditor.In assessing the potential impact on Lifecore's stock, one would consider the timing and reasons for the auditor's decision not to stand for reappointment. The lack of explicit reasoning provided could lead to speculation and uncertainty. Investors should monitor the company's efforts to appoint a new auditor and any subsequent communications that clarify the change. The forthcoming business update could be pivotal in providing reassurance to the market, especially if it includes positive financial data and commercial progress. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Lifecore Biomedical's announcement may influence investor perception, potentially affecting the company's share price. The CDMO industry is highly competitive and trust in a company's financial health is paramount. The market will look for signals of stability in the upcoming business update. If the provided financial data and commercial business matters reflect growth or stability, it may mitigate concerns over the auditor change.However, if the market perceives the auditor change as a red flag, this could lead to increased stock volatility. Investors and analysts will likely scrutinize the company's selection process for a new auditor and the transparency of their future financial disclosures. The quality and reputation of the replacement auditor will also be under observation, as it can influence the perceived credibility of Lifecore's financial reporting. Corporate Governance Expert Changes in a company's auditor are closely linked to corporate governance practices. While it is not uncommon for companies to change auditors, the context and communication around the change are critical. Lifecore Biomedical must ensure that the transition is seamless and that the new auditor is capable of upholding the highest standards of independence and scrutiny.Good corporate governance would dictate that Lifecore addresses investor concerns proactively, providing clear and comprehensive reasons for Ernst & Young's departure. This transparency will be important in maintaining shareholder trust. Additionally, the company's board of directors should demonstrate due diligence in the selection of a new auditor, ensuring that the chosen firm has a strong track record in the industry. The effectiveness of the board in handling this situation will be reflected in investor confidence and, ultimately, in the company's market performance. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM CHASKA, Minn., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lifecore Biomedical, Inc.

The company ended the year with an outstanding debt balance, cash balance, and liquidity. Management comments emphasized value creation and growth initiatives.

The balance sheet update detailed debt outstanding, borrowing base, availability, and cash balance. Production and pricing updates for 2023 and the fourth quarter were provided, along with financial and operating summaries. Reserves summary, hedge summary, and conference call details were also included. Positive Total daily production in 2023 averaged 1,711 Boe/d with oil production at 1,073 Bbl/d. Revenue totaled $32.3 million with oil sales of $28.4 million and natural gas and liquids sales of $4.0 million. Lease operating expense decreased by 8% in 2023 compared to 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $5.0 million. The company ended the year with an outstanding debt balance of $5.0 million and $3.4 million of cash. A $5.0 million share repurchase program was launched, repurchasing more than 0.6 million shares of common stock. The company completed the divestment of non-core assets in the fourth quarter, generating $7.3 million of sales proceeds. The company hedged an average of 514 Bbl/d oil production for full year 2024 at a weighted average price of $81.16 per Bbl. Management emphasized capital allocation discipline and organic growth initiatives for value creation. As of December 31, 2023, the company had debt outstanding of $5.0 million and a borrowing base of $20.0 million. For the full year 2023, the company produced 624,420 Boe, with average sales prices showing a decline compared to 2022. The company generated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Year-end 2023 SEC proved reserves were 4.9 MBoe, with a PV-10 value of $70.1 million. Hedged volumes and weighted average hedge prices for full year 2024 were provided. A conference call to review financial results was scheduled for March 27, 2024. Negative Total revenue decreased by 27% in 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss of $32.4 million was reported for 2023, largely due to an impairment of oil and natural gas properties. Equity compensation expense increased by 24% for the year. Oil and natural gas prices showed declines compared to the previous year. Total revenue decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter. Cash general and administrative expense remained flat for the quarter. Natural gas and liquids sales declined by 2% in the fourth quarter. The Company's SEC proved reserves showed reductions in pricing compared to year-end 2022. The year-end 2023 SEC proved reserves were comprised of 65% oil and 35% natural gas. The present value of the Company's reported SEC proved reserves decreased at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022. Financial Analyst The reported financial results for U.S. Energy Corporation indicate several key trends that are vital for understanding the company's fiscal health and future prospects. The decrease in total revenue by 27% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower commodity pricing, reflects the volatility in the energy market and the direct impact on oil and gas companies' top-line growth. The reported decrease in lease operating expense, which improved by 9% from the previous year, suggests effective cost management strategies are in place. However, investors should be cautious about the net loss of $32.4 million, significantly influenced by a $26.7 million impairment charge, which illustrates the sensitivity of asset valuations to fluctuating commodity prices. The company's hedging strategy, with a weighted average price of $81.16 per Bbl for oil production in 2024, serves as a risk mitigation tool against price uncertainty. This forward-looking approach to secure future cash flows at a set price can be reassuring for investors seeking stability in an inherently unpredictable sector. Additionally, the balance sheet shows a conservative leverage with a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.3x, which is a positive sign of financial prudence and provides flexibility for future growth initiatives or market downturns. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, U.S. Energy Corporation's announcement of a share repurchase program signifies management's confidence in the intrinsic value of the company. The repurchase of more than 2% of outstanding shares at an average price significantly below previous market prices can be perceived as an attempt to stabilize stock price and provide direct value to shareholders. The extension of the share repurchase program timeline to June 2025 reflects a long-term commitment to this strategy. However, the effectiveness of such programs in delivering shareholder value is often debated and should be monitored in the context of overall market performance and sector trends. The divestment of non-core assets and the subsequent debt repayment exhibit a strategic pivot towards streamlining operations and focusing on core competencies. This move could potentially lead to improved operational efficiency and higher margins. Nevertheless, the production and pricing updates, with a slight increase in production but a significant decrease in average sales prices, highlight the challenges faced in the energy sector, particularly with the current instability of oil and natural gas prices. Energy Sector Analyst Analyzing the operational side, the marginal increase in production paired with a significant decrease in average sales prices for oil and gas indicates that U.S. Energy is somewhat insulated from the full brunt of price volatility due to its production efficiency. The focus on maintaining a lower declining asset base and the company's ability to reduce lease operating expenses are indicative of a robust operational framework. However, the 38% decrease in reserve volumes year-over-year raises concerns about the sustainability of production levels and the company's reserve replacement strategy. The company's emphasis on a predictable production profile and commitment to capital allocation discipline are essential in a sector where long-term planning is often hindered by short-term price fluctuations. The reserve summary, with 99% classified as proved developed producing, suggests a low-risk reserve profile, which is favorable for consistent cash flow generation. The present value of the company's SEC proved reserves, discounted at 10%, standing at $70.1 million, provides an indication of the underlying asset value, although this should be weighed against the overall net loss and impairment charges reported. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM HOUSTON, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: USEG, “U.S. Energy” or the “Company”), a growth-focused energy company engaged in operating a portfolio of high-quality producing oil and natural gas assets, today reported financial and operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTS ""I am pleased with our team’s performance during 2023, efforts which continue advancing the Company’s daily goal of unlocking shareholder value,” said Ryan Smith, U.S. Energy’s Chief Executive Officer. “U.S. Energy’s track record of successfully integrating the Company’s previous acquisitions has resulted in a more efficient and lower declining asset base today, as shown in the operating results and cost structure of the Company. As a result, U.S. Energy’s strong, de-levered balance sheet and predictable production profile are well positioned to support the Company’s growth initiatives while enabling management to allocate capital to the highest rate of return projects. As we move forward through 2024, we believe maintaining capital allocation discipline, exploiting organic growth initiatives, and using a portion of free cash flow to support shareholder returns is the right combination in today’s environment to drive value creation for the Company’s shareholders.” SHAREHOLDER RETURNS PROGRAM UPDATE Since the beginning of the Company’s share repurchase program in May 2023 through February 2024, U.S. Energy has repurchased greater than 0.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $1.18 per share, representing greater than 2% of outstanding shares.

Adjusted EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial measure” presented as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance. It is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus net interest expense, net unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of derivatives, income tax (benefit) expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, one-time costs associated with completed transactions and the associated assumed derivative contracts, non-cash share-based compensation, transaction related expenses, transaction related acquired realized derivative loss (gain), and loss (gain) on marketable securities. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand U.S. Energy’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company’s presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, below. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

However, there was a decrease in revenues due to lower commissions on talent bookings. Positive Annual revenues of $17.2 million in 2023. Net income of $0.4 million in 2023. Highest total cash and cash equivalents of $12.7 million in the company's history. Decrease in revenues in 2023 due to lower commissions on talent bookings. Net loss of $71 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Negative Decreased revenues in 2023 compared to 2022. Net loss of $71 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023. Operating income decreased by 29.5% in 2023. Significant impact on net income in 2022 due to a $1.5 million valuation allowance release on deferred tax assets. Financial Analyst The reported financial figures indicate a contraction in both quarterly and annual revenues, with a notable year-over-year decrease in net income from $3.5 million to $0.4 million. This sharp decline is concerning and could signal underlying challenges in the company's operations or market conditions. The significant drop in operating income and EBITDA further underscores potential issues with cost management or revenue generation. Investors should consider the sustainability of the company's financial health, especially given the reduction in gross billings, which suggests a decrease in the company's core business activities. Market Research Analyst The decrease in revenue and net income is attributed to lower commissions on talent bookings, which raises questions about the company's competitive positioning and market dynamics. The talent agency industry is highly competitive and sensitive to economic fluctuations. The stability of Wilhelmina's client relationships and its ability to adapt to industry trends will be critical for future growth. Additionally, the increase in salaries and service costs despite declining revenues is a red flag that may point to inefficiencies or an investment in strategic hires that have yet to yield returns. Legal and Compliance Expert The reduction in corporate overhead, particularly due to the costs of two SEC restatement filings in the prior year not recurring, is a positive sign of potential stabilization in the company's compliance environment. However, increased legal expenses in the first half of the year could indicate ongoing legal challenges or increased regulatory scrutiny. Stakeholders should monitor the company's regulatory filings and any potential legal issues that could impact financial performance or operational capabilities. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM Annual Financial Highlights Annual revenues of $17.2 million for 2023.Annual operating income of $0.7 million in 2023.Annual net cash flows provided by operating activities were $0.7 million in 2023.Annual pre-tax income of $0.7 million, net income of $0.4 million and Pre-Corporate EBITDA of $2.0 million for 2023.$12.7 million of combined cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at December 31, 2023 was the highest total at the end of any quarterly or annual period in Company history.Annual gross billings of $65.9 million for 2023.

The Company considers Gross Billings, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-Corporate EBITDA to be important measures of performance because they: are key operating metrics of the Company's business;are used by management in its planning and budgeting processes and to monitor and evaluate its financial and operating results; andprovide stockholders and potential investors with a means to evaluate the Company's financial and operating results against other companies within the Company's industry. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be consistent with similar calculations by other companies in the Company's industry. The Company calculates Gross Billings as the gross amount billed to customers on behalf of its models and talent for services performed. The Company calculates EBITDA as net income plus interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense. The Company calculates “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA plus foreign exchange gain/loss, share-based payment expense and certain significant non-recurring items that the Company may include from time to time. There were no such non-recurring items during 2023 and 2022. The Company calculates “Pre-Corporate EBITDA” as Adjusted EBITDA plus corporate overhead expense, which includes director compensation, securities laws compliance costs, audit and professional fees, and other public company costs. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to net and operating income as an indicator of the Company's operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Negative Total revenue decreased to $5.6 million from $8.8 million in the prior year due to delays in customer activities. Gross Margin dropped to 34% from 47% in the prior year, offset by an increase in indirect expenses. Adjusted EBITDA loss increased to $6.1 million from $4.1 million due to investments in sales and marketing. Operating loss increased to $7.4 million from $6.1 million, driven by a decrease in revenues and gross margin. Net loss decreased to $6.3 million from $11.0 million, attributed to lower revenues and gross margin. Financial expenses (income), net improved to ($1.1) million from $4.9 million, with a decrease in fair value of warrants. The company faced delays in realizing expected large new orders and experienced a decline in financial expenses associated with warrants and convertible facilities. Financial Analyst The reported financial results by Actelis Networks indicate a strategic pivot towards IoT, which is a growing market with substantial opportunities. However, the immediate financial impact of this shift is a reduction in total revenue year-over-year, from $8.8 million to $5.6 million. This decline is noteworthy as it suggests an initial challenge in the transition, potentially impacting investor confidence in the short term. The direct margin decrease, from 47% to 34%, further underscores cost management issues possibly arising from the strategic realignment.From an investment perspective, the substantial reduction in operating expenses and net loss is a positive signal, reflecting effective cost control measures. However, the increased adjusted EBITDA loss, from $4.1 million to $6.1 million, raises concerns about the company's operational efficiency amidst the transition. The delayed IoT projects, expected to resume in 2024, may provide a future revenue stream, but this also introduces uncertainty regarding the timing and realization of these revenues. Market Research Analyst Actelis Networks' focus on IoT is aligned with market trends, as IoT applications are projected to grow significantly. The certification by the US Department of Defense and NIST could give Actelis a competitive edge in cybersecurity, a critical aspect of IoT. The new product launches, such as the GigaLine 800 and 900 series, cater to underserved markets like MDUs, potentially opening new revenue streams.Strategic partnerships with Netceed and Carahsoft are strategic moves to expand market reach and are likely to support future sales growth. However, the decline in traditional telco revenues and the transition period to IoT sales might require investors to be patient for returns on their investments. The regional revenue decline, particularly in North America and EMEA, may also reflect market saturation or competitive pressures that need to be monitored closely. Cybersecurity Expert The certifications from DoD and NIST are significant achievements for Actelis, positioning it as a trusted provider of cyber-hardened solutions. The emphasis on cybersecurity is a strategic advantage, especially considering the increase in cyber threats and the importance of secure IoT devices. The successful penetration of Actelis' products into the DoDIN APL is a testament to the robustness of their solutions.While these achievements are promising, the financial implications of R&D and certification processes must be weighed against the potential for increased sales. The certifications could lead to lucrative contracts with defense and government entities, which may justify the initial investments and bolster long-term financial health. It's important for stakeholders to consider both the costs associated with achieving these certifications and the prospective market opportunities they may unlock. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM FREMONT, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Actelis Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASNS) (“Actelis” or the “Company”), a market leader in cyber-hardened, hybrid-fiber rapid deployment networking solutions for wide area IoT applications, today reported financial results for the fiscal full year 2023 ended December 31, 2023. Key Highlights: Strategic shift to IoT sales: Total revenue was $5.6 million for the full year 2023, compared to $8.8 million in the prior year. The Company nearly completed its strategic shift to IoT, with a proportional increase of IoT sales to 77% of annual sales, and further significant decline in Telecom revenue. A significant portion of the decline was a result of delays in on-going customer activities, which are expected to catch up in 2024.Direct margin increase: Gross Margin was 34% for the full year 2023, compared to 47% in the prior year. A consistently healthy direct margin year over year was offset by an increase of indirect expenses as % of revenues. Most indirect expenses are fixed, related to inventory and new product introduction costs, and are represented as a higher % of revenue against the revenue decline.Substantial improvement in operating expenses: Operating expenses declined by 9% to $9.3 million for the full year 2023. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter on an annualized basis declined to $8 million, or 35% from the year-ago quarter, driven by efficiencies created with cost reduction and restructuring measures. We expect this reduction to continue into 2024.Substantial improvement in net loss: Net Loss dropped by 43% to $6.3 million for the full year 2023 compared to $11 million in the prior year, with the decline of financial expenses associated with warrants and convertible facilities.Adjusted EBITDA loss trends with shift of Telco to IoT revenues: Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2023 was $6.1 million compared to $4.1 million in the prior year due to the effects associated with the investments made in sales and marketing, as well as the impact of the shift to the IoT business and associated decline in Telco revenues. “We are coming close to completing our strategic focus shift to the growing vertical business areas in IoT in 2023 and are driving strongly towards our goal of delivering the world’s best, most secure, hybrid-fiber networking solutions,” said Tuvia Barlev, Chairman and CEO of Actelis. “We remain persistent on our vision of cyber-aware networking and protecting IoT devices surrounding our customers’ networks. Importantly, we successfully passed certification by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) as the only solution of its kind certified for Cyber security and Interoperability (FIPS). Additionally, we continue to support our loyal Telco customers and continue to serve their needs. In fact, during the last several months we have offered them our newly launched multi-dwelling unit (MDU) solution set for multi-gigabit connectivity at a fraction of the cost and time to connect MDUs compared to a fiber-only solution. We are pleased to report that several of our Telco customers are currently testing our new GigaLine 800 and GigaLine 900 product series for this vast market of Millions of underserved MDUs in the US alone”. “In our continued efforts to create robust cyber secure and cyber aware networking solutions, we completed our Federal Information Protection Standard (FIPS) and Department of Defense (DoD) interoperability and security certification, while at the same time expanding our network of business and strategic partnerships with resellers and integrators to reach more customers and grow revenue. Additional partnerships will emerge soon, further enhancing our offering and reach of monitoring and response to our customers’ networking and IoT device security threats.” “Operationally, I am encouraged by the efficiencies we continue to create resulting in operational cost reductions, preparing us well for 2024. While we have seen delays in realizing some expected large new orders, we are ready for the new year with better market coverage such as with the partnerships we have created with Netceed, Carahsoft and Swarco as well as cost of sales, inventory management and operational expenses,” Barlev continued. Key operational highlights of 2023 to-date: After 18 months of development, rigorous testing and certification process, the DoD Information Network (DoDIN) added Actelis’ products in January 2024 to the approved list of products (“APL”) that have met cybersecurity and interoperability certification requirements. Actelis’ hybrid-copper-fiber networking products are the only ones of their kind on this list.Achieved National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certification for data cyber security, as well as third-party validation for FIPS 140-2 standard from UL labs.Launched the new Multi-Dwelling-Unit (MDU) solution consisting of a last mile hybrid-fiber multi-gigabit broadband solution for buildings and IoT applications (GigaLine 800) and the new ultra-low power in-building gigabit connectivity solution for instant service provisioning (GigaLine 900).Launched new line of advanced, software managed, temperature and cyber-hardened, layer 2 and layer 3 fiber optic switching devices, enabling the delivery of a broad selection of solutions for large and small networks, at higher speeds, in support of hybrid fiber-copper networks that contain a larger portion of fiber.Signed partnership agreements for distribution and resale of Actelis portfolio of products and services with Netceed, a leading value-added distributor for the telecom, traffic, and digital infrastructure industries in North America and with Carahsoft, the trusted public sector IT solutions provider, supporting federal, state and local government agencies through its “Master Government Aggregator” model for their vendor partners with over 2,000 professionals nationwide. In Asia Pacific, through the hiring of Tzachy Givaty, Vice President of Sales for the region, signed multiple resale agreements with new partners in India, Philippines and Vietnam.Continued its service of the multi-year agreement with customer SITA, a worldwide industry leader in infrastructure provision and management for airports. Total orders to-date have reached approximately $0.9 million.Multiple customer wins and deployments in the various IoT verticals of Intelligent Traffic Systems (“ITS”), smart cities, railways, and energy such as City of Napa, major North American rail operator, City of Everett, US Naval base, major European natural gas operator, major US Air-Force base, Northern Ireland Railways and many more, extending its hybrid-fiber cyber-hardened IoT networking connectivity and network management software and services.Hired and restructured sales and marketing presence and strategy with the hiring of Bret Harrison, Senior Vice President of Sales, Americas, alongside new members covering Latin America and Central Europe.The war in Israel has not affected the Company’s operations, we are keeping a close look as the situation evolves and preparing for any necessary adjustments. Fiscal Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights: Revenues Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $5.6 million, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease from the corresponding period was primarily attributable to the decline of revenues generated from telco customers as our focus shifted to IoT customers by $1.6 million significantly impacted by a two-year software license renewal in 2022, therefore not repeated in 2023, driving a $0.5 million decline, and to delays of IoT projects into 2024. By region, it is primarily attributable to a decrease of $1.7 million of revenues generated from North America and a decrease of $1.5 million of revenues generated from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.7 million compared to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease from the corresponding period was mainly due to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by the higher effect of indirect costs as the percent of lower revenues. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $2.7 million compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in payroll expenses. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.0 million compared to $3.3 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in commission expenses as a result of the decrease in revenues. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to $3.5 million compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to a reduction in professional services of approximately $0.2 million, a decrease in management bonus expenses of $0.2 million, as well as a reduction in other non-payroll expenses associated with the IPO in 2022. Operating Loss Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $7.4 million, compared to an operating loss of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly due to the decrease in Revenues and Gross Margin while continuing to invest in Sales and Marketing and Research and Development expenses, which was offset by a decrease in sales commission expenses as well as general and administrative one-time expenses due to the IPO in 2022. Financial Expenses (income), Net Financial expenses (income), net for the year ended December 31, 2023, was ($1.1) million (including $0.8 million interest expenses) compared to $4.9 million (including $0.8 million interest expenses) for the year ended December 31, 2022. In 2023, the Company recorded financial income in connection with a decrease in fair value of warrants in the amount of $1.7 million, while in 2022 the Company recorded finance expenses as a result of increase in fair value of various financial instruments prior to the IPO completed in May 2022, such as a convertible loan, note and warrants, in the amount of $4.5 million. The decrease in the finance expenses, net partially offset by a decrease in income from exchange rate differences in the amount of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $0.5 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Net Loss Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $6.3 million, compared to a net loss of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Revenues and Gross Margin offset by a decrease in financial expenses, net resulting from the expenses incurred by the conversion of the financial instruments the Company had such as a convertible loan, note and warrants from the IPO completed in May 2022 for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to income in connection with a decrease in fair value of warrants for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss, a non-GAAP measurement of operating performance (reconciled below to Net Loss), for the full year ended December 31, 2023, was $6.1 million, compared to $4.1 million in the comparable year-ago period. This was primarily a result of decrease in Revenues and Gross Margin while continuing to invest in Sales and Marketing and Research and Development expenses. About Actelis Networks, Inc.

The study demonstrated improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep inertia, and brain fog, supporting the safety and tolerability of KP1077 for further development into a Phase 3 trial. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The announcement from Zevra Therapeutics regarding the Phase 2 clinical trial outcomes for KP1077 is a significant development in the field of rare disease therapeutics. The focus on idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) – a condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and other debilitating symptoms – highlights an area of high unmet medical need. The reported improvements in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS) and Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale (SIVAS) suggest that KP1077 could represent an advancement in treatment options for IH patients.From a medical research perspective, the safety profile of KP1077 is noteworthy, particularly given the mild nature of reported adverse events in the context of higher dosing regimens. This could indicate a favorable risk-benefit ratio which is important for patient compliance and long-term treatment success. Additionally, the move towards a Phase 3 trial, pending FDA guidance, is a pivotal step that could potentially lead to KP1077's approval and commercial availability, addressing a gap in the current treatment landscape for IH. Financial Analyst Investors in Zevra Therapeutics should interpret the positive Phase 2 trial results as a potential indicator of future value creation. The progression towards a Phase 3 study is a critical juncture in the drug development process, often leading to significant stock market movements. The market for IH treatments is relatively untapped and the introduction of a novel therapeutic like KP1077 could capture substantial market share, thus enhancing Zevra's revenue prospects.However, it is essential to consider the financial implications of advancing to a Phase 3 trial, which entails considerable investment. Investors should weigh the costs against the potential for KP1077 to become a first-in-class treatment for IH. The company's collaboration with patient advocacy groups may also play a role in the future commercial strategy, potentially aiding in patient outreach and market penetration post-approval. Regulatory Affairs Specialist The engagement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an end-of-Phase 2 meeting is a critical step for Zevra Therapeutics. This meeting will provide essential guidance on the design of the Phase 3 trial, which is important for ensuring that the trial objectives align with regulatory expectations for a potential approval. For stakeholders, the outcome of this meeting will be a key determinant of the trial's timeline and design, which directly impacts the drug's time to market.Understanding the regulatory pathway is important for assessing the likelihood of KP1077 reaching the market. Given the positive safety and efficacy signals in the Phase 2 trial, there is a reasonable expectation that the FDA will support the initiation of a Phase 3 trial. However, the exact requirements for trial design, including the size and duration, will influence the development costs and timeline. Stakeholders should monitor the outcomes of the regulatory discussions closely as they will have a direct impact on the investment required and the potential market entry date. 03/26/2024 - 04:30 PM KP1077 demonstrates clinically meaningful benefits for key IH symptoms Top-line data provide key information for the design of a Phase 3 study CELEBRATION, Fla., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zevra Therapeutics, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ZVRA) (Zevra, or the Company) a rare disease therapeutics company, today announced top-line data from its placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT05668754) evaluating the safety and tolerability of KP1077 (serdexmethylphenidate, or SDX) in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia (IH). This proof-of-concept study was not powered to demonstrate statistical significance. The data gathered for several secondary and exploratory endpoints, including the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Idiopathic Hypersomnia Severity Scale (IHSS) and Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale (SIVAS) will inform the Phase 3 study design. “Zevra’s Phase 2 trial evaluating KP1077 as a treatment for IH demonstrated clinically meaningful impact and encouraging outcomes on both clinical safety and efficacy,” stated Christopher Drake, PhD, FAASM, DBSM, Principal Investigator of the study. “During the open-label dose titration period, patients showed robust improvements in IH symptom severity, including excessive daytime sleepiness that were maintained during the double-blind withdrawal period. At the end of the study, patients randomized into the KP1077 treatment group also demonstrated improvements in patient reported IH specific outcomes. We look forward to presenting the final results of the Phase 2 trial at the upcoming SLEEP 2024 annual meeting.” “We’re thankful to the patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial for their participation in advancing the investigational treatment, KP1077, for IH,” said Neil McFarlane, Chief Executive Officer of Zevra. “We believe KP1077 has strong potential to alleviate the immense burden of key IH symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep inertia and brain fog, and could provide a differentiated treatment option for patients underserved by currently available therapies. We would also like to thank our IH-focused patient advocacy group partners and supporters for making this clinical trial possible. Their partnership in raising awareness for this study and supporting trial enrollment has been crucial for its success.” The positive top-line results of the Phase 2 trial support the safety and tolerability of KP1077 as measured by the primary endpoint of the study. The study also successfully fulfilled the objectives of providing key information for the design of a potentially pivotal efficacy trial, and the results of the secondary efficacy endpoints were supportive of initiating a Phase 3 trial of KP1077. KP1077 was shown to be well-tolerated at all dose levels evaluated in the trial, including the highest dose of 320 mg daily, regardless of dosing regimen (once or twice daily). The most common adverse events were insomnia, headache, anxiety, nausea, and decreased appetite. Due to its unique pharmacokinetic profile, adverse events were mostly mild in severity despite higher overall exposure levels when compared to both immediate and long-acting methylphenidate products currently used off-label for the treatment of IH. Topline results of the Phase 2 study include: KP1077 produced clinically meaningful improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), as assessed by change from baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), that was maintained during both the five-week open-label titration period and throughout the 2-week double-blind withdrawal period for both dosing regimens.Patients administered KP1077 showed benefits in change from baseline for the IH Severity Scale (IHSS), Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale (SIVAS) and Brain Fog severity Scale (BFS) at the end of the open-label dose titration, and at the end of the double-blind withdrawal period.The results from the completed Phase 2 trial provide key information for the design of a potentially pivotal Phase 3 trial of KP1077 in patients with IH. The Company plans to request an end-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek guidance on the Phase 3 clinical trial design. About the KP1077 Phase 2 Trial The Phase 2 clinical trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal, dose-optimizing, multi-center study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of KP1077 for the treatment of IH. Part 1 of the trial consisted of a five-week open-label dose titration phase during which patients were optimized to one of four doses of KP1077 (80, 160, 240, or 320 mg/day). Part 2 of the trial entailed a two-week randomized, double-blind, withdrawal phase, during which two-thirds of the trial participants continued to receive their optimized dose while the remaining one-third received placebo. Participants were assigned into two evenly divided cohorts. The first cohort received a single daily dose just before bedtime, and the second cohort received half the daily dose shortly after awakening and the second half prior to bedtime. Zevra enrolled 66 adult patients with IH in 24 centers in the U.S into the open-label titration phase of the study and 50 of those patients continued into the double-blind phase. The primary endpoint was the safety and tolerability of KP1077. The major secondary efficacy endpoint was the change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) total score. Additional secondary endpoints included the IH Severity Scale (IHSS), the Sleep Inertia Visual Analog Scale (SIVAS), and a new scale to assess the symptoms and severity of brain fog. About Idiopathic Hypersomnia (IH) Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Patients with IH experience daytime lapses into sleep, or an irrepressible need to sleep that persists even with adequate or prolonged nighttime sleep. Additionally, those with IH have extreme difficulty waking, otherwise known as sleep inertia, severe brain fog, and often fall asleep unintentionally or at inappropriate times. These symptoms of IH often lead to further, even more debilitating problems such as memory lapses, difficulty maintaining focus, and depression. It is estimated, based on claims data, that approximately 37,000 patients in the United States are currently diagnosed with IH, although the total patient population may be much larger due to some patients who have not yet been diagnosed, have been misdiagnosed, or are not currently seeking treatment. About KP1077 KP1077 (serdexmethylphenidate or SDX) is Zevra’s proprietary prodrug of d-methylphenidate (d-MPH) and its sole active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). KP1077 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of IH, and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has classified SDX, the sole API in KP1077, as a Schedule IV controlled substance based on evidence suggesting SDX has a lower potential for abuse when compared to d-MPH, a Schedule II controlled substance.

(SELF) reported strong occupancy rates and tenant duration driving same-store revenue growth despite a competitive move-in rate environment. Q4 2023 saw total revenues decrease by 2.7% to $3.0 million, while net income increased to $1.1 million. Full Year 2023 showed total revenues increase by 2.1% to $12.2 million, with net income totaling $2.9 million. The company's objective is to increase value for stockholders through strategic business plans and acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Observing the reported financials, the decrease in total revenues and same-store revenues for Q4 2023 indicates a challenging market environment for Global Self Storage. The competitive move-in rate environment, coupled with general economic headwinds such as inflation and rising interest rates, appears to have exerted downward pressure on the company's ability to increase rental income. However, the increase in net income due to unrealized gains in marketable securities and higher interest income suggests a diversified income strategy that may buffer operational revenue fluctuations.The occupancy rates and tenant duration data present a mixed picture. While there is a slight decrease in same-store occupancy year-over-year, the increase in occupancy to 92.1% as of March 15, 2024 and the increase in average tenant duration indicate a stable customer base. This stability could be a positive signal for investors, as it suggests tenant loyalty and a potentially steady revenue stream. The maintenance of the quarterly dividend also suggests confidence by the management in the company's cash flow stability. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the decline in FFO and AFFO is notable. FFO and AFFO are critical measures for real estate investment trusts (REITs), as they provide a clearer picture of the company's operational performance by excluding gains or losses from property sales or changes in the value of marketable securities. The decrease in these metrics may raise concerns about the company's operational efficiency and its ability to sustain dividend payouts in the long term.Additionally, the increase in operating expenses, particularly due to employment costs and property taxes, suggests margin compression. This could be a concern for profitability moving forward, especially if the company is unable to pass these costs onto tenants through higher rental rates. The company's strategic focus on acquisitions and partnerships, as well as its revenue rate management program and marketing initiatives, will be important to monitor as they could significantly influence future financial performance. Real Estate Investment Analyst The real estate sector and specifically the self-storage segment, is sensitive to economic cycles. Global Self Storage's strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions and expansion projects, indicates a growth-oriented approach. The company's robust capital resources, with a healthy mix of cash, marketable securities and available credit, position it to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in a potentially oversupplied market. However, the success of this strategy hinges on the company's ability to identify and integrate acquisitions that enhance shareholder value without overextending its financial leverage.Investors should also consider the company's use of digital and grass roots marketing strategies to improve occupancy rates. While these methods appear to have been successful thus far, the effectiveness of these strategies in a sustained competitive pricing environment remains to be seen. The reliance on proprietary revenue rate management programs to offset decreased move-in rates is innovative, but it is not clear how much flexibility remains to raise rates without affecting occupancy levels. 03/26/2024 - 04:25 PM Strong Occupancy Rates and Tenant Duration Drove Same-Store Revenue Growth Despite Competitive Move-in Rate EnvironmentMILLBROOK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 26, 2024 / Global Self Storage, Inc.

The company's board of directors regularly reviews the strategic business plan, with topics and metrices that include capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, FFO and AFFO performance, and optimal cash levels.The management of Global Self Storage believes that the company's continued operational performance and capital resources position it well to continue to pursue its strategic business plan.Management Commentary""In 2023, we generated record annual same-store revenue despite a competitive move-in rate environment and general economic headwinds related to inflation and interest rates,"" stated Global Self Storage president and CEO, Mark C. Winmill. ""We saw lower move-in rental rates year-over-year across the self-storage industry, but we were able to partially offset decreases in our move-in rates with our proprietary revenue rate management program.""Our strong occupancy rate for the year overall was a result of our balanced approach of both digital and grass roots marketing designed to attract high-quality tenants who are more price resilient and stay for a longer duration. This helped drive a record same-store average tenant duration of stay, which was a peer-leading 3.4 years at year end. Our West Henrietta occupancy in particular increased nine percentage points to 88.6% at year-end as compared to the previous year. Since the end of the year, our average same-store occupancy has increased 2.8 percentage points to 92.1% as of March 15, 2024.""We anticipate our overall average occupancy rates will continue to improve this year, with this strengthening our pricing power. Supporting this outlook is our belief that our local grass roots marketing, which includes distribution of flyers, LED reader boards and participation in community programs, is more effective and better utilized by us than our peers for attracting high-quality tenants.""On the digital marketing front, we re-launched our website in Q4 with an enhanced user interface designed for better engagement and utilization of our now more than 2,700 tenant Google reviews, which has increased by over 160 reviews since December 31, 2023. Our reviews are a great asset as many of our properties have hundreds of Google reviews and our properties have a combined average rating of more than 4.8 out of 5 stars.""We are planning for the heightened competitive pricing environment to persist, with continued pressure on move-in rates and increased marketing spend aimed at attracting high-quality tenants. We're also implementing measures to manage expenses amidst ongoing inflationary challenges.""To be sure, these challenges are not unique to us but are industry wide. In that way, they also have a positive aspect in how we see them creating opportunities for favorable acquisitions and partnerships. Supported by our robust financial position, we're actively pursuing potential self-storage property acquisitions in select regions across the United States, and particularly where supply growth is limited and competition from other professionally managed operators is generally less.""As we progress through the year, we expect to continue to benefit from our revenue rate management program, enhanced website, and various marketing initiatives. Our commitment to offering a seamless, secure, and customer-centric experience is unwavering, which we believe helps us attract high-quality tenants. Our comprehensive marketing strategies and the potential for growth through acquisitions makes us confident that our professional management will continue to build long-term shareholder value.""Q4 2023 Financial SummaryTotal revenues decreased 2.7% to $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the decrease due primarily to lower move-in rental rates.Total operating expenses increased 3.9% to $2.3 million compared to $2.2 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in store level operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and real estate property taxes.Operating income decreased 19.8% to $680,000, as compared to $848,000 in the same period last year, which was primarily due to increased total expenses.Net income increased to $1.1 million or $0.10 per basic and diluted share from $440,000 or $0.04 per basic and diluted share in the same year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to an unrealized gain in marketable equity securities and higher interest income on money market mutual fund balances.As of December 31, 2023, the company's capital resources totaled approximately $24.3 million, comprised of $7.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $2.8 million of marketable securities, and $14.5 million available for withdrawal under the company's revolving credit facility.Q4 2023 Same-Store ResultsAs of December 31, 2023, the company owned 12 same-store properties and managed one third-party-owned property, and there were no non-same-store properties.For the fourth quarter of 2023, same-store revenues decreased 2.5% to $3.0 million compared to $3.0 million in the same period last year. This decrease was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and real estate property taxes.Same-store cost of operations increased 5.3% to $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million in the same period last year. This increase in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and real estate property taxes.Same-store NOI decreased 7.1% to $1.8 million compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to the increased cost of operations mentioned above.Same-store occupancy at December 31, 2023 increased to 89.3% from 89.6% at December 31, 2022. As of March 15, 2024, occupancy at the company's same-store properties was 92.1%.Same-store average duration of tenant stay at December 31, 2023 was approximately 3.4 years compared to approximately 3.3 years at December 31, 2022.For a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, ""Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,"" below.Q4 2023 Operating ResultsNet income in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to $1.1 million or $0.10 per basic and diluted share from $440,000 or $0.04 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2022.Property operations expense increased to $1.2 million from $1.1 million in the same period last year.General and administrative expenses increased to $703,000 from $689,000 in the same period last year.Business development costs increased to $8,900 from $1,600 in the same period last year.Interest expense increased to $227,000 from $208,000 in the year-ago period. The increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap and cash settlements under the interest rate cap from the difference between the reference interest rate and the strike rate.FFO decreased 13.0% to $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to FFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.AFFO decreased 9.1% to $1.0 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to AFFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.

The company's self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the company owns and/or manages 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma.For more information, go to ir.globalselfstorage.us or visit the company's customer site at www.globalselfstorage.us. You can also follow Global Self Storage on X, LinkedIn and Facebook.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresFunds from Operations (""FFO"") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT's net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes unrealized gains on marketable equity securities and gains relating to PPP loan forgiveness. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.Adjusted FFO (""AFFO"") and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.We believe net operating income or ""NOI"" is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.Same-Store Self Storage Operations DefinitionWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At December 31, 2023, we owned twelve same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, NOI, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking StatementsCertain information presented in this press release may contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, but not limited to, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Positive LRFC reported a net investment income of $0.6 million or $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023. The company made approximately $14.8 million of investments and had around $9.2 million in repayments and sales of investments in Q4 2023.

LRFC's cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, were $3.9 million. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net investment income (NII) of $1.43 per share for Logan Ridge Finance Corporation marks a significant turnaround from the previous year's net investment loss of $0.43 per share. This positive shift is attributed to an increased total investment income of $20.2 million, up from $14.9 million. The company's strategic decisions, including portfolio adjustments and capital deployment, have contributed to this outcome. The increase in quarterly distribution to $0.32 per share, a 7% rise from the previous quarter, signals confidence in the company's earnings sustainability and may influence investor sentiment positively.However, the decrease in net asset value (NAV) per share from $34.78 to $33.34 suggests a potential concern for valuation and investor returns. This could be indicative of underlying challenges within the portfolio or market conditions impacting asset valuations. Furthermore, the company's share repurchase program, resulting in NAV accretion, reflects a commitment to enhancing shareholder value. The repurchase of shares at a value perceived to be below intrinsic worth can be a positive signal to the market, potentially leading to a positive reevaluation of the stock. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in yield on Logan Ridge's debt portfolio by 70 basis points compared to the previous year suggests an improved interest income scenario. This increase is likely a result of rising interest rates and strategically targeted higher-yielding investments. The company's judicious investment approach, marked by a net repayment and sales of approximately $10.5 million, indicates a conservative strategy in a volatile market. This could be a response to market uncertainties or a shift towards more secure, income-producing assets.Additionally, the company's focus on rotating out of non-income producing legacy equity exposure aligns with a broader industry trend towards income-generating investments. This pivot could be a response to investor demand for more predictable income streams in an uncertain economic climate. The increased private market transaction activity, as noted by the CEO, may offer new opportunities for Logan Ridge to capitalize on favorable terms and pricing, potentially enhancing future earnings and investor returns. Legal Expert The appointment of Brandon Satoren as Chief Financial Officer, effective April 1, 2024, follows corporate governance practices and is not expected to have immediate material financial impact. However, the transition in key management personnel can influence strategic direction and investor confidence. It is important to note that the departure of the former CFO, Jason T. Roos, was not due to any operational disagreements, mitigating concerns over potential internal conflicts or issues with financial practices. The continuity in leadership, with Mr. Satoren already serving in multiple roles within the company, may ensure a smooth transition and uphold investor trust.Furthermore, the company's adherence to SEC Rule 10b-18 and the establishment of a Rule 10b5-1 plan for share repurchases demonstrates compliance with regulatory requirements, minimizing legal risks associated with share buyback programs. This compliance is important for maintaining corporate integrity and investor confidence in the company's governance practices. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Reports Strong 2023 Results with Net Investment Income of $1.43 Per Share, Compared to a Net Investment Loss of $0.43 Per Share for Year Ended 2022; Total Investment Income Increased to $20.2 Million as Compared to $14.9 Million for Year Ended 2022 As Previously Announced, Declared a Distribution of $0.32 Per Share for the First Quarter of 2024, an Increase of 7% Compared to Prior Quarter; Fourth Consecutive Quarterly Distribution Increase Total Distributions Paid During 2023 Amount to $0.96 Per Share NEW YORK, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Logan Ridge Finance Corporation (“Logan Ridge”, “Logan”, “LRFC”, “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) (Nasdaq: LRFC) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.

Management CommentaryTed Goldthorpe, Chief Executive Officer and President of LRFC, said, “We are pleased to report our strongest full year of financial performance since Mount Logan Management took over as the Company’s investment advisor in July of 2021. These results are a testament to the work we have done to optimize Logan’s balance sheet, the benefits of higher rates and our prudent deployment in a complex market. Of particular note, I would like to highlight our net investment income growth of 431% compared to the prior year as well as our $0.97 per share of undistributed spillover earnings as of December 31, 2023. This speaks volumes for the earnings power of the Company today, and also illustrates the potential to drive incremental earnings growth in 2024 as we continue to rotate out of the Company’s non-income producing legacy equity exposure and redeploy that capital into credits originated by the BC Partners credit platform. Further, Logan’s improved financial position has allowed the Board of Directors to approve a dividend of $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2024, which represents a 7% increase over the prior quarter, and a 78% increase compared to the $0.18 per share distribution declared during the first quarter of 2023 when the Board reintroduced the quarterly distribution. Looking forward to 2024, in spite of a unique and dynamic market, we are starting to see an increase in private market transactions with attractive terms and pricing. We are optimistic this trend will continue barring any unforeseen economic events. As always, we continue to focus on maximizing the earnings power of the Company to further increase stockholder total returns.” Selected Financial Information Total investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $5.3 million, to $20.2 million, compared to $14.9 million for 2022.Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, increased by $0.2 million, to $16.3 million, compared to $16.1 million for 2022.Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $3.8 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to a net investment loss of $1.2 million, or $(0.43) per share, for 2022.Net asset value as of December 31, 2023, was $89.2 million, or $33.34 per share, compared to $95.0 million, or $35.04 per share, as of December 31, 2022.Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, were $3.9 million compared to $6.8 million as of December 31, 2022.The investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023, consisted of investments in 60 portfolio companies with a fair value of approximately $189.7 million.

Eagle Point Income Company Inc. Announces Offering of Preferred Stock,2024-03-26T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Eagle Point Income Company Inc. announced a public offering of its Series C Term Preferred Stock, rated 'BBB' by Egan-Jones Ratings Company. The offering includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares and is expected to list on NYSE under the symbol 'EICC'.","Eagle Point Income Company Inc. Announces Offering of Preferred Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Eagle Point Income Company Inc. announced a public offering of its Series C Term Preferred Stock, rated 'BBB' by Egan-Jones Ratings Company. The offering includes an option for underwriters to purchase additional shares and is expected to list on NYSE under the symbol 'EICC'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The commencement of an underwritten public offering of Series C Term Preferred Stock by Eagle Point Income Company Inc. is a strategic financial move that warrants attention from various market participants. The issuance of preferred stock typically aims to raise capital for the company without diluting existing shareholders' equity to the same extent as common stock offerings. The 'BBB' rating by Egan-Jones Ratings Company suggests a moderate level of creditworthiness, which may appeal to risk-averse investors seeking stable dividend payments.Furthermore, the option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares could indicate the company's anticipation of strong demand or a strategy to stabilize the price post-listing. The involvement of reputable financial institutions as joint bookrunners and lead managers could potentially boost investor confidence in the offering. However, it is critical for investors to consider the terms of the Preferred Stock, such as dividend rates and redemption features, as these will impact the investment's risk-return profile. Market Research Analyst The expected listing of the Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 'EICC' within 30 days of the original issue date introduces a new investment vehicle into the market. This move may diversify the Company's investor base by attracting those who prioritize income generation and lower volatility compared to common stocks. The market's reception of this new issuance can be indicative of the current appetite for fixed-income securities, especially in the context of the broader economic climate and interest rate environment.It is also noteworthy to consider the timing of such an offering, as it may reflect the Company's strategic financial planning in response to market conditions or internal capital requirements. The performance of this newly issued Preferred Stock could serve as a bellwether for similar future offerings in the sector, influencing the capital raising strategies of other firms. Legal Expert The issuance of Preferred Stock and its subsequent trading on a public exchange necessitates compliance with regulatory requirements, including the filing of a preliminary prospectus supplement and an accompanying prospectus with the SEC. These documents are critical as they provide investors with essential details regarding the investment, including the Company's objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Potential investors must exercise due diligence by reviewing these materials to make informed decisions.Additionally, the legal framework governing the 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares is an important aspect of the offering. This mechanism often serves to cover over-allotments, which can help in managing supply and demand dynamics post-offering. The legal disclosures in the prospectus can also shed light on the rights of Preferred Stock holders, including voting rights, dividend policies and liquidation preferences, which are significant factors in evaluating the attractiveness of the offering. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Eagle Point Income Company Inc.

Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased by 5% to $1.25. Progress fortified its balance sheet with a new revolving credit facility and a convertible notes offering. Cash and cash equivalents were $133.2 million at the end of the quarter. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.175 per share of common stock. Progress provided updated guidance for fiscal year 2024, expecting revenue of $722-732 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.94-2.06. The company also offered Q2 2024 guidance with revenue of $166-170 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.22-0.26. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report indicates a 12% increase in year-over-year revenue, which is a positive signal for investors and stakeholders, reflecting the company's ability to grow its top line. However, the decrease in diluted earnings per share (EPS) by 4% could be a concern as it suggests a reduction in profitability or increased share count. The operating margin contraction of 300 basis points on a GAAP basis and 200 basis points on a non-GAAP basis year-over-year might indicate rising costs or inefficiencies that could impact future profitability.Progress's cash and cash equivalents position seems robust at $133.2 million, which provides financial flexibility. The 51% increase in cash from operations is particularly noteworthy, suggesting improved operational efficiency or working capital management. The company's decision to fortify its balance sheet through a new revolving credit facility and a convertible notes offering is strategic, potentially lowering costs and providing capital for accretive M&A activities.The provided 2024 business outlook appears optimistic, with stable revenue guidance and a slight increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance. This forward-looking statement may reassure investors about the company's confidence in its future performance. Market Research Analyst Progress's stable Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) indicates a consistent revenue stream, which is a key metric for the predictability of future earnings. The company's strategy of focusing on recurring revenue aligns with industry norms, as it provides visibility and stability. Additionally, the Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increased to 50 days from 42 days year-over-year, suggesting a lengthening of the cash conversion cycle that might warrant attention.The company's emphasis on its Total Growth Strategy and the potential for accretive mergers and acquisitions (M&A) could lead to growth opportunities, although it also introduces risks associated with integration and potential dilution of existing shareholders. Investors may view the strategic use of the new credit facilities and convertible notes as a commitment to driving growth through investment and acquisition. Legal & Compliance Expert From a compliance perspective, the inclusion of Non-GAAP financial measures provides additional insight into the company's operational performance by excluding certain items deemed non-representative of ongoing operations. It is important to note that these measures should be viewed supplementary to GAAP results, as they exclude items like stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, which can be significant.Moreover, the company's adjustments for cyber incident and vulnerability response expenses highlight the impact of cybersecurity on financial performance. The disclosure of these adjustments provides transparency, but stakeholders should be aware of the potential ongoing risks related to cybersecurity threats.Lastly, the forward-looking statements regarding financial guidance are subject to uncertainties, including changes in exchange rates, which could impact the company's performance. It is important for investors to consider the risks associated with these projections. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM First Quarter Revenues and Earnings Per Share Ahead of Estimates BURLINGTON, Mass., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Progress (Nasdaq: PRGS), the trusted provider of infrastructure software, today announced financial results for its fiscal first quarter ended February 29, 2024.

Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information Progress furnishes certain non-GAAP supplemental information to our financial results. We use such non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our period-over-period operating performance because our management team believes that by excluding the effects of certain GAAP-related items that in their opinion do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations, such information helps to illustrate underlying trends in our business and provides us with a more comparable measure of our continuing business, as well as greater understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business. Management also uses such non-GAAP financial measures to establish budgets and operational goals, evaluate performance, and allocate resources. In addition, the compensation of our executives and non-executive employees is based in part on the performance of our business as evaluated by such non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future by: (i) providing more transparency for certain financial measures, (ii) presenting disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure the performance of our business, (iii) affords a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies, and (iv) enables investors to consider our operating results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis (including following the integration period of our prior and proposed acquisitions). However, this non-GAAP information is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") and should be considered in conjunction with our GAAP results as the items excluded from the non-GAAP information may have a material impact on Progress' financial results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjustments to Progress' GAAP financial results is included in the tables at the end of this press release. In the noted fiscal periods, we adjusted for the following items from our GAAP financial results to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures: Acquisition-related revenue – We include acquisition-related revenue, which constitutes revenue reflected as pre-acquisition deferred revenue that would have been recognized prior to our adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (""ASU 2021-08"") during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. The acquisition-related revenue in our prior period results relates to Chef Software, Inc. which we acquired on October 5, 2020. Since GAAP accounting required the elimination of this revenue prior to the adoption of ASU 2021-08, GAAP results alone do not fully capture all of our economic activities. We believe these adjustments are useful to management and investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of the business because, although we cannot be certain that customers will renew their contracts, we have historically experienced high renewal rates on maintenance and support agreements and other customer contracts. Upon our adoption of ASU 2021-08, this adjustment is no longer applicable to subsequent acquisitions.Amortization of acquired intangibles – We exclude amortization of acquired intangibles because those expenses are unrelated to our core operating performance and the intangible assets acquired vary significantly based on the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions and the maturities of the businesses acquired.Stock-based compensation – We exclude stock-based compensation to be consistent with the way management and, in our view, the overall financial community evaluates our performance and the methods used by analysts to calculate consensus estimates. The expense related to stock-based awards is generally not controllable in the short-term and can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. As such, we do not include these charges in operating plans.Restructuring expenses and other – In all periods presented, we exclude restructuring expenses incurred because those expenses distort trends and are not part of our core operating results.Acquisition-related expenses – We exclude acquisition-related expenses in order to provide a more meaningful comparison of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. We consider these types of costs and adjustments, to a great extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, we do not consider these acquisition-related costs and adjustments to be related to the organic continuing operations of the acquired businesses and are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition-related costs, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions.Cyber incident and vulnerability response expenses, net November 2022 Cyber Incident – We exclude certain expenses resulting from the detection of irregular activity on certain portions of our corporate network, as more thoroughly described in the Form 8-K that we filed on December 19, 2022.MOVEit Vulnerability – We exclude certain expenses resulting from the zero-day MOVEit Vulnerability, as more thoroughly described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission since June 5, 2023, including our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023.Expenses include costs to investigate and remediate these cyber related matters, as well as legal and other professional services related thereto. Expenses related to such cyber matters are provided net of expected insurance recoveries, although the timing of recognizing insurance recoveries may differ from the timing of recognizing the associated expenses. Costs associated with the enhancement of our cybersecurity program are not included within this adjustment. We expect to continue to incur legal and other professional services expenses in future periods associated with the MOVEit Vulnerability. We do not expect to incur additional costs associated with the November 2022 Cyber Incident as the investigation is closed. Expenses related to such cyber matters are expected to result in operating expenses that would not have otherwise been incurred in the normal course of business operations. We believe that excluding these costs facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance. Provision for income taxes – We adjust our income tax provision by excluding the tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments discussed above.Constant currency – Revenue from our international operations has historically represented a substantial portion of our total revenue. As a result, our revenue results have been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we present revenue growth rates on a constant currency basis, which helps improve the understanding of our revenue results and our performance in comparison to prior periods. The constant currency information presented is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.Annualized Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") – We provide an ARR performance metric to help investors better understand and assess the performance of our business because our mix of revenue generated from recurring sources has increased in recent years and comprises the vast majority of our total revenue. ARR represents the annualized contract value for all active and contractually binding term-based contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR includes maintenance, software upgrade rights, public cloud and on-premises subscription-based transactions and managed services. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace, either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.Net Retention Rate – We calculate net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the ARR from the cohort of all customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (""Prior Period ARR""). We then calculate the ARR from these same customers as of the current period end (""Current Period ARR""). Current Period ARR includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months but excludes ARR from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total Current Period ARR by the total Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net retention rate. Net retention rate is not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We also provide guidance on adjusted free cash flow, which is equal to cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus restructuring payments.

Financial Analyst The recent repricing of U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.'s Term Loan B represents a strategic financial maneuver to capitalize on the company's strong performance and to optimize its capital structure. The reduction of the interest rate margin by 75 basis points, particularly in a high interest rate environment, signifies a substantial decrease in debt servicing costs. This move should positively impact the company's net interest margin, freeing up cash flows that can be potentially reinvested into the business or used to further pay down debt.The elimination of the Term SOFR Adjustment and reduction in the soft call period from twelve to six months also indicate an improved risk profile and increased flexibility for the company. These actions demonstrate a proactive approach to debt management and could be perceived favorably by investors and credit rating agencies, potentially leading to an improved credit rating and lower cost of capital in the future. Market Research Analyst U.S. Silica's successful debt repricing and the voluntary repayment of $25 million in principal indicate a robust demand for the company's debt instruments, reflecting investor confidence. This confidence likely stems from the company's position as a leading logistics provider to the oil and gas industry, a sector that has seen volatility but remains critical to the economy.

Li-Cycle Provides Organizational Structure Update,2024-03-26T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Li-Cycle transitions to centralized management model to increase efficiencies, expecting $10 million in cost savings annually. Leadership changes announced to align with new structure.","Li-Cycle Provides Organizational Structure Update Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Li-Cycle transitions to centralized management model to increase efficiencies, expecting $10 million in cost savings annually. Leadership changes announced to align with new structure. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic shift by Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. to a centralized management model represents a significant operational restructuring. This move is designed to streamline operations and cut costs, with an anticipated $10 million in annual savings. From a financial perspective, the workforce reduction and the associated $8.3 million in severance costs suggest a short-term cash outflow which needs to be balanced against the long-term savings. Investors will likely monitor the execution of this transition closely, gauging its effectiveness in achieving the promised cost efficiencies.Such restructurings can be a double-edged sword, potentially disrupting operations in the short term but offering improved margins and operational agility in the long term. The company's stock performance could be affected by how well these changes are communicated to the market and how quickly the benefits are realized. Furthermore, the strategic financing from Glencore and the leadership changes, including the appointment of a new interim CFO, may influence investor confidence depending on how these moves are perceived in terms of stability and strategic direction. Market Research Analyst Li-Cycle's transition to a centralized management model can be seen as a response to the increasingly competitive and cost-sensitive lithium-ion battery recycling market. By reducing operational redundancies and fostering cross-functional partnerships, Li-Cycle aims to enhance its market position and operational efficiency. The announced changes in leadership, including the new COO and CCO roles, signal a strategic realignment towards a more integrated and cohesive global strategy.Given the growing importance of sustainable practices and the critical role of battery recycling in the supply chain for electric vehicles and other technologies, Li-Cycle's focus on cost efficiency and strategic partnerships could strengthen its appeal to potential clients and partners. The market will be observing how these organizational changes affect Li-Cycle's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for battery recycling solutions and to navigate the complex regulatory and technological landscape of this industry. Corporate Governance Expert The governance implications of Li-Cycle's organizational changes are notable. The shift in board composition, particularly with the anticipation of an independent Board Chair following the next annual general meeting, reflects a commitment to strong corporate governance practices. This move may be reassuring to shareholders concerned about oversight and strategic direction, especially in light of the recent financing agreement with Glencore, which grants them nomination rights.The departure of the CFO and the transition to an interim CFO could raise questions about financial leadership continuity, but the planned support until May 31, 2024, for a smooth handover should mitigate some of those concerns. Investors typically favor stability and clear succession planning in financial leadership roles, as these are critical for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring strategic financial management. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Li-Cycle to transition from regional to centralized management model to increase efficiencies Li-Cycle expected to generate approximately $10 million in cost savings on an annualized basis through workforce reduction TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Li-Cycle Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LICY) (“Li-Cycle” or the “Company”), a leading global lithium-ion battery resource recovery company, today provided a business update regarding its organizational structure. As part of its previously disclosed ongoing comprehensive review and Cash Preservation Plan, which includes organizational right-sizing and right-shaping, the Company has made the strategic decision to transition from its regional management structure to a centralized model to better position the Company for future success and increase efficiencies. Ajay Kochhar, Li-Cycle President and CEO, commented: “We are recalibrating our organizational structure to better align with the more focused priorities of Li-Cycle. We believe that a centralized model, and the consolidation of our operational and commercial teams, will increase efficiencies and facilitate cross-functional partnerships to enhance our planning process and ability to execute on our short- and long-term objectives. We remain focused on our key initiatives of completing our review of the go-forward plan for the Rochester Hub and evaluating additional financing and strategic alternatives after securing and closing the recent strategic financing from Glencore.” To ensure the appropriate management organizational structure, the Company made the following leadership changes, effectively immediately: Tim Johnston, Executive Chair, will transition to the role of interim non-executive Board Chair, where he will provide leadership, support, guidance and strategic advice to the Company. Considering Glencore’s nomination rights associated with the recently closed strategic financing, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board will be considering changes to Company’s Board and Committee composition, expected to be made immediately following Li-Cycle’s next annual general meeting in May 2024. It is expected that these changes will include identifying an independent Board Chair. Conor Spollen, who has been with Li-Cycle since January 2022, has assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer (COO). In this role, Mr. Spollen will be responsible for Li-Cycle’s global Spoke operations driving safety, productivity, and cost-efficiency. In addition to overseeing Spoke operations, following the completion of the technical and economic review of the Rochester Hub project, he will be responsible for project delivery and the planned operation of the Rochester Hub. Mr. Spollen has more than 33 years of international mining and metallurgical experience, serving in leadership roles in a number of global companies, including at Vale, where he was, among other roles, Chief Operating Officer for Vale Base Metals’ operating mines and processing facilities in Canada, UK, China and Japan. Dawei Li, who has been with Li-Cycle since July 2021, has assumed the new role of Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). In his new role, Mr. Li will lead Li-Cycle’s global commercial function and consolidate the global team’s strategy and approach to continue building strong partnerships with key battery market players. He previously led Li-Cycle’s Asia-Pacific region and brings 20 years of experience in strategy and business development and leading growth in untapped markets to drive robust performance. Previous to Li-Cycle, Mr. Li served as Global Business Director for lithium carbonate at Albemarle Corporation. With the changes to the centralized and reduced size of the organization, Debbie Simpson, Chief Financial Officer, will be leaving the Company to pursue new opportunities. Since joining the Company in December 2021, Ms. Simpson has made a significant contribution to Li-Cycle through her executive leadership in financial management and strategic initiatives. She has helped lead the strategic funding roadmap for the Company and built a finance function to support the Company’s focus on fiscal responsibility and strong governance. Ms. Simpson will continue to support the team until May 31, 2024, to ensure a smooth transition. The Company is pleased to announce that Craig Cunningham has joined Li-Cycle as its interim Chief Financial Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Cunningham has an extensive background in executive level leadership and brings more than 17 years of accounting, finance, operational, and capital markets experience. Most recently, he was Chief Financial Officer at Electra Battery Materials and prior to that served as Vice President and Regional Financial Officer at Kinross Gold. With the change to a centralized organization model, Richard Storrie will cease serving as the Company’s Regional President, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Storrie has provided strong leadership for the Company in both the EMEA and North America regions and has made significant contributions to Li-Cycle’s operations, commercial activities, and execution of its growth strategy. He will continue in an advisory role until May 31, 2024, to support the transition. “We would like to extend our sincere thanks to Ms. Simpson and Mr. Storrie for their dedication and valuable contributions to the Company. We wish them the very best in their future endeavors,” said Mr. Kochhar. “We are also excited to welcome Mr. Spollen, Mr. Li and Mr. Cunningham to their new roles. We believe their leadership, expertise and experience will be key to Li-Cycle’s future success.” In addition to the leadership changes, and as part of the Company’s Cash Preservation Plan and the change from a regional to a centralized management model, the Company is taking other steps to reduce its workforce, primarily at the corporate level. Overall, the Company expects to reduce approximately 60 positions, representing approximately 17% of the Company’s global workforce. The Company estimates that it will incur total charges of approximately $8.3 million in connection with the workforce reductions, with the majority of these costs to be incurred as cash severance payments over the next twelve months. These steps are expected to generate approximately $10 million in payroll and benefit cost savings on an annualized basis. Mr. Kochhar continued, “I want to thank all of the impacted Li-Cycle team members, as they played a key role in helping us work towards our vision of creating a more sustainable lithium-ion battery supply chain. Although our Cash Preservation Plan is essential to position Li-Cycle for future success, we have deep appreciation and gratitude for their high-quality work and contributions and will provide the impacted Li-Cycle team members with support through a period of transition.” About Li-Cycle Holdings Corp.

(OUST) reports record revenue of $83 million for 2023 and expects $25 to $26 million in revenue for Q1 2024. The company achieved milestones like merging with Velodyne, launching new products, and exceeding cost-saving targets. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported revenue growth of Ouster, Inc. reflects a robust demand for lidar sensors across various industries. The 103% year-over-year revenue increase and the sequential growth in shipments indicate a strong market position and successful expansion efforts. The strategic merger with Velodyne has not only diversified Ouster's business but also enhanced its financial stability through an expanded patent portfolio and cost structure optimization.Their transition to manufacturing in Thailand is a strategic move to reduce costs, which is reflected in the 40% cost savings exceeding initial targets. This is a positive signal for operational efficiency and margin improvement. The launch of new products like Ouster Gemini and the transition to more software solutions suggest a pivot towards recurring revenue streams, which could lead to a more stable and predictable financial outlook. However, the net loss and EBITDA loss indicate that despite revenue growth, profitability remains a challenge. Investors should monitor the company's ability to control operating expenses and further improve margins to assess the long-term viability. Financial Analyst Ouster's financial performance, particularly the record revenue and improved gross margins, signals potential for increased investor confidence. The non-GAAP gross margin improvement to 35% is notable as it excludes one-time expenses, providing a clearer picture of the company's operational efficiency. The book-to-bill ratio of 1.7x suggests a healthy backlog of orders, which could translate into sustained revenue growth.The company's focus on achieving a long-term financial framework with targets of 30-50% annual revenue growth and gross margins of 35-40% sets clear expectations for investors. The projected revenue for Q1 2024 indicates a continued upward trajectory, but the net loss figures remind us that Ouster is still in a growth phase with associated costs. Investors should weigh the potential for future profitability against the current expenses and risks associated with the competitive and rapidly evolving lidar technology market. Technology Industry Analyst The advancements in Ouster's product offerings, particularly the REV7 sensor and the upcoming integration of the Chronos chip into its solid-state digital flash sensors, demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation in the lidar space. The shift towards digital lidar hardware could position Ouster favorably against competitors by offering enhanced performance features. The focus on software solutions, including subscription-based offerings, aligns with broader industry trends towards service-oriented business models.The strategic merger with Velodyne has likely expanded Ouster's technological capabilities and market reach. However, the competitive landscape in lidar technology is intense, with rapid advancements and cost pressures. Ouster's ability to maintain its R&D momentum while managing costs will be important for its long-term success. Investors should consider the company's technological advancements in the context of the larger industry dynamics, including potential disruptions from emerging technologies and market entrants. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM Record revenue of $83 million for the full year 2023 Expects $25 to $26 million of revenue for the first quarter of 2024 SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ouster, Inc. (NYSE: OUST) (“Ouster” or the “Company”), a leading provider of high-performance lidar sensors for the automotive, industrial, robotics, and smart infrastructure industries, announced today financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 20231. Fourth Quarter 2023 Highlights Over $24 million in revenue, up 10% sequentially and a quarterly record. Shipped over 4,100 sensors for revenue, up over 20% sequentially and a quarterly record. GAAP gross margins of 22%, compared to 14% in the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP gross margins2 of 35%, compared to 33% in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss of $39 million, compared to $35 million in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA2 loss of $14 million, compared to a loss of $18 million in the third quarter of 2023. Full Year 2023 Highlights Over $83 million in revenue, up 103% year over year and an annual record. Booked $142 million in business with new and existing customers, representing a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7x.3 Closed merger with Velodyne and established a combined company with a robust range of products, stronger financial position, diversified business, extensive intellectual property portfolio, and a significantly reduced cost structure. Ended 2023 with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments balance of $192 million. Exceeded initial post-merger annualized cost savings target by over 40%4. Scaled production and shipments of REV7, Ouster’s most performant sensor to date. Awarded production wins by May Mobility and Motional to supply lidar for their autonomous vehicles. Transitioned manufacturing of Velodyne products to Thailand. Launched Ouster Gemini, a digital lidar perception platform for crowd analytics, security, and intelligent transportation systems. Unified Blue City and Ouster Gemini, adding new performance-improving deep learning AI perception models. ""Ouster had a transformative year, reporting record revenue of $83 million and bookings of $142 million in 2023. We successfully completed the merger with Velodyne, which solidified our balance sheet, expanded our patent portfolio, and streamlined our cost structure. We achieved important milestones across our operations, notably scaling production and shipments of REV7. Additionally, we added new revenue streams with the launch of Ouster Gemini and Blue City and demoed our first DF sensors with customers, marking a significant stride forward in our product development journey. This was accomplished while delivering record financial performance, significantly reducing our cash burn, and exceeding our initial post-merger annualized cost savings target by over 40%”, said Ouster CEO Angus Pacala. ""I’m excited to continue this momentum in 2024 as we execute our plan towards profitability."" Ouster delivered record quarterly revenue of over $24 million with shipments exceeding 4,100 sensors. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were sequentially higher, in line with expectations. Margin expansion was driven by higher revenues and lower manufacturing costs attributable to operational improvements. GAAP gross margins of 22% in the fourth quarter of 2023 include the impact of certain expenses outside of ordinary operations associated with the consolidation of product lines and outsourced manufacturing of Velodyne products. Non-GAAP gross margins improved to 35% in the fourth quarter of 2023. GAAP operating expenses were higher sequentially, driven by a litigation settlement and higher stock-based compensation expenses. 2024 Business Objectives Expand software solutions and grow the installed base Advance the development of digital lidar hardware Progress on the long-term financial framework Expand software solutions and grow the installed base: Ouster’s smart infrastructure solutions, powered by Ouster Gemini and Blue City, are enabling customers to improve operating efficiency and safety.

In addition, see information below concerning non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to its results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), Ouster believes the non‑GAAP measures of Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating its operating performance. Ouster calculates Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit (loss) excluding amortization of acquired intangibles, certain excess and obsolete expenses and losses on firm purchase commitments, and stock-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP Gross Margin is calculated as Non-GAAP Gross Profit divided by revenues. Ouster calculates Adjusted EBITDA as net loss excluding interest expense (income), net, other expense (income), net, stock-based compensation expense, provision for income tax expense, goodwill impairment charges, restructuring costs excluding stock-based compensation expenses, certain excess and obsolete expenses and losses on firm purchase commitments, amortization of acquired intangible assets, depreciation expenses, certain litigation and litigation related expenses, merger and acquisition related expenses, gain on lease termination and other items. Ouster believes that Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Gross Margin, and Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and may be helpful in comparison with other companies, some of which use similar non‑GAAP information to supplement their GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by the Board and management as a performance metric for compensation purposes. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non‑GAAP measures used by other companies. Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this press release. ____________________________________ 1 The comparative financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2022 reflect only the results of standalone Ouster. The financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 are composed of Ouster standalone performance through February 10, 2023 and combined performance of Ouster and Velodyne for the remainder of the period.

Camden National Corporation Announces its First Quarter 2024 Dividend,2024-03-26T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Camden National  (CAC) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend yield of 5.19% based on the closing price of $32.38 per share on March 25, 2024.","Camden National Corporation Announces its First Quarter 2024 Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Camden National (CAC) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend yield of 5.19% based on the closing price of $32.38 per share on March 25, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share by Camden National Corporation represents a tangible return to shareholders and signals confidence from the company's management in its financial stability and profit-generating ability. The disclosed annualized dividend yield of 5.19% is notably higher than the average bank industry yield, which typically hovers around the 2-3% mark. This could indicate a strategic move to attract income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where such yields are competitive.However, investors should consider the sustainability of such a high yield. A payout ratio – the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends – significantly above industry averages or above 100% could be a red flag, potentially signaling that dividends are being paid out from debt or reserves rather than current earnings. It's essential to analyze the company's earnings, payout ratio and cash flow statements for a comprehensive understanding of dividend sustainability. Market Research Analyst The announcement of a dividend payment can often lead to a positive market reaction, as it is perceived as a sign of a company's health and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. Given the yield of 5.19%, it is likely that Camden National Corporation's stock will garner attention from yield-seeking investors. This could potentially increase demand for the stock around the ex-dividend date, which is the final date on which new shareholders are eligible to receive the dividend.Market trends also show that regional banks and financial institutions are increasingly pressured to offer competitive yields to retain and attract shareholders, especially during economic downturns or periods of market volatility. It will be interesting to observe the stock's performance leading up to and following the ex-dividend date, as well as any adjustments in analyst ratings or investor sentiment. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM CAMDEN, Maine, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Simon R.

Hillman Successfully Reprices Senior Term Loan Lowering Interest Expense,2024-03-26T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Hillman Solutions Corp. successfully repriced its Term Loan, reducing interest rate margin by 25 basis points, leading to annualized interest savings of $2.6 million.

The company improved its financial position by reducing inventories and debt, aiming to strengthen its balance sheet further in 2024. Credit agencies like S&P, Moody's, and Fitch have shown positive ratings and outlooks for Hillman. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Hillman Solutions Corp.'s recent move to reprice its existing term loan can be seen as a strategic financial decision aimed at optimizing its capital structure. The reduction in the interest rate margin by 25 basis points, alongside the elimination of the Credit Spread Adjustment, will lead to an estimated annual savings of $2.6 million. This action indicates a proactive approach to debt management and reflects positively on the company's creditworthiness.The improved financial position, as highlighted by the CFO, is corroborated by the reduction in net inventories and gross debt position. The potential for further interest rate margin reductions, contingent on the first lien leverage ratio, offers an additional incentive for the company to maintain a strong balance sheet. The credit rating upgrades and affirmations by S&P and Moody's serve as external validations of the company's financial health and could positively influence investor confidence.However, investors should consider the one-time fees associated with the repricing and the impact of new swap agreements on the company's financial flexibility. The fixed interest rate on a portion of the term note may provide stability in interest expenses, but it also limits the potential benefits of future rate decreases. Overall, the company's debt restructuring efforts seem to be a step towards financial improvement and cost savings. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Hillman's actions to improve its debt terms and the subsequent credit rating upgrades signal to current and potential investors that the company is on a trajectory of financial stability and prudence. The market often reacts favorably to such news as it suggests a lower risk profile and enhanced ability to generate shareholder value.Furthermore, the removal of the CSA and the favorable interest rate environment, as indicated by the company's ability to secure lower rates, could be reflective of broader market trends. Investors may interpret these developments as a sign of Hillman's strong bargaining position with lenders and its robust financial strategy.It's important for stakeholders to monitor Hillman's commitment to using free cash flow to pay down debt, as this will likely have a significant impact on its leverage ratios and subsequent interest rate margins. The company's focus on balance sheet strength could be a differentiating factor in its sector, potentially leading to a competitive advantage. Debt Market Analyst Hillman's recent repricing initiative and swap agreements reflect an environment where companies are seeking to lock in favorable interest rates ahead of potential market volatility. The company's ability to negotiate better terms is indicative of a robust credit profile, which is essential for debt market stakeholders.The decision to enter into new swap agreements for a significant portion of the term note at a fixed rate plus the interest rate spread could be seen as a hedge against future interest rate fluctuations. This move might be particularly appealing to debt investors who prefer predictable cash flows and are wary of interest rate risks.While the immediate interest savings are clear, the long-term implications of these swap agreements on Hillman's interest expense should be closely examined. The fixed rate ensures certainty in financial planning, but it could also mean missed opportunities if interest rates fall below the swap rate. The balance between risk management and financial flexibility is a critical aspect for debt market analysts to consider when evaluating Hillman's financial instruments. 03/26/2024 - 04:15 PM CINCINNATI, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hillman Solutions Corp. (Nasdaq: HLMN) (the “Company” or “Hillman”), a leading provider of hardware products and merchandising solutions, successfully repriced its existing $752 million Term Loan due July 14, 2028. The repricing reduces Hillman’s interest rate margin by 25 basis points to SOFR + 250 basis point and successfully removes the Credit Spread Adjustment (“CSA”) of 11 basis points, based on current leverage and elections. The expected annualized interest savings are approximately $2.6 million, before one-time fees of approximately $1.4 million. Rocky Kraft, Hillman’s chief financial officer commented: ""The improved interest rate spread is a result of Hillman’s execution and improved financial position. Since the second quarter of 2022, we have reduced our net inventories by $192 million and improved our gross debt position by $206 million. We expect to continue strengthening our balance sheet as we use our free cash flow to pay down debt throughout 2024.” Should Hillman’s first lien leverage ratio, as defined by Hillman’s Term Loan Credit Agreement, drop below 3.0 times, the interest rate margin will be reduced by another 25 basis points, to 225 basis points. Following the company’s Q4 2023 results issued on February 22, 2024, S&P upgraded Hillman’s issuer credit rating to 'BB' from 'BB-' and maintained its ‘Stable’ outlook; while Moody’s affirmed Hillman’s ‘B1’ Corporate Family Rating and upgraded its outlook to ‘Stable’ from ‘Negative.’ During September 2023, Fitch affirmed its Long-Term Issuer Default Rating of ‘BB-’ Hillman and its ‘Stable’ outlook. During December 2023, Hillman entered into new swap agreements fixing $360 million of the term note at approximately 3.69 percent plus the interest rate spread. These new swaps go into effect when the existing swaps expire on July 31, 2024, and expire on January 31, 2027.

With the sale of its previous headquarters, Farmer Brothers anticipates moving into the new facility by the end of fiscal 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The lease agreement by Farmer Brothers for a new headquarters is a strategic move that aligns with the company's operational restructuring. The downsizing from a 540,000-square-foot facility to a 25,000-square-foot space indicates a significant reduction in physical footprint. This could suggest an optimization of operations and a potential decrease in overhead costs. Investors would view such a move as a positive signal if it translates into improved net margins and a leaner cost structure in the long term.However, the transition also raises questions about the scale at which Farmer Brothers aims to operate moving forward. The reduction in space may reflect a pivot in business strategy, perhaps focusing more on efficiency rather than expansion. Stakeholders should monitor how this move affects the company's distribution capabilities, especially considering the emphasis on direct store delivery (DSD) mentioned by the CEO. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the sale of the larger Northlake facility and subsequent lease of a smaller space could be indicative of capital reallocation or debt reduction efforts. The cash influx from the sale to TreeHouse Foods might have provided Farmer Brothers with liquidity to address immediate financial obligations or to invest in core business areas.Investors should consider the terms of the lease, such as the duration and cost, as these details could impact the company's balance sheet and cash flow statements. A 54-month lease provides a medium-term horizon for occupancy costs, which should be factored into forecasts and valuation models. The anticipated move by the end of fiscal 2024 year allows for a clear timeline for investors to track potential disruptions or benefits stemming from the relocation. Real Estate Investment Analyst In terms of real estate strategy, Farmer Brothers' decision to remain in close proximity to its previous headquarters suggests a commitment to maintaining its presence within the region, which may be important for retaining talent and continuity of business operations. The Fort Worth area is known for its growing business environment and such a move could be seen as a strategic positioning.Real estate market conditions in Fort Worth could also play a role in this decision. If the market is favorable, with competitive lease rates and ample supply of suitable commercial spaces, Farmer Brothers may have secured a cost-effective deal. Conversely, if the market is tight, the company's ability to secure a new headquarters space could be seen as a proactive measure to ensure stability amidst potential future market constraints. 03/26/2024 - 04:11 PM NORTHLAKE, Texas, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmer Brothers (NASDAQ: FARM) a leading roaster, wholesaler, and distributor of coffee, tea and allied products, announced today it has entered into a 54-month lease agreement on a new headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas.

The combined development programs have a steady cadence of catalysts with programs ranging from pre-clinical to registration studies. SBP-101 IvospeminIvospemin is a proprietary polyamine analogue designed to induce polyamine metabolic inhibition (PMI) by exploiting an observed high affinity of the compound for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other tumors. It has shown signals of tumor growth inhibition in clinical studies of metastatic pancreatic cancer patients, demonstrating a median overall survival (OS) of 14.6 months and an objective response rate (ORR) of 48%, both exceeding what is typical for the standard of care of gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel suggesting potential complementary activity with the existing FDA-approved standard chemotherapy regimen. In data evaluated from clinical studies to date, ivospemin has not shown exacerbation of bone marrow suppression and peripheral neuropathy, which can be chemotherapy-related adverse events. Serious visual adverse events have been evaluated and patients with a history of retinopathy or at risk of retinal detachment will be excluded from future SBP-101 studies. The safety data and PMI profile observed in the previous Panbela-sponsored clinical trials provide support for continued evaluation of ivospemin in the ASPIRE trial. For more information, please visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03412799 . Flynpovi™Flynpovi is a combination of CPP-1X (eflornithine) and sulindac with a dual mechanism inhibiting polyamine synthesis and increasing polyamine export and catabolism. In a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with sporadic large bowel polyps, the combination prevented > 90% subsequent pre-cancerous sporadic adenomas versus placebo. Focusing on FAP patients with lower gastrointestinal tract anatomy in the recent Phase 3 trial comparing Flynpovi to single agent eflornithine and single agent sulindac, FAP patients with lower GI anatomy (patients with an intact colon, retained rectum or surgical pouch), Flynpovi showed statistically significant benefit compared to both single agents (p≤0.02) in delaying surgical events in the lower GI for up to four years. The safety profile for Flynpovi did not significantly differ from the single agents and supports the continued evaluation of Flynpovi for FAP. CPP-1X EflornithineCPP-1X (eflornithine) is being developed as a single agent tablet or high dose power sachet for several indications including prevention of gastric cancer and recent onset Type 1 diabetes. Preclinical studies as well as Phase 1 or Phase 2 investigator-initiated trials suggest that CPP-1X treatment may be well-tolerated and has potential activity.

Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue less transaction-based expenses by 13% year-over-year and a modest 1% rise in trading volume for Forge Global Holdings signifies a strengthening of its core business activities. However, the expansion in revenue is overshadowed by the operating loss widening from $21.5 million to $24.4 million quarter-over-quarter and a net loss increase from $19.0 million to $26.2 million in the same period. This suggests significant challenges in managing operational costs, which are further exacerbated by a substantial $2.5 million increase in accrued legal expenses. Such financial strain could affect investor sentiment and potentially the company's stock price.From a cash flow perspective, the uptick in net cash used in operating activities from $3.5 million to $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter indicates a burn rate that investors should monitor closely. Despite this, a robust ending cash balance of $144.7 million provides some cushion for the company's liquidity status. The net take rate remaining relatively stable at 3.3% for the year reflects a consistent monetization of trading volumes, an important metric for assessing the company's revenue-generating efficiency. Market Research Analyst Forge's strategic focus on technology development, data and category leadership appears to be yielding product innovation, as evidenced by the launch of Forge Pro and the debut of two private market indexes. These developments could enhance Forge's competitive positioning in the private securities marketplace, potentially attracting institutional investors and increasing trading activity. However, the 20% year-over-year decline in Forge Trust Custodial Cash might raise concerns about the company's ability to retain assets under management.The growth in Total Assets Under Custody by 5% and an 11% increase in the number of companies with Indications of Interest (IOIs) suggest a growing interest in private market investments, which could be a positive signal for future revenue prospects. Yet, the full-year trading volume decline of 37% year-over-year is a red flag that could indicate a market contraction or loss of market share to competitors. Legal Expert The $2.5 million increase in accrued legal expenses related to a settlement reached in the fourth quarter is a material financial development that stakeholders should consider. Such legal matters can not only impact current financials but also have longer-term implications for a company's reputation and operational focus. It's critical for investors to understand the nature of these legal challenges and their potential recurrence, which could pose ongoing risks to profitability. 03/26/2024 - 04:10 PM Total Revenue Less Transaction Based Expenses Was $18.9 million in 4Q23, increasing 13% year-over-year Trading Volume Was $250.4 million in 4Q23, increasing 1% year-over-year Net Take Rate Was 3.2% in 4Q23 and 3.3% for 2023 Total Assets Under Custody increased in 2023 from $14.9 billion to $15.6 billion, up 5% year-over-year SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Forge Global Holdings, Inc.

Marketplace revenue includes placement fees earned through transactions on our Forge Markets platform, subscription fees earned from our data products, and private company solutions revenue. We believe this name better describes the revenue included therein and therefore is more useful to investors by better characterizing the underlying types of revenue included. We have not adjusted methodology, assumptions, or otherwise changed any aspects of “Placement Fee” revenue in making this name change to “Marketplace” revenue, and this category of revenue remains comparable to prior period presentations.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""GAAP""), we present Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business and our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a tool for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We defined Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted to exclude: (i) interest expense, net, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) share-based compensation expense, (v) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, (vi) acquisition-related transaction costs, and (vii) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, transaction bonus) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.

FORGE GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION KEY OPERATING METRICS (In thousands of U.S. dollars) Key Business Metrics We monitor the following key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions. The tables below reflect period-over-period changes in our key business metrics, along with the percentage change between such periods. We believe the following business metrics are useful in evaluating our business: Three Months Ended Dollars in thousands December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 Change % Change TRADING BUSINESS Trades 435 567 (132 ) (23 )% Volume $ 250,414 $ 234,141 $ 16,273 7 % Net Take Rate 3.2 % 3.0 % 0.2 % 7 % Marketplace revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 7,971 $ 7,135 $ 836 12 % Year Ended December 31, Dollars in thousands 2023 2022 Change % Change TRADING BUSINESS Trades 1,756 2,184 (428 ) (20 )% Volume $ 765,899 $ 1,222,879 $ (456,980 ) (37 )% Net Take Rate 3.3 % 3.3 % — % — % Marketplace revenues, less transaction-based expenses $ 25,359 $ 40,182 $ (14,823 ) (37 )% Trades are defined as the total number of orders executed by us and entities we have acquired buying and selling private stocks on behalf of private investors and shareholders. Increasing the number of orders is critical to increasing our revenue and, in turn, to achieving profitability. Volume is defined as the total sales value for all securities traded through our Forge Markets platform, which is the aggregate value of the issuer company’s equity attributed to both the buyer and seller in a trade and as such a $100 trade of equity between buyer and seller would be captured as $200 volume for us. Although we typically capture a commission on each side of a trade, we may not in certain cases due to factors such as the use of a third-party broker by one of the parties or supply factors that would not allow us to attract sellers of shares of certain issuers. Volume is influenced by, among other things, the pricing and quality of our services as well as market conditions that affect private company valuations, such as increases in valuations of comparable companies at IPO. Net Take Rates are defined as our marketplace revenues (previously called placement fee revenue), less transaction-based expenses (defined below), divided by Volume. These represent the percentage of fees earned by our marketplace on any transactions executed from the commission we charged on such transactions (less transaction-based expenses), which is a determining factor in our revenue. The Net Take Rate can vary based upon the service or product offering and is also affected by the average order size and transaction frequency. Transaction-based expenses represent fees incurred to support marketplace activities. These include, but are not limited to, those for fund management, fund and trade settlement, external broker fees and transfer fees.

These relate to our Custodial Administration fees revenue stream and are an important measure of our business as the number of Total Custodial Accounts is an indicator of our future revenues from certain account maintenance, transaction and sub-account fees. Assets Under Custody is the reported value of all client holdings held under our agreements, including cash submitted to us by the responsible party. These assets can be held at various financial institutions, issuers and in our vault. As the custodian of the accounts, we collect all interest and dividends, handle all fees and transactions and any other considerations for the assets concerned. Our fees are earned from the overall maintenance activities of all assets and are not charged on the basis of the dollar value of Assets Under Custody, but we believe that Assets Under Custody is a useful metric for assessing the relative size and scope of our business.

(STKS) acquires Safflower Holdings Corp., owner of Benihana Inc., for $365 million, adding $514 million in revenue and $70 million in EBITDA. The deal is expected to be accretive to diluted earnings per share and generate significant free cash flow for debt reduction and shareholder value. The combined business will have 168 venues, aiming to realize $20 million in synergies annually post-closing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of Benihana by The ONE Group represents a significant consolidation within the restaurant industry, creating a combined entity with a substantial increase in venue count, revenue and EBITDA. The financing structure, involving both preferred equity and a sizable term loan, indicates a strategic approach to capital allocation that balances equity dilution and leverage. The expected synergies, although taking 24 months to realize, suggest operational efficiency gains that could bolster profitability.From a financial perspective, the increase in net debt to $295 million raises questions about the leverage ratio and interest coverage capacity post-acquisition. Investors should assess the company's ability to service this debt, especially in a potentially rising interest rate environment. Additionally, the transaction's claim of being immediately accretive to earnings per diluted share warrants scrutiny to ensure it accounts for the full cost of capital, including preferred dividends. Market Research Analyst The strategic acquisition of Benihana is poised to diversify The ONE Group's portfolio, potentially strengthening its market position against competitors. Benihana's unique teppanyaki and sushi offerings complement The ONE Group's existing experiential dining concepts, which could appeal to a broader consumer base. However, the integration of distinct corporate cultures and customer service models will be a critical factor in realizing the projected $20 million in annual synergies.Market trends show a growing consumer interest in experiential dining, which this acquisition capitalizes on. Yet, the success of the integration will largely depend on the execution of a cohesive brand strategy and maintaining the individual identities of the acquired brands, which command strong customer loyalty. The expanded geographic footprint also presents opportunities for cross-promotion and market penetration but comes with the challenge of managing a more complex operation. M&A Legal Advisor From a legal standpoint, the transaction between The ONE Group and Benihana involves customary closing conditions, which typically include regulatory approvals and other due diligence matters. The involvement of multiple legal advisors suggests a complex deal structure, possibly involving intricate negotiations around representations, warranties and indemnifications, which are standard in such transactions.Investors should pay attention to any regulatory hurdles that could delay or impact the deal's closing. Additionally, the post-acquisition integration process will require careful legal oversight to ensure compliance with employment laws, intellectual property rights and contractual obligations with franchisees and licensors. The legal complexities of integrating two large businesses should not be underestimated, as they can have significant implications for the projected timeline and cost synergies. 03/26/2024 - 04:10 PM Creates a scaled platform and further enables The ONE Group to diversify and strengthen its industry leading portfolio of world-class, experiential restaurant concepts Transaction adds $514 million in trailing twelve months revenue and significant incremental annualized EBITDA Combined business will generate meaningful free cash flow enabling debt reduction and shareholder friendly capital allocation to drive long-term value for shareholders Expected to be accretive to diluted earnings per share Conference call and webcast to discuss the transaction to be held later today at 5:00 PM ET on Tuesday, March 26th DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ONE Group Hospitality, Inc. (“The ONE Group” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: STKS), today announced it will acquire Safflower Holdings Corp., the owner of Benihana Inc. (“Benihana”), a leading operator of highly differentiated experiential brands that owns the only national teppanyaki brand in the U.S. and owns RA Sushi. The transaction is valued at $365 million and will be financed with $160 million in preferred equity and a portion of a new $390 million term loan and credit facility. Upon closing of the transaction, which is expected by the end of the second quarter of 2024, The ONE Group will have a global footprint of 168 venues, across full-service entertainment and grill restaurants across its four distinctive experiential, and complementary brands. Founded in 1964, Benihana has a tremendous legacy in the U.S. as it pioneered two unique, complementary restaurant brands focusing on providing high-quality food and unparalleled guest service. Its flagship brand, BENIHANA®, is a category-defining brand and American cultural icon that pioneered interactive teppanyaki dining in the U.S. Benihana’s RA SUSHI® predicates itself on delivering creative sushi and Japanese dishes in a bar-forward, upbeat, and vibrant dining atmosphere and fun-filled, high-energy environment.

Once closed, the acquisition is expected to add approximately $575 million in annualized system-wide revenue and approximately $70 million in annual run-rate EBITDA before synergies, which are estimated to be $20 million annually. The Company expects that it will take 24 months to realize synergies post-closing. This is expected to bring the Company’s pro forma annualized run-rate EBITDA with synergies to more than $135 million. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings per diluted share. “We are delighted to welcome Benihana, an American cultural icon with timeless appeal that transcends generations and offers unparalleled guest experiences, to The ONE Group family,” said Emanuel “Manny” Hilario, President and CEO of The ONE Group. “The strategic acquisition of a one-of-a-kind restaurant platform with a compelling financial profile supports our broader strategy to fortify and diversify our leading portfolio of best-in-class experiential VIBE restaurant concepts.

The Company intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and ongoing investment activities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of Stevanato Group's upsized public offering, including the full exercise of the underwriters' option, signifies a robust market interest in the company's equity. The offering's success, marked by the sale of 14,605,000 ordinary shares at $26.00 each, is indicative of investor confidence and a positive valuation of the company's prospects. The gross proceeds of approximately $379.7 million are substantial for Stevanato Group, potentially bolstering its balance sheet and providing liquidity for future investment activities.From an investor's perspective, the dual nature of the offering—split between the company and a major shareholder—provides insights into ownership dilution and capital allocation. While the company's proceeds are earmarked for general corporate purposes and strategic flexibility, the fact that Stevanato Group will not benefit from the selling shareholder's proceeds is noteworthy. Investors might be interested in how this capital injection could accelerate Stevanato's growth trajectory, particularly in its investment activities and working capital needs within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Market Research Analyst Stevanato Group operates within the pharmaceutical and life sciences sectors, providing critical solutions for drug containment and delivery. The successful offering suggests a favorable market perception of the industry's growth potential, driven by rising demand for biopharmaceuticals and advanced diagnostic solutions. It's important to assess the competitive landscape and how Stevanato's capital raise positions it against peers.Investors may find value in understanding the strategic implications of Stevanato's funding allocation. The capital raise could enable Stevanato to invest in R&D, expand its product portfolio and enhance its global footprint. This could lead to market share gains and strengthened customer relationships in the long run, although it may also bring about near-term financial pressures associated with increased spending. Legal Expert The offering's execution under an automatic shelf registration statement on Form F-3, which was declared effective by the SEC, underscores the regulatory compliance and preparedness of Stevanato Group. The ability to quickly mobilize capital through such a mechanism is a strategic advantage that allows the company to act swiftly in response to market conditions and investment opportunities.Investors should be aware of the legal nuances, such as the implications of securities laws on the sale and distribution of shares. The statement that the sale would not proceed in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws emphasizes the importance of adhering to regulatory frameworks, which can impact the timing and scope of such offerings. 03/26/2024 - 04:10 PM PIOMBINO DESE, Italy--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stevanato Group S.p.A.

The company plans to use the proceeds for research, clinical development, manufacturing of product candidates, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative The offering is subject to market conditions, and there is no guarantee of completion or the final size and terms of the offering. Financial Analyst Stoke Therapeutics' announcement of a proposed underwritten public offering to raise up to $75 million is a significant move for the company, signaling both a need for capital and a confidence in its potential growth. The offering's success hinges on market conditions and investor appetite for biotech stocks, which can be volatile. The additional 15% option for underwriters is a common practice, providing flexibility to manage over-allotments and stabilize the stock price post-offering.The funds are earmarked for research and development, particularly for STK-001 and STK-002, which could be transformative for the company if successful. Investors should note, however, that biotech investments are high-risk due to the long development cycles and regulatory hurdles inherent in bringing new drugs to market. The impact on the stock will depend on the market's interpretation of the offering as a growth opportunity versus a dilution of existing shares. Biotech Market Analyst In the biotech industry, raising capital through public offerings is a common strategy to fund expensive and lengthy R&D processes. Stoke Therapeutics' focus on RNA-based medicines for severe diseases is a cutting-edge area with significant potential. The market's response to this offering will reflect the current sentiment towards biotech investments and Stoke's specific prospects.Investors should consider the competitive landscape and the regulatory environment, as these factors will influence Stoke's ability to successfully bring its product candidates to market. The mention of 'late-stage development' of their products could indicate upcoming milestones which may catalyze the company's valuation if they are positive. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials mean that setbacks could adversely affect the stock value. Securities Law Expert From a legal perspective, Stoke's compliance with SEC regulations, including the use of a Form S-3 registration statement, is a routine part of conducting such offerings. The effectiveness of the registration statement and the role of J.P. Morgan Securities as the sole book-running manager indicate a standard, structured approach to capital raising. Prospective investors should review the prospectus supplement for details on the risks and specifics of the offering.It's important to highlight that the legal disclaimer in the announcement is a precautionary measure to ensure that the offering is not misconstrued as an immediate sale, which would be subject to specific regulatory requirements and restrictions. Potential investors must be aware of the legal implications of investing in securities and the conditions that govern such transactions. 03/26/2024 - 04:07 PM BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stoke Therapeutics, Inc.

About Stoke Therapeutics Stoke Therapeutics (Nasdaq: STOK), is a biotechnology company dedicated to addressing the underlying cause of severe diseases by upregulating protein expression with RNA-based medicines. Using Stoke’s proprietary TANGO (Targeted Augmentation of Nuclear Gene Output) approach, Stoke is developing antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to selectively restore protein levels. Stoke’s first compound, STK-001, is in clinical testing for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a severe and progressive genetic epilepsy. Dravet syndrome is one of many diseases caused by a haploinsufficiency, in which a loss of ~50% of normal protein levels leads to disease. Stoke is pursuing the development of STK-002 for the treatment of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA), the most common inherited optic nerve disorder. Stoke’s initial focus is haploinsufficiencies and diseases of the central nervous system and the eye, although proof of concept has been demonstrated in other organs, tissues, and systems, supporting its belief in the broad potential for its proprietary approach. Stoke is headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Progress sees MariaDB's RDBMS products as valuable, aligning with its expertise and customer-centric approach. The announcement reflects Progress's intent to engage with MariaDB's Board for due diligence and a potential firm offer, emphasizing stakeholder interests. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Progress Software Corp. regarding a potential acquisition of MariaDB plc is a significant development in the software industry, particularly within the database management sector. The premium offered over MariaDB's average closing share price suggests a strategic move by Progress to consolidate its position in the market.From a market perspective, the acquisition could lead to synergies between Progress's existing infrastructure software products and MariaDB's relational database management systems. The emphasis on MariaDB's open-source platform aligns with current industry trends towards open-source solutions, which can be more cost-effective and flexible than proprietary systems.The potential acquisition could enhance Progress's product offerings and market reach, potentially leading to increased revenue streams and a stronger competitive stance. However, the premium offered also indicates that Progress views MariaDB's technology and customer base as highly valuable assets, which could impact Progress's financials in the short term due to the acquisition cost. Financial Analyst The possible offer by Progress Software Corp. to acquire MariaDB at a significant premium suggests a confident outlook by Progress on the value MariaDB will add to its portfolio. The 216% premium over the closing share price before the forbearance agreement announcement indicates a robust valuation, which could influence investor sentiment and stock market dynamics for both companies.Investors will be analyzing the potential for earnings growth, cost synergies and the strategic fit between the companies' products. Progress's net retention rates and its capacity to deploy over $1 billion for acquisitions provide a strong financial foundation for the deal. However, investors will also be cautious about the integration risks and the potential for dilution of Progress's earnings if the acquisition does not yield the expected benefits.It is also noteworthy that the acquisition is not yet confirmed and such announcements can lead to volatility in the stock prices of the companies involved. The stipulated deadline for a firm offer adds a time-sensitive dimension to the deal, which could influence trading behavior in the short term. Mergers and Acquisitions Legal Expert The announcement falls under Rule 2.4 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act, indicating a preliminary stage in the acquisition process. The legal framework governing the potential transaction is critical for ensuring compliance with the relevant takeover rules and providing a structured timeline for the offer to be formalized or withdrawn.The conditions under which Progress Software may amend the terms of the offer, including the possible reduction of the offer consideration, reflect the legal complexities and the need for due diligence. The legal stipulations also provide safeguards for MariaDB shareholders, ensuring that any change in the terms of the offer is made with their interests in mind.The legal process will involve careful scrutiny of the terms of the deal, potential regulatory hurdles and the implications for shareholders of both companies. The outcome of this process will have material implications for the market, as it will determine the structure and success of the potential acquisition. 03/26/2024 - 04:10 PM POSSIBLE OFFER (RULE 2.4 ANNOUNCEMENT) NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OF SUCH JURISDICTION.

The report can be accessed on the company's website, EDGAR, and SEDAR+. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The filing of Greenfire Resources Ltd.'s annual report on Form 20-F is a significant disclosure, providing investors with essential information regarding the company's performance and reserve evaluations. The independent evaluation of bitumen reserves is particularly noteworthy, as it offers insights into the company's asset quality and potential future revenue streams. In the energy sector, reserves are a key indicator of a company's long-term viability and are closely monitored by investors.From a financial perspective, the reserves' valuation is based on SEC standards and pricing, which ensures a level of consistency and comparability with other entities in the industry. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the company's market position and growth prospects. The disclosed oil and gas information could influence the company's stock performance, as it directly relates to its core business operations and potential for expansion within the thermal energy market. Market Research Analyst In analyzing the market implications of Greenfire Resources Ltd.'s annual report, it is important to consider the broader industry trends. The energy market, particularly in the sustainable and thermal energy segments, is subject to volatile pricing and regulatory changes. The disclosure of bitumen reserves in compliance with SEC standards provides transparency and may affect investor confidence positively, depending on the reported quantities and projected extraction costs.Additionally, the availability of the report on multiple platforms, including the company's website, EDGAR and SEDAR+, ensures broad accessibility for stakeholders. This transparency can often lead to increased investor trust and could potentially attract new investors seeking opportunities in the sustainable energy sector. The long-term impact on the company's stock will depend on how the disclosed information aligns with market expectations and the company's strategic initiatives to capitalize on its reserves. Compliance Officer Filing an annual report on Form 20-F is not only a regulatory requirement for foreign companies listed in the U.S. but also an exercise in demonstrating a company's commitment to regulatory compliance and transparency. The inclusion of independently evaluated reserves information is critical, as it adheres to SEC standards, which are stringent and designed to protect investors by providing a clear picture of a company's assets.For Greenfire Resources Ltd., compliance with these standards may mitigate risks associated with governance and enhance its reputation among investors who are increasingly conscious of corporate governance practices. The long-term implications for the business could include more favorable terms in future financing and partnerships, as well as a potentially more stable stock price, assuming that the reported data meets or exceeds market expectations. 03/26/2024 - 06:37 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 26, 2024) - Greenfire Resources Ltd.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/26/2024 - 06:51 PM Powerful PSA featuring former Bucs linebacker Shelton Quarles raises awareness across Florida TAMPA, Fla., March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- As Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month continues throughout March, Ambetter from Sunshine Health and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are teaming up to spread awareness about colorectal cancer by unveiling a powerful public service announcement (PSA). The video featuring Shelton Quarles, Buccaneers Director of Football Operations and former Super Bowl-winning linebacker for the team, is aimed at raising awareness about the importance of preventive screenings. The PSA, titled ""Don't Sideline Your Colon Health,"" serves as a reminder to Floridians about the significance of early detection and prevention in saving lives. Through this joint effort, Ambetter from Sunshine Health and the Buccaneers are committed to sharing vital health information that has the potential to make a profound impact in the fight against colorectal cancer. ""In my last season playing for the Bucs, the team doctor advised me to get a colonoscopy during a routine physical based on some warning signs,"" said Quarles. ""Listening to my doctor and getting that screening saved my life. They found I had a progressive form of colorectal cancer that they were able to successfully remove because it was caught early. As a survivor, I want to encourage everyone to do everything they can to lower their risk."" Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States in both men and women. According to the American Cancer Society, over 150,000 cases of colorectal cancer will be diagnosed in 2024, with approximately 53,000 deaths attributed to the disease. Additionally, colorectal cancer disproportionately affects Black Americans, who are 20% more likely to get colorectal cancer and about 40% more likely to die from it than other groups. However, research has shown that regular screenings, maintaining a healthy weight and balanced diet, and staying physically active can help lower your risk. ""We are grateful for the Buccaneers partnership, which allows us to amplify our message and expand our reach to individuals who may not have been aware of the importance of colorectal cancer screenings,"" said Nathan Landsbaum, CEO of Sunshine Health. ""Together, we are empowering Floridians to take control of their health and prioritize preventive care."" The PSA encourages viewers to educate themselves about the risk factors associated with colorectal cancer and to speak with their health care providers about appropriate screening options.

The Company plans to utilize the funds for general corporate purposes, research and development, and working capital, extending its cash runway through fiscal year 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal announced by iBio, Inc. is a significant financial event, indicating investor confidence and providing the company with a substantial cash infusion of approximately $15.0 million. The premium of 148+% on the purchase price above the last close price reflects a strong belief in the company's future prospects by the participating investors. This capital raise is a strategic move to strengthen the company's balance sheet, providing the necessary funds for research and development, which is critical for a company specializing in precision antibody immunotherapies.Investors should note the expectation set by iBio that the proceeds will extend its cash runway through the fiscal year 2025. This suggests a reduced risk of near-term liquidity concerns and provides a clearer financial horizon for the company's operations. However, the impact of the dilution on existing shareholders cannot be overlooked, as the issuance of additional shares may lead to a decrease in earnings per share and potentially affect the stock price in the short term.Furthermore, the involvement of specialized healthcare investors such as ADAR1 Capital Management and Ikarian Capital could be seen as a vote of confidence in iBio's AI-driven approach to drug development. The conversion terms of the warrants, with an exercise price set at $2.64, will be a point of interest for investors, as it may represent future share price expectations by the market. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the PIPE financing arrangement by iBio, Inc. is structured under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, which allows for the sale of securities without a public offering. This is a common route for companies looking to raise capital quickly and with more flexibility compared to traditional public offerings. The fact that the securities were offered only to accredited investors is also noteworthy, as it limits the pool of potential investors but typically involves parties that are more sophisticated and capable of taking on higher risks.The company's commitment to file one or more registration statements with the SEC for the resale of the unregistered shares suggests a proactive approach to regulatory compliance. This move will ultimately provide liquidity to the investors by allowing them to sell their shares in the open market once the registration is complete. However, the timing and success of these filings will be critical, as delays or issues could affect the investors' ability to resell their securities and impact market perception. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications of iBio's PIPE deal, it is important to recognize the role of AI and machine learning in the biotechnology sector. iBio's emphasis on leveraging AI for drug development is in line with industry trends towards more data-driven and precision approaches to therapy discovery. The market is generally responsive to biotech firms that innovate in this space, often rewarding them with higher valuations, as evidenced by the premium price of the PIPE deal.However, the market will be closely monitoring the deployment of the raised capital towards R&D efforts and the resulting pipeline developments. Investors typically expect a clear roadmap and timely updates on progress in drug development, which can have material effects on the company's stock performance. Additionally, the competitive landscape of antibody immunotherapies is fierce and iBio's ability to differentiate itself and deliver on its promises will be important for sustained investor interest and market performance. 03/26/2024 - 07:35 PM – Purchase price of $2.85 represents a premium of 148+% to last close – BRYAN, Texas and SAN DIEGO, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iBio, Inc.

Metal prices used to estimate mineral reserves and mineral resources have increased by $100/oz for Au, $2.00/oz for Ag and $0.25/lb for Cu relative to year-end 2022, reflecting continued strength in underlying metal prices. These prices are in line with the mid-point of metal prices used by precious metal peers.Jody Kuzenko, President & CEO of Torex, stated:""A key strategic focus for Torex is to grow reserves and resources and our 2023 drilling program was very successful in this regard. The results delivered in 2023 continue to bolster confidence that we will achieve our goal to maintain annual AuEq production of more than 450,000 ounces (""oz"") beyond 2027 and extend the overall life of our Morelos assets well beyond 2033.""At ELG Underground, Proven and Probable reserves increased to 654 koz AuEq, which now sees us with a reserve life out to late 2028. Measured and Indicated resources expanded by 432 koz AuEq (570 koz AuEq prior to mined depletion), while Inferred resources increased by 119 koz AuEq. Resource growth was a direct result of successful drilling as well as the assumption of a lower cut-off grade, reflecting higher metal price assumptions and lower costs due to steady increases in underground mining rates.""At EPO, infill drilling was successful in upgrading Inferred resources, while step-out drilling expanded the overall mineralized footprint. Indicated resources increased by 481 koz AuEq to 1,153 koz at year end, surpassing even our aggressive target of one million AuEq ounces. The updated resource will form the basis of an internal prefeasibility study to be completed in the second half of 2024. ""Our strategy to grow reserves and resources has been supported with meaningful investment, with an average of $31 million invested annually for each of the last 3 years, reflecting the strategic pivot towards drilling made in 2020. Since releasing the March 2022 Technical Report, we have increased our Measured and Indicated resource1 base by 1,979 koz AuEq (prior to mined depletion) over the last two years and strengthened the production profile by increasing our Proven and Probable reserves by 719 koz AuEq (prior to processed depletion) over the same period. The ongoing success demonstrates the significant mineral endowment at Morelos and the potential to generate significant shareholder value from Morelos far into the future.""Detailed breakdowns of mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates can be found in Table 7 and Table 8 of this press release. The detailed breakdowns include tonnes, grade, and contained metal estimates by metal as well as notes accompanying the applicable mineral reserve and resource estimates.1) Measured and Indicated resources are reported inclusive of Proven and Probable reserves.

Ore processed (depletion) in 2023 on a AuEq basis assumes respective based on prices and recoveries used at year-end 2022.Year-end mineral reserves and year-over-year variance (2023 versus 2022) subject to rounding.During 2023, 67% of the 526 koz AuEq depleted (processed) was replaced, driven by drilling success (gain of 148 koz), block model updates (gain of 105 koz), lower cut-off grade in ELG Underground (gain of 86 koz), and other changes (gain of 11 koz).The decline in ELG Open Pits primarily reflects depletion (389 koz AuEq) partially offset by optimizations carried out to the block model during 2023.At ELG Underground, Proven and Probable reserves increased 146 koz AuEq net of depletion of 134 koz AuEq (280 koz prior to depletion), with 129 koz added through drilling, 86 koz added via a lower cut-off grade (reflecting higher metal prices and lower unit costs), and 65 koz added through block model optimizations.At Media Luna, Proven and Probable reserves primarily reflect changes to Measured and Indicated resources delivered during 2022 as these results were not available to be incorporated into the year-end 2022 update. Modestly higher tonnes at modestly lower Au, Ag, and Cu grades reflect the conversion of Probable reserves to the Proven category (following resources upgraded to the Measured category during 2022), refinements to the block model carried out during 2023, and the benefit of additional Probable reserves (reflecting resources upgraded to the Indicated category during 2022). The impact of these changes on a AuEq basis was offset by the higher relative contribution of Cu and Ag on AuEq reserves given higher metal prices used for Cu (+8%) and Ag (+12%) relative to the higher price used for Au (+7%).Metal prices used in the estimation of mineral reserves have increased relative to year-end 2022. Higher metallurgical recoveries for ELG Underground reflect the increased proportion of reserves to be processed through the upgraded processing plant starting in late 2024 relative to the proportion anticipated at year-end 2022, including improved Cu and Ag recoveries due to the installation of copper and iron sulfide flotation circuits as part of the Media Luna Project.Table 3: Metal price and metallurgical recovery assumptions used in the estimation of mineral reservesMineral ReservesDecember 31, 2023December 31, 2022VarianceAuAgCuAuAgCuAuAgCuMetal Prices($/oz)($/oz)($/lb)($/oz)($/oz)($/lb)($/oz)($/oz)($/lb)Media Luna Underground$1,500$19.00$3.50$1,400$17.00$3.25$100$2.00$0.25ELG Underground$1,500$19.00$3.50$1,400$17.00$3.25$100$2.00$0.25ELG Open Pit$1,500$19.00$3.50$1,400$17.00$3.25$100$2.00$0.25Surface Stockpiles$1,500$19.00$3.50$1,400$17.00$3.25$100$2.00$0.25Metallurgical Recoveries(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)(%)Media Luna Underground90%86%93%85%79%91%5%7%2%ELG Underground90%86%93%90%62%63%-24%30%ELG Open Pit89%30%15%89%30%23%--(8%)Surface Stockpiles89%30%15%89%30%23%--(8%) The impact of updated AuEq formulas on AuEq values (incorporating higher metal prices and updated metallurgical recoveries) on Proven and Probable reserves is negligible when comparing year-end Au, Ag, and Cu reserves assuming the AuEq formulas used at year-end 2022.MEASURED & INDICATED MINERAL RESOURCESMeasured and Indicated mineral resources are estimated at 7,828 koz AuEq at an average grade of 5.00 gpt, representing a 5% increase relative to the 7,468 koz AuEq at 4.86 gpt at year-end 2022.

Measured and Indicated resources specific to Media Luna declined 51 koz AuEq, reflecting refined geological interpretation related to dykes encountered during underground development. Infill drilling at EPO was successful in further expanding the mineral endowment with infill drilling increasing Indicated resources to 1,153 koz AuEq at a grade of 5.14 gpt compared to 671 koz AuEq at 5.16 gpt at year-end 2022. The updated resource, which surpassed the Company's target of one million AuEq ounces, will form the basis of an internal prefeasibility study to be completed in the second half of 2024.The increase in Au, Ag, and Cu prices used to estimate mineral resources mirrors the increase in metal prices used to estimate mineral reserves year-over-year.

The impact of updated AuEq formulas on AuEq values (incorporating higher metal prices and updated metallurgical recoveries) on Inferred resources is minimal and estimated at 12 koz AuEq when comparing year-end Au, Ag, and Cu resources assuming the AuEq formulas used at year-end 2022. The impact was most noticeable at EPO given higher metallurgical recoveries for Ag and Cu relative to Au.QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL Torex maintains an industry-standard analytical quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) and data verification program to monitor laboratory performance and to ensure high quality assay results.

Looking ahead to 2024, Paysign anticipates continued growth in all business units, especially in patient affordability solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported growth in total revenues and net income for the full year 2023 indicates a positive performance for Paysign, Inc., which seems to be driven by strategic expansions in both plasma center operations and pharma patient affordability programs. The 24% increase in total revenues and a significant rise in net income from $1.0 million to $6.5 million reflect a strong operational year. The uptick in Adjusted EBITDA by 21% also suggests effective cost management despite the increase in cost of revenues by 35%.An important aspect to consider is the company's zero-debt status coupled with an increase in unrestricted cash to $17.0 million, which may provide financial flexibility and resilience against market volatility. Furthermore, the repurchase of shares could be seen as a sign of confidence in the company's future by its management. However, investors should be mindful of the gross profit margin decrease, which may signal rising costs or pricing pressure in the business segments. Market Research Analyst The expansion of the plasma center count by 20 and the launch of new patient affordability programs have been pivotal in driving revenue growth, particularly in the plasma and pharma segments. Notably, the plasma segment now holds approximately 39% market share in the U.S., which is a substantial footprint. The 172% increase in pharma patient affordability revenue is indicative of successful penetration and adoption of these programs within the pharmaceutical industry.It is also noteworthy that the company anticipates continued growth in the pharma patient affordability business, expecting triple-digit growth. This optimism is grounded in the robust pipeline and strategic leveraging of disruptions in the pharmaceutical payments space. The focus on this segment could be a strategic move to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependency on the plasma business, which currently makes up a significant portion of total revenue. Economist The financial results of Paysign, Inc. reflect broader economic trends, such as the impact of wage inflation pressures on customer service expenses. The company's ability to increase its net income in the face of rising costs suggests effective operational leverage and the potential for scalable growth. The reported increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances and interest rates also highlights the impact of the macroeconomic environment on corporate earnings.Looking ahead, the forecast for continued revenue growth in 2024, with plasma and pharma segments as key drivers, suggests confidence in the underlying market demand for these services. However, the company's forward-looking statements regarding expected revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth should be considered in the context of economic conditions, including interest rate movements and labor market tightness, which could affect operational costs and consumer spending patterns. 03/26/2024 - 05:15 PM For the Full YearFull-year 2023 total revenues of $47.3 million, up 24% from full-year 2022Full-year 2023 net income of $6.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.12, versus net income of $1.0 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.02 for full-year 2022Full-year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, up 21% from $5.5 million a year ago, while diluted Adjusted EBITDA per share was $0.12 versus $0.10 for full-year 20221Total plasma center count increased by 20 during 2023, exiting the year with 464 centers, contributing to a 21% increase in plasma revenue versus the same period last yearLaunched 24 net new patient affordability programs during 2023, exiting the year with 43 active programs, leading to a 35% increase in pharma revenue and a 172% increase in pharma patient affordability revenue over the same period last yearExited the year with $17.0 million of unrestricted cash and zero debt while repurchasing 394,558 shares of common stock for $1.1 millionFull-year 2023 gross dollar load volume was up 7% over 2022Full-year 2023 gross spend volume was up 10% over 2022For the Fourth QuarterFourth quarter 2023 total revenues of $13.7 million, up 29% from fourth quarter 2022Fourth quarter 2023 net income of $5.6 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.10Fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million, up 43% from $1.7 million a year ago, while diluted Adjusted EBITDA per share was $0.05 versus $0.03 for the fourth quarter 20221Added two net new plasma donation centers during the fourth quarter of 2023, exiting the quarter with 464 centers, helping contribute to a 19% increase in plasma revenue over the same period last yearLaunched nine net new patient affordability programs during the fourth quarter of 2023, exiting the quarter with 43 active programs, leading to a 132% increase in pharma revenue and a 247% increase in pharma patient affordability revenue over the same period last yearFourth quarter 2023 gross dollar load volume up 9% versus the year-ago periodFourth quarter 2023 gross spend volume was up 8% versus the year-ago periodFourth quarter 2023 average revenue per plasma center per month of $8,297, up 14%, versus $7,293 for the fourth quarter of 20221Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-GAAP metrics used by management to gauge the operating performance of the business - see reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA at the end of the press release.HENDERSON, NV / ACCESSWIRE / March 26, 2024 / Paysign, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYS), a leading provider of prepaid card programs, comprehensive patient affordability offerings, digital banking services and integrated payment processing, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2023.""We are exceptionally pleased with our financial performance in 2023, as it marked a year of continued strong growth for our company. Our year-over-year revenue grew by 24%, and our adjusted EBITDA increased by 21%. Notably, plasma revenue also grew by 21%. Additionally, our patient affordability business has emerged as a significant growth driver, experiencing an impressive 172% revenue growth,"" stated Mark Newcomer, President & CEO of Paysign. ""Looking ahead to the current year, we anticipate continued upward trajectory across all our business units. Our patient affordability business in particular, is poised for triple-digit year-over-year growth. Our patient affordability solutions have gained traction among major players in the pharmaceutical industry, and our robust pipeline positions us well for the future. We are strategically leveraging recent disruptions in the pharmaceutical payments space to our advantage. Our unwavering commitment to sustainable top and bottom-line growth remains steadfast. We firmly believe that our ongoing investments in this business unit will play a pivotal role in delivering long-term shareholder value.""2023 Full-Year ResultsThe following additional details are provided to aid in understanding Paysign's full-year 2023 results versus full-year 2022:·Total revenues increased 24%, or $9.2 million. The increase was attributable to the following factors: oPlasma revenue increased $7.2 million, or 21%, primarily due to an increase in plasma locations, plasma donations and dollars loaded to cards. Total plasma center count increased by 20, exiting the year with 464 centers. oPharma revenue increased $1 million, or 35%, as we exited our pharma prepaid business in 2022 and expanded our pharma patient affordability reach in 2023. oPharma patient affordability revenue increased $2.5 million, or 172%, primarily due to the growth and launch of new pharma patient affordability programs. We added 24 net new patient affordability programs throughout the year, exiting with 43 active programs. oOther revenue increased by $1 million, or 340%, primarily due to the growth in our payroll business and the growth and launch of new prepaid disbursement programs. Cost of revenues increased 35%, or $6.1 million. Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing fees, data connectivity, data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, postage costs, customer service, program management, application integration setup and sales and commission expense. The year-over-year increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to an increase in cardholder usage activity and associated network expenses such as interchange and ATM costs, an increase in plastics and collateral related to an increase in the number of unique card loads, an increase in network expenses and sales commissions related to the growth in our pharma patient affordability business, an increase in customer service expenses associated with wage inflation pressures and the overall growth in our business. Gross profit increased by $3.2 million, or 15%, primarily due to increased plasma and pharma patient affordability revenue, offset by a decline in our legacy pharma prepaid revenue which concluded November 2022. Our gross profit margin decreased to 51.1% versus 55.1% in the prior year primarily due to the decline in our pharma prepaid business and increased cost of revenues mentioned above. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.6 million, or 15%, and consisted primarily of increases in (i) compensation, payroll taxes and benefits of $3.0 million due to continued hiring to support the company's growth, a tight labor market and increased employee benefit costs, (ii) stock-based compensation expense of approximately $576 thousand, (iii) technologies and telecom of approximately $345 thousand, (iv) non-IT professional services of approximately $140 thousand (v) and all other operating expenses of approximately $62 thousand. This was offset by a $1.6 million increase in the amount of capitalized software development costs mostly pertaining to salary and benefit expense. We exited the year with 123 employees versus 110 employees at the end of the same period last year. Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.1 million, or 38%, due mainly to the continued capitalization of new software development costs and equipment purchases related to the enhancement to our processing platform. Other income increased by $1.7 million primarily related to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.1 million due to the release of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to both federal and state taxes. This valuation allowance was released, as it is more-likely-than-not that income in future periods will be sufficient to support the realization of all deferred tax assets. Net income of $6.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, improved by $5.4 million compared to net income of $1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, during the same period last year. The overall change in net income relates to the factors mentioned above. ""EBITDA,"" defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which is a non-GAAP metric, increased by $605 thousand, or 19%, to $3.9 million due to the factors mentioned above. ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" which excludes stock-based compensation from EBITDA, and which is a non-GAAP metric used by management to gauge the operating performance of the business, increased by $1.2 million, or 21%, to $6.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, due to the factors mentioned above.Quarterly ResultsThe following additional details are provided to aid in understanding Paysign's fourth quarter 2023 results versus the year-ago period: Total revenues increased 29%, or $3.1 million. The increase was attributable to the following factors: oPlasma revenue increased $1.8 million, or 19%, primarily due to an increase in plasma locations, plasma donations and dollars loaded with average monthly revenue per center up 14.0% to $8,297 versus $7,293 in the year-ago period. oPharma revenue increased $972 thousand, or 132%, primarily due to the growth and launch of new pharma patient affordability programs. oPharma patient affordability revenue increased $1.2 million, or 247%. oOther revenue increased by $291 thousand, or 165%, primarily due to the growth in our payroll business and the growth and launch of new prepaid disbursement programs. Cost of revenues increased 28%, or $1.4 million. Cost of revenues is comprised of transaction processing fees, data connectivity, data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, postage costs, customer service, program management, application integration setup and sales and commission expense. The fourth quarter increase in cost of revenues when compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to an increase in cardholder usage activity and associated network expenses such as interchange and ATM costs, an increase in plastics and collateral related to an increase in the number of unique card loads, an increase in network expenses and sales commissions related to the growth in our pharma patient affordability business, an increase in customer service expenses associated with wage inflation pressures and the overall growth in our business. Gross profit increased by $1.6 million, or 30%, primarily due to increased plasma and pharma patient affordability revenue, offset by a decline in our legacy pharma prepaid revenue which concluded November 2022. Our gross profit margin increased to 52.2% versus 51.9% for the same period in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $913 thousand, or 21%, and consisted primarily of increases in (i) compensation, payroll tax and benefits of approximately $944 thousand due to continued hiring to support the company's growth, a tight labor market and increased employee benefit costs, (ii) stock-based compensation of approximately $41 thousand, (iii) technologies and telecom of approximately $192 thousand, (v) and other operating expenses of approximately $52 thousand. This was offset by a $317 thousand increase in the amount of capitalized software development costs mostly pertaining to salary and benefit expense. Depreciation and amortization increased by $400 thousand, or 51%, due to the continued capitalization of new software development costs and equipment purchases related to the enhancement to our processing platform. Other income increased by $290 thousand primarily related to an increase in interest income resulting from higher average cash balances and higher interest rates. We recorded an income tax benefit of $4.3 million due to the release of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to both federal and state taxes. This valuation allowance was released, as it is more-likely-than-not that income in future periods will be sufficient to support the realization of all deferred tax assets. Net income of $5.6 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, improved by $4.9 million compared to net income of $713 thousand, or $0.01 per diluted share, during the same period last year. The overall change in net income relates to the factors mentioned above. ""EBITDA,"" defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, which is a non-GAAP metric, increased by $717 thousand, or 66%, to $1.8 million due to the factors mentioned above, and was up $175 thousand sequentially from the third quarter of this year. ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" which excludes stock-based compensation from EBITDA, and which is a non-GAAP metric used by management to gauge the operating performance of the business, increased by $759 thousand, or 43%, to $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, due to the factors mentioned above, and was up $160 thousand sequentially from the third quarter of this year.2023 Year Milestones Exited the quarter with approximately 6.4 million cardholders and approximately 600 card programs. Year-over-year revenue increased 24%. Plasma revenue increased 21%. Pharma patient affordability revenue increased 172%. Added 20 net new plasma donation centers, ending the year with 464 centers. Launched 24 net new pharma patient affordability programs, ending the year with 43 active programs. Repurchased 394,558 shares of common stock at a cost of $1.1 million. Unrestricted cash balances increased 75% from December 31, 2022, to $17.0 million while maintaining a current ratio of 1.1x. Restricted cash balances increased 15% from December 31, 2022, to $92.4 million, primarily due to increased funds on cards and growth in customer programs.Balance Sheet at Year-End 2023Unrestricted cash increased $7.3 million to $17.0 million from December 31, 2022, due primarily to our net income of $6.5 million, noncash items of $3.0 million and increases in working capital accounts of $6.1 million. This was primarily offset by fixed assets and capitalized software development of $7.0 million and the repurchase of 394,558 shares of our common stock for $1.1 million. Restricted cash of $92.0 million are funds used for customer card funding with a corresponding offset under current liabilities. This balance increased $12.2 million from December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in funds on card balances of $4.4 million and customer deposits for our plasma and pharma customers of $15.8 million, offset by the termination of our pharma prepaid business where we returned program funds of over $8.0 million.2024 Outlook""We delivered solid fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results, meeting or exceeding our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance that we laid out over a year ago. Revenue for the year increased 24% to $47.3 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $6.7 million. We exited the year with 464 plasma centers, representing approximately 39% market share in the United States, and 43 pharma patient affordability programs, more than double the number of programs we had at the end of 2022. Our decision five years ago to invest in our pharma patient affordability business as another growth engine is paying off and we expect that momentum to continue throughout 2024,"" said Jeff Baker, Paysign CFO.""For the full-year 2024, we expect total revenues to be in the range of $54.5 million to $56.7 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% to 20%, with plasma making up between 80% to 85% of total revenue. Pharma revenue is expected to grow at least 100% year-over-year as we receive a full-year benefit for all pharma patient affordability programs added in 2023 and continue to add new pharma patient affordability programs throughout 2024. To date this year we have already added five new plasma centers and launched ten new pharma patient affordability programs. Full-year gross profit margins are expected to be between 52.0% to 54.0% reflecting increased revenue contribution from our pharma patient affordability business. Operating expenses are expected to be between $29.0 and $31.0 million as we continue to make investments in people and technology. Of this amount, depreciation and amortization are expected to be between $6.0 million and $6.5 million, while stock-based compensation is expected to be between $2.7 million and $3.0 million. Given our large unrestricted and restricted cash balances and the current interest rate environment, we expect to generate interest income of $2.6 million to $2.9 million. Taking all of the factors above into consideration, we expect net income to be in the range of $2.0 million to $3.0 million, or $0.04 to $0.06 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $8.0 million to $9.0 million, or $0.15 to $0.17 per diluted share.""""For the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $12.0 million to $13.0 million, reflecting the seasonal impact of tax refunds on our plasma business, with gross profit margins between 52.0% to 53.0% driven largely by an increased revenue contribution from our pharma patient affordability business. Operating expenses are expected to be between $7.0 million to $7.5 million, of which depreciation and amortization will be approximately $1.3 million. This reflects investments largely required to support our pharma patient affordability growth. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $1.20 million and $1.50 million,"" Baker concluded.Fourth Quarter 2023 and Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call DetailsThe company will hold a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today to discuss its fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results.

We believe these non-GAAP measures used by management to gauge the operating performance of the business help investors better evaluate our past financial performance and potential future results. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP accounting, and investors should read them in conjunction with the company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP measures we use may be different from, and not directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.""EBITDA"" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" reflects the adjustment to EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation charges.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent cash flows from operations, operating income (loss) or net income as defined by U.S. GAAP as indicators of operating performances. Management cautions that amounts presented in accordance with Paysign's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.Paysign, Inc.Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income: Net income $5,622,409 $713,095 $6,458,727 $1,027,775 Income tax (benefit) provision (4,259,730) 42,481 (4,094,911) 107,477 Interest income, net (730,683) (441,070) (2,531,071) (790,917)Depreciation and amortization 1,178,384 778,378 4,026,578 2,909,612 EBITDA 1,810,380 1,092,884 3,859,323 3,253,947 Stock-based compensation 695,223 653,723 2,853,643 2,277,717 Adjusted EBITDA $2,505,603 $1,746,607 $6,712,966 $5,531,664 Adjusted EBITDA per share Basic $0.05 $0.03 $0.13 $0.11 Diluted $0.05 $0.03 $0.12 $0.10 Weighted average common shares Basic 52,736,483 52,232,986 52,487,840 52,048,127 Diluted 53,769,686 53,773,758 54,162,485 52,933,255 SOURCE: Paysign, Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What were Paysign's total revenues for the full year 2023?

(""Innovent"") (HKEX: 01801), a world-class biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology, metabolic, autoimmune, ophthalmology and other major diseases, announces that the first participant has been successfully dosed with IBI310 (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody) in combination with sintilimab (PD-1 inhibitor) in a randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 3 clinical trial (Neoshot), for resectable MSI-H/dMMR[1] colon cancer (stage cT4 or cN+) neoadjuvant therapy. Neoshot is the first Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT05890742) in China to investigate MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of IBI310 combined with sintilimab for neoadjuvant therapy, compared with adjuvant chemotherapy after radical surgery for MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer. The primary endpoints are pathologic complete response (pCR) rate and event-free survival (EFS). Previously, in a randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 1b study for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with resectable MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer, the pCR rate in the IBI310+sintilimab group was significantly higher as compared with the sintilimab monotherapy group. No subjects in the IBI310+sintilimab group were inoperable due to adverse reactions, and there was no additional safety risk. Data from this Phase 1b trial will be published at an upcoming medical conference or in an academic journal in future. The Principal Investigator of the Neoshot study, Prof. Ruihua Xu from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, stated, ""At present, R0 resection for T4 and/or N+ stage colon cancer patients remain a significant challenge, along with risks of extensive trauma and poor prognosis. The results of the FOxTROT study suggested that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not effective in MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer, and the pCR rate is only about 5%[2]. Therefore, effective neoadjuvant treatment scheme is urgently needed to reduce preoperative staging, decrease tumor burden, narrow the scope of radical resection, and increase R0 resection rate, so as to improve long-term prognosis. IBI310 combined with sintilimab is expected to be the first neoadjuvant immunotherapy in China for resectable MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer, which has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and a good tolerance profile in a Phase 1b study. I look forward to working together with other investigators in Neoshot to obtain high-quality clinical data, in support of potentially providing a more effective treatment option for patients with MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer in China."" Dr. Zhou Hui, Senior Vice President of Innovent, stated, ""There is a huge unmet clinical need for neoadjuvant therapy of resectable MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer in China. The results of NICHE study showed that postoperative pCR rate after neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced colon cancer can be well translated into survival benefits[3]. In the Phase 1b study, IBI310 combined with sintilimab achieved excellent efficacy and safety results. We are pleased that the Phase 3 clinical study of Neoshot has completed the first patient dosing, and we are looking forward to the positive results generating from this study to provide a more ideal treatment option for MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer patients in China."" About Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignant tumor and the fourth leading cause of cancer death in China. It is estimated that in 2022, there are more than 510,000 new cases and approximately 240,000 fatal cases[4]. In addition, the incidence of colorectal cancer has continued to rise over the past 15 years[5]. MSI-H/dMMR is more common in localized colorectal cancer (10-15%) compared to metastatic colorectal cancer (5%)[6]. T4 and N2 are important prognostic indicators for MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer. Studies have shown that the 3-year disease-free survival rate of MSI-H/dMMR stage III colon cancer patients (T4 and/or N2) is about 60-65%[7],[8]. Therefore, the perioperative treatment for stage II-III MSI-H/dMMR colon cancer patients needs to be continually improved. About IBI310 IBI310 is a fully human monoclonal antibody injection independently developed by Innovent. IBI310 can specifically bind cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), thereby blocking CTLA-4 mediated T cell inhibition, promoting T cell activation and proliferation, improving tumor immune response, and achieving anti-tumor effects. About Sintilimab Sintilimab, marketed as TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) in China, is a PD-1 immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody co-developed by Innovent and Eli Lilly and Company. Sintilimab is a type of immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody, which binds to PD-1 molecules on the surface of T-cells, blocks the PD-1 / PD-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, and reactivates T-cells to kill cancer cells[9]. In China, sintilimab has been approved and included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) for seven indications. The updated NRDL reimbursement scope of TYVYT® (sintilimab injection) includes: For the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin's lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer lacking EGFR or ALK driver gene mutations;For the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who progressed after EGFR-TKI therapy;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced or metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer;For the first-line treatment of unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma with no prior systematic treatment;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;For the first-line treatment of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.In addition, two clinical studies of sintilimab have met their primary endpoints: Phase 2 study of sintilimab monotherapy as second-line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma;Phase 3 study of sintilimab monotherapy as second-line treatment for squamous NSCLC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy.Disclaimer: The above two indications are still under clinical study, which have not been approved in China.

Negative Revenue declines for Q4 and full year 2023 compared to previous periods. Net loss reported for both Q4 and full year 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased significantly from 2022 to 2023. Continuing resolution negatively impacted consulting revenues. Financial Analyst The recent financial disclosure by Intrusion Inc. indicates a mixed performance with notable strategic initiatives aimed at improving the company's standing. A reduction in net losses from $(0.82) per share to $(0.57) per share year-over-year suggests a positive trajectory in cost management and operational efficiency. The expansion of Intrusion Shield SaaS services into the Philippines represents a strategic move to tap into new markets, potentially diversifying revenue streams and mitigating the impact of domestic challenges such as federal budget constraints on consulting revenues.However, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $3.0 million to $0.1 million raises liquidity concerns, potentially affecting the company's ability to fund operations and invest in growth initiatives. The exchange agreement with Streeterville Capital to convert senior debt into Series A Preferred Stock is a critical step towards improving the balance sheet, although it may dilute existing shareholders' equity. Investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain Nasdaq listing compliance, as failure to do so could impact stock market perception and liquidity. Market Research Analyst The cybersecurity sector continues to grow, driven by increasing digital threats and the adoption of remote work practices. Intrusion Inc.'s focus on cyberattack prevention places it within a high-demand industry. The reported increase in gross profit margin from 55% to 78% year-over-year is a strong indicator of the company's pricing power and cost control measures. However, the sequential and year-over-year decline in revenue warrants attention, as it may reflect competitive pressures or market saturation.The announcement of new contracts and the intent of customers to increase their use of Shield products in 2024 provides a positive outlook for future revenue growth. Yet, it's important for Intrusion to convert these opportunities into tangible financial improvements to reassure stakeholders. The company's strategic focus on product innovation and market expansion could be pivotal in driving long-term growth, but execution and customer retention will be key determinants of success. Debt Market Analyst The conversion of senior debt into Series A Preferred Stock is a significant restructuring move that could have implications for Intrusion's debt profile and cost of capital. By reducing senior debt, the company may lower its interest obligations, potentially improving net income margins. However, the specifics of the preferred stock terms, such as dividend rights and conversion features, will influence the long-term financial impact.Investors in the debt market should assess the creditworthiness of Intrusion in light of these changes, especially considering the company's reduced cash position. The ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements through the reverse stock split and debt exchange could enhance investor confidence and stabilize the company's stock price, which is essential for maintaining access to capital markets. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM PLANO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / March 26, 2024 / Intrusion Inc. (NASDAQ:INTZ), a leader in cyberattack prevention solutions, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Recent Financial & Business Highlights:Improved full year EPS to $(0.57) per share from $(0.82) per share in 2022.Announced the expansion of Intrusion Shield SaaS services in the Philippines.Made additional progress toward regaining compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price and equity standard requirements.Continuing resolution negatively impacts consulting revenues.Fourth Quarter Financial ResultsRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.4 million, a decrease of 7% sequentially and 5% compared to the previous year. The decline in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2024 was driven by a decrease in consulting revenue that was mainly associated with the federal government's continuing resolution and the absence of an approved federal budget.The gross profit margin was 79% for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 63% in the fourth quarter of 2022.Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $3.5 million, a decrease from $5.4 million in the comparable quarter of last year.The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $(2.8) million, or $(0.09) per share, compared to a loss of $(5.2) million, or $(0.25) per share for the fourth quarter of 2022.Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the full year ended December 31, 2023, was $5.6 million, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to 2022.The gross profit margin was 78% for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 55% in 2022.Operating expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023, were $16.4 million, a decrease from $20.5 million in 2022.The net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2023, was $13.9 million, or $(0.57) per share, compared to a loss of $16.2 million, or $(0.82) per share in 2022.As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $0.1 million, down from $3.0 million on December 31, 2022. Subsequent to year end, the Company announced that it entered into an exchange agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC to exchange an aggregate $9,275,000 in senior debt pursuant to notes issued in March and June of 2022 for a newly designated Series A Preferred Stock.""We continue to see strong momentum for our suite of Shield products, with the fourth quarter being our best quarter to date with the addition of seven new logos, including the $5 million multi-year award we announced in October,"" said Tony Scott, CEO of Intrusion. ""While initial revenue contributions from these new contracts will bring modest gains, as deployments are occurring in the first and second quarter of this year, two of these customers have already indicated their intent to further increase their use of Shield throughout 2024. We believe that the addition of these new customers and our growing sales pipeline will help drive Intrusion Shield revenue growth in 2024.""Mr. Scott continued, ""Last week, we implemented two key steps in our plan to regain compliance with the minimum bid price and equity standard requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Markets with the announcement of a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares and an exchange agreement with Streeterville Capital to exchange an aggregate of $9,275,000 in senior debt for newly designated Series A Preferred Stock.While there can be no assurance that Intrusion will be able to regain, and thereafter sustain, compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, we believe that the Reverse Stock Split and our ability to reduce our overall debt will provide Intrusion with the best option to successfully regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements. Our focus remains on our vision for the future, and we believe that our compelling products and innovative strategies position us well to capitalize on the robust opportunities in our evolving marketplace.""Conference CallIntrusion's management will host a conference call today at 4:00 P.M., CDT.

Market Research Analyst The reported increase in student enrollment and portfolio training credit hours for ATA Creativity Global (ACG) is a positive indicator of the company's growth trajectory in the education sector. The 11.3% rise in enrollment suggests a robust demand for ACG's services, which is critical as the education industry is highly sensitive to student numbers. This growth aligns with broader industry trends where personalized and career-focused education programs are gaining popularity.The substantial jump in net income for the fourth quarter, a 324.1% increase year-over-year, is significant as it demonstrates the company's ability to convert revenue growth into profit. This is particularly noteworthy given that operating expenses did not rise substantially, indicating improved operational efficiency. Investors may interpret these results as a sign of a strong management team capable of driving profitability while expanding services.However, the reported net loss for the fiscal year, despite narrowing from the previous year, still raises concerns. While the company is on a path to recovery, the lingering losses indicate that challenges remain in achieving sustained profitability. The market will be watching closely to see if the positive trends in quarterly results can translate into annual gains in the coming fiscal years. Financial Analyst ACG's financial performance, particularly the increased net revenues and narrowed losses, reflects a company that is potentially on the cusp of a turnaround. The reported 7.2% increase in net revenues for the fiscal year is a modest yet steady growth, which is a good sign for investors. The gross margin improvement, from 60.6% to 62.6% in the fourth quarter, suggests that ACG is not only increasing its revenues but also becoming more efficient in its cost structure.From a financial perspective, the increase in cash and cash equivalents by 9.4% to $8.5 million provides ACG with a safety net and the ability to invest in future growth opportunities. However, investors should be mindful of the company's net loss position, as it indicates that ACG has not yet achieved a stable financial footing. The management's focus on operating efficiencies and the expectation of enhanced financial performance in 2024 will be critical factors in evaluating the company's investment potential.It's worth noting that the company's use of both GAAP and non-GAAP measures provides a more nuanced view of its financial health. The exclusion of share-based compensation and foreign exchange losses in the non-GAAP measures suggests that these factors are significant enough to warrant separate consideration when assessing the company's core operating performance. Education Industry Analyst ACG's strategic expansion into portfolio training and overseas study counselling services is timely, as there is an increasing global trend toward international education and creative arts. The company's focus on diversifying its course offerings and tailoring them to different student needs is indicative of a responsive business model that adapts to market demands.The introduction of the ACG International Arts Foundation Program Center and the diploma program in cooperation with Raffles College of Higher Education in Singapore are strategic moves that could potentially create new revenue streams and strengthen the company's market position. By offering a pathway from junior high school to a bachelor’s degree, ACG is positioning itself as a comprehensive education provider, which could attract a broader student base.However, the education industry is highly competitive and ACG's initiatives will need to be effectively marketed and delivered to capitalize on these opportunities. The success of these programs and partnerships will be critical in determining ACG's ability to sustain and accelerate its growth in the long term. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Conference Call on Tuesday, March 26, 2024, at 9 p.m. ET with Accompanying Investor PresentationBEIJING, China, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ATA Creativity Global (“ACG” or the “Company”, Nasdaq: AACG), an international educational services company focused on providing quality learning experiences that cultivate and enhance students’ creativity, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023 (“Fourth Quarter 2023” and “Fiscal Year 2023”, respectively).

Management Commentary Mr. Kevin Ma, Chairman and CEO of ACG, stated, “We were pleased to have completed a full year of on-campus class delivery in 2023 while continuing to offer certain courses online. We saw steady improvement in our performance in the second half of the year due to growth in our core portfolio training services business and concluded 2023 on a positive note, reporting a modest increase in net revenues and narrowing losses by 29.7% in Fiscal Year 2023. In Fourth Quarter 2023, we more than tripled net income attributable to ACG from the prior-year period as a result of increased revenue contributions from portfolio training services and overseas study counselling services with no substantial increase in operating expenses. We continued to strengthen our financial position over the course of 2023 and closed 2023 with $8.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, up 9.4% from the end of 2022.” Mr. Ma continued, “We were pleased to see student enrollment for Fourth Quarter 2023 grow 11.3%, driven by increased demand for our portfolio training and overseas study counselling services. We continue to see strong overall demand for portfolio training services reflected in our sales, which is the primary growth driver of our business and an important student acquisition channel for our research-based learning and overseas study counselling services. During Fourth Quarter 2023, our students began submitting their overseas study applications, and many have already received favorable early admission results from well-known creative art institutions in the U.K. and the U.S. with more offers for regular admission anticipated in the coming months. We look forward to providing students with continued guidance and support throughout the admissions process as we work to fulfill our mission of enabling positive student outcomes.” Outlook Mr. Jun Zhang, President of ACG, stated, “In 2024, ACG remains focused on serving a diverse population of students coming from different backgrounds with different needs, providing an extensive portfolio of relevant course offerings, quality instruction and unending support. In the first few months of 2024, aside from our usual online Master Class programs and the Shanghai Fashion Week 2024 project, we also hosted the 2024 Arts Study Tour to U.S. universities, taking students who aim to continue their creative studies at American arts institutions to visit the campuses of eight prestigious schools in New York, Rhode Island and Los Angeles. Designed to accommodate students interested in various art genres, we had hosted this popular program for seven years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students benefit from its immersive experience and opportunities to communicate with professors face to face. This is the first year we have hosted this tour since the pandemic, and we are pleased that it continues to be valuable to students. We launched the ACG International Arts Foundation Program Center (the ‘Foundation Center’) in 2021, which has been delivering accredited international arts and introductory curriculum to students. At the start of the 2023-24 school year, the Foundation Center introduced a diploma program in cooperation with Raffles College of Higher Education in Singapore, which enables junior high school graduates to continue their education through a one-year foundation program in Beijing followed by a three-year bachelor’s program in Singapore, upon the completion of which they can receive a bachelor’s degree. We are working to expand our institutional partnerships and teaching resources as we continue growing our portfolio training and other lines of business. We expect to continue improving our operating efficiencies, which will drive enhanced financial performance in 2024.” Operating Review Enrollment Update ACG student enrollment for Fourth Quarter 2023 was 1,011, of which 648 were enrolled in portfolio training programs, which consisted of time-based programs and project-based programs.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Review – GAAP Results ACG’s total net revenues for Fourth Quarter 2023 were RMB83.6 million (US$11.8 million), an increase of 6.5% from RMB78.5 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased revenue contributions from portfolio training and overseas study counselling services, partially offset by decreased revenues from other educational services related to decreased services delivered to institutional partners during the period. Revenues from portfolio training programs were RMB64.7 million, or 77.4% of total net revenues, during the period. Revenues from overseas study counselling services, research-based learning services and other educational services were RMB18.9 million, or 22.6% of total net revenues, during the period. Gross profit for Fourth Quarter 2023 was RMB52.4 million (US$7.4 million), an increase of 10.0% from RMB47.6 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to increased revenues during the period. Gross margin was 62.6% during the period, compared to 60.6% in the prior-year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased revenues during the period. Total operating expenses for Fourth Quarter 2023 were RMB43.3 million (US$6.1 million), compared to RMB42.7 million in the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to an RMB0.9 million increase in general and administrative expenses resulting from increased rent and travel expenses during the period and an RMB 0.4 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, which was partially offset by an RMB0.7 million decrease in research and development expenses related to the ongoing development of the new service management platform, which the Company expects to complete in Fiscal Year 2024.

Revenues from portfolio training programs were RMB166.4 million, or 75.1% of total net revenues, during the period.

Currency Convenience Translation The Company’s financial information is stated in Renminbi (“RMB”), the currency of the People’s Republic of China. The translations of RMB amounts for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers and have been made at the rate of RMB7.0999 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate as of December 31, 2023, in New York for cable transfers in RMB per U.S. dollar as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. Such translations should not be construed as representations that RMB amounts could be converted into U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate, or to be the amounts that would have been reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement ACG’s consolidated financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, ACG uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss, and basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share and ADS excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. ACG believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information about its performance by excluding share- based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss, which may not be indicative of its operating performance. ACG believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to ACG’s historical performance. ACG computes its non-GAAP financial measures using a consistent method from period to period. ACG believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of using non-GAAP net income (loss) excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss and basic and diluted earnings (losses) per common share and per ADS excluding share-based compensation expense and foreign currency exchange gain or loss is that share-based compensation charges and foreign currency exchange gain or loss have been, and are expected to continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in ACG’s business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The table captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Most Comparable GAAP Measures” shown at the end of this news release has more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures used by ACG.

The company's CEO, Jin Kang, highlighted the resilience of their sales and marketing strategy amidst macroeconomic challenges, setting a positive outlook for fiscal year 2024. Positive Revenue growth of 21% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period last year. Positive Adjusted EBITDA for the 26th consecutive quarter and free cash flow positive at the end of Q4 2023. Awarded over $70.3 million in contractual actions in Q4 2023. Federal contract backlog reached $359 million as of December 31, 2023. Full-year 2023 revenues increased by 13% compared to the previous year. Gross margin was 14% in Q4 2023 and 15% for the full year 2023. Net loss of $1.3 million in Q4 2023 and $4.0 million for the full year 2023. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $6.9 million as of December 31, 2023, with no bank debt. CEO Jin Kang expressed satisfaction with the company's performance and outlined growth strategies for fiscal year 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 21% increase in quarterly revenues and 13% annual revenue growth for WidePoint Corporation are significant indicators of the company's growth trajectory. The revenue increase is a positive signal to investors, especially when considered in the context of the broader technology Managed Solution Provider (MSP) industry, which is characterized by high competition and rapid innovation. The positive Adjusted EBITDA for the 26th consecutive quarter demonstrates consistent operational efficiency despite the reported net loss. However, the net loss of $1.3 million for the quarter and $4.0 million for the full year raises questions about the company's profitability challenges. The gross margin at 14% for the quarter and 15% for the year, while consistent, is relatively low for the technology sector, suggesting a need for cost management improvements or a shift towards higher-margin offerings. Market Research Analyst The $359 million federal contract backlog represents a robust pipeline that could secure future revenues for WidePoint. This backlog, coupled with the strategic focus on securing higher-margin contracts, indicates potential for improved profitability. The company's decision to allocate additional resources to sales and marketing reflects a proactive approach to capitalize on this opportunity. Furthermore, the mention of synergistic and accretive M&A opportunities suggests WidePoint is looking to expand through strategic acquisitions, which could enhance its service offerings and market reach. Investors should monitor how these strategies will affect the company's market position and financial health in the competitive MSP landscape. Telecommunications Industry Analyst WidePoint's specialization in Identity & Access Management (IAM), Telecommunications and Managed Mobility Services (MMS) positions it within a high-growth sector driven by increased demand for cybersecurity and mobile solutions. The contracts awarded for managed IT and cyber services, as well as for Cisco equipment, underscore the company's active role in essential technology infrastructure. The ability to maintain a positive free cash flow in such a capital-intensive industry is commendable and provides the company with the liquidity needed to invest in growth opportunities without incurring additional debt. The absence of bank debt and a strong cash position are strategic advantages that could enable WidePoint to navigate economic challenges and invest in technology upgrades to stay competitive. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM FAIRFAX, VA / ACCESSWIRE / March 26, 2024 / WidePoint Corporation (NYSE American:WYY), the innovative technology Managed Solution Provider (MSP) specializing in Identity & Access Management (IAM), Telecommunications and Managed Mobility Services (MMS), Analytics & Billing as a Service (ABaaS), and IT as a Service (ITaaS), reported results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Operational Highlights:Awarded a three-year contract valued at over $1.4 million from a major Florida attraction and research center to provide managed IT and cyber servicesReceived a three-year, $216,000 contract from a mobile healthcare provider to provide managed IT servicesAwarded a $900,000 contract for Cisco equipment by a national bottling distributorAttained positive Adjusted EBITDA for the 26th consecutive quarter, and ended the quarter free cash flow positiveAwarded more than 30 contractual actions resulting in over $70.3 million of contract value in Q4 2023Federal contract backlog totaled $359 million as of December 31, 2023Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Highlights:Revenues were $28.3 million, a 21% increase from the same quarter last yearGross margin was 14%, and gross margin excluding carrier services revenue was 32%Net loss totaled $1.3 million, or a loss of $(0.15) per diluted shareAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $423,000As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents equaled $6.9 million with no bank debtFull Year 2023 Financial Highlights:Revenues were $106.0 million, a 13% increase from the same period last yearGross margin was 15%, and gross margin excluding carrier services revenue was 33%Net loss totaled $4.0 million, or a loss of $(0.46) per diluted shareAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $791,000Management Commentary""The fourth quarter of 2023 for WidePoint was a great way to conclude an incredible year of growth and execution,"" said Company CEO, Jin Kang.

WidePoint defines EBITDA as net income excluding (i) interest expense, (ii) provision for or benefit from income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) Impairment charges. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain amounts included in EBITDA. WidePoint is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA in reliance on the ""unreasonable efforts"" exception for forward-looking non-GAAP measures set forth in SEC rules because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable effort and expense. In this regard, WidePoint does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) to GAAP net income, due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation. Because certain deductions for non-GAAP exclusions used to calculate projected net income may vary significantly based on actual events, WidePoint is not able to forecast on a GAAP basis with reasonable certainty all deductions needed in order to provide a GAAP calculation of projected net income at this time. The amounts of these deductions may be material and, therefore, could result in projected GAAP net income being materially less than is indicated by estimated adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP).Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning our business, operations and financial performance and condition as well as our plans, objectives and expectations for our business operations and financial performance and condition that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

PDUFA action date set for September 26, 2024, under the RTOR program. Positive Priority Review granted for Syndax's NDA for revumenib, a menin inhibitor for KMT2Ar acute leukemia. Efficient review process under FDA's RTOR program for potential earlier approval. Positive data from AUGMENT-101 trial supports NDA submission for revumenib. 23% CR/CRh rate among efficacy evaluable patients in KMT2Ar acute leukemia population. 70% of patients achieving CR/CRh were MRD negative. 63% overall response rate, with 39% undergoing HSCT and 50% restarting revumenib post-transplant. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The FDA's decision to grant Priority Review for revumenib, a menin inhibitor aimed at treating KMT2A-rearranged acute leukemia, marks a critical advancement in oncology therapeutics. Menin inhibitors represent a novel class of drugs that target leukemogenic proteins involved in the pathogenesis of certain leukemias. This is particularly pertinent for patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, where treatment options are limited and prognosis is poor.The AUGMENT-101 trial results, showing a complete remission rate of 23% and a high percentage of MRD-negative responses among those in remission, demonstrate a promising therapeutic potential for revumenib. The ability to achieve MRD negativity is a strong prognostic factor for improved survival outcomes in leukemia patients. Furthermore, the fact that a significant portion of responders could proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant, a potentially curative treatment, underscores the drug's potential impact on patient management.While these results are encouraging, it's important to consider the long-term effects and safety profile of revumenib, as well as the impact of post-transplant maintenance therapy on survival and quality of life. The RTOR program's expedited review process could bring this drug to market more quickly, offering hope to patients with limited treatment options. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review Program is designed to expedite the availability of cancer treatments that may offer significant benefits. Syndax Pharmaceuticals' transition to a commercial-stage company is indicative of the industry trend where biopharmaceutical companies are rapidly advancing from research and development to commercialization of therapies. This reflects positively on the company's capability to innovate and execute on clinical development plans.Investors and stakeholders should note the potential market impact of revumenib. The high MRD-negative response rate is a key factor, as it may lead to a competitive advantage in the market, considering the importance of MRD status in treatment decisions and prognosis. The success of this drug could also pave the way for further development of menin inhibitors, potentially opening new revenue streams for Syndax.However, it is important to monitor the competitive landscape, as other companies may also be developing similar therapies. The long-term commercial success of revumenib will depend on its efficacy and safety profile compared to existing and future treatments, pricing and insurance coverage policies. Financial Analyst The assignment of a PDUFA date is a significant event for Syndax Pharmaceuticals and its investors. It serves as a catalyst for potential stock price movements as the market anticipates the FDA's decision. The progress under the RTOR program and the Priority Review status are likely to be viewed favorably by investors, as they suggest a higher probability of approval and a potentially expedited time to market.From a financial perspective, the successful commercialization of revumenib could lead to substantial revenue growth for Syndax. Given the drug's 'first-in-class' status and its application in a high-need area, the pricing power could be strong, assuming the clinical benefits are confirmed upon further review. The company's focus on commercial preparations indicates a strategic foresight into the necessary infrastructure and marketing efforts required for a successful launch.It is important for investors to consider the implications of the upcoming PDUFA date on Syndax's financials, including potential increases in operational expenses related to the launch and marketing of the drug, as well as the impact on cash flow and earnings. Additionally, the outcome of the FDA's decision will likely have a significant influence on the company's valuation. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM – PDUFA action date set for September 26, 2024 – – NDA being reviewed under FDA's RTOR program – WALTHAM, Mass., March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Syndax Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: SNDX), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative pipeline of cancer therapies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Priority Review for its New Drug Application (NDA) for revumenib, the Company's first-in-class menin inhibitor, for the treatment of adult and pediatric relapsed or refractory (R/R) KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2Ar) acute leukemia. The NDA filing is being reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review Program (RTOR) and has been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of September 26, 2024. RTOR allows for a more efficient review and close engagement between the sponsor and the FDA throughout the submission process, which historically has led to earlier approvals. ""The receipt of Priority Review for the revumenib NDA filing is a significant milestone as we transition to a leading commercial-stage oncology company with the planned launches of two first- and best-in class drugs in 2024,"" said Michael A. Metzger, Chief Executive Officer. ""With two regulatory filings now under FDA Priority Review, our team is focused on commercial preparations to enable Syndax's continued success as we enter this next stage of growth."" The NDA submission is supported by positive data from the pivotal AUGMENT-101 trial of revumenib in adult and pediatric patients with KMT2Ar acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). As previously reported, the trial met its primary endpoint at the protocol-defined interim analysis with a complete remission (CR) or a CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate of 23% (13/57; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [12.7, 35.8, one-sided p-value = 0.0036]) among the 57 efficacy evaluable patients in the pooled KMT2Ar acute leukemia population. 70% of patients who achieved a CR/CRh and were assessed for minimal residual disease (MRD) were MRD negative. Additionally, 63% (36/57) of the efficacy-evaluable patients achieved an overall response, 39% (14/36) of whom underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with 50% (7/14) restarting revumenib as post-transplant maintenance at the time of the data cutoff. About Revumenib Revumenib is a potent, selective, small molecule inhibitor of the menin-KMT2A binding interaction that is being developed for the treatment of KMT2A-rearranged, also known as mixed lineage leukemia rearranged or MLLr, acute leukemias including ALL and AML, and NPM1-mutant AML. Positive topline results from the Phase 2 AUGMENT-101 trial in R/R KMT2Ar acute leukemia showing the trial met its primary endpoint were presented at the 65th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and data from the Phase 1 portion of AUGMENT-101 in acute leukemia was published in Nature. Revumenib was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and European Commission for the treatment of patients with AML and Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemias harboring a KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation. Revumenib was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with R/R acute leukemia harboring a KMT2A rearrangement. About Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) RTOR provides a more efficient review process for oncology drugs to ensure that safe and effective treatments are available to patients as early as possible, while improving review quality and engaging in early iterative communication with the applicant. Specifically, it allows for close engagement between the sponsor and the FDA throughout the submission process and it enables the FDA to review individual sections of modules of a drug application rather than requiring the submission of complete modules or a complete application prior to initiating review.

This uptick in losses can be attributed to the company's ramped-up investment in clinical trials and research activities, which is common for clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies focusing on novel therapies. The reported cash burn rate, reflected in the $52.4 million of net cash used in operating activities, is also higher than the previous year's $36.1 million. This acceleration in cash burn is indicative of the company's aggressive development strategy.However, the successful initial public offering (IPO) in February 2024, which raised approximately $366.9 million, is a positive signal for the company's financial health. This capital infusion is expected to fund operations into 2026, providing a substantial runway for the company to advance its clinical programs and potentially reach critical development milestones. Investors will likely focus on the company's ability to manage its cash reserves effectively and the progress of its clinical trials, which could drive future valuations. Medical Research Analyst Kyverna Therapeutics' progress in advancing KYV-101 through clinical trials is a key development, as successful outcomes in these trials could position the company as a leader in cell therapy for autoimmune diseases. The FDA Fast Track Designations for KYV-101 in multiple indications are particularly noteworthy, as they may expedite the review process and could lead to an earlier market entry if clinical outcomes are positive.The therapeutic areas targeted by Kyverna—multiple sclerosis, lupus nephritis and myasthenia gravis—represent markets with significant unmet medical needs and the potential for high-impact treatments. The company's proprietary CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, if proven effective, could disrupt current treatment paradigms and offer new hope to patients with refractory conditions. The long-term implications for stakeholders include not only the potential health benefits for patients but also the economic impact of introducing novel, possibly more effective therapies into the healthcare system. Market Research Analyst The landscape of autoimmune disease treatment is rapidly evolving and Kyverna Therapeutics' strategic positioning in both rheumatology and neurology could be advantageous. The autoimmune disease treatment market is expected to grow significantly and innovations in cell therapy are being closely monitored by industry participants and investors. Kyverna's engagement with ElevateBio's BaseCamp to improve its Ingenui-T manufacturing process signals an awareness of the importance of manufacturing efficiency and patient experience in the competitive biopharmaceutical space.As the company releases interim patient data at upcoming conferences such as EULAR, ECTRIMS and ACR, stakeholders should pay close attention to the scientific community's reception of these data. Positive feedback and results could enhance investor confidence and drive interest in the company's stock, while any setbacks could have the opposite effect. Kyverna's ability to navigate the regulatory landscape in the US and Europe will also be a critical factor in its long-term success and potential market share capture. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Advanced clinical development in two broad areas of autoimmune disease: rheumatology and neurologyStrong balance sheet, bolstered by recent public offering, expected to fund operations into 2026EMERYVILLE, Calif., March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc.

Financial Analyst The recent financial results from Velo3D point to a strategic realignment that appears to have positively impacted their operational efficiency. The reported reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses by over 30% from Q3 2023 to the end of Q1 2024 indicates a significant cost-optimization effort. This, coupled with the 35% year-over-year improvement in free cash flow, suggests that the company is on a path to achieving cash flow breakeven in the latter half of FY 2024.Investors should note the importance of the company's bookings recovery, with $15 million in total bookings since mid-December 2023 and more than half of these orders coming from existing customers. This not only reflects customer loyalty but also indicates a positive market response to the company's strategic shift. The addition of 12 new customers, including three in the defense sector, is a testament to the company's market expansion and diversification efforts. The strategic partnership with notable defense contractors like Kratos Defense and Bechtel Plant Machinery could be seen as a move to secure more stable, long-term contracts that are less susceptible to market volatility. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Velo3D's focus on the defense industry is a strategic decision that capitalizes on the sector's need for reliable, high-quality additive manufacturing for mission-critical metal parts. The defense sector is known for its rigorous standards and long procurement cycles, which can provide consistent revenue streams once a supplier is integrated into the supply chain. The company's ability to add new defense customers is indicative of its technological competitiveness and the potential for growth within this niche market.Furthermore, the emphasis on customer success and system reliability is likely to enhance Velo3D's reputation and lead to repeat business, which is important in the manufacturing technology industry where trust and performance are paramount. The reported bookings recovery and operational expense reduction reflect a balance between aggressive market expansion and prudent financial management, which could make Velo3D an attractive proposition for investors looking for companies with a clear path to profitability and a strategic focus on high-value markets. Supply Chain Analyst Examining Velo3D's strategic realignment through a supply chain lens, the company's initiative to improve system reliability is a critical factor for its success. In the additive manufacturing industry, the reliability of machines directly impacts the supply chain efficiency of customers. The fact that Velo3D is focusing on this aspect suggests that they are working towards creating a more robust and dependable product offering, which is essential for customer retention and attracting new business in sectors with stringent requirements like defense.Moreover, the reduction in operating expenses can be partially attributed to potential improvements in the supply chain and manufacturing processes. Streamlining operations to reduce costs without compromising on quality is a delicate balance, but it is key for sustainable growth. The progress in free cash flow also indicates a healthier balance sheet, which could provide the company with the necessary capital to invest in further supply chain optimizations, potentially leading to better margins and competitiveness in the long run. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Successfully Executing on Strategic Realignment Priorities Strategic Review Remains Ongoing – Board of Directors in Discussions with Multiple Parties to Maximize Stockholder Value Bookings recovery As of March 26, 2024, total bookings of $15 million since mid-December 2023; >50% of orders from existing customers Successfully reduced quarterly operating expenses Down >15% sequentially (excluding one-time charges) Expect >30% reduction Q3 2023 through end of Q1 2024 in non-GAAP operating expenses Further expanded installed base - added 12 new customers in 2023 including 3 new defense customers Continued free cash flow progress – 35% year over year improvement, well positioned to achieve cash flow breakeven in the second half of FY 2024 FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE: VLD), a leading additive manufacturing technology company for mission-critical metal parts, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 ended December 31, 2023. “2023 was a transformational year for the company as we re-aligned our strategic and business priorities from driving revenue growth to ensuring customer success, improving system reliability and materially reducing our cost structure,” said Brad Kreger, CEO of Velo3D. “We are pleased with the significant progress we are making related to our key initiatives as we have significantly reduced our costs and materially improved our operational efficiency. Additionally, our new go to market approach is paying dividends as we have resumed our bookings growth, including signing a number of new, strategic customers in the defense industry with Kratos Defense and Bechtel Plant Machinery. I remain very excited about our market opportunities in 2024, especially in defense given the recent $825 billion Department of Defense funding approval. We have already received one purchase order tied to this approval and expect we will close additional orders by the end of the quarter as a result. I firmly believe the benefits from our re-alignment are just beginning.” Key highlights related to the company’s strategic initiatives: Ensuring customer success / system reliability – reduced field issue resolution times by more than 45% since Q3 2023 and improved system uptime by 10% Increased revenue 1H24 visibility through bookings growth – as of March 26, 2024, booked >$15 million in new orders since mid-December, more than 50% of orders from existing customers Improved Sapphire printer quality – reduced system installation time by 40% over the last 6 months Improving cash flow – successfully reduced sequential operating expenses by >15%, expect sequentially quarterly improvement in free cash for FY 2024 “The entire Velo3D team remains focused on these four objectives and we’re beginning to see these changes yield results, including existing customers purchasing new systems. We believe this reflects their confidence in our technology as well as the success of our initiatives in improving customer satisfaction,” said Kreger. “We’re continuing to execute on our cost realignment programs to improve margins and cash flow, while prudently managing working capital. By doing so, we believe we are well positioned to profitably capitalize on the increasing industry demand for leading-edge additive manufacturing solutions.” ($ in Millions, except percentages and per-share data) 4th Quarter 2023 3rd Quarter 2023 4th Quarter 2022 FY2023 FY2022 GAAP revenue $1.8 $23.8 $29.8 $77.6 $80.8 GAAP gross margin (>100)% 6.3% 5.9% (33.7)% 3.6% GAAP net income (loss)1 $(58.2) ($17.4) $22.6 $(135.0) $10.0 GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share $(0.28) ($0.09) $0.11 $(0.68) $0.05 Non-GAAP net loss2 $(61.1) ($19.2) ($16.4) $(117.4) ($83.0) Non-GAAP net loss per diluted share2 $(0.29) ($0.10) ($0.08) $(0.59) ($0.41) Cash and Investments $31 $72 $80 $31 $80 Information about Velo3D’s use of non-GAAP information, including a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, is provided at the end of this release. Reconciliations to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures are presented below under “Non-GAAP Financial Information”. Non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per diluted share exclude stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments for the Company’s warrants, contingent earnout and debt derivative liabilities, and loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended December 31, 2023, September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 and years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Summary of Fourth Quarter 2023 results Revenue for the fourth quarter was $2 million and reflected a significant reduction in system shipments due to lower than planned bookings in the second half of 2023 and the company’s re-alignment transition. For fiscal year 2023, revenue was $77.6 million compared to $80.8 million in 2022. Given the decline in bookings and challenging industry conditions, the company successfully instituted a number of strategic sales initiatives in the fourth quarter to drive bookings growth. As a result of the successful execution of these initiatives, as of March 26, 2024, the company has booked more than $15 million in new orders since mid-December 2023. Gross margin for the fourth quarter was a negative 1,857%, primarily driven by reduced system volume, inventory valuation charges and costs associated with the company’s re-alignment initiatives. The company expects positive gross margin in the first quarter given improvements in its system balance of material costs, benefits from its new long term supply contracts and overall improvements in operating and manufacturing efficiency. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $24.5 million compared to $26.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter operating expenses include one-time charges totaling $4.7 million related to the company's re-alignment initiatives including a $2.4 million inventory reserve charge and $2.3 million in severance and other costs related to its recent reduction in force. Non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes the company’s re-alignment charges and stock-based compensation expense of $3.4 million, was $16.5 million, down approximately 17% sequentially. The company expects non-GAAP quarterly operating expenses to decline by more than 30% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the company’s realignment programs. Net loss for the quarter was $58.2 million and reflected a gain of $27.6 million on the fair value of warrants, contingent earnout and debt derivative liabilities. Additionally, net loss for the quarter included a $19.2 million loss on the extinguishment of the company’s convertible debt that was exchanged in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP net loss, which excludes, among other items, the gain on fair value of warrants, contingent earnout and debt derivative liabilities and the loss on debt extinguishment as well as stock-based compensation expense, was $61.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, excluding the same metrics, was a loss of $51.5 million. For more information regarding the company’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below. The company ended the quarter with $31 million in cash and investments. Also, as a result of its re-alignment initiatives, the company recorded a $27 million non-cash charge related to the valuation of its inventory during the quarter. Fourth quarter free cash flow, excluding financing activities, was in line company's forecasts and improved 35% on a year over year basis. The company expects sequential quarterly improvement in cash flow in 2024. Guidance The company expects sequential improvement in revenue, gross margin and operating expenses on a quarterly basis in 2024. The company also believes the continued execution on its realignment strategy will enable it to reach its goal of free cash flow breakeven in the second half of 2024. For the fiscal year 2024, the company’s guidance is as follows: Revenue in the range of $80 million to $95 million Gross margin in the range of 20% to 30% with fourth quarter 2024 gross margin of approximately 30%, excluding non-recurring charges related to its cost reduction initiatives The company will host a conference call for investors this afternoon to discuss its fourth quarter 2023 financial results at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

About Velo3D: Velo3D is a metal 3D printing technology company. 3D printing—also known as additive manufacturing (AM)—has a unique ability to improve the way high-value metal parts are built. However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago. This has prevented the technology from being used to create the most valuable and impactful parts, restricting its use to specific niches where the limitations were acceptable. Velo3D has overcome these limitations so engineers can design and print the parts they want. The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The fully integrated solution includes the Flow print preparation software, the Sapphire family of printers, and the Assure quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion manufacturing process. The company delivered its first Sapphire system in 2018 and has been a strategic partner to innovators such as SpaceX, Honeywell, Honda, Chromalloy, and Lam Research. Velo3D has been named as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies for 2023. For more information, please visit Velo3D.com, or follow the company on LinkedIn or X, formerly Twitter.

Non-GAAP Financial Information The company uses non-GAAP financial measures to help it make strategic decisions, establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business, analyze its financial results and evaluate its performance. The company also believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures in this release provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the company’s core business and results of operations over multiple periods. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as the sole measure of the company’s performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). The information in the table below sets forth the non-GAAP financial measures that the company uses in this release.

Positive 10% growth in Q4 net sales from the eyecare and wound care segment 27% decline in sales and marketing expenses for the quarter Divestiture of skincare segment to enhance cash position Co-marketing partnership in the eyecare market for strategic growth 64% year-over-year increase in online subscription-based unit sales Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 10% increase in Q4 net sales from the eyecare and wound care segment of NovaBay Pharmaceuticals indicates a solid performance in these areas, likely reflecting a successful adaptation to market demands and effective channel strategy. The growth in Avenova sales, both through physician dispensed and OTC channels, suggests an effective utilization of digital marketing, which is also supported by the reported reduction in sales and marketing expenses. This reduction, by 27% for the quarter, signifies a strategic shift towards more cost-efficient digital marketing tactics, which could be a positive signal for operating leverage improvement.The divestiture of the skincare segment, DERMAdoctor, appears to be a strategic move to focus on core competencies and could result in a more streamlined operation with reduced complexity and cost structure. This refocus on the eyecare segment, including the co-marketing partnership with Eyenovia, may enhance NovaBay's market position in its specialty areas. However, investors should be mindful of the impairment charges related to the skincare segment, which may indicate challenges faced in this area and potential risks associated with divestitures.Furthermore, the full-year financials show a modest 2% increase in total sales, with a stable gross margin. The reduction in G&A and R&D expenses could be indicative of disciplined cost management. However, the net loss attributable to common stockholders and the increase in other expenses, primarily due to interest and amortization of convertible notes, highlight the need to examine the company's capital structure and financing strategy. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents year-over-year should also be monitored closely as it may impact the company's ability to fund ongoing operations and growth initiatives. Market Research Analyst The growth in NovaBay's eyecare and wound care segment sales reflects broader industry trends where companies that leverage online sales channels and subscriptions, such as through Amazon.com and Avenova.com, can outperform. The 64% year-over-year increase in online subscription-based unit sales underscores the importance of a strong e-commerce strategy in the healthcare products market. The company's ability to capitalize on digital marketing to drive sales while simultaneously reducing marketing expenses is a testament to the efficacy of digital optimization strategies in reaching and retaining customers.From a market perspective, the partnership with Eyenovia could potentially open new distribution avenues and enhance product offerings, which may be a strategic move to capture additional market share. Investors should consider the potential for synergies from this partnership and how it might contribute to future revenue growth. It is also essential to consider the competitive landscape of the eyecare market and how NovaBay's growth strategy aligns with emerging trends in consumer preferences and technology adoption within the sector. Medical Industry Analyst The eyecare and wound care markets are highly competitive with a significant focus on innovation and customer retention. NovaBay's reported increase in sales within these segments suggests that their product offerings, such as Avenova, are resonating with both physicians and consumers. The emphasis on physician-dispensed and over-the-counter sales channels indicates a strategic approach to market penetration, catering to different customer segments.The reduction in R&D expenses might raise questions about the company's long-term innovation pipeline and commitment to product development. While cost reductions can benefit the bottom line in the short term, sustained R&D investment is critical for long-term competitiveness in the medical industry. Stakeholders should assess the balance between cost-saving measures and the potential impact on future product development and market competitiveness.Moreover, the divestiture of the skincare segment may allow NovaBay to allocate resources more efficiently and focus on areas with higher growth potential. However, the impairment charges suggest that there were significant challenges within the skincare business and stakeholders should consider whether the issues leading to impairment were unique to the skincare segment or indicative of broader operational challenges. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 net sales from the eyecare and wound care segment grew 10% over the prior year with higher sales from the Avenova® physician dispensed and OTC channels, and from branded wound care products Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter declined 27% reflecting digital marketing optimization Divestiture of skincare segment expected to bolster cash position and reduce operating expenses Continued execution on eyecare growth strategy including recent co-marketing partnership Conference call begins at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time today EMERYVILLE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NovaBay® Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: NBY) reports financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023 and provides a business update. “Quarterly revenue from our eyecare and wound care segment increased 10% versus the prior year, driven by higher Avenova sales through our physician dispensed and OTC channels, and by higher sales of our branded wound care products,” said Justin Hall, CEO of NovaBay. “Last year we expanded our loyal customer base for Avenova with a 64% year-over-year increase in online subscription-based unit sales on Amazon.com and Avenova.com, our two most important OTC sales channels. We achieved this while reducing our sales and marketing spend by 17% for the year, including a 27% reduction for the quarter, by further leveraging our digital marketing expertise."" “Further, the declining sales from skincare products prompted the recent divestiture of DERMAdoctor®, which reduces our operating expenses and better positions us to pursue strategic initiatives that have a greater potential for growth,” he added. “We recently announced a co-promotion agreement with Eyenovia that capitalizes on our established relationships with eyecare professionals and are seeking additional strategic growth opportunities in the eyecare market,” said Mr. Hall. Fourth Quarter Financial Results Total sales, net for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $3.7 million, an increase of 2% from $3.6 million for the prior-year period, with the increase due to higher Avenova and wound care product sales. Net product revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 included $2.8 million from the eyecare and wound care segment, and $0.9 million from the skincare segment. Gross margin on net product revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 49%, compared with 48% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.4 million, a 27% decrease from $1.9 million for the prior-year period, reflecting lower digital advertising costs and lower expenses for outside professional services. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.2 million, a 51% decrease from $2.4 million for the prior-year period, with the decrease due primarily to a decrease in both headcount and the use of outside professional services. Research & development (R&D) expenses also decreased for the fourth quarter of 2023 to $4 thousand, versus $66 thousand for the prior-year period. The Company recorded goodwill, intangible and other asset impairment charges for the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 of $2.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively, related to the impairment of the DERMAdoctor business. Non-cash gain on changes in fair value of warrant liability for the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022 were $56 thousand and $976 thousand, respectively. Non-cash gain on changes in fair value of contingent liability for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $342 thousand and was related to the operations of DERMAdoctor, which was recently sold. Other expense, net for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $766 thousand, consisting primarily of interest expense and the amortization of discounts on convertible notes issued in May 2023. This compared with other expense, net for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $98 thousand. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.2 million, or $1.33 per share, which included a non-cash adjustment of $5.1 million due to the reset of preferred stock conversion prices. This compared with a net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $8.2 million, or $4.33 per share.

(Nasdaq: LIDR) signed an LOI with a global Tier 1 automotive supplier and announced the launch of Apollo, a product from their 4Sight Flex family. The company reported a cash burn reduction for the third consecutive quarter, ending 2023 with $36.5 million in cash and marketable securities. Despite a GAAP net loss of $(27.8) million, AEye beat its non-GAAP EPS net loss guidance by 10 cents due to cost reduction initiatives. Positive None. Negative GAAP net loss of $(27.8) million in Q4 2023 Non-cash impairment charges impacting GAAP financial results 1-for-30 reverse stock split in December 2023 Revenue of $0.1 million in Q4 2023 Financial Analyst The announcement by AEye, Inc. of a signed Letter of Intent (LOI) with a Tier 1 automotive supplier could signal a strategic partnership that may enhance the company's market position in the automotive Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) sector. This partnership is indicative of AEye's commitment to a capital-light, automotive-first strategy, potentially improving its competitive edge and opening new revenue streams. The introduction of Apollo, a new product offering, suggests innovation and expansion of AEye's product line, which could be a positive indicator for future sales and market penetration.However, the reported financials raise concerns. The significant GAAP net loss of $27.8 million, or $4.44 per share and a non-GAAP net loss of $6.9 million, or $1.10 per share, despite a reduced cash burn rate, reflect ongoing financial challenges. The cash position of $36.5 million, with an expected runway into 2025, provides some assurance of short-term operational stability, but it also underscores the need for the company to secure additional funding or achieve profitability to sustain long-term growth. The reverse stock split is a common strategy to meet minimum bid price requirements and may also be aimed at making the stock more attractive to institutional investors, although it could be perceived negatively by current shareholders. Market Research Analyst AEye's foray into the ADAS market through strategic partnerships with Tier 1 suppliers is a significant move, given the projected growth of the ADAS market driven by increasing adoption of safety features and autonomous driving technologies. The launch of Apollo could cater to the demand for compact, high-performance lidar solutions, which are critical components for autonomous vehicles. By focusing on a capital-light approach, AEye may be able to leverage its partners' resources and distribution networks to scale effectively without incurring substantial capital expenditures.However, the revenue of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 is minimal, signaling that AEye is still in the early stages of commercialization and market acceptance. Investors should monitor the conversion of LOIs into firm contracts and subsequent revenue generation as a key indicator of the company's ability to capitalize on its strategic initiatives. The wind down of the industrial product line and the associated impairment charges reflect a strategic pivot and a narrowing of focus, which could be either a streamlining effort or a sign of retrenchment depending on future performance. Legal Expert The disclosure of financial adjustments following the 1-for-30 reverse stock split is a critical piece of information for shareholders and potential investors. Such corporate actions require adherence to regulatory guidelines and can have legal implications if not properly executed and communicated. The adjustment of financial information to reflect the revised share count is necessary for accurate financial reporting and compliance with securities laws. It is also important for investors to understand the legal context behind the non-cash impairment charges related to the wind down of the industrial product line, as these charges can affect the company's reported earnings and tax liabilities.Investors should be aware of the legal ramifications of the LOI with the Tier 1 automotive supplier. While an LOI is not a binding contract, it does signify a serious intent to enter into a partnership and can have legal consequences if either party fails to negotiate in good faith. The progression from an LOI to a definitive agreement will be a important step to watch, as it will formalize the terms and obligations of the partnership and provide more concrete legal and financial implications for AEye's business strategy. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Signed LOI with global Tier 1 automotive supplier Third consecutive quarter of cash burn reduction DUBLIN, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AEye, Inc. (Nasdaq: LIDR), a global leader in adaptive, high performance lidar solutions, today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. Management Commentary “AEye is pleased to announce that we have signed an LOI with a global Tier 1 automotive ADAS sensor supplier, which marks the beginning of a new relationship as part of our capital-light, automotive-first strategy. We are also excited to unveil Apollo, the first member of our 4Sight Flex product family that delivers ultra-long-range performance in an incredibly compact form factor,” said Matt Fisch, AEye CEO. “We are looking forward to a successful 2024 as we focus on delivering AEye’s innovative technology to the market with our Tier 1 partners.” Key Q4 2023 Financial Highlights “For the third consecutive quarter, we have reduced our cash burn rate while maintaining a disciplined approach to expense management. We entered 2024 with $36.5 million in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet, and a cash runway that we expect extends into 2025,” said Conor Tierney, AEye CFO. “Due to the previously announced wind down of our industrial product line, we incurred non-cash impairment charges that negatively impacted our GAAP financial results, causing a GAAP EPS net loss of $4.44, but we are pleased to have beaten our non-GAAP EPS net loss guidance by 10 cents in part due to our continued cost reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter.” In December 2023, the company effected a 1-for-30 reverse stock split and all the financial information disclosed has been adjusted to account for the revised share count numbers. Revenue of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss was $(27.8) million, or $(4.44) per share, based on 6.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net loss was $(6.9) million, or $(1.10) per share, based on 6.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $36.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Conference Call and Webcast Details AEye management will hold a conference call today, March 26, 2024, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) to discuss these results. AEye CEO Matt Fisch and CFO Conor Tierney will host the call, followed by a question-and-answer session.

The company confirms its full-year business outlook for revenue, profit, and cash flow, and commits to share repurchases of $100 million over the remainder of 2024. Positive Revenue increased by 46.8% to $2,402.7 million compared to $1,636.4 million in the prior year first quarter. Operating income decreased by 4.9% to $148.4 million. Non-GAAP operating income increased by 46.6% to $319.1 million. Net income decreased by 40.7% to $52.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 50.2% to $384.3 million. Diluted earnings per common share decreased by 54.8% to $0.76. The company repurchased 0.2 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $22.0 million. The company's remaining share repurchase authorization is $267.5 million. Second quarter revenue expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion to $2.372 billion. Full year revenue expected to be in the range of $9.510 billion to $9.700 billion. Non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year is expected to be in the range of $11.69 to $12.50. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from Concentrix Corporation indicate a significant revenue increase of 46.8% year-over-year, which is a robust indicator of growth, particularly in the customer experience solutions and technology sector. However, the increase in revenue did not translate to a proportional increase in operating income or net income, with operating income seeing a decline of 4.9% and net income decreasing by 40.7%. This discrepancy suggests rising costs or potential inefficiencies that may be eroding margins. The operating margin contraction by 330 basis points is a critical point of analysis for stakeholders, as it could signal challenges in scaling operations while maintaining profitability.Concentrix's commitment to a $100 million share repurchase program reflects a confidence in future cash flows and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. This, coupled with a steady dividend, may signal to investors a stable financial position. However, the cash flow used in operations and the adjusted free cash flow figures being in the negative territory are areas of concern. They could indicate that despite strong revenue growth, the company's cash management and operational efficiency need scrutiny.For long-term implications, investors should monitor the company's ability to improve profit margins and cash flow in the context of its revenue growth. The guidance for the full year suggests a conservative revenue growth forecast on a proforma constant currency basis, which indicates management's cautious stance possibly due to macroeconomic factors or industry-specific challenges. Market Research Analyst Concentrix's performance in the customer experience sector is notable for its AI and technology-led solutions, which are driving the high end of revenue guidance. The sector is increasingly competitive and innovation-driven, so the company's emphasis on AI could be a differentiator that supports sustained growth. The growth in adjusted EBITDA by 50.2% is a positive sign, as it suggests that the company's core operations are generating increased profits before accounting for non-operational financial factors.From a market perspective, the guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year reflects a cautious optimism with expected pro forma constant currency revenue growth. The impact of foreign exchange rates is not negligible; it's expected to negatively impact revenue, which is a common challenge for global businesses like Concentrix. Investors should appreciate the transparency in how these external factors are expected to influence financial performance.Understanding the company's market positioning and competitive landscape is essential. Investors should consider how Concentrix's pipeline and innovation in AI solutions position it against competitors and how effectively it can capitalize on the increasing demand for advanced customer experience services. Economist The financial results of Concentrix must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. The negative impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue projections is a reflection of the current volatility in global currency markets. This volatility can be attributed to various macroeconomic factors, including trade tensions, interest rate differentials and geopolitical uncertainties. Companies like Concentrix that operate on a global scale are particularly susceptible to these fluctuations.Furthermore, the company's pro forma constant currency revenue growth is modest, which could be indicative of a maturing market or increased competition. It's also possible that it reflects a strategic focus on profitable growth rather than expansion at any cost. Investors should consider these growth rates in light of the overall economic conditions and industry trends, such as digital transformation and the increasing importance of customer experience in business strategy.Long-term, the company's investment in AI and technology, as well as its share repurchase program, suggest a belief in its own growth potential. However, it's important to assess whether these investments will yield the expected returns in an economic climate that may be facing headwinds such as potential recessions or continued currency instability. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Revenue at high end of guidance rangeWell-positioned for Q2 with a strong pipelineConfirming full year business outlook for revenue, profit, cash flowCommitted to share repurchases of $100 million over remainder of 2024 NEWARK, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Concentrix Corporation (NASDAQ: CNXC), a leading global provider of customer experience (CX) solutions and technology, today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended February 29, 2024.

First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Highlights: Revenue was $2,402.7 million, up 46.8% from the prior year first quarter compared with $1,636.4 million in the prior year first quarter. On a proforma constant currency basis, revenue increased by 2.8%.Operating income was $148.4 million, or 6.2% of revenue, compared with $156.0 million, or 9.5% of revenue, in the prior year first quarter.Non-GAAP operating income was $319.1 million, or 13.3% of revenue, compared with $217.6 million, or 13.3% of revenue, in the prior year first quarter.Adjusted EBITDA was $384.3 million, or 16.0% of revenue, compared with $255.8 million, or 15.6% of revenue, in the prior year first quarter.Cash flow used in operations was $46.9 million in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $81.3 million in the quarter.Diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) was $0.76 compared to $1.68 in the prior year first quarter.Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.57 compared to $2.59 in the prior year first quarter. “We are seeing a strong pipeline for our AI and technology-led solutions,” said Chris Caldwell, President and CEO of Concentrix. “This allowed us to achieve the high end of our revenue guidance and our profit target for the quarter. Reflecting our confidence in our outlook for 2024, we are committed to repurchasing $100 million of our shares over the final three quarters of 2024 while maintaining our dividend and our debt reduction commitments.” Quarterly Dividend and Share Repurchase Program: The Company paid a $0.3025 per share quarterly dividend on February 15, 2024. The Company’s Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.3025 per share payable on May 7, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 26, 2024.The Company repurchased 0.2 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $22.0 million under its previously announced share repurchase program at an average cost of $90.22 per share. At February 29, 2024, the Company’s remaining share repurchase authorization was $267.5 million. Business OutlookThe following statements are based on the Company’s current expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and the full year fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation, share-based compensation, and the related tax effects thereon. The non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes no impact from changes in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Expectations: Second quarter reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.325 billion to $2.372 billion. Based on current exchange rates, our expectations assume an approximately 160-basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year period. Our guidance implies pro forma constant currency revenue growth for the second quarter in the range of 1% to 3%.Operating income is expected to be in the range of $161 million to $163 million and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million.Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.70, assuming approximately 65.5 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 4% of net income attributable to participating securities.The effective tax rate is expected to approximate 26% to 27%. Full Year Fiscal 2024 Expectations: Full year reported revenue is expected to be in the range of $9.510 billion to $9.700 billion. Based on current exchange rates, our expectations assume an approximately 70-basis point negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared with the prior year. Our guidance implies pro forma constant currency revenue growth for the full year in the range of 1% to 3%.Operating income is expected to be in the range of $770 million to $800 million and non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $1,390 million to $1,450 million.Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $11.69 to $12.50, assuming approximately 65.3 million diluted common shares outstanding and approximately 4% of net income attributable to participating securities.The effective tax rate is expected to approximate 26% to 27%.We expect to repurchase $100 million of our common stock over the final three quarters of fiscal 2024. The Company believes that a quantitative reconciliation of the non-GAAP EPS outlook to the most directly comparable GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to (a) the inability to forecast future changes in acquisition contingent consideration, which is based, in part, on the future trading price of the Company’s common stock, and (b) the inability to forecast future foreign currency losses (gains), net included in other expense (income), net. For the same reason, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which may have a material impact on the Company’s GAAP results. Conference Call and WebcastThe Company will host a conference call for investors to review its first quarter fiscal 2024 results today at 5:00 p.m. (ET)/2:00 p.m. (PT). The live conference call webcast will be available in listen-only mode in the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website under “Events and Presentations” at https://ir.concentrix.com/events-and-presentations.

Use of Non-GAAP InformationIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with GAAP, we also disclose certain non-GAAP financial information, including: Constant currency revenue growth, which is revenue growth adjusted for the translation effect of foreign currencies so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Constant currency revenue growth is calculated by translating the revenue of each fiscal year in the billing currency to U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year’s currency conversion rate in comparison to prior year’s revenue. Generally, when the U.S. dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, revenue growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than revenue growth reported at actual exchange rates.Pro forma constant currency revenue growth, which is constant currency revenue growth measured against the Company’s combined pro forma results of operations as if the combination with Webhelp had occurred on December 1, 2022.Non-GAAP operating income, which is operating income, adjusted to exclude acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation.Non-GAAP operating margin, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, divided by revenue.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP operating income, as defined above, plus depreciation (exclusive of step-up depreciation).Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.Non-GAAP net income, which is net income excluding the tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers’ note, change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net.Free cash flow, which is cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, and adjusted free cash flow, which is free cash flow excluding the effect of changes in the outstanding factoring balance. We believe that free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. We believe that adjusted free cash flow is a meaningful measure of cash flows because it removes the effect of factoring which changes the timing of the receipt of cash for certain receivables. However, free cash flow and adjusted cash flow have limitations because they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not incorporate payments for business acquisitions.Non-GAAP diluted EPS, which is diluted EPS excluding the per share, tax-effected impact of acquisition-related and integration expenses, including related restructuring costs, step-up depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation, imputed interest related to the sellers’ note, change in acquisition contingent consideration and foreign currency losses (gains), net. Non-GAAP EPS excludes net income attributable to participating securities and the related per share, tax-effected impact of adjustments to net income described above reflect only those amounts that are attributable to common shareholders. We believe that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand our base operating performance, especially when comparing results with previous periods and for planning and forecasting in future periods, primarily because management typically monitors the business adjusted for these items in addition to GAAP results. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in some cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of intangible assets. Although intangible assets contribute to our revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the services performed for our clients. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of our acquisition activity. Accordingly, we believe excluding the amortization of intangible assets, along with the other non-GAAP adjustments, which neither relate to the ordinary course of our business nor reflect our underlying business performance, enhances our and our investors’ ability to compare our past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude share-based compensation expense. Given the subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use when calculating share-based compensation expense, management believes this additional information allows investors to make additional comparisons between our operating results and those of our peers. As these non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the comparable GAAP measures and should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.

deductible non-GAAP adjustments was calculated using the tax-deductible portion of the expenses and applying the entity-specific, statutory tax rates applicable to each item during the respective periods presented. (2) Diluted EPS is calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation proportional to the respective ownership among holders of common stock and participating securities. Restricted stock awards, and effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, restricted stock units granted to employees are considered participating securities. For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, net income attributable to participating securities was approximately 3.8% and 1.8% of net income, respectively, for the three months ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023 and was excluded from total net income to calculate net income attributable to common stockholders. In addition, the non-GAAP adjustments allocated to common stockholders were calculated based on the percentage of net income attributable to common stockholders. (3) Foreign currency losses (gains), net are included in other expense (income), net and primarily consist of gains and losses recognized on the revaluation and settlement of foreign currency transactions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting. The reported amounts for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the three months ended February 29, 2024 include adjustments to exclude these foreign currency losses (gains), net, which were not adjusted in similar non-GAAP measures previously reported for the corresponding period in fiscal year 2023. In order to enhance comparability, similar adjustments were made for non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS for the three months ended February 28, 2023. (4) The supplemental pro forma revenue presented below is for illustrative purposes only, does not include the pro forma adjustments that would be required under Regulation S-X for pro forma financial information, is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the combination with Webhelp had been completed on December 1, 2022, does not reflect synergies that might have been achieved, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The supplemental pro forma financial information reflects pro forma adjustments to present the combined pro forma results of operations as if the combination with Webhelp had occurred on December 1, 2022. The supplemental pro forma financial information for the quarter ended May 31, 2023 and the fiscal year ended November 30, 2023 is as follows: Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2023 November 30, 2023Revenue$2,339,082 $9,485,600 What was Concentrix 's revenue for the first quarter ended February 29, 2024?

STAG INDUSTRIAL TO ISSUE $450 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND REFINANCES TERM LOAN,2024-03-26T20:06:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"STAG Industrial, Inc. announces a note purchase agreement for $450 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes with varying terms and interest rates. The company also refinanced a $200 million unsecured term loan, extending the maturity date and adjusting the interest rates.","STAG INDUSTRIAL TO ISSUE $450 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND REFINANCES TERM LOAN Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary STAG Industrial, Inc. announces a note purchase agreement for $450 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes with varying terms and interest rates. The company also refinanced a $200 million unsecured term loan, extending the maturity date and adjusting the interest rates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $450 million in fixed rate senior unsecured notes by STAG Industrial is a strategic move to secure long-term financing, diversify the company's capital structure and potentially finance its growth initiatives or refinance existing debt. With interest rates set between 6.05% and 6.30%, the debt cost reflects current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness. Investors should note the term structure of the notes, which indicates a staggered maturity schedule that can help STAG manage its debt obligations over time without facing a significant burden at any single point.However, the interest rates for the new notes are higher than the refinanced term loan, which has a fixed rate of 2.94% until January 2025 and then 4.83% until March 2027. This difference suggests a premium for the longer-term and unsecured nature of the notes, which could increase the company's interest expenses in the short term. The refinancing of the $200 million unsecured term loan also indicates proactive debt management, potentially improving financial flexibility by extending the maturity and locking in a relatively low interest rate before a speculated rise in market rates. Market Research Analyst STAG Industrial's recent financial activities could be interpreted as a response to anticipated interest rate trends and capital market conditions. By locking in fixed interest rates, the company is hedging against the risk of rising interest rates, which is a concern for many businesses in the current economic climate. The private placement of notes also suggests that STAG Industrial is tapping into a specific investor base that is comfortable with the company's risk profile and is seeking fixed income opportunities.From a market perspective, this move could be seen as a vote of confidence from institutional investors in STAG's business model and future prospects. The company operates in the industrial real estate sector, which has been experiencing growth due to the rise of e-commerce and the need for distribution centers. Therefore, the ability to secure long-term financing at fixed rates may position STAG favorably to capitalize on market opportunities. Credit Analyst The unregistered nature of the notes indicates a private placement, which is typically offered to a select group of sophisticated investors. This approach can offer quicker access to funds and lower issuance costs compared to public offerings. However, it also requires investors to perform their due diligence, as the notes will not have the same level of public disclosure as registered securities.Credit analysts would closely examine STAG Industrial's credit ratings, interest coverage ratios and leverage metrics to assess the risk associated with the new debt. The refinancing of the term loan with a lower interest rate until 2025 provides temporary relief on interest payments, but the subsequent rate increase will require careful financial planning. The extension options on the term loan add a layer of flexibility, but they are contingent on meeting certain conditions, which have not been disclosed. These factors must be weighed when evaluating the company's credit risk and overall financial health. 03/26/2024 - 04:06 PM BOSTON, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- STAG Industrial, Inc. (the ""Company"") (NYSE: STAG) today announced that it entered into a note purchase agreement to issue $450 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 6.17%.

Lead candidate SER-252 progressing towards Phase I clinical trials for Parkinson's Disease treatment.","Serina Therapeutics Announces Completion of Merger with AgeX Therapeutics Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Serina Therapeutics completes merger with AgeX Therapeutics, to trade on NYSE American as 'SER' starting March 27, 2024. Lead candidate SER-252 progressing towards Phase I clinical trials for Parkinson's Disease treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst With Serina Therapeutics' stock commencing trading under a new ticker and the closing of its merger with a subsidiary of AgeX Therapeutics, the landscape for investors has shifted. The market will likely react to this consolidation, as mergers can lead to operational synergies and cost savings, potentially increasing shareholder value. Investors should monitor the trading volume and price action of Serina's stock post-merger to gauge market sentiment.Furthermore, the ownership split, with Serina shareholders retaining a majority, suggests confidence in Serina's existing pipeline and strategic direction. The market will also keep a close eye on the progress of SER-252, as successful preclinical studies and IND submission could lead to significant long-term value creation if the drug proves effective in treating Parkinson’s Disease. Biotech Industry Analyst The advancement of Serina's lead drug candidate, SER-252, is a critical step for the company. The polyoxazoline-drug conjugate represents a novel approach in the treatment of neurological diseases. The preclinical studies' results and the subsequent IND submission are pivotal events that could significantly influence the company's valuation.Investors should be aware of the high risk and reward nature of biotech investments, particularly in clinical-stage companies. The successful progression into and through clinical trials can lead to substantial appreciation in stock value, while any setbacks could have the opposite effect. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reverse stock split and the new share distribution need careful examination. The post-merger share structure will dilute existing AgeX shareholders while concentrating ownership among Serina's. This could affect the stock's liquidity and volatility. Investors should evaluate the company's financials, including cash burn rate and capital requirements for upcoming clinical trials, as these will be indicative of future financing needs or potential dilution.Additionally, the legal counsel involvement from Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP indicates that significant legal due diligence has been undertaken, which is reassuring from a corporate governance standpoint. 03/26/2024 - 05:04 PM Shares of Serina to commence trading on NYSE American under the ticker symbol “SER” on March 27, 2024Lead candidate SER-252, POZ-apomorphine preclinical studies anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024; IND submission to the FDA for the initiation of a Phase I clinical trial planned for 2025 HUNTSVILLE, Ala., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Serina Therapeutics (NYSE American: SER), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of therapies for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and other neurological diseases, today announced the closing of its previously announced merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary of AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. The combined company will operate under the name Serina Therapeutics and will trade on the NYSE American market under the ticker symbol “SER” effective with the open of business on Wednesday, March 27, 2024. The new CUSIP number for the combined company following the merger is 81751A108. Serina Board Chair J. Milton Harris, Ph.D., stated, “This merger is the culmination of years of work on the part of the Serina team and enables us to move our lead polyoxazoline-drug conjugate into clinical trials. We will endeavor to advance additional clinical candidates, further develop our LNP and ADC platforms, and look forward to presenting the Serina opportunity to a new investor audience.” Serina will focus on the advancement of its lead drug candidate, SER-252 (POZ-apomorphine) for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s Disease through pre-clinical studies towards the goal of an investigational new drug submission or “IND” to the Food and Drug Administration for the initiation of a Phase I clinical trial during the fourth quarter of 2024. The management team of the combined company is led by Steven Ledger as Interim Chief Executive Officer. Following the reverse stock split and closing of the merger, there will be approximately 10.1 million shares of the combined company’s common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, excluding warrants, with prior Serina shareholders owning approximately 75% and prior AgeX shareholders owning approximately 25%. Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP provided legal counsel to Serina. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP provided legal counsel to AgeX. About Serina Therapeutics Serina is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of wholly-owned drug product candidates to treat neurological diseases and pain. Serina’s POZ PlatformTM delivery technology is engineered to provide greater control in drug loading and more precision in the rate of release of attached drugs, enabling the potential of certain challenging small molecules, while addressing the limitations of polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) and other biocompatible polymers. Serina’s POZ PlatformTM partners are at the forefront in advancing LNP delivery technology to develop novel RNA therapeutics. Serina’s lead candidate, SER-252 (POZ-apomorphine), has entered IND-enabling preclinical studies that were initiated in August 2023 and are anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. Serina intends to advance SER 252 into Phase I clinical trials in 2025 for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Serina is headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama on the campus of the HudsonAlpha Institute of Biotechnology. About the Pipeline of Product Candidates Serina’s business is largely focused on the development of a wholly-owned pipeline of POZ-enabled drug candidates for central nervous system (CNS) indications, including Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and pain. A key element of Serina’s strategy is to use and expand its POZ Platform drug delivery technology to build a pipeline of product candidates and progress these product candidates through preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of various diseases. About SER-252 (POZ-apomorphine) SER 252 (POZ-apomorphine) is a POZ conjugate of the potent dopamine agonist apomorphine being developed for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and is in preclinical development. SER 252 is designed to provide continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) via a subcutaneous injection delivered one to two times per week. The treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease relies on multiple therapies, including levodopa (L-DOPA), compounds that inhibit the breakdown of L-DOPA in the brain (catechol-O-methyl transferase, or COMT; for example, opicopone), dopamine agonists (transdermal rotigotine; for example, NeuproTM) and others. L-DOPA in escalating doses is the mainstay of therapy for advanced Parkinson’s Disease but is also the proximate cause of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDS), one of the most troubling complications of prolonged high dose L-DOPA therapy. Approximately 90% of Parkinson’s disease patients who use L-DOPA for ten years will develop irreversible LIDS. An infusion therapy known as Apo-go (apomorphine) is available in the European Union, or EU, but is not yet available in the United States. Apo-go must be administered as a 12–16-hour continuous infusion through an electronic pump and a standard insulin infusion set. While effective in reducing daily “OFF” time, and simultaneously increasing daily “ON” time without troublesome dyskinesia, its use frequently requires a healthcare provider to connect the device and infusion set each day and remove it at night. “OFF” time refers to the time period the patient is unable to perform routine daily activities. “ON” time refers to those periods where the patient is able to perform routine daily activities. Apo-go administration is accompanied by significant skin reactions in approximately 40% of patients, often leading to permanent scarring (nodules) on the abdomen. Serina’s preclinical studies in monkeys suggest SER 252 may be administered as a single subcutaneous injection twice a week, provides continuous delivery of apomorphine and has no skin liabilities. Its use is designed to be administered in the convenience of the patient’s home without the need for a healthcare provider. Serina believes that SER 252 may allow some patients to titrate completely off L-DOPA, thus simultaneously addressing the LIDS that is associated with its prolonged use. In early 2018, Serina initiated work on developing a polymer conjugate of apomorphine that could be delivered as a subcutaneous injection that is devoid of any skin reactions. The first step was attachment of apomorphine to the polymer. The chemistry of attachment and controlled release required attachment of ester-linked groups to both of the hydroxyl groups in apomorphine; one ester linkage attaches the apomorphine to the polymer backbone (linking group) and the other ester linkage caps the second hydroxyl (capping group). In the course of these studies, Serina discovered that the rate-limiting step in the release of apomorphine from the polymer was the release of the “capping linker.” After three and a half years of dedicated efforts to control the release kinetics of apomorphine, Serina identified SER 252 as the IND candidate. Importantly, SER 252 provides linear dose kinetics when administered in preclinical multi-dose studies in monkeys. Although studies in humans are required for confirmation, Serina conducted a simulation of human PK based on the results from its preclinical studies in monkeys. The PK parameters of SER 252 in monkeys were modeled with a standard one-compartment fit of the data with V/F (volume of distribution) derived from imputed data from NeuroDerm, Ltd. published human PK on ND0701, an apomorphine product being developed by NeuroDerm; the V/F was 13 L/kg. The simulation demonstrated that doses from 0.25 mg eq Apo/kg to 1 mg eq Apo/kg would cover the PK profile of Apo-go and provide a range of doses that Serina intends to evaluate in early studies in humans. About the POZ PlatformTM Serina’s proprietary POZ technology is based on a synthetic, water soluble, low viscosity polymer called poly(2-oxazoline). Serina’s POZ technology is engineered to provide greater control in drug loading and more precision in the rate of release of attached drugs delivered via subcutaneous injection. The therapeutic agents in Serina’s product candidates are typically well-understood and marketed drugs that are effective but are limited by pharmacokinetic profiles that can include toxicity, side effects and short half-life. Serina believes that by using POZ technology, drugs with narrow therapeutic windows can be designed to maintain more desirable and stable levels in the blood. Serina’s POZ platform delivery technology has potential for use across a broad range of payloads and indications. Serina intends to advance additional applications of the POZ platform via out-licensing, co-development, or other partnership arrangements, including the non-exclusive license agreement with Pfizer, Inc. to use Serina’s POZ polymer technology for use in lipid nanoparticle drug (LNP) delivery formulations.

Movella Announces Nasdaq’s Planned Suspension of Trading of Securities,2024-03-26T22:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Movella Holdings Inc. (MVLA) announces voluntary delisting of its securities from Nasdaq, affecting trading and shareholders.","Movella Announces Nasdaq’s Planned Suspension of Trading of Securities Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Movella Holdings Inc. (MVLA) announces voluntary delisting of its securities from Nasdaq, affecting trading and shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Movella Holdings Inc. regarding its voluntary delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market is a significant event with potential implications for investors and the company's financial strategy. Delisting, in general, can occur for various reasons, including cost savings on listing fees, desire for more privacy, or as a prelude to other strategic moves such as mergers or acquisitions.Investors should note that delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq often leads to reduced liquidity and visibility for a company's securities. This can impact the stock's volatility and the ease with which investors can buy or sell shares. Additionally, institutional investors may have mandates that only allow them to hold securities listed on major exchanges, which could lead to a sell-off if they are required to divest.However, the decision to delist voluntarily suggests that Movella's management may believe that the benefits of being a private company or listing on a different exchange outweigh the costs and benefits of staying on the Nasdaq. This could be due to a strategic pivot that requires less public scrutiny or the pursuit of financial restructuring that might be facilitated by a more private setting. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Movella Holdings Inc.'s delisting could indicate a shift in the company's operational focus or strategic direction. Movella, being a provider of sensors and analytics for digitizing movement, operates in a highly competitive and fast-evolving tech sector. Delisting might allow the company to operate with greater flexibility away from the public eye, which could be advantageous if it's planning to develop new proprietary technologies or undergo significant restructuring.It's also important to consider the market's perception of the delisting. While it may raise questions about the company's financial health or future prospects, it could also be seen as a move to align the company's capital and governance structures with its long-term strategy. The impact on the stock market will largely depend on the reasons behind the delisting and the company's subsequent performance and strategic decisions. Legal Expert Legally, the process of delisting requires adherence to specific SEC regulations and procedures, as indicated by Movella's filing of the Current Report on Form 8-K. This ensures transparency and provides shareholders with relevant information. The company's management must navigate this process carefully to avoid legal pitfalls and ensure compliance with securities laws.Shareholders should be aware that delisting does not absolve the company of its reporting obligations immediately. Movella will still be required to file periodic reports with the SEC unless it further reduces the number of its shareholders below the reporting threshold or takes additional legal steps. It's important for stakeholders to closely monitor these filings for insights into the company's operational and financial health post-delisting. 03/26/2024 - 06:00 PM HENDERSON, Nev., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Movella Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: MVLA) (“Movella” or the “Company”), a leading full-stack provider of sensors, software, and analytics that enable the digitization of movement, announced today that it was notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) of the timing of Nasdaq’s planned suspension of trading of the Company’s securities. As previously disclosed in its Current Report filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 20, 2024 (the “8-K”), the Company notified Nasdaq of the Company’s decision to voluntarily delist its shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”) and its warrants exercisable for one share of Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 (the “Warrants” and together with the Common Stock, the “Securities”) from the Nasdaq Global Market. As disclosed in the 8-K, the Company had expected that the last trading day of the Securities on the Nasdaq Global Market would be on or about April 11, 2024. On March 22, 2024, however, Nasdaq notified the Company that trading of its Securities would be suspended after the Company files a Form 25 with the SEC on April 1, 2024, resulting in the last trading day for the Securities occurring on or about April 1, 2024 instead of on or about April 11, 2024, as previously thought. The Securities will remain listed on Nasdaq while trading is suspended until the effectiveness of the Form 25 filing on or about April 11, 2024, after which time the Securities will be delisted from Nasdaq. Following the delisting of Movella’s Securities from trading on Nasdaq, any trading in the Securities would only occur in privately negotiated sales and potentially on an over‐the‐counter market. Movella expects to have its Securities quoted on a market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (the “OTC”) on April 12th so that a trading market may continue to exist for the Securities. There is no guarantee, however, that a broker will continue to make a market in the Securities or that trading thereof will continue on an OTC market or otherwise. As previously disclosed, Movella’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) considered whether the Company could regain compliance in the given timeframe but decided that attempting to regain compliance was not in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Board made this decision following its review and careful consideration of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the Company’s current and likely future inability to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and the personnel resources and high costs of meeting Nasdaq Global Market disclosure and reporting requirements and related regulatory burdens, costs that have resulted and would continue to result in significant operating expense. In light of these factors, the Board determined that it is in the Company’s best interests that the Company redeploy these resources toward adequately funding the Company’s operations in the future.

The platform, launched in 2023, offers customizable web dashboards for portfolio and lease administration, occupancy utilization, and more. Positive None. Negative None. Information Security Analyst The ISO/IEC 27001 certification is a significant achievement for a data visualization platform like Newlitic, particularly in the realm of corporate real estate. This certification suggests a robust information security management system, which is essential for corporate clients who rely on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their data. In the context of increasing cyber threats and data breaches, Newlitic's certification could enhance its marketability and trustworthiness among prospective and current users.For businesses, the assurance of data security can be a deciding factor when choosing a service provider, especially for those handling sensitive real estate portfolio information. This certification might also give Newlitic a competitive edge over other CRE technologies that lack such accreditation. From a risk management perspective, it could mean fewer data incidents, which can be costly and damaging to a company's reputation. Real Estate Technology Analyst Newlitic's integration of various management reporting needs into a single platform represents a leap forward in efficiency for corporate real estate professionals. The ability to analyze real estate metrics effectively is important for making informed decisions about property investments, lease management and facilities operations. The platform's versatility and scalability suggest that it can cater to a wide range of business sizes and types, potentially disrupting the traditional CRE software market.Furthermore, the addition of NewliticQuest could represent an innovative step in real-time strategic portfolio management. By allowing executives to overlay their strategies onto existing data, Newlitic is positioning itself as not just a reporting tool, but a dynamic planning asset. This functionality may lead to more proactive and agile decision-making in the CRE space.

The ISO/IEC 27001 certification could signal to investors that Newmark is committed to maintaining high standards in product development and client service, potentially affecting the company's stock valuation positively.Investor confidence might be bolstered by the company's apparent focus on innovation and security, two key areas of interest in today's market. If Newlitic gains traction among CRE professionals, it could lead to an increase in recurring revenue for Newmark, given the software as a service (SaaS) model's potential for stable cash flow.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/26/2024 - 07:42 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Standard Uranium Ltd. (“Standard Uranium” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: STND) (OTCQB: STTDF) (Frankfurt: FWB:9SU) is pleased to announce it held its Annual General and Special Meeting of Shareholders (the “Meeting”) on March 26, 2024. At the Meeting, shareholders voted in favour of all business items including setting the number of directors at six (6) and the re-election of directors: Jon Bey, Neil McCallum, Mike Young, Zoya Shashkova, Blair Jordan and Kenneth Judge. Furthermore, the shareholders have approved the re-appointment and remuneration of Manning Elliott LLP as the Company’s auditor for the ensuing year, the re-approval of the Company’s Omnibus Plan, and the approval of continuance resolution set out in Schedule “C” of the Company’s information circular. About Standard Uranium (TSX-V: STND) We find the fuel to power a clean energy future Standard Uranium is a uranium exploration company and emerging project generator poised for discovery in the world’s richest uranium district. The Company holds interest in over 209,867 acres (84,930 hectares) in the world-class Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. Since its establishment, Standard Uranium has focused on the identification, acquisition, and exploration of Athabasca-style uranium targets with a view to discovery and future development. Standard Uranium has successfully completed four joint venture earn in partnerships on their Sun Dog, Canary, Atlantic and Ascent projects totaling over $31M in work commitments over the next three years from 2024-2026. Standard Uranium’s Davidson River Project, in the southwest part of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, comprises ten mineral claims over 30,737 hectares. Davidson River is highly prospective for basement-hosted uranium deposits due to its location along trend from recent high-grade uranium discoveries. However, owing to the large project size with multiple targets, it remains broadly under-tested by drilling. Recent intersections of wide, structurally deformed and strongly altered shear zones provide significant confidence in the exploration model and future success is expected. Standard Uranium’s eight eastern Athabasca projects comprise thirty mineral claims over 32,838 hectares. The eastern basin projects are highly prospective for unconformity related and/or basement hosted uranium deposits based on historical uranium occurrences, recently identified geophysical anomalies, and location along trend from several high-grade uranium discoveries. Standard Uranium's Sun Dog project, in the northwest part of the Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, is comprised of nine mineral claims over 19,603 hectares. The Sun Dog project is highly prospective for basement and unconformity hosted uranium deposits yet remains largely untested by sufficient drilling despite its location proximal to uranium discoveries in the area.

Marathon Oil Corporation Announces Pricing of Offering of $600 Million of Senior Notes Due 2029 and $600 Million of Senior Notes Due 2034,2024-03-26T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Marathon Oil  (MRO) announces a $1.2 billion senior notes offering to repay borrowings, with J.P.

Morgan, Morgan Stanley among book-runners. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Marathon Oil Corporation's recent announcement of a $1.2 billion senior notes offering is a strategic financial move aimed at optimizing the company's capital structure. By issuing debt with fixed interest rates of 5.300% and 5.700% for notes due in 2029 and 2034 respectively, the company is taking advantage of the current interest rate environment to lock in long-term financing costs. This is particularly relevant given the volatile interest rate forecasts and the potential for rate hikes in the future.The decision to repay outstanding borrowings under the company's term loan facility with the net proceeds indicates a shift towards longer maturity debt, which could improve the company's liquidity profile and reduce refinancing risks. Investors should note that such corporate actions might reflect the company's confidence in its future cash flows, considering it is willing to commit to fixed long-term payments. However, the impact on the company's debt-to-equity ratio and overall leverage must be monitored, as excessive debt can lead to financial distress, especially if the company's revenues are subject to commodity price fluctuations. Market Research Analyst Marathon Oil's bond offering can be seen as a reflection of its broader industry's current financial health and investor sentiment towards energy companies. With oil and gas prices having experienced significant volatility, companies within this sector are seeking to strengthen their balance sheets to navigate uncertain market conditions. The choice of joint book-running managers, which includes prominent investment banks, suggests a strong underwriting process and potentially high investor demand for the notes.Investors should consider the industry trends such as energy transition and regulatory changes that could affect the company's profitability and, consequently, its ability to service its debt. While the offering may not directly impact the stock price in the short term, it could be indicative of the company's strategic direction and financial planning, which are critical for long-term valuation. Debt Capital Markets Expert The structure of the debt offering by Marathon Oil is indicative of a well-calibrated approach to managing its capital needs. By diversifying the maturity dates, the company is spreading its repayment obligations over a longer period, which can alleviate pressure on cash flows. The interest rates attached to the notes are competitive and reflect both the company's creditworthiness and the prevailing market conditions.Investors should assess the offering's terms in light of the company's historical performance and credit ratings. The successful closure of this offering could signal to the market that Marathon Oil is taking prudent steps to manage its debt profile. However, it is essential to consider the opportunity cost of this capital restructuring, as the interest payments on the new debt will reduce the funds available for other investments or to return value to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. 03/26/2024 - 05:00 PM HOUSTON, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) (the ""Company"") announced today that it has priced an offering of senior notes in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion, consisting of $600 million principal amount of its 5.300% Senior Notes due 2029 and $600 million principal amount of its 5.700% Senior Notes due 2034. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to fund the repayment in full of outstanding borrowings under the Company's term loan facility. The offering is expected to close on March 28, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc. and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. are acting as Joint Book-Running Managers for the offering.

The center will produce 200mm silicon carbide wafers, expanding materials capacity and meeting the demand for next-gen semiconductors. The investment aims to grow the state's economy by $17.5 billion and create 1,800 jobs by 2030. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The establishment of the John Palmour Manufacturing Center represents a significant expansion for Wolfspeed, with the potential to greatly enhance their production capabilities in the semiconductor industry. The investment in 200mm silicon carbide wafers is a strategic move, as these are larger and more efficient than the traditional 150mm wafers, suggesting a focus on cost reduction and increased productivity. For the semiconductor market, this could lead to more competitive pricing and innovation, particularly in sectors reliant on energy efficiency and advanced technologies such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.Furthermore, the projected economic impact of $17.5 billion over two decades and the creation of 1,800 jobs by 2030 could stimulate local economies and contribute to the broader trend of reshoring manufacturing capabilities in the United States. This aligns with national interests in securing the semiconductor supply chain and fostering technological independence, as emphasized by the CHIPS and Science Act. Investors may view these developments favorably, considering the potential for market growth and the company's alignment with federal initiatives. Financial Analyst Wolfspeed's $5 billion investment in the new manufacturing facility is a long-term strategic commitment that could impact their financials significantly. The capital expenditure is substantial and the return on investment will likely be scrutinized by shareholders and analysts alike. The funding structure, including public and private support, will be critical in assessing the financial risk and the burden on Wolfspeed's balance sheet.As the facility ramps up production, investors should monitor the impact on Wolfspeed's operating margins, given the potential for cost savings from larger wafers and the efficiencies of scale. Additionally, the secured customer agreements with companies like Renesas and Infineon indicate a strong demand forecast for silicon carbide semiconductors, which may lead to an optimistic revenue growth trajectory. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical and market conditions can change rapidly, so the timing of this expansion and its alignment with market demand cycles will be pivotal. Economist The $5 billion investment in the John Palmour Manufacturing Center is a significant event for the North Carolina economy and the U.S. semiconductor industry at large. The creation of 1,800 jobs by 2030 is likely to have a multiplier effect, boosting local employment and potentially attracting ancillary businesses and investment to the region. This could lead to an increase in regional GDP and improve the overall economic health of the area.From a macroeconomic perspective, the investment aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign semiconductor supply chains, which has been a focus due to recent global supply chain disruptions. The anticipated growth in the state's economy and the boost to national semiconductor production capacity are expected to enhance economic resilience and competitiveness. However, the long-term economic benefits will depend on the sustained demand for silicon carbide technology and Wolfspeed's ability to maintain its market leadership amidst increasing global competition. 03/26/2024 - 05:41 PM The John Palmour Manufacturing Center for Silicon Carbide (“the JP”) is a $5 billion investment that will bring jobs, economic growth to North Carolina SILER CITY, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Wolfspeed, Inc.

(KYN) declared a quarterly distribution of $0.22 per share for the fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2024. The distribution is payable on April 12, 2024, to common stockholders. KYN aims to provide a high after-tax total return by investing in Energy Infrastructure Companies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (KYN) of a quarterly distribution of $0.22 per share is a reflection of the company's current financial health and its ability to generate cash flow from its investments in energy infrastructure companies. The distribution amount is a key figure for investors as it directly impacts their yield on investment. The 40% return of capital estimate indicates that a portion of the distribution is not derived from the fund's earnings and profits, which could imply that the fund is returning part of investors' original investment back to them. This could suggest that the fund's income-generating ability may not be fully covering the distribution, which could be a point of concern for long-term sustainability if the trend continues.Moreover, the variability of distribution amounts based on market conditions and portfolio performance is a common feature of closed-end funds, but it also adds an element of uncertainty for investors seeking stable cash flow. The fund's focus on energy infrastructure, a sector known for its volatility due to commodity price fluctuations and regulatory changes, further underscores the importance of understanding the underlying investments and market dynamics. Tax Advisor The tax character of the distributions is an important consideration for investors, particularly for those in higher tax brackets or those seeking tax-efficient income. The preliminary estimate that 40% of the distribution is a return of capital has implications for the investor's tax situation. A return of capital reduces an investor's cost basis in the investment, which can defer taxes until the investment is sold. However, it is also indicative that the fund's distributions are not solely comprised of net investment income or capital gains, which could affect the after-tax return for investors.It is also important for investors to note that the final tax character of the distributions will only be determined after the end of the fiscal year. This uncertainty requires investors to monitor their investments closely and possibly adjust their tax planning strategies once the final information is available. Market Research Analyst The energy infrastructure sector is a critical component of the broader energy market, with specific risks and opportunities. Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund's strategy to invest at least 80% of its total assets in securities of energy infrastructure companies positions it to potentially benefit from the growth in energy demand and infrastructure development. However, this focus also exposes the fund to sector-specific risks, such as changes in energy prices, shifts in regulatory policies and the transition towards renewable energy sources.Investors considering this fund should evaluate the broader energy sector trends, including the move towards decarbonization and the impact of geopolitical events on energy supply and prices. These factors can significantly affect the performance of energy infrastructure investments and, consequently, the fund's ability to maintain its distribution levels and achieve its investment objective of a high after-tax total return. 03/26/2024 - 05:45 PM HOUSTON, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kayne Anderson Energy Infrastructure Fund, Inc.

Lucid Diagnostics Inc. shows revenue growth and expansion in clinical data evidence. Veris Health Inc. focuses on financing from academic and regional cancer centers. Financially, the company had a net loss but positive revenue growth. Positive None. Negative High operating expenses compared to revenue may raise concerns about profitability. Significant net loss and cash decrease from the previous year indicate financial challenges. Reliance on non-GAAP measures for financial reporting may lead to confusion for investors unfamiliar with these metrics. Financial Analyst The reported 33 percent sequential revenue increase for Lucid, a subsidiary of PAVmed, indicates a positive trajectory in commercial performance. This growth, particularly the 829 percent annual increase from the previous year, reflects strong market demand for Lucid's EsoGuard technology. The ability to maintain independence in financing, even amidst challenging market conditions, underscores management's strategic agility and the subsidiary's financial viability.However, the wider financial context for PAVmed reveals a substantial net loss and a significant decrease in cash and cash equivalents year-over-year. While operating expenses have decreased from the previous year, they remain high relative to revenue, suggesting ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. The reliance on non-GAAP measures to provide a more favorable view of financial performance warrants investor scrutiny, particularly as these measures exclude substantial stock-based compensation expenses and other non-cash costs. Medical Technology Market Analyst The strategic shift towards targeting large academic and regional cancer centers for Veris's commercial strategy may tap into a niche market with potential for growth, given the specialized nature of cancer care and the importance of technological advancements in this field. The incubator PMX's role in developing and commercializing portfolio technologies like PortIO, EsoCure and CarpX represents an innovative approach to product development, potentially reducing time-to-market and leveraging existing expertise.Lucid's traction with health fair testing events and the successful adjudication of out-of-network claims are positive indicators for market penetration and reimbursement success. However, the long-term sustainability of such growth will depend on broader insurance coverage, including Medicare and the outcome of ongoing contract negotiations. Healthcare Economist The strategic decision to independently finance subsidiaries like Lucid and Veris aligns with a broader trend in healthcare towards specialized and targeted service delivery. This approach can lead to more efficient allocation of capital and may result in higher returns on investment if these subsidiaries can carve out strong positions in their respective markets.The high volume of EsoGuard revenue growth is indicative of a successful market adoption, yet the healthcare market is notoriously complex, with regulatory hurdles and significant competition. The financial results indicate a substantial investment in R&D and other operating expenses, which is common in the industry but raises questions about the path to profitability. The shift in strategy and the incubator launch are forward-thinking, but they carry inherent risks associated with bringing new technologies to market. 03/26/2024 - 07:32 PM Lucid's quarterly revenue increased 33 percent sequentially Launched wholly-owned incubator, PMX, to complete development and commercialization of existing portfolio technologies Conference call and webcast to be held tomorrow, March 27th at 8:30 AM ET NEW YORK, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- PAVmed Inc. (Nasdaq: PAVM, PAVMZ) (""PAVmed"" or the ""Company""), a diversified commercial-stage medical technology company, operating in the medical device, diagnostics, and digital health sectors, today provided a business update for the Company and its subsidiaries, Lucid Diagnostics Inc.

Business Update Highlights ""We are very pleased by Lucid's sustained ability to translate commercial activity into revenue and revenue growth, which has enabled it to remain independently financeable despite challenging market conditions,"" said Lishan Aklog, M.D., PAVmed's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""PAVmed has revised its overall strategy to drive shareholder value through independently financed subsidiaries, much like we have done with Lucid. In light of this strategic shift, we have concluded that Veris's best opportunity for independent financing lies with a focus on large academic and regional cancer centers. We are finalizing contract negotiations with our first such target in an otherwise robust pipeline. Similarly, the recently-announced launch of our PMX incubator and partnership with Hatch Medical to finance, develop, and commercialize our existing portfolio technologies aligns with this revised strategy. Finally, consistent with this revised strategy, we remain extremely active in seeking out groundbreaking, independently financeable technologies with large market opportunities, agnostic of sector."" Highlights from the fourth quarter and recent weeks include: Yesterday, Lucid reported that 4Q23 EsoGuard revenue was $1.04M, which represents a 33 percent increase sequentially from 3Q23 and an 829 percent annual increase from 4Q22.Lucid's high-volume #CYFT health fair testing events continue to gain traction with a robust roster of events scheduled through July.Payors now allowing approximately half of Lucid's out-of-network adjudicated EsoGuard claims, with an average allowable amount of approximately $1,800.Lucid significantly expanded its clinical validity and clinical utility data evidence to support broad EsoGuard medical policy coverage, including Medicare.In order to facilitate an independent financing into Veris, consistent with PAVmed's revised strategy, Veris shifted its commercial strategy to target large academic and regional cancer centers, with first such engagement expected in the very near-term and a robust pipeline to follow.Veris held its final, successful FDA pre-submission meeting for its implantable cardiac and physiologic monitor, designed to be implanted in conjunction with a vascular access port. The implantable monitor now has a clear path to FDA submission and 510(k) clearance once Veris secures independent financing.Consistent with PAVmed's revised strategy, PAVmed launched a wholly-owned incubator, PMX, to complete development and commercialization of existing portfolio technologies, including PortIO, EsoCure, and CarpX. PMX and Hatch Medical, a medical device incubator and technology brokerage firm with decades of success, executed a joint venture agreement to advance these technologies. Beginning with PortIO, PAVmed will seek to independently finance a separate subsidiary of the PMX incubator to develop and commercialize each technology.Financial Results: For the three months ended December 31, 2023, revenues were $1.0 million, while for the year ended December 31, 2023, revenues were $2.5 million.

In addition, management believes non-GAAP financial measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods.A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and 2022 are as follows: Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations (Unaudited) For the three months ended December 31, For the years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands except per-share amounts) Revenue $ 1,049 $ 112 $ 2,452 $ 377 Operating expenses 17,434 24,712 71,247 91,464 Other (Income) Expense 1,023 (28) 10,468 12,151 Net Loss 17,408 24,572 79,263 103,238 Net income (loss) per common share, basic and diluted $ (1.98) $ (3.31) $ (9.16) $ (15.03) Net loss attributable to common stockholders (15,904) (20,531) (66,270) (89,264) Preferred Stock dividends and deemed dividends 1,868 72 2,095 281 Net income (loss) as reported (14,036) (20,459) (64,175) (88,983) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization expense1 725 726 2,932 2,457 Interest expense, net2 (81) 126 84 1,112 NCI ownership share of Interest and Depreciation adjustments (133) (139) (608) (452) EBITDA (13,525) (19,746) (61,767) (85,866) Other non-cash or financing related expenses: Stock-based compensation expense3 1,968 4,949 11,139 19,532 ResearchDx acquisition/settlement paid in stock1 — 226 713 653 Change in FV convertible debt2 255 (466) 6,026 1,273 Offering costs convertible debt2 — — 1,186 4,332 Loss on debt extinguishment2 750 312 3,782 5,434 Other non-cash charges — — — 82 NCI ownership share of non-GAAP adjustments (103) (913) (2,860) (3,658) Non-GAAP adjusted (loss) $ (10,655) $ (15,638) $ (41,781) $ (58,218) Basic and Diluted shares outstanding 8,014 6,206 7,232 5,938 Non-GAAP adjusted (loss) income per share $(1.33) $(2.52) $(5.78) $(9.80) 1 Included in general and administrative expenses in the financial statements. 2 Included in other income and expenses. 3 Stock-based compensation (""SBC"") expense included in operating expenses is detailed as follows in the table below by category within operating expenses for the non-GAAPNet operating expenses: Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Expenses to Non-GAAP Net Operating Expenses (in thousands except per-share amounts) For the three months ended December 31, For the years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Cost of revenue $ 1,610 $ 1,618 $ 6,420 $ 3,614 Stock-based compensation expense3 (35) (7) (122) (16) Net cost of revenue 1,575 1,611 6,298 3,598 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 505 505 2,021 1,784 Sales and marketing 4,690 5,759 17,583 19,318 Stock-based compensation expense3 (413) (605) (1,715) (2,464) Net sales and marketing 4,277 5,154 15,868 16,854 General and administrative 7,033 10,156 30,947 41,410 Depreciation expense (220) (221) (911) (673) ResearchDx acquisition/settlement paid in stock — (226) (713) (653) Stock-based compensation expense3 (1,175) (3,985) (7,935) (16,001) Net general and administrative 5,638 5,724 21,388 24,083 Research and development 3,596 6,674 14,276 25,338 Stock-based compensation expense3 (345) (352) (1,367) (1,051) Net research and development 3,251 6,322 12,909 24,287 Total operating expenses 17,434 24,712 71,247 91,464 Depreciation and amortization expense (725) (726) (2,932) (2,457) ResearchDx acquisition/settlement paid in stock — (226) (713) (653) Stock-based compensation expense3 (1,968) (4,949) (11,139) (19,532) Net operating expenses $ 14,741 $ 18,811 $ 56,463 $ 68,822 About PAVmed and its Subsidiaries PAVmed Inc. is a diversified commercial-stage medical technology company operating in the medical device, diagnostics, and digital health sectors.

Accordingly, Equity cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Equity believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Equity’s expectations include competition from other financial institutions and bank holding companies; the effects of and changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in the demand for loans; fluctuations in value of collateral and loan reserves; inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; and acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses; and similar variables. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in Equity’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 7, 2024, and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Equity’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

FCPT Announces Acquisition of a Heartland Dental Property for $2.0 million,2024-03-26T20:38:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) acquires a Heartland Dental property in Alabama for $2.0 million, enhancing its portfolio with a strong retail asset under a net lease.","FCPT Announces Acquisition of a Heartland Dental Property for $2.0 million Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) acquires a Heartland Dental property in Alabama for $2.0 million, enhancing its portfolio with a strong retail asset under a net lease. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The acquisition of a Heartland Dental property by Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) for $2.0 million reflects a strategic investment in a net-leased asset within the healthcare sector. A net lease typically involves the tenant paying most, if not all, of the property expenses, which can include real estate taxes, building insurance and maintenance, making it an attractive investment for REITs. The reported 7.7% cap rate is a key indicator of the property's potential yield and suggests a favorable return relative to current market conditions, where cap rates for similar properties might hover around the 5-6% range. This acquisition aligns with FCPT's portfolio strategy, potentially providing stable, long-term income streams and diversification benefits. Healthcare Investment Analyst From a healthcare investment perspective, the acquisition of a property leased to Heartland Dental, one of the largest dental support organizations in the U.S., signals FCPT's confidence in the healthcare real estate market. The dental industry has proven to be recession-resistant and has shown consistent growth due to increasing demand for dental services and an aging population. The location of the property in a strong retail corridor is advantageous, as it ensures high visibility and foot traffic, which are important factors for healthcare facilities. This investment could be seen as a hedge against economic downturns, given the non-cyclical nature of healthcare spending. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications of this transaction, the investment in a corporate-operated Heartland Dental property indicates a low-risk profile with a predictable cash flow due to the remaining lease term of approximately four years. The initial yield of 7.7% is particularly attractive, especially when considering the low-interest-rate environment that has prevailed in recent years. Investors should note, however, that the actual return on investment will be affected by transaction costs, which were not disclosed. Additionally, the long-term success of this investment will largely depend on the property's performance post-lease term and FCPT's ability to renegotiate the lease or find a new tenant without significant vacancy periods. 03/26/2024 - 04:38 PM MILL VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE:FCPT), a real estate investment trust primarily engaged in the ownership and acquisition of high-quality, net-leased restaurant and retail properties (“FCPT” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce the acquisition of a Heartland Dental property for $2.0 million. The property is located in a strong retail corridor in Alabama and is corporate-operated under a net lease with approximately four years of term remaining. The transaction was priced at a 7.7% cap rate on rent as of the closing date, exclusive of transaction costs.

(NASDAQ:WVVI) reports a loss per common share after preferred dividends, with increased net sales revenues in 2023 compared to 2022. Gross profit and operating expenses also saw notable changes, influenced by factors like direct sales and tasting room sales. Positive Net sales revenues increased by 15.3% in 2023 compared to 2022. Gross profit rose by 19.9% in 2023 over the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 22.7% in 2023. Loss from operations increased by $660,784 in 2023 compared to 2022. Jim Bernau, Founder and CEO, highlights the positive impact of increased gross profit and operational cash flow in 2023. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in net sales revenues for Willamette Valley Vineyards is a positive signal, indicating a robust demand for their products, particularly from direct sales which saw a significant jump. This suggests effective marketing strategies and a strong brand presence in the market. However, the rising selling, general and administrative expenses, especially from tasting rooms, highlights the cost-intensive nature of such sales channels. While they can provide a unique customer experience and strengthen brand loyalty, they also come with higher operational costs.Furthermore, the mention of higher depreciation costs linked to new retail locations suggests a strategic expansion. This is a double-edged sword; on one hand, it positions the company for future growth, but on the other, it pressures current profitability. Investors should weigh the potential long-term benefits of these assets against the short-term financial strain. Financial Analyst The reported loss per common share increase is a concern, as it reflects a widening gap between profitability and shareholder returns. The higher preferred stock dividends also imply that common shareholders are facing dilution or a potential reduction in their share of future earnings. This could affect investor sentiment and the stock's attractiveness.On the flip side, the CEO's statement about the subsiding inflationary pressure points to improved cost management, which could be a sign of a stronger financial stance in the future. This, coupled with the reported improvement in cash from operations, may provide some reassurance to investors about the company's ability to manage cash flow and invest in growth despite current losses. Wine Industry Analyst The increase in revenue from direct sales strongly suggests that Willamette Valley Vineyards is capitalizing on the trend of consumer-direct sales, which have been gaining traction in the wine industry. This channel often yields higher margins and can be a critical factor in building direct relationships with consumers. The CEO's confidence in the new retail assets as a hedge against market contraction indicates a strategic move to enhance the customer experience and brand resilience in uncertain market conditions.However, the wine industry is known for its sensitivity to economic cycles and consumer discretionary spending. The company's performance must be monitored for its ability to sustain growth and manage costs in a highly competitive and potentially volatile market. 03/26/2024 - 05:30 PM SALEM, Ore., March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Willamette Valley Vineyards, Inc. (NASDAQ:WVVI) (the ""Company""), a leading Oregon producer of Pinot Noir, generated a loss per common share after preferred dividends of $0.65 and $0.51 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $0.14, or 29.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. The primary reason for this increase was an increase in net loss and higher preferred stock dividends in 2023 compared to 2022. The Company had net sales revenues of $39,136,114 and $33,934,081 for the years December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $5,202,033, or 15.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period primarily as a result of an increase in revenue from direct sales of $4,786,730, or 30.4% in 2023 compared to 2022, and an increase in revenue from sales to distributors of $415,303 or 2.3% in 2023 compared to 2022. Gross profit was $22,557,128 and $18,814,096 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $3,743,032 or 19.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was generally driven by an increase in sales revenues in 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $23,764,330 and $19,360,514 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $4,403,816, or 22.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 over the prior year period. This increase was primarily as a result of more sales coming from tasting rooms which have higher selling costs and from newer locations being open for longer in 2023. Loss from operations was $1,207,202 and $546,418 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, an increase of $660,784, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior year period. This increase included higher depreciation costs of $1,232,459 in 2023 mostly relating to the investment in new locations. Jim Bernau, Founder and CEO of the Company said ""I believe that our gross profit increasing by approximately 20% in 2023 over 2022 relative to our sales growth of approximately 15% over that same period signals that the substantial inflationary pressure that previously impacted the Company's costs of growing, making and selling our wines has subsided. Cash from operations improved in 2023, while higher depreciation expenses from the deployment of new retail assets reduced the Company's net profits. In the event that the wine market changes and contracts, I believe that these new retails assets will aid the Company in ensuring that our brands remain compelling to wine consumers.""

Income from operations and net income decreased in Q4 2023 compared to the previous year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income also declined in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total loan amount facilitated and originated by X Financial is a positive indicator of the company's growth trajectory. However, the quarter-over-quarter decline in the fourth quarter may signal a strategic shift or response to external market pressures. The uptick in delinquency rates is concerning as it could affect the company's loan performance and profitability. Investors should monitor how these rates evolve in comparison to industry averages, as higher delinquency may necessitate increased provisions for loan losses, potentially impacting future earnings.While the year-over-year growth in net revenue and net income is commendable, the quarter-over-quarter decline in net income and the significant drop in net income per ADS could affect investor sentiment. The management's commitment to profitable growth and dividends is reassuring, but the actual ability to maintain profitability in the face of rising delinquencies will be critical to watch. The company's conservative approach for 2024 might be a strategic move to strengthen its position in uncertain market conditions. Market Research Analyst The financial results of X Financial reflect broader trends in the Chinese online personal finance industry, including regulatory changes and economic shifts. The reported increase in other revenues, particularly from referral services and guarantee income, suggests diversification of revenue streams, which is a positive development for the company's resilience. However, the increase in origination and servicing expenses indicates that growth is accompanied by higher operational costs, which could squeeze margins if not managed effectively.The company's performance must also be contextualized within the Chinese regulatory environment, which has seen tightening measures in the fintech sector. The management's acknowledgment of a stable regulatory environment and a commitment to aligning with government efforts to promote economic recovery indicates a strategic alignment that could benefit the company if executed well. Nevertheless, the actual impact of these strategic decisions on the company's market share and competitive positioning will be vital for long-term success. Risk Management Analyst The reported increase in delinquency rates for loans past due both for 31-60 days and 91-180 days is a red flag for risk management. It suggests that X Financial's loan portfolio may be experiencing increased borrower default risk, which could lead to higher credit losses. The proactive reduction in loan volumes in response to this risk is a prudent measure, but it also raises questions about the company's underwriting standards and the economic health of its borrower base.Investors should consider the company's impairment losses on long-term investments and the health of its investment in Newup Bank of Liaoning. While the company remains optimistic about this investment, the market valuation's impact on financials is an area of concern. The emphasis on strengthening the risk management system is crucial, as it directly impacts asset quality and, subsequently, the company's financial stability and reputation. 03/26/2024 - 04:50 PM SHENZHEN, China, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- X Financial (NYSE: XYF) (the ""Company"" or ""we""), a leading online personal finance company in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

In 2023, we facilitated and originated 43% more loans than in 2022 and delivered notable year-over-year growth in both revenue and profit. Total net revenue increased 35% on an annual basis, while income from operations increased 33%, and net income improved by 46%. However, as we entered the second half of 2023, particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced increased risk levels in asset quality. While we strengthened our risk control system and implemented various measures to manage delinquency rates, we also made the strategic decision to proactively reduce loan volumes in the fourth quarter, prioritizing profitability over sheer volume growth."" ""For fiscal year 2024, our strategic approach will remain consistent and somewhat conservative, aligning with current market conditions in China. We believe the regulatory environment has become stable, and the government is committed to promoting economic recovery. However, we recognize that challenges and uncertainties exist as the country undergoes a transformative shift in its economic growth model away from the rapid expansion of the past, and structural adjustments are imperative. All of this has far-reaching impacts on various sectors, including our targeted market. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to executing our strategy and prioritizing profitable growth. Our commitment to delivering value to shareholders is unwavering, and we intend to pay dividends as and when profitability and smooth operations allow. This overall approach reflects our dedication to navigating the evolving economic landscape while ensuring the sustainable success of our business and returning value to our shareholders."" Mr. Kent Li, President of the Company, added, ""During the fourth quarter of 2023, our total loan amount facilitated and originated was RMB26 billion, a 20% year-over-year increase but an 11% quarter-over-quarter decline. Delinquency rates for loans past due for 31-60 days and 91-180 days were 1.57% and 3.12%, respectively, at the end of the quarter, compared with 1.02% and 1.93%, respectively, a year ago. Our team remains vigilant in monitoring asset dynamics and has taken further steps to mitigate risk by reducing our exposure to higher risk areas and adjusting our business approach to ensure sustainable profitability. We aim for continued gradual improvement over the course of 2024, and these measures have begun to have a positive impact on our risk indicators."" Mr. Frank Fuya Zheng, Chief Financial Officer of the Company, added, ""We are pleased to deliver solid financial results in 2023. Total net revenue increased by 35% year-over-year to RMB4.8 billion, and net income rose by 46% to approximately RMB1.2 billion. In response to heightened asset quality risks in the fourth quarter, we proactively reduced loan volumes to safeguard profitability, resulting in a 15% sequential decline in total net revenue for the quarter. We recognized RMB26.9 million and RMB46.8 million of impairment losses on long-term investments related to our indirect investment in Newup Bank of Liaoning in 2022 and 2023, respectively, mainly due to the depreciation in the market valuation of the Chinese banking sector. However, the bank's loan portfolio and operations remain healthy, and we believe it continues to be a good investment for us. Looking ahead, we will not pursue pure loan volume growth at the expense of profitability, which is always our strategic focus to ensure long-term growth and returns to shareholders. We will continue to strengthen our risk management system to improve asset quality and balance our revenue and profitability growth.""

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Statement In evaluating our business, we consider and use non-GAAP measures as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. We present the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates investors' assessment of our operating performance and help investors to identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income (loss) from operations and net income (loss). We also believe that the non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We use in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted net income, (ii) adjusted net income per basic ADS, and (iii) adjusted net income per diluted ADS, each of which excludes share-based compensation expense, impairment losses on financial investments, income (loss) from financial investments and impairment losses on long-term investments. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The company highlighted its transformative year, strategic growth objectives, and collaboration with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. LuxUrban also discussed surrendering underperforming properties and enhancing its working capital profile for 2024. The company entered into a surety bond agreement to secure future leases and provided an update on its 2024 guidance and enhanced audit procedures. Positive LuxUrban Hotels Inc. reported a substantial increase in net rental revenue for 2023, reaching approximately $114.0 million compared to $43.8 million in 2022, driven by an expansion in available units and improved TRevPAR. EBITDA rose to approximately $30.6 million from $14.3 million, showcasing a significant growth in operational profitability. Adjusted EBITDA also saw a notable increase to approximately $35.0 million from $14.3 million, reflecting the company's improved financial performance. The company emphasized its strategic growth initiatives, including enhancing its working capital profile, focusing on higher-end properties, and improving Total RevPAR and operating margins. LuxUrban entered into a surety bond agreement to secure up to $10 million in surety bonds for future leases, aiming to support its growth and credit profile. The company provided an update on its 2024 priorities, highlighting its commitment to increasing its hotel portfolio, generating higher TRevPAR, improving EBITDA, and enhancing its cash flow profile. LuxUrban announced enhanced audit procedures and a delayed 10-K filing to ensure transparency and compliance with best practices in risk and audit procedures. The company decided not to host an earnings call in connection with its results due to ongoing audit procedures and the filing status of the 10-K, focusing on timely disclosures of material information. LuxUrban's business model focuses on securing long-term operating rights for hotels through Master Lease Agreements and renting out hotel rooms to travelers, with a strategic partnership with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. The company provided non-GAAP financial metrics including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, cash net income, and adjusted cash net income to evaluate and manage its business, highlighting its commitment to profitable, long-term growth. Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial rise in net rental revenue and EBITDA for LuxUrban Hotels Inc. reflects a strong year-over-year operational performance. The shift in strategy towards higher-end properties and the shedding of underperforming assets are strategic moves to improve the company's revenue quality and operating margins. The collaboration with Wyndham could provide a competitive edge in marketing and distribution, potentially enhancing the company's brand recognition and customer reach.The significant increase in net loss, however, raises questions about the sustainability of growth and the effectiveness of the current business model. The surety bond agreement indicates a proactive approach to financing growth, but the reliance on such instruments may also signal underlying challenges in cash flow generation. The reduction in total debt is a positive sign, suggesting management's focus on balance sheet health.For investors, the key takeaway is the company's aggressive growth trajectory and its impact on financial stability. While the expansion and strategic partnerships could yield long-term benefits, the near-term financials indicate a period of investment and transition that requires careful monitoring. Market Research Analyst LuxUrban's operational pivot towards high-end properties aligns with broader industry trends favoring quality over quantity. This strategy, combined with the partnership with Wyndham, positions LuxUrban to potentially capture a more affluent demographic. The focus on properties with higher Total RevPAR is indicative of a targeted approach to revenue maximization.However, the hospitality industry is highly competitive and sensitive to economic fluctuations. The company's performance must be contextualized within the broader market dynamics, including travel trends and consumer spending patterns. Investors should consider the risks associated with LuxUrban's expansion strategy, particularly in light of the increased net losses and the ongoing need for capital to fund growth.Overall, LuxUrban's strategy reflects a nuanced understanding of the hospitality market's current state and a calculated bet on its future direction. The success of this bet will depend on the company's ability to execute its growth strategy without compromising financial health. Economist The reported financials of LuxUrban Hotels Inc. come at a time when the hospitality sector is navigating post-pandemic recovery and shifting consumer preferences. The company's decision to streamline its portfolio and concentrate on higher-end properties suggests an anticipation of increased demand in this market segment. The reduction in total debt and the strategic use of surety bonds for lease acquisitions are reflective of a conscious effort to manage liquidity and solvency risks.However, the reported net loss warrants attention. While it is not uncommon for companies in growth phases to incur losses, the scale and trend of these losses merit scrutiny. The company's long-term financial health will hinge on its ability to translate its strategic initiatives into sustainable profit margins. Furthermore, the reliance on non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can sometimes obscure the real costs of expansion and should be analyzed in conjunction with GAAP measures for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial position.Investors should be cognizant of macroeconomic factors such as interest rates, inflation and consumer confidence, which could impact the hospitality sector's recovery trajectory and, by extension, LuxUrban's performance. 03/26/2024 - 05:29 PM 2023 Net Rental Revenue Increased to Approximately $114.0 Million from $43.8 Million EBITDA Rose to Approximately $30.6 Million from $14.3 Million Adjusted EBITDA Rose to Approximately $35.0 Million from $14.3 Million MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LuxUrban Hotels Inc.

As further discussed herein, the completion of the Company’s audit for 2023 includes additional procedures that are in process. While management believes the results herein will not materially change following completion of the audit, the information presented herein cannot be deemed final until the filing of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on the preliminary results set forth herein. “2023 was a transformative year for LuxUrban,” said Brian Ferdinand, Chairman of the Board. “We increased our portfolio of hotel properties under long-term Master Lease Agreement, increased net rental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by 160% and 146%, respectively, and signed a groundbreaking collaboration agreement with Wyndham that provides financial, brand, and operating support to advance our growth objectives on our existing portfolio.” Mr. Ferdinand further stated, “We have an unwavering commitment to elevating LuxUrban’s industry profile and expanding the adoption of our distinct and successful operating model. In a little more than 18 months, we have grown from a newly public start up to an evolving and maturing operator of a wide range of hotel properties in destination cities. In that time, we have learned a lot and have gained a better understanding of the inherent opportunities and complexities of our industry. Although there is still much work to be done, we have responded in kind so that we may fully capitalize on these prospects while both addressing the concerns of and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. We added industry veterans Elan Blutinger and Kim Schaefer to the Board of Directors, and Robert Arigo as Chief Operating Officer. We remain focused on attracting the management, personnel, and capital necessary to execute on our vision and reach our full potential.” “Following a period of significant expansion, we have adopted a more strategic approach to growth in 2024 with a focus on improving our working capital profile, receivables, and free cash flow,” said Shanoop Kothari, Co-CEO and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kothari further stated, “Our pipeline of potential operating rights acquisitions remains strong, and we expect to continue to increase our portfolio of hotels under long-term Master Lease Agreement throughout release entitled end, we have taken an important step to finance future lease acquisitions by entering into a master collateral trust agreement that provides us with up to an aggregate of $10 million in surety bonds that can be used to fund deposit requirements under long-term hotel leases (see the section of this release entitled, “Surety Bond Agreement”). “We intend to focus on higher end (3.5 star to 4.5 star) properties and adopt a slower pace of acquisitions allowing us to better absorb the impact of our growth on working capital. We have recently surrendered certain underperforming leases in our non-core market that had created a drag on our operating results and represented in total less than 200 keys. These properties are lower star, smaller in size, lower occupancy and of shorter remaining lease terms. As a result of this, we expect that Total RevPAR1 and operating margins will improve from 2023 levels.” As a result of the transition to the Wyndham platform in the fourth quarter of 2023, net rental revenue for Q4 and full year 2023 reflected a one-time negative impact of approximately $5 million from the onboarding of the Company’s initial hotels to the Wyndham platform (“Wyndham Transition”), during which time these hotel rooms were not available for rent. As of January 1, 2024, the initial properties were onboarded to the Wyndham platform. Select Preliminary Unaudited Full Year 2023 Financial Results Overview All comparisons are to the full year ended December 31, 2022 (“FY 2022”) as audited unless otherwise stated. Net rental revenue rose 160% to approximately $114.0 million from $43.8 million, driven by an increase in average units available to rent to 1,249 from 487, as well as an improvement in TRevPAR. Adjusted for the impact for the Wyndham Transition, net rental revenue was approximately $119 million for 2023. TRevPAR improved to approximately $250 from $247; as adjusted for the Wyndham transition, TRevPAR for 2023 was $261. Net loss was approximately $65.2 million, compared to a net loss of $9.4 million. Adjusted for the impact for the Wyndham Transition, net loss was approximately $60.8 million. EBITDA increased to approximately $30.6 million from $14.3 million. Pro-forma the impact for the Wyndham transition, Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $35.0 million from $14.3 million. Cash Net Income adjusted for non-cash items including the surrender of deposits, as well as bad debt expense, was $1.6 million as compared to $5.6 million in 2022. Adjusted for the impact of the Wyndham Transition and the estimated costs for the exit of the apartment rental business and restructuring, Cash Net Income was $15.3 million. Total debt declined to approximately $4.3 million from total debt of $14.0 million. Select Preliminary Unaudited Q4 2023 Financial Results Overview All comparisons are to the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022 (“Q4 2022”) unless otherwise stated. Net rental revenue rose 117% to approximately $28.2 million from $12.9 million, driven by an increase in average units available to rent to 1,548 from 680, as well as improved TRevPAR. Net rental revenue pro-forma for the impact of the Wyndham transition for Q4 2023 would have risen 156% to approximately $33.2 million from $12.9 million Adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $6.2 million from $5.9 million. Pro forma for the impact of the Wyndham transition, adjusted EBITDA increased to approximately $10.7 million from $5.9 million Property Summary As of December 31, 2023, the Company leased 18 properties with 1,599 units available for rent In March of 2024, the Company surrendered four properties that had created a consistent drag on its operating results, the characteristics of which included: 1) demonstrated poor performance, 2) in markets that have deteriorated since the signing of the lease, 3) possessed suboptimal size and scale, and 4) of a quality that could create other risks to the Company. In addition, in late 2023, the Company decided to not move forward on a previously agreed to Master Lease Agreement due to repairs not being completed by the landlord. As a result of this, the Company wrote off approximately $3.0 million in security deposits and accrued $2.8 million in potential claims against the Company. These costs are included in the results above. After giving pro forma effect to the surrender of these properties, at December 31, 2023, the Company leased 14 properties with 1,406 units available for rent, with an average weighted lease term of 14.2 years and 19.0 years, including extension options ____________________________________________________________ 1The Company defines Total RevPAR (or TRevPAR) as total revenue received by the Company inclusive of room rental rates, ancillary fees (which include but are not limited to resort fees, late/early check-in, baggage fees, parking fees paid to us, and upgrade fees), cancellation fees, taxes (including other pass-through expenses) and other miscellaneous income received by the Company, divided by the average available rooms for rent during a given period. Surety Bond Agreement In March 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to secure surety bonds for future leases. The provider of the bond is currently rated A+ by A.M. Best (Superior). The agreement will provide the Company with up to an aggregate of $10 million in surety bonds that can be used to fund deposit requirements under long-term hotel leases. The bonds have a 70% collateral requirement. For example, a $1,000,000 bond would require us to maintain a collateral position of $700,000, which can be deposited in either cash or in the form of a letter of credit. In addition to collateral, we entered into an agreement of indemnity with the provider. The bonds will cost 2.5% of the penalty amount of each bond annually. The terms of this agreement are reviewed annually and the Company believes as its continues to grow and improve its credit profile, the amount it is required to post will decrease over time while the size of the facility will increase over time. The Company anticipates this will fulfill in most instances where accepted by landlord the entire upfront deposit on an absolute dollar basis in connection with various key money arrangements the Company has entered into or is contemplating. “This is a significant step to institutionally capitalize the business,"" said Mr. Kothari. “We have made significant strides in growing the business and believe that the willingness of a highly rated surety bond provider to back LuxUrban is an indication of its support of the Company and a validation of our business model."" 2024 Guidance Update For full year 2024, the Company has committed the following priorities: increase its portfolio of hotels under long term Master Lease Agreement with a focus on higher-quality 3.5 star to 4.5-star properties generate increased TRevPAR compared to 2023, driven by portfolio expansion, the addition of 3.5 star to 4.5-star properties to the portfolio, and an increase in ancillary revenues generate increased EBITDA compared to 2023 improve its working capital profile, receivables, and cash flow profile by adopting a slower pace of acquisitions, increasing Total RevPAR, and realizing the benefits of the above referenced surrender of certain underperforming leases Although the Company believes that its prior guidance for 2024 is achievable, its ability to do so may be impacted by the above-referenced priorities and other corporate initiatives. The Company expects to quantify its 2024 guidance later this year. Institutes Enhanced Audit Procedures; Updates 10-K Filing Timeline On the recommendation of the Audit Committee and with the full support of management, the Company has expanded its annual audit procedures as part of its adoption of a more robust best practices risk and audit procedures protocol. This review is consistent with its commitment to full transparency regarding its operations. The Company has engaged Grassi Advisors and Accountants, its independent registered public accounting firm, to conduct a thorough internal review of certain aspects of the Company’s operations. Due to the expanded nature of the audit and time required to complete it, the Company plans to file a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for a 15-day grace period for the filing of its Form 10-K. The Company believes that this expanded audit procedure will be completed in time so that it may file its Form 10-K within the 15-day grace period. As of the date of this release, there have been no disagreements between the Company and its auditors, or reason to believe the audit will not close within this time frame. The Company does not expect material changes to its operating financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 as a result of the completion of its audit, including with respect to these expanded audit procedures. Investor Call In light of the ongoing, enhanced audit procedures and the filing status of the 10-K, the Company will not host an earnings call in connection with these results, and the event previously scheduled for March 27, 2024 at 10:00 AM EDT has been cancelled. Management will continue to make timely disclosures of material information regarding the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the completion of the expanded audit process, and any other corporate developments. LuxUrban Hotels Inc. LuxUrban Hotels Inc. secures long-term operating rights for entire hotels through Master Lease Agreements (MLA) and rents out, on a short-term basis, hotel rooms to business and vacation travelers. The Company is strategically building a portfolio of hotel properties in destination cities by capitalizing on the dislocation in commercial real estate markets and the large amount of debt maturity obligations on those assets coming due with a lack of available options for owners of those assets. LuxUrban’s MLA allows owners to hold onto their assets and retain their equity value while LuxUrban operates and owns the cash flows of the operating business for the life of the MLA. Through its partnership with Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, the largest hotel company in the world by rooms, LuxUrban gains several competitive advantages including joint branding for marketing, sales, and distribution, capital allocation from Wyndham for each hotel it acquires, and ongoing customer support and training across its portfolio. Non-GAAP Information The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes and other taxes, interest and financing costs, non-cash compensation expense, non-cash expenses associated with common stock issuance and stock options, non-cash rent expense amortization, depreciation and amortization, non-cash financing costs, costs associated with its exit from SoBeNY, incremental processing and channel financing fees, legacy union costs, non-cash write offs associated with its exit from the apartment rental business, and bad debt expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less the estimated impact of the Wyndham transition. The Company defines cash net income as net income (loss) before non-cash stock compensation expense, non-cash expenses associated with common stock issuance and stock options, non-cash rent amortization expense, accrued taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash financing costs, and non-cash write off associated with its exit from the apartment rental business. Adjusted cash net income is defined as cash net income less costs associated with the Company’s exit from SoBeNY and bad debt expense. The Company seeks to achieve profitable, long-term growth by monitoring and analyzing key operating metrics, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, cash net income, and adjusted cash net income. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial metrics and related computations to evaluate and manage the business and to plan and make near and long-term operating and strategic decisions. The management team believes these non-GAAP financial metrics are useful to investors to provide supplemental information in addition to the GAAP financial results. Management reviews the use of its primary key operating metrics from time-to-time. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, cash net income, and adjusted cash net income are not intended to be a substitute for any GAAP financial measure and as calculated, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of performance of other companies in other industries or within the same industry. The Company’s management team believes it is useful to provide investors with the same financial information that it uses internally to make comparisons of historical operating results, identify trends in underlying operating results, and evaluate its business. For purposes of the guidance provided herein for the year ended December 31, 2024, however, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures for future periods, which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Attached to this release is a preliminary reconciliation of the nonGAAP measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, cash net income and adjusted net income to net loss, which management believes are the nearest correlated GAAP measures. This reconciliation is based on the preliminary unaudited data presented in this release and should not be relied upon. The Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 will contain a final reconciliation when filed with the SEC. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use EBITDA and cash net income as non-GAAP financial measures. We define EBITDA and cash net income above in the paragraph entitled “Non-GAAP Information.” The following table provides reconciliation of our preliminary unaudited net income (loss) to EBITDA and cash net income.

Announces Pricing of US$350 Million 9.125% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Algoma Steel Group Inc. announced the pricing of US$350 million aggregate principal amount of 9.125% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2029 by its subsidiary, Algoma Steel Inc. The Notes will be issued at a price of 100% of their face amount, with an interest rate of 9.125% per year, providing financial flexibility for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Algoma Steel Inc.'s Senior Secured Second Lien Notes at an interest rate of 9.125% is indicative of the company's credit standing and the current market conditions. In a stable economic environment, such a high-interest rate may suggest that lenders perceive a higher risk associated with the company. Investors should consider the implications this may have on the company's debt servicing costs and overall financial health.Further, the use of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes is a broad designation and stakeholders might seek more specificity to gauge the potential impact on the company's operations. For example, if the funds are used for deleveraging high-interest debt, it could be a positive sign. However, if used for operational losses, it could be a concern.It's also noteworthy that the notes are being issued at 100% of their face value, which means there is no discount to investors at the time of purchase. The guarantee by ASI's parent company and subsidiaries creates a senior secured position, which could be seen as a measure to attract investors by offering a higher degree of security for their investment. Debt Market Analyst Investors in the fixed income space will note that the 9.125% interest rate on Algoma's Notes is significantly higher than the average for industrial companies, which could reflect the specific risk profile of the steel industry and Algoma's financials. The steel industry is cyclical and can be highly sensitive to economic downturns, trade policies and input costs, such as iron ore and coal. These factors could be contributing to the perceived risk and the resultant interest rate.From a market perspective, the closing of this offering will add to the company's liquidity and may provide the flexibility needed to navigate the volatile steel market. However, the long-term impact on the company's balance sheet and interest coverage ratios should be closely monitored, as the high-interest rate could become a burden if the company's earnings do not keep pace with its debt obligations. Market Research Analyst The decision to issue Senior Secured Second Lien Notes also reflects the company's position in the competitive landscape of the steel industry. Given that the industry is capital intensive, Algoma's move to strengthen its balance sheet could be in preparation for future capital expenditures or to cushion against potential downturns. Investors should be aware of the company's strategic plans and capital allocation to assess whether the debt issuance aligns with long-term growth initiatives or merely serves short-term liquidity needs.Additionally, the guarantee by the parent company and subsidiaries could be seen as a commitment to the subsidiary's operations and its strategic importance to the overall corporate structure. This might provide some assurance to note holders regarding the prioritization of their claims in the event of financial distress. 03/26/2024 - 05:30 PM SAULT STE.

(TSXV: SGU) (OTCQB: SGGTF) (FSE: 3S30) (""Signature"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that its contractor Watts, Griffin, McOuat (""WGM"") has completed updating its geologic model by incorporating the historical drilling completed in the 1980's. This was an important step in our roadmap to defining the prospects of the Lingman Lake Project and delivering on our objectives for 2024.With the addition of the 1980's drilling to the geologic model, we have significantly extended the identified high-grade mineralization (greater than 5g/t), in the working geologic model. With the additional drilling data, WGM have identified zones of moderate grade mineralization (>2 g/t and <5 g/t) which was never a focus of past exploration efforts despite being less than 200 metres from surface (see Figure 1). This updated model provided us with a more data rich package in which to identify areas of interest and allowed us to design an efficient drill program to meet our goals to drive shareholder value.Figure 1: Updated Geologic Model Showing Zones of MineralizationTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/203126_3334e1d304b46b4b_001full.jpg""This work reaffirms Lingman Lake as an undervalued, near surface, high-grade Canadian gold deposit with tremendous exploration potential. The recent completion of high tension power and roads into the region is a game changer for this asset. Meanwhile, we continue to meet the objectives set by the board when we started down the path of resetting the company last November. If we continue to hit our goals, 2024 will be a catalyst rich year which should be rewarding for the company and its shareholders.""- J. Dan Denbow, CFA – Interim CEO and DirectorNew targets identified by Artificial Intelligence ModelingWhile completing the updating of the model, through the use of Artificial Intelligence Interpolation (""AI""), several new targets emerged that were identified as highly prospective. All these targets will be tested by the 2024 program designed by WGM and reviewed and approved by Signature's exploration team. Interestingly, a number of these targets are reinforced by geophysics that was not available to the AI software during the first iteration, We are excited to be able to use these new modeling techniques to target areas within the property that can quickly expand the resource and more efficiently use our exploration funds.Figure 2: New mineralization zones identified by Artificial Intelligence InterpolationTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/203126_3334e1d304b46b4b_002full.jpg2024 Work ProgramNow that WGM has updated our geologic model and designed the 2024 drill program. Signature plans to conduct an extensive field program that will focus on: 1) mapping historical activity at the site, 2) structural mapping, 3) locating proposed drill locations and reviewing any structural outcroppings that might better locate and design proposed drill holes. The drill program is designed to most efficiently use our exploration funds to enrich our understanding and knowledge of the Lingman Lake Project. This drill program totalling 5,000 metres will include full hole core assaying for each hole, thereby providing total lithological gold distribution giving us a much richer data package about the mineralization contained in the envelope around the mineralized zones. Prior drilling had not undertaken such extensive assaying of the core and this data will be very beneficial to the planned resource estimate.Figure 3: Proposed 2024 Drilling ProgramTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8296/203126_3334e1d304b46b4b_003full.jpgThe Spring exploration program will focus on compilation and detailed mapping of surface outcrops in the Lingman Lake deposit to better inform the planned drill program. It is anticipated that the drilling program should commence in early summer and will be executed in three 30-day programs with a two-week program by the geologic team to complete the data interpretation. Signature and its shareholders have made a significant investment in its exploration camp and drilling equipment which provides flexibility when exploring our property and scheduling drill programs. We can very efficiently conduct our drilling programs at a reduced cost.Once the field work, drilling and assay work is complete, the data can be turned over to the resource team which should be able to begin the process of compiling and publishing an initial NI 43-101 resource. Completing the drilling program and the publishing of our initial resource will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital. If Signature is able to fund the programs in a timely manner it is anticipated that the resource estimate could be completed early in calendar 2025.Qualified PersonThe scientific and technical content of this press release has been, reviewed and approved by Mr. Walter Hanych, P.

The Notes will bear interest at 5.365% per year and the remarketing is expected to close on March 28, 2024. Proceeds will be used to purchase treasury securities and settle Purchase Contracts. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. regarding the successful remarketing of its Senior Notes represents a strategic financial maneuver that is likely to have a significant impact on the company's capital structure and liquidity. The increase in the interest rate from 1.18% to 5.365% reflects the changing market conditions and the company's response to these shifts. This adjustment in interest rates could potentially impact the company's interest expenses and overall financial health.Investors should note that the proceeds from the remarketing are being used to purchase treasury securities, which will then be used to settle Purchase Contracts. This indicates a structured approach to managing the company's liabilities and could be seen as a positive step towards improving its balance sheet. However, the higher interest rate also suggests an increased cost of debt, which could affect the company's profitability in the short term. It is essential to monitor how this increased interest expense will be managed and whether the company's operational cash flow can support it. Debt Market Analyst Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.'s decision to remarket its Senior Notes at a significantly higher interest rate is a move that resonates within the debt market space. The original issuance of notes at 1.18% was indicative of the historically low-interest-rate environment. However, the remarketing at a rate of 5.365% aligns with the current market trend of rising interest rates, which could be attributed to inflationary pressures or changes in monetary policy.For the debt market and potential investors, this remarketing offers a glimpse into the creditworthiness of the company and the market's appetite for such securities. The successful closure of this remarketing, subject to customary conditions, will also be an indicator of investor confidence in the company's financial stability and its ability to manage debt effectively. This could influence the company's credit rating and, subsequently, its ability to raise capital in the future at favorable terms. Energy Sector Analyst From an energy sector perspective, Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.'s remarketing of its Senior Notes is indicative of the industry's current financial environment. The utility sector is capital-intensive and companies often rely on the issuance of debt instruments to finance their operations and growth initiatives. The decision to remarket these notes and the subsequent use of proceeds to reduce existing indebtedness suggest a proactive approach to capital management within the sector.Given the long-term nature of utility investments and the need for stable capital structures, the company's strategy to strengthen its financial position through debt management could be seen as a positive development. It is important for stakeholders to consider the implications of these financial decisions on the company's ability to invest in infrastructure and sustainable energy projects, which are critical for long-term growth in this sector. 03/26/2024 - 09:29 PM OAKVILLE, ON, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (""AQN"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: AQN) (NYSE: AQN) announced today that it has successfully remarketed its U.S.$1,150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.18% Senior Notes due June 15, 2026 (the ""Notes"").

The Company expects that substantially all of the funds generated upon maturity of the treasury portfolio will be used on June 17, 2024, to settle the Purchase Contracts. Any remaining proceeds of the portfolio of treasury securities will be distributed to the holders of the Corporate Units. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the settlement of the Purchase Contracts to reduce existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes.

The net proceeds from the offering will be used for acquisitions, development activities, and general corporate purposes. Negative None. Financial Analyst Rexford Industrial Realty's recent announcement of a $1 billion exchangeable senior notes offering is a significant capital market activity. The dual tranches, with varying maturities in 2027 and 2029 and interest rates of 4.375% and 4.125% respectively, reflect a strategic approach to managing the company's capital structure. Given the current interest rate environment, these rates seem competitive and could indicate confidence in Rexford Industrial's creditworthiness and future performance.Moreover, the option for additional purchases to cover over-allotments suggests strong demand expectations from institutional investors. This could be a positive signal for the company's stock, as it implies investor confidence. However, the impact on the stock price will depend on how the market interprets the use of proceeds. If used effectively for acquisitions and developments, it could lead to growth, but it also increases the company's leverage, which could be a concern if not managed properly. Real Estate Market Analyst The use of proceeds from the notes for potential acquisitions and development activities is a clear indication of Rexford Industrial's growth strategy in the industrial real estate sector. This sector has been performing well due to the e-commerce boom and the subsequent demand for warehouse and distribution centers. If Rexford can secure good locations and enhance their portfolio, this could lead to increased rental income and property values over time.The exchangeable nature of the notes, allowing conversion to common stock at a 30% premium to the current share price, also aligns investors' interests with the company's success. However, the dilution effect upon conversion needs to be monitored, as it could potentially affect existing shareholders' value. The redemption feature of the 2029 notes provides flexibility to the company to manage debt in response to market conditions, which is a prudent feature from a risk management perspective. Legal Expert The offering's compliance with Rule 144A is noteworthy as it targets qualified institutional buyers, streamlining the process and potentially reducing the time to market compared to a public offering. The associated registration rights agreement is a commitment to provide liquidity for the exchangeable shares, which could enhance the notes' attractiveness to investors. However, the limitations within this agreement and the absence of a current resale registration statement underscore the importance of understanding the legal complexities and risks involved in such private offerings.The stipulation of a 'fundamental change' clause in the indentures is a protective measure for investors, offering them an exit strategy in case of significant corporate events that could impact their investment. This highlights the company's attempt to balance investor protection with its financing objectives. 03/26/2024 - 08:17 PM LOS ANGELES, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Rexford Industrial"") (NYSE: REXR) today announced that its operating partnership, Rexford Industrial Realty, L.P. (the ""operating partnership""), priced its offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.375% exchangeable senior notes due 2027 (the ""2027 notes"") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% exchangeable senior notes due 2029 (the ""2029 notes"" and, together with the 2027 notes, the ""notes"") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis, by Rexford Industrial. The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on March 28, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The operating partnership also granted the initial purchasers of the notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 notes and up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 notes, in each case solely to cover over-allotments. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the operating partnership and will accrue interest at a rate of 4.375% per annum (in the case of the 2027 notes) and 4.125% per annum (in the case of the 2029 notes), payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on September 15, 2024. The 2027 notes will mature on March 15, 2027, and the 2029 notes will mature on March 15, 2029, in each case unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or (in the case of the 2029 notes) redeemed. Before December 15, 2026 (in the case of the 2027 notes) or December 15, 2028 (in the case of the 2029 notes), noteholders will have the right to exchange their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after December 15, 2026 (in the case of the 2027 notes) or December 15, 2028 (in the case of the 2029 notes), noteholders may exchange their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date of the applicable series of notes. Exchanges will be settled in cash and, if applicable, shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock. The initial exchange rate is 15.7146 shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2027 notes, which represents an initial exchange price of approximately $63.64 per share of Rexford Industrial's common stock, in the case of the 2027 notes, and 15.7146 shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 notes, which represents an initial exchange price of approximately $63.64 per share of Rexford Industrial's common stock, in the case of the 2029 notes. The initial exchange price represents a premium of approximately 30.0% (in the case of the 2027 notes) and 30.0% (in the case of the 2029 notes) over the last reported sale price of $48.95 per share of Rexford Industrial's common stock on March 26, 2024. The exchange rate and exchange price of each series of notes will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The 2027 notes will not be redeemable at the operating partnership's option before their maturity. The 2029 notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the operating partnership's option at any time, and from time to time, on or after May 20, 2027 and on or before the 41st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date of the 2029 notes, but only if the last reported sale price per share of Rexford Industrial's common stock exceeds 130% of the exchange price of the 2029 notes for a specified period of time and certain other conditions are satisfied. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the 2029 notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. If a ""fundamental change"" (as defined in the indentures that will govern the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require the operating partnership to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. The notes of each series will be entitled to the benefits of a registration rights agreement pursuant to which Rexford Industrial will agree to register the resale of the shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock, if any, deliverable upon exchange of the notes of such series under the Securities Act. The operating partnership estimates that the net proceeds from the offering of the notes will be approximately $978.8 million (or approximately $1,126.2 million if the initial purchasers fully exercise their over-allotment options), after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The operating partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund future acquisitions, to fund its development or repositioning/redevelopment activities and for general corporate purposes. The offer and sale of the notes, the guarantees and any shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock deliverable upon exchange of the notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. Although the operating partnership and Rexford Industrial intend to enter into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which Rexford Industrial will agree to file a resale registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock, if any, deliverable upon exchange of the notes, the registration rights agreement will contain significant limitations, and a resale registration statement may not be available at the time investors wish to resell the shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock, if any, deliverable upon exchange of their notes. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock deliverable upon exchange of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares of Rexford Industrial's common stock, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

The offering will be completed through underwriting agreements with ATB Securities Inc. and is expected to close on April 2, 2024. The company plans to use the net proceeds for growth initiatives, acquisitions, and investments in the cannabis and hemp markets. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Organigram Holdings Inc. regarding a public offering of units for approximately C$25 million represents a strategic move to raise capital. The offering's structure, consisting of common shares and warrants, is a common practice that allows investors to potentially benefit from future price increases of the company's stock. The use of proceeds for growth initiatives and general corporate purposes is indicative of Organigram's expansion strategy. However, the dilutive effect of such offerings on existing shareholders cannot be ignored. The market's reaction to the pricing and terms, once finalized, will be critical in assessing the immediate impact on the company's stock value.Furthermore, the inclusion of an over-allotment option, or 'greenshoe', is standard in public offerings, providing underwriters with a mechanism to manage price stability post-offering. The anticipated use of funds for accretive acquisitions and investments signals a proactive approach to scaling operations, which may be received positively if the market perceives the targeted opportunities as value-adding. Nonetheless, the final assessment of this offering's success will depend on the execution of the growth initiatives funded through this capital raise. Market Research Analyst Organigram's decision to pursue a public offering is reflective of the broader cannabis industry's need for capital to fund expansion and sustain competitive advantage. The reference to 'accretive acquisitions' suggests that Organigram is seeking to consolidate its market position or enter new markets, a trend observed across the sector. The success of such a strategy hinges on selecting the right targets and integrating them effectively. Investors will likely scrutinize the company's past acquisition performance and the potential of new markets, such as international federally legal cannabis and hemp markets, to gauge the long-term value proposition.It is also notable that the offering is being made in both Canada and the United States, indicating Organigram's intention to appeal to a broader investor base and capitalize on the growing cross-border interest in cannabis companies. The timing of the offering, set to close on April 2, 2024, suggests a calculated move to align with market conditions, although it carries inherent risks related to market volatility and regulatory dynamics within the industry. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the offering's reliance on a prospectus supplement and registration statement under the United States/Canada Multi-Jurisdictional Disclosure System (MJDS) highlights the regulatory complexities of cross-border offerings. Organigram must navigate both Canadian and U.S. securities laws, ensuring compliance with the Toronto Stock Exchange and NASDAQ notification rules. The requirement for approval by these exchanges and the filing with securities regulatory authorities underscores the importance of transparency and adherence to regulatory standards in capital-raising activities.The legal framework for cannabis-related businesses remains fragmented, especially in international markets. Organigram's reference to targeting federally legal cannabis and hemp markets is a prudent reminder of the varying legal landscapes and the company's commitment to operating within these confines. Investors will need to consider the legal risks associated with the industry, including potential changes in regulations that could impact Organigram's growth initiatives and international market strategies. 03/26/2024 - 07:06 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Organigram Holdings Inc. (“Organigram” or the “Company”) (TSX: OGI; NASDAQ: OGI), announces today an overnight marketed public offering of units of the Company (the “Units”) for total gross proceeds of approximately C$25 million (the “Offering”).

In addition, the Company will grant the underwriters an over-allotment option exercisable for a period of 30 days from the closing date of the Offering to purchase up to an additional 15% of the Offering, which will be comprised of additional Units at the Offering price. The Offering is expected to close on April 2, 2024 and will be subject to market and other customary conditions, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and compliance with the notification rules of NASDAQ. There can be no assurance as to whether or when the Offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the Offering. The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the Offering to fund growth initiatives and for general corporate purposes.

"PHINIA Announces Pricing of Private Offering of $525,000,000 of Senior Secured Notes due 2029",2024-03-26T20:50:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"PHINIA Inc.

The closing is expected on or before April 4, 2024.","PHINIA Announces Pricing of Private Offering of $525,000,000 of Senior Secured Notes due 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary PHINIA Inc. (PHIN) announces the pricing of $525 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% senior secured notes due 2029 in a private offering. The Offering size was increased from $425 million, with the notes being sold at 100.00% plus accrued interest. The closing is expected on or before April 4, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst PHINIA Inc.'s decision to issue $525 million in senior secured notes at a 6.75% interest rate signals several key financial strategies. Firstly, the upsizing from $425 million suggests strong investor demand or a greater need for capital than initially anticipated. This could indicate expansion efforts, debt refinancing, or other significant capital-intensive projects. The fixed interest rate of 6.75% is notably higher than the current average corporate bond yield, reflecting either a higher risk associated with the company or prevailing market conditions demanding higher returns for investors.Investors should consider the implications of this debt issuance on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios. An increase in debt levels can improve capital structure if used for growth or improving operational efficiencies. However, it could also signal financial strain if used to cover operational shortfalls. The secured nature of the notes means that in the event of default, these debt holders have a claim on PHINIA's assets, which could affect equity holder value. Market Research Analyst The issuance of senior secured notes by PHINIA Inc. can have a ripple effect on its market position. By securing additional capital, PHINIA may be aiming to invest in competitive advantages or to shore up its balance sheet. The terms of the notes and the timing of the offering should be analyzed in the context of the company's industry sector and current market trends.For instance, if PHINIA operates within a highly competitive or rapidly evolving industry, this influx of capital could be critical in maintaining or enhancing its market share. On the other hand, if the industry is facing headwinds, the company may be seeking to fortify its financial position against potential downturns. The interest rate of the notes might also be compared to those of competitors to gauge relative financial health and cost of capital. Credit Analyst From a credit perspective, the increase in the aggregate principal amount of PHINIA's offering to $525 million is a pivotal move. The creditworthiness of PHINIA will be impacted by the issuance of these notes. The 6.75% interest rate, which is a premium over the benchmark rates, indicates the market's perception of higher credit risk associated with PHINIA or potentially a strategic move to quickly attract capital.Assessing the company's historical financial performance and future earnings projections is essential to understand the ability to service this new debt. The use of proceeds from the notes, whether for restructuring existing debt, funding acquisitions, or capital expenditures, will also be critical in evaluating the long-term credit implications. The secured nature of the notes provides some assurance to note holders, potentially at the expense of unsecured debt holders and equity investors. 03/26/2024 - 04:50 PM AUBURN HILLS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PHINIA Inc. (“PHINIA” or the “Company”) (NYSE: PHIN) announced today that it has priced its previously announced offering (the “Offering”) and has agreed to issue and sell $525 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.75% senior secured notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering that is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The aggregate principal amount of the Offering of the notes was increased from the previously announced Offering size of $425 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be sold to investors at 100.00% plus accrued interest, if any, from April 4, 2024. The closing of the Offering of the notes is expected to occur on or about April 4, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will be guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantees its credit facilities.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons absent registration or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.

The company entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities for the sale. Additionally, its operating partnership priced $500 million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2027 and 2029 in a private offering. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Rexford Industrial Realty, Inc. about its public offering of common stock and the forward sale agreement presents a significant capital-raising activity. The pricing of over 17 million shares at $48.95 each indicates a substantial influx of capital. The forward sale agreement also provides flexibility and potentially reduces the risk of stock price volatility affecting the capital raise.This move suggests a strategic plan to bolster the company's balance sheet, which could be seen as a positive signal to investors about the company's growth prospects. However, investors should be aware that such offerings can dilute existing shareholders' equity. The use of proceeds for acquisitions and development activities could drive future growth, but the effectiveness of these investments remains to be seen. Legal Expert The offering of exchangeable senior notes and common stock by Rexford Industrial is conducted under Rule 144A, which is significant as it targets qualified institutional buyers and is not available to the general public. This approach can expedite the capital-raising process, as it's subject to fewer regulations than public offerings.The legal framework, including the shelf registration statement and the SEC's involvement, provides a layer of investor protection. Nonetheless, potential investors should review the final prospectus supplement for details on the terms of the exchangeable notes and the forward sale agreement to understand the risks and rights associated with these securities.

(the ""Company"" or ""Rexford Industrial"") (NYSE: REXR), today announced that it has priced an underwritten public offering of 17,179,318 shares of its common stock, in connection with the forward sale agreement described below in which the shares were sold to an existing long-only investor based on the West Coast at a price per share of $48.95. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on March 28, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. BofA Securities is acting as the sole book-running manager for the offering. In connection with the offering of shares of common stock, the Company entered into a forward sale agreement with BofA Securities (or its affiliate) (which the Company refers to as the ""forward purchaser""), with respect to 17,179,318 shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the forward sale agreement, the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is expected to borrow from third parties and sell to the underwriter an aggregate of 17,179,318 shares of the Company's common stock. However, the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) is not required to borrow such shares if, after using commercially reasonable efforts, it is unable to borrow such shares, or if borrowing costs exceed a specified threshold or if certain specified conditions have not been satisfied. If the forward purchaser or its affiliate does not deliver and sell all of the shares of the Company's common stock to be delivered and sold by it pursuant to the terms of the underwriting agreement, the Company will issue and sell directly to the underwriter the number of shares of its common stock not delivered and sold by the forward purchaser or its affiliate, and under such circumstances the number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the forward sale agreement will be decreased by the number of shares of its common stock that the Company issues and sells. Pursuant to the terms of the forward sale agreement, and subject to its right to elect cash or net share settlement, the Company intends to issue and sell, upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreement, up to an aggregate of 17,179,318 shares of common stock to the forward purchaser in exchange for cash proceeds per share equal to the applicable forward sale price, which will initially be equal to the price the underwriter agreed to pay the forward purchaser (or its affiliate) for each share, and will be subject to certain adjustments as provided in the forward sale agreement. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of its common stock by the forward purchaser (or its affiliate). The Company intends to contribute any cash proceeds that it receives upon settlement of the forward sale agreement to its operating partnership in exchange for common units. The Company expects its operating partnership will use any cash proceeds that it receives upon settlement of the forward sale agreement, together with the net proceeds from the offering of Exchangeable Notes, described below, if it is consummated, to fund future acquisitions, fund development or repositioning/redevelopment activities and for general corporate purposes. In a separate press release, the Company also announced today that its operating partnership priced its offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2027 (the ""2027 notes"") and $500 million aggregate principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due 2029 (the ""2029 notes"" and, together with the 2027 notes, the ""Exchangeable Notes"") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Exchangeable Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior, unsecured basis, by the Company. The operating partnership also granted the initial purchasers of the Exchangeable Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 notes and up to an additional $75 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 notes, in each case solely to cover over-allotments. The completion of the offering of the common stock is not contingent on the completion of the offering of the Exchangeable Notes, and the completion of the offering of the Exchangeable Notes is not contingent on the completion of the offering of the common stock. This offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement (containing a prospectus) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").

Matador Resources Company Prices Upsized Offering of $900 Million of Senior Notes Due 2032,2024-03-26T21:41:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Matador Resources Company (MTDR) announced a private offering of $900 million of 6.500% senior unsecured notes due 2032, increasing from the initial $800 million. The offering is expected to close on April 2, 2024. The net proceeds will be used for repurchasing outstanding senior notes, general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions, and repayment of borrowings. The New Notes and related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933.","Matador Resources Company Prices Upsized Offering of $900 Million of Senior Notes Due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Matador Resources Company (MTDR) announced a private offering of $900 million of 6.500% senior unsecured notes due 2032, increasing from the initial $800 million. The offering is expected to close on April 2, 2024. The net proceeds will be used for repurchasing outstanding senior notes, general corporate purposes, potential acquisitions, and repayment of borrowings. The New Notes and related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Matador Resources Company's $900 million senior unsecured notes is a significant financial move, reflecting the company's capital raising strategy. The increment from the initially planned $800 million to $900 million suggests strong investor demand or a greater need for capital than initially anticipated. This could indicate that Matador is aggressively looking to fund acquisitions or reduce debt costs by repurchasing higher-interest notes ahead of maturity.From an investment perspective, the increase in offering size and the use of proceeds to repurchase existing debt and for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions, could signal a strategic shift or expansion. This may affect the stock's volatility in the short term as the market digests the implications of the increased debt load and potential for growth through acquisitions. Over the long term, if the acquisitions or debt restructuring improve Matador's financial position or market share, it could lead to a reevaluation of the company's valuation by investors. Debt Market Analyst Matador's choice to issue senior unsecured notes at a 6.500% interest rate, despite the existing 5.875% notes, reflects current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness. The interest rate differential suggests a market perception of increased risk or an overall rise in interest rates since the issuance of the 2026 Notes. It's important to note that senior unsecured notes are ranked higher in repayment hierarchy than subordinated debt, but they do not have the security of collateral, which may affect their attractiveness to risk-averse investors.The tender offer to repurchase the 2026 Notes before maturity could be seen as a move to manage the company's debt profile, potentially reducing future interest expenses. However, investors should also consider the implications of the new notes' maturity in 2032, which extends the company's debt obligations further into the future. This could impact the company's cash flow and financial flexibility, particularly if the energy market faces volatility. Energy Sector Analyst Matador Resources operates in the energy sector, which is known for its capital-intensive nature and sensitivity to commodity prices. The decision to raise capital through the debt market is not uncommon in this industry, especially for funding acquisitions or capital expenditures. The use of proceeds for general corporate purposes suggests that Matador may be positioning itself to take advantage of opportunities in the market, such as acquiring assets at competitive prices or investing in new technologies.Investors should consider the underlying commodity price environment when evaluating Matador's financial strategy. If the company can secure assets that enhance its production capabilities or reserves at a time when oil and gas prices are favorable, this could strengthen its market position. However, the cyclical nature of the energy market means that these investments come with inherent risks and the additional debt could strain the company's balance sheet if the market turns. 03/26/2024 - 05:41 PM DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Matador Resources Company (NYSE: MTDR) (“Matador”) today announced that it has priced a private offering of $900 million of 6.500% senior unsecured notes due 2032 (the “New Notes”) at a price of 100% of their face value. Matador increased the size of the offering to $900 million from the previously announced $800 million. The offering is expected to close on April 2, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

To the extent any 2026 Notes remain outstanding after the consummation of the Tender Offer, Matador intends to satisfy and discharge any remaining 2026 Notes in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 2026 Notes.

WINREVAIR is the first FDA-approved activin signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH, offering a new treatment pathway. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The FDA approval of WINREVAIR, a new biologic therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), marks a significant advancement in the treatment landscape for this condition. The financial implications for Merck, as the manufacturer, are potentially substantial given the rarity and severity of PAH and the lack of diverse treatment options. This novel activin signaling inhibitor therapy represents a new approach to managing a disease that has historically had limited therapeutic advancements.From an investor's perspective, the approval could translate into a competitive edge for Merck in the specialty biologics market. The breakthrough therapy designation previously granted by the FDA likely expedited the development and review process, which can be advantageous in terms of cost-savings and achieving market penetration more rapidly. However, the long-term financial impact will depend on the drug's adoption rate, pricing strategy, insurance coverage and the actual benefit to patients in a real-world setting.It is also important to consider the potential risks associated with the drug, such as the need for monitoring hemoglobin and platelets, which could affect patient compliance and overall market uptake. Furthermore, the safety profile and the risk of thromboembolic events or hyperviscosity syndrome highlighted in the safety information are important factors that healthcare providers will weigh when considering this treatment for their patients. Healthcare Market Research Analyst The introduction of WINREVAIR into the market presents an opportunity for Merck to tap into a niche yet underserved medical need. Given the rarity of PAH, the patient population is relatively small, which typically leads to higher drug prices under orphan drug designations. The approval based on the STELLAR trial results, which showed a significant improvement in exercise capacity and reduction in clinical worsening events, positions WINREVAIR as a strong entrant into the PAH treatment market.Market adoption will likely be influenced by the drug's efficacy in comparison to existing therapies, its side effect profile and the convenience of subcutaneous administration every three weeks. The latter could be particularly appealing to patients and caregivers looking for more manageable treatment regimens. The ability to self-administer may also reduce the overall cost of care, an important consideration for payers when deciding on coverage policies.Merck's strategy to make WINREVAIR available through select specialty pharmacies could streamline distribution and ensure that patients receive adequate support and education. This specialized approach to dispensing may also enhance patient adherence and outcomes, further justifying the drug's value proposition in a market that prioritizes demonstrable health benefits and cost-effectiveness. Medical Research Analyst The clinical significance of WINREVAIR's approval extends beyond its immediate therapeutic benefits. As the first FDA-approved activin signaling inhibitor for PAH, it opens new avenues for research into the pathophysiology of the disease. The drug's mechanism, which involves regulating vascular cell proliferation, offers a fresh perspective on targeting the underlying causes of PAH rather than just managing its symptoms.Long-term, the success of WINREVAIR will likely be measured not only by its market performance but also by its impact on patient outcomes and quality of life. The reduction in risk of death from any cause or PAH clinical worsening events by 84% is a remarkable clinical achievement, but real-world evidence will be important to validate these findings. Post-marketing surveillance and further studies will be essential to monitor the long-term safety and effectiveness of the drug, as well as to explore potential uses in other conditions characterized by vascular proliferation.The specificity of the drug's indications and the requirement for pre-dosing monitoring suggest that Merck will need to work closely with healthcare providers to ensure that the drug's benefits are maximized and risks are minimized. This includes educating providers on the importance of patient selection and monitoring, which can be resource-intensive but is necessary for achieving the best patient outcomes. 03/26/2024 - 06:21 PM WINREVAIR is a breakthrough biologic for this rare, progressive disease WINREVAIR on top of background therapy significantly improved exercise capacity and multiple important secondary outcome measures compared to background therapy alone RAHWAY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved sotatercept-csrk (U.S. Brand Name: WINREVAIR™, for injection, 45mg, 60mg) for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, World Health Organization [WHO] Group 1) to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class (FC), and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. WINREVAIR was previously granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA. WINREVAIR is the first FDA-approved activin signaling inhibitor therapy for PAH, representing a new class of therapy that works by improving the balance between pro- and anti-proliferative signaling to regulate vascular cell proliferation underlying PAH. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240326077272/en/WINREVAIR logo (Graphic: Merck & Co., Inc.) “Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing significant strain on the heart,” said Dr. Marc Humbert, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Reference Center at the Université Paris-Saclay and investigator on the Phase 3 STELLAR study. “Based on the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, adding WINREVAIR to background PAH therapy demonstrated significant clinical benefits compared to background PAH therapy alone. This approval is an important milestone, as it offers healthcare providers a novel therapeutic option that targets a new PAH treatment pathway.” The approval is based on the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, which compared WINREVAIR (n=163) to placebo (n=160), both in combination with background standard of care therapies in adult patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 FC II or III). Results showed adding WINREVAIR to background therapy increased six-minute walk distance from baseline by 41 meters (95% CI: 28, 54; p<0.001; placebo-adjusted) at Week 24 and significantly improved multiple important secondary outcome measures, including reducing the risk of death from any cause or PAH clinical worsening events by 84% versus background therapy alone (number of events: 9 vs 42, hazard ratio=0.16; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.35; p<0.001). Healthcare providers should monitor hemoglobin and platelets before each dose of WINREVAIR for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter to determine if dose adjustments are required. WINREVAIR may increase hemoglobin and may lead to erythrocytosis, which if severe may increase the risk of thromboembolic events or hyperviscosity syndrome. WINREVAIR also may decrease platelet count and lead to severe thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding; thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in patients also receiving prostacyclin infusion. Treatment should not be initiated if platelet count is <50,000/mm3. See additional Selected Safety Information below. “The Pulmonary Hypertension Association welcomes the development of new therapies for those with PAH,” said Matt Granato, president and chief executive officer, Pulmonary Hypertension Association. “A diagnosis of PAH is a life-changing experience for patients and families due to its chronic, progressive nature. Patients with PAH experience limiting symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue. We are excited to see industry research leading to a better understanding of PAH and the development of a medicine in a novel treatment pathway that expands options for the patient community.” “New treatment options continue to be needed for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension that support important clinical goals, including increasing exercise capacity and improving functional class,” said Dr. Aaron Waxman, Executive Director of the Center for Pulmonary Heart Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and investigator on the Phase 3 STELLAR study. “Sotatercept added to background therapy has the potential to become a new standard of care option for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.” WINREVAIR is given once every three weeks by subcutaneous injection and may be administered by appropriate patients or caregivers with guidance, training and follow-up from a healthcare provider. Healthcare providers and patients/caregivers should refer to the Instructions for Use for information on the proper preparation and administration of WINREVAIR. Merck estimates that WINREVAIR will be available for dispensing by select specialty pharmacies in the U.S. by the end of April. “PAH remains a debilitating disease with high morbidity and mortality,” said Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president and head of global clinical development, chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories. “This approval of WINREVAIR is an important milestone and a testament to our science-led strategy and focus on the development of innovations that can help people affected by rare diseases like PAH. We are proud to bring this novel medicine to patients.” Merck offers support to patients who are prescribed WINREVAIR, including information about insurance coverage and help for eligible patients with out-of-pocket costs and co-pay assistance options, through the Merck Access Program. For additional information, healthcare providers and patients can call 1-888-637-2502 or visit www.merckaccessprogram-WINREVAIR.com in the coming days. STELLAR Study Results The primary efficacy endpoint in the STELLAR trial was the change from baseline at Week 24 in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD). In the WINREVAIR treatment group, the placebo-adjusted median increase in 6MWD was 41 meters (95% CI: 28, 54; p<0.001, Hodges-Lehmann estimate). Additionally, patients who added WINREVAIR had statistically significantly greater improvements compared to placebo across multiple secondary endpoints: Treatment with WINREVAIR led to an improvement in FC from baseline at Week 24 in 29% of patients compared to 14% of patients treated with placebo (p<0.001). Treatment with WINREVAIR resulted in an 84% reduction in the occurrence of death or PAH clinical worsening events compared to placebo (median duration of exposure 33.6 weeks; number of events: 9/163 vs 42/160, hazard ratio=0.16; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.35; p<0.001). Treatment with WINREVAIR led to an improvement from baseline in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The median treatment difference in PVR between WINREVAIR and placebo was -235 dynes*sec/cm5 (95% CI: -288, -181; p<0.001). Treatment with WINREVAIR led to an improvement from baseline in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels. The median treatment difference in NT-proBNP between WINREVAIR and placebo was -442 pg/mL (95% CI: -574, -310; p<0.001). About STELLAR The STELLAR study (NCT04576988) was a global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial in which 323 patients with PAH (WHO Group 1 FC II or III) were randomized 1:1 to WINREVAIR (target dose 0.7 mg/kg) (n=163) or placebo (n=160) plus stable background therapy administered subcutaneously once every 3 weeks. The most common PAH etiologies were idiopathic PAH (59%), heritable PAH (18%), and PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (CTD) (15%). Most participants were receiving either three (61%) or two (35%) background drugs for PAH, and 40% were receiving prostacyclin infusions. The mean time from PAH diagnosis was 8.8 years. Patients had a WHO FC II (49%) or III (51%) at baseline. About WINREVAIR™ (sotatercept-csrk) for injection, for subcutaneous use, 45 mg, 60 mg WINREVAIR is FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group 1) to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class (FC) and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. WINREVAIR is the first activin signaling inhibitor therapy approved to treat PAH. WINREVAIR improves the balance between pro-proliferative and anti-proliferative signaling to modulate vascular proliferation. In preclinical models, WINREVAIR induced cellular changes that were associated with thinner vessel walls, partial reversal of right ventricular remodeling, and improved hemodynamics. WINREVAIR is the subject of a licensing agreement with Bristol Myers Squibb. Selected Safety Information WINREVAIR may increase hemoglobin and may lead to erythrocytosis. Severe erythrocytosis may increase the risk of thromboembolic events or hyperviscosity syndrome. Monitor Hgb before each dose for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter, to determine if dose adjustments are required. WINREVAIR may decrease platelet count and lead to severe thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding; thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in patients also receiving prostacyclin infusion. Do not initiate treatment if platelet count is <50,000/mm3. Monitor platelets before each dose for the first 5 doses, or longer if values are unstable, and periodically thereafter to determine if dose adjustments are required. In clinical studies, serious bleeding (e.g., gastrointestinal, intracranial hemorrhage) was reported in 4% of patients taking WINREVAIR and 1% of patients taking placebo. Serious bleeding was more likely in patients on prostacyclin background therapy and/or antithrombotic agents, or with low platelet counts. Advise patients about signs and symptoms of blood loss. Do not administer WINREVAIR if the patient is experiencing serious bleeding. WINREVAIR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with WINREVAIR and for at least 4 months after the final dose. Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential before starting WINREVAIR treatment. Based on findings in animals, WINREVAIR may impair female and male fertility. Advise patients on the potential effects on fertility. The most common adverse reactions occurring in the Phase 3 clinical trial (≥10% for WINREVAIR and at least 5% more than placebo) were headache (24.5% vs 17.5%), epistaxis (22.1% vs 1.9%), rash (20.2% vs 8.1%), telangiectasia (16.6% vs 4.4%), diarrhea (15.3% vs 10.0%), dizziness (14.7% vs 6.2%), and erythema (13.5% vs 3.1%). Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with WINREVAIR, and for 4 months after the final dose.

MediciNova Receives a Notice of Allowance for a New Patent Covering MN-166 (ibudilast) for the Treatment of Macular Injury in Japan,2024-03-26T23:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"MediciNova, Inc. receives a Notice of Allowance from the Japan Patent Office for a pending patent application covering MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of macular injury associated with progressive multiple sclerosis. The patent is expected to expire no earlier than October 2039 and covers a wide range of doses, dosing frequencies, and treatment periods. Chief Medical Officer, Kazuko Matsuda, highlights the potential value of MN-166 in ophthalmic neurodegenerative diseases based on positive data from previous studies.","MediciNova Receives a Notice of Allowance for a New Patent Covering MN-166 (ibudilast) for the Treatment of Macular Injury in Japan Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary MediciNova, Inc. receives a Notice of Allowance from the Japan Patent Office for a pending patent application covering MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of macular injury associated with progressive multiple sclerosis. The patent is expected to expire no earlier than October 2039 and covers a wide range of doses, dosing frequencies, and treatment periods. Chief Medical Officer, Kazuko Matsuda, highlights the potential value of MN-166 in ophthalmic neurodegenerative diseases based on positive data from previous studies. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Patent Analyst The receipt of a Notice of Allowance from the Japan Patent Office for MediciNova's MN-166 (ibudilast) represents a strategic milestone in the company's intellectual property portfolio. This allowance not only extends the exclusivity of MN-166's use in treating macular injury associated with progressive multiple sclerosis until at least 2039 but also underscores the drug's versatility in oral dosage forms. The breadth of the claims, encompassing a variety of dosages, frequencies and treatment durations, offers MediciNova a robust defense against generic competition in the Japanese market.MediciNova's ability to secure similar patents in other major markets such as the U.S., Europe and China suggests a coordinated effort to build a global moat around MN-166. This strategic positioning could enhance the company's negotiating power in potential licensing deals or partnerships, especially given the positive data from preclinical studies and Phase 2b trials. However, it is essential to monitor how this patent will affect market access and pricing strategies in Japan, considering the country's stringent health economics assessment for new therapies. Biotech Market Analyst The announcement by MediciNova regarding the patent allowance for MN-166 in Japan is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, given the extended market protection and the potential for MN-166 to address an unmet medical need in progressive multiple sclerosis. The reference to positive data from animal model studies and the SPRINT-MS Phase 2b trial adds credence to the drug's efficacy profile. For investors, the patent news serves as a tangible progress indicator in MediciNova's pipeline development.However, it is critical to assess the size of the target population for MN-166 and the competitive landscape. While the patent secures long-term prospects, the immediate impact on the stock market will depend on the drug's progress through clinical trials, regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization. Investors should weigh the potential revenue against the costs of ongoing development and the time required to bring MN-166 to market. Medical Research Analyst The clinical implications of MN-166 for progressive multiple sclerosis patients are significant, particularly for those suffering from macular injury. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) results indicating less retinal tissue loss with MN-166 compared to placebo suggest that the drug could offer a novel therapeutic approach for preserving vision in this patient population. The specificity of the patent claims to both primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis broadens the potential impact of MN-166, as it addresses two distinct forms of the disease.While the patent is a positive development, it is important to consider the remaining clinical and regulatory hurdles that MN-166 must clear. The drug's efficacy and safety profile will need to be consistently demonstrated in larger, more diverse patient populations. Additionally, the treatment's long-term benefits and its position within the existing treatment paradigm will be closely scrutinized by both regulators and the medical community. 03/26/2024 - 07:00 PM LA JOLLA, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediciNova, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ:MNOV) and the Standard Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Code Number: 4875), today announced it has received a Notice of Allowance from the Japan Patent Office for a pending patent application which covers MN-166 (ibudilast) for the treatment of macular injury associated with progressive multiple sclerosis. Once issued, this patent is expected to expire no earlier than October 2039. The allowed claims cover the use of MN-166 (ibudilast) for treating macular injury associated with progressive multiple sclerosis and for decreasing macular volume loss associated with progressive multiple sclerosis. The allowed claims specifically cover both primary progressive multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The allowed claims cover oral administration including tablets, capsules, granules, microbead dosage forms, and liquid dosage forms. The allowed claims cover a wide range of doses of MN-166 (ibudilast), a range of different dosing frequencies, and a range of different treatment periods. Kazuko Matsuda, MD, PhD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, “We are very pleased to receive a notice of this new patent allowance in Japan and we believe it could increase the potential value of MN-166. The potential of MN-166 in ophthalmic neurodegenerative diseases has been demonstrated previously by positive data from a glaucoma animal model study and a retinal damage animal model study. Previously, we reported positive Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) results from the SPRINT-MS Phase 2b trial of MN-166 in progressive multiple sclerosis. All OCT measures showed less loss of retinal tissue for MN-166 compared to placebo. Similar patents have been granted in the U.S., Europe, and China.” About MN-166 (ibudilast) MN-166 (ibudilast) is a small molecule compound that inhibits phosphodiesterase type-4 (PDE4) and inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). It is in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), progressive MS (multiple sclerosis), and DCM (degenerative cervical myelopathy); and is also in development for glioblastoma, Long COVID, CIPN (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), and substance use disorder. In addition, MN-166 (ibudilast) was evaluated in patients that are at risk for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). About MediciNova MediciNova, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad late-stage pipeline of novel small molecule therapies for inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases. Based on two compounds, MN-166 (ibudilast) and MN-001 (tipelukast), with multiple mechanisms of action and strong safety profiles, MediciNova has 11 programs in clinical development. MediciNova’s lead asset, MN-166 (ibudilast), is currently in Phase 3 for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and is Phase 3-ready for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). MN-166 (ibudilast) is also being evaluated in Phase 2 trials in Long COVID and substance dependence. MN-001 (tipelukast) was evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and a second Phase 2 trial in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is ongoing.

Cardlytics Prices $150.0 Million Convertible Senior Notes Offering,2024-03-27T01:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDLX) announced the pricing of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private offering.

(NASDAQ: CDLX) announced the pricing of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 in a private offering. The notes will accrue interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum, payable semi-annually. Cardlytics estimates net proceeds of approximately $144.5 million, intending to use it to repurchase $183.9 million of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2025. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Cardlytics' decision to issue $150 million in convertible senior notes is a strategic move to restructure its debt, given the concurrent repurchase of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2025. The use of the proceeds to manage existing obligations indicates a proactive approach to balance sheet management. The new notes offer a higher interest rate of 4.25%, which could attract investors seeking fixed income in a potentially rising interest rate environment. However, the higher interest rate also suggests an increased cost of capital for Cardlytics, which may affect their net interest margin and profitability. The conversion feature, with an initial conversion price set at a 32.5% premium over the last reported sale price of the common stock, is designed to minimize immediate dilution and could be appealing to investors bullish on Cardlytics' future stock performance. It's important to note that the potential for dilution exists if the notes are converted into equity, which could impact current shareholders. The impact on the stock will largely depend on the market's perception of Cardlytics' growth prospects and its ability to manage the increased debt load. Market Research Analyst Cardlytics' private offering of convertible notes may signal to the market an anticipation of growth or a need for capital for strategic investments. The repurchase of the 2025 Notes could be viewed positively as it may reduce the near-term financial burden and potential dilution from those notes. However, the introduction of new debt with a higher interest rate must be justified by the company's future performance to maintain investor confidence. Furthermore, the potential market activities by the hedged holders of the 2025 Notes could lead to short-term volatility in Cardlytics' stock price. Investors should monitor the average daily trading volume of Cardlytics’ stock and the company's disclosures regarding these transactions to gauge the potential impact. The unwinding of hedge positions often creates additional trading volume, which can have a temporary effect on stock price, independent of the company's fundamentals. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under Rule 144A, which allows for the sale of securities to qualified institutional buyers without the need for public registration. This approach can expedite the capital raising process but also limits the pool of potential investors to those who are deemed sophisticated enough to understand the risks. The lack of public registration also means less disclosure, which could affect market transparency. The stipulation that the notes cannot be redeemed prior to maturity gives Cardlytics less flexibility in managing its debt portfolio, which could be a disadvantage if interest rates decline or if the company's financial position improves significantly prior to 2029. The 'fundamental change' clause, which allows noteholders to require repurchase, introduces a potential cash outflow risk in the event of significant corporate changes, such as a takeover or a major restructuring. 03/26/2024 - 09:15 PM ATLANTA, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardlytics, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDLX) (“Cardlytics”), an advertising platform in banks’ digital channels, today announced the pricing of its offering of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “notes”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The issuance and sale of the notes are scheduled to settle on April 1, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. Cardlytics also granted the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, for settlement within a period of 13 days from, and including, the date the notes are first issued, up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of notes. The notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of Cardlytics and will accrue interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The notes will mature on April 1, 2029, unless earlier converted or repurchased by Cardlytics. Before January 2, 2029, noteholders will have the right to convert their notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after January 2, 2029, noteholders may convert their notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. Cardlytics will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Cardlytics’ election. The initial conversion rate is 55.4939 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $18.02 per share of common stock. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 32.5% over the last reported sale price of $13.60 per share of Cardlytics’ common stock on March 26, 2024. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. The notes will not be redeemable at Cardlytics’ option prior to maturity. If a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture for the notes) occurs, then, subject to a limited exception, noteholders may require Cardlytics to repurchase their notes for cash. The repurchase price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable repurchase date. Cardlytics estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $144.5 million (or approximately $166.3 million if the initial purchasers fully exercise their option to purchase additional notes), after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and Cardlytics’ estimated offering expenses. Cardlytics expects to use approximately $169.3 million, consisting of the net proceeds from the offering, together with cash on hand, to repurchase for cash approximately $183.9 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), together with accrued and unpaid interest, in privately negotiated transactions entered into concurrently with the pricing of the offering through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliate, as Cardlytics’ agent (each, a “note repurchase transaction”). This press release is not an offer to repurchase the 2025 Notes, and the offering of the notes is not contingent upon the repurchase of the 2025 Notes. In connection with any note repurchase transaction, Cardlytics expects that holders of the 2025 Notes who agree to have their 2025 Notes repurchased and who have hedged their equity price risk with respect to such notes (the “hedged holders”) will unwind all or part of their hedge positions by buying Cardlytics’ common stock and/or entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Cardlytics’ common stock. The amount of Cardlytics’ common stock to be purchased by the hedged holders or in connection with such derivative transactions may be substantial in relation to the historic average daily trading volume of Cardlytics’ common stock. This activity by the hedged holders could have increased (or reduced the size of any decrease in) the market price of Cardlytics’ common stock, including concurrently with the pricing of the notes, which could have resulted in a higher effective conversion price of the notes. Cardlytics cannot predict the magnitude of such market activity or the overall effect it will have on the price of the notes offered or Cardlytics’ common stock. The offer and sale of the notes and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, if any, have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and the notes and any such shares cannot be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy, the notes or any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes, nor will there be any sale of the notes or any such shares, in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would be unlawful.

The company plans to use the proceeds to fund a tender offer for its outstanding 2025 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative The increase in debt through the issuance of senior secured notes may raise concerns about the company's financial leverage and ability to service the increased debt in the future. Financial Analyst The issuance of $875 million in senior secured notes by AMC Networks is a significant financial maneuver, signaling a strategic move to restructure its debt portfolio. The high interest rate of 10.25% reflects the current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness. Investors should consider the implications of the company's decision to replace its existing 4.75% notes with higher-interest debt. While this could indicate a proactive approach to managing upcoming maturities, it also suggests an increase in future interest expenses, which could impact the company's net income and cash flows.Furthermore, the decision to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of indebtedness, provides some insight into the company's liquidity management. However, the increase in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes from the initially announced figure could raise concerns about the company's leverage and the potential dilution of existing creditors' claims. Stakeholders should monitor the company's subsequent financial statements to assess the impact of these new debt obligations on its balance sheet and overall financial health. Legal Expert The offering's structure, utilizing an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933 and targeting qualified institutional buyers, means that AMC Networks is seeking to tap into a sophisticated investor base, while also limiting the regulatory burden associated with public offerings. The legal intricacies of such private placements are complex and the fact that the Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws limits their marketability and could affect their liquidity.It is also important to note the guarantees provided by AMC Networks’ subsidiaries, which create a web of internal obligations that could have legal ramifications in the event of financial distress. Investors should be aware of the limitations imposed on the sale of the Notes, as they are not available to the general public and any secondary market for the Notes may be limited as a result of the offering's private nature. Market Research Analyst The entertainment industry, in which AMC Networks operates, has been experiencing a shift towards streaming and on-demand content, affecting traditional revenue streams. The company's decision to issue new debt could be interpreted as a move to bolster its financial position in a competitive market. However, the high yield of the Notes points to a perceived higher risk associated with the company's future earnings potential.Analysts might look at comparable offerings in the media sector to gauge whether the interest rate offered is in line with industry norms or if it reflects specific concerns about AMC Networks' prospects. The company's performance relative to its peers will be important in determining the attractiveness of this debt issue to investors. The increased principal amount could suggest a strong demand for the company's debt or a need for additional capital, each of which carries different implications for the market's view of the company's growth and risk profile. 03/26/2024 - 05:53 PM NEW YORK, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AMC Networks Inc.

Positive The net revenues decreased by 9.4% in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. For FY 2023, net revenues increased by 6.3% from 2022, primarily driven by a 59.8% increase in one-time commissions from the distribution of insurance products. Net income for Q4 2023 increased by 54.8% from the corresponding period in 2022. In Q4 2023, Wealth Management business saw a 15.1% increase in one-time commissions, while the Asset Management business had a 13.5% increase in recurring service fees. Operating costs and expenses for Q4 2023 decreased by 12.6% compared to the same period in 2022. Noah Holdings reported a net margin of 26.7% for Q4 2023, an increase from 15.9% in the corresponding period in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results of Noah Holdings Limited for Q4 2023 and the full fiscal year present a mixed picture, with both positive and negative trends that are of interest to investors and market analysts. The reported decrease in net revenues by 9.4% year-over-year (YoY) for Q4 and the increase in full-year net revenues by 6.3% highlight the company's fluctuating performance in different quarters. The decline in Q4 revenues is attributed to reduced performance-based income and service fees, which may signal a challenging environment for wealth management services, particularly in the private equity space. However, the increase in one-time commissions from insurance product distributions suggests a strategic pivot or diversification in the company's revenue streams. The 54.8% increase in net income attributable to shareholders in Q4, largely due to a non-recurring litigation expense in the prior year, paints a more favorable profitability scenario. It's important to consider the non-GAAP measures, which also show an increase, providing a cleaner view of the company's operating performance without one-time charges. From an operational perspective, the decrease in the total number of active clients and the contraction of the company's coverage network in China could be concerning, potentially indicating market saturation or competitive pressures. On the other hand, the growth in overseas assets under management (AUM) and registered clients suggests successful international expansion efforts, which could be a key driver of future growth. Market Research Analyst The wealth management industry, particularly in China, is undergoing significant transformation. Noah Holdings' operational updates and financial results reflect this dynamic landscape. The reduction in the number of cities covered and the decline in active clients may indicate a strategic consolidation, focusing on profitability over expansive growth. This aligns with broader industry trends where firms are seeking to optimize their operations amidst regulatory changes and market volatility. The shift in product distribution, with a decrease in mutual fund products and an increase in private secondary products, suggests changing investor preferences or a recalibration of Noah's product offerings. The company's increased emphasis on insurance products could be a response to market demand and a move to capitalize on higher commission-based revenues. The asset management business shows a mixed performance with a slight increase in recurring service fee revenues but a sharp decline in performance-based income. The stability of AUM indicates that while there may be challenges in generating performance-based income, the core asset management operations remain resilient. The increased operating margin in asset management also suggests improved efficiency in this segment. Economist Examining Noah Holdings' financial outcomes in the context of the broader economic environment, the results provide insights into the health of the wealth management sector and investor sentiment. The decrease in Q4 net revenues, particularly from performance-based income, may reflect broader economic headwinds and market downturns that have affected investment returns. The increased distribution of insurance products, however, could be a strategic hedge against market volatility, as these products often carry lower risk profiles. The company's international expansion and growth in overseas AUM by 10.7% suggest a diversification strategy that can mitigate risks associated with domestic market fluctuations. This international footprint could be increasingly important as global economic uncertainties persist, offering a buffer through geographic and currency diversification. Furthermore, the full-year increase in net revenues, despite a challenging year for capital markets, indicates that Noah's business model has some resilience. The company's ability to generate growth in a difficult market environment speaks to the strength of its wealth management and asset allocation services, which are critical during times of economic uncertainty. 03/26/2024 - 05:00 PM SHANGHAI, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Noah Holdings Limited (""Noah"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: NOAH and HKEX: 6686), a leading and pioneer wealth management service provider offering comprehensive one-stop advisory services on global investment and asset allocation primarily for Mandarin-speaking high-net-worth investors, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023 and the audited financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023.

The transaction provides GCT with $50 million in gross proceeds for developing a full-band 5G chipset portfolio and expanding into new markets. GCT's transition into a publicly listed company on NYSE under ticker symbols 'GCTS' and 'GCTSW' marks a significant milestone. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction involving GCT Semiconductor and Concord Acquisition Corp III represents a significant financial event in the semiconductor industry, with a notable enterprise value of approximately $461 million at closing. The pro forma valuation of up to approximately $667 million includes performance-based earnout shares, which are contingent on the future performance of the company. This structure incentivizes management to meet certain targets, potentially enhancing shareholder value.The provision of approximately $50 million in gross proceeds for GCT is a strategic move to accelerate the development of its 5G chipset portfolio and market expansion. Given the intense competition and high R&D costs in the semiconductor sector, this capital infusion is critical for GCT to remain competitive. Investors should monitor the efficient allocation of these funds, as it could significantly impact GCT's market position and financial performance in the rapidly evolving 5G landscape. Market Research Analyst The transition from 4G to 5G technology is a pivotal moment for the semiconductor industry and GCT's public listing could provide it with the visibility and capital necessary to capitalize on this shift. The retention of equity by existing stockholders suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects. The conversion of outstanding convertible notes into common stock could dilute existing shares but also simplifies the capital structure and could be viewed positively by the market.Investors should consider the broader market trends, including the demand for 5G technology and GCT's competitive positioning. With a strong customer base and a focus on advanced LTE, IoT and 5G semiconductor solutions, GCT is well-positioned to leverage its expertise. However, the success of this strategy will depend on the company's ability to execute its business plan and navigate the complex dynamics of the semiconductor industry. Technology Industry Analyst The semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid innovation and high barriers to entry due to the technical expertise required. GCT's emphasis on full-band 5G chipset portfolios indicates a strategic focus on a segment with significant growth potential. The listing on the NYSE under the new ticker symbols provides GCT with increased credibility and access to a broader investment community.The long-term success of GCT will hinge on its ability to deliver innovative products that meet the evolving needs of the 5G market. While the gross proceeds from the transaction provide the necessary resources, execution risk remains a key factor. The company's performance in the coming quarters will be a telling indicator of its ability to translate financial resources into marketable products and services that resonate with its customer base. 03/26/2024 - 06:30 PM Transaction values GCT at a pro forma enterprise value of approximately $461 million at closing Pro forma valuation of GCT of up to approximately $667 million, which includes up to 20.6 million performance-based earnout shares Transaction provided GCT approximately $50 million of gross proceeds to finalize development of a full-band 5G chipset portfolio as well as for expansion into new markets Approximately $49 million has been funded via fully committed PIPE and convertible note financing from both existing and new investors of GCT All GCT existing stockholders retained their equity holdings through GCT’s transition into the publicly listed company and substantially all outstanding convertible notes will convert into common stock at closing SAN JOSE, Calif. & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- GCT Semiconductor, Inc.

Financially, the company had a decrease in R&D and G&A expenses, an increase in other income, and reported a reduced net loss for Q4 and full-year 2023. Positive Progress with FDA for GTB-3650 Phase 1 trial initiation anticipated in 2H 2024 IND submission for GTB-5550 targeting solid tumors in Q4 2024 Cash position of $14 million as of December 31, 2023 Decrease in R&D expenses for Q4 and full-year 2023 Decrease in G&A expenses for Q4 and full-year 2023 Increase in other income for Q4 and full-year 2023 Reduced net loss for Q4 and full-year 2023 Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial summary provided by GT Biopharma, Inc. highlights a strategic reduction in both Research and Development (R&D) and General and Administrative (G&A) expenses year-over-year. The company has effectively managed to decrease its R&D expenses by streamlining licensing and administrative costs while maintaining investment in product development. This cost management reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is vital for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with no revenue-generating products on the market.On the G&A front, the substantial decrease in expenses is indicative of an operational efficiency strategy, which is critical for the company's sustainability. The reduction in stock compensation and consulting fees suggests a shift towards a more cash-conservative remuneration model, which is often appreciated by investors during the high-risk development phases.Another notable financial metric is the net loss reduction, which may be positively perceived by the market as it indicates a more controlled burn rate. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the company's ability to continue reducing losses while simultaneously advancing their product candidates will be a important factor in assessing their long-term financial health and investment potential.The cash position, with a runway into 2025, offers the company some leeway to progress its clinical trials without the immediate need for additional capital raises, which could dilute existing shareholders. However, the anticipated increase in clinical and preclinical expenses in 2024 will likely require careful financial planning to avoid future financial strain. Medical Research Analyst The clinical development of GTB-3650 and the planned IND submission for GTB-5550 are significant milestones in GT Biopharma's pipeline progression. The transition of GTB-3650 into Phase 1 clinical trials for CD33+ leukemia represents an advancement in the company's proprietary TriKE® platform, which aims to enhance natural killer (NK) cell engagement. The potential of this platform lies in its novel approach to immuno-oncology, a field that has seen substantial interest and investment over the past decade.GTB-5550's targeting of B7H3 for multiple solid tumors, including prostate and breast cancers, suggests that the company is looking to address a broad range of oncological indications with significant unmet needs. Successful development of these therapies could position GT Biopharma in a lucrative market segment. However, the long-term impact on the company's valuation will heavily depend on the clinical outcomes and the ability to navigate a highly competitive landscape.It is essential to monitor the initial data from the GTB-3650 Phase 1 trial expected by the end of 2024/early 2025. This data will provide insights into the efficacy and safety profile of the therapy, which are critical determinants of its commercial viability and potential market impact. Investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with clinical-stage biopharmaceuticals, as any setbacks in the development process can significantly affect the company's prospects and stock performance. Market Research Analyst The immuno-oncology sector continues to be a hotbed of innovation and investment, with significant growth potential. GT Biopharma's focus on NK cell engagers positions it within a niche yet expanding area of cancer treatment research. The company's strategic decision to target both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors could open up diverse revenue streams should these treatments prove successful in clinical trials.However, it is important to consider the competitive environment. Major pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are also investing heavily in immuno-oncology. GT Biopharma will need to differentiate its TriKE® platform not only through clinical efficacy but also by demonstrating cost-effectiveness and manageable safety profiles compared to existing treatments.From a market perspective, the IND clearance and the start of Phase 1 trials may serve as catalysts for the company's stock, as positive regulatory milestones often do. Yet, the actual impact on stock performance will likely hinge on broader market conditions and investor sentiment towards the biotech sector, which can be volatile and influenced by regulatory news, clinical trial outcomes and competitive developments. 03/26/2024 - 05:00 PM Remain in active dialogue with the FDA regarding IND clearance for GTB-3650, a 2nd generation nanobody TriKE® for treatment of CD33+ leukemiaPhase 1 trial with GTB-3650 anticipated to start in 2H 2024Anticipate submitting an IND for GTB-5550 targeting B7H3 for multiple solid tumors, including prostate and breast, in Q4 2024Cash of approximately $14 million as of December 31, 2023, provides sufficient runway to fund operations into 2025 BRISBANE, CALIFORNIA, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GT Biopharma, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ: GTBP), a clinical stage immuno-oncology company focused on developing innovative therapeutics based on the Company's proprietary natural killer (NK) cell engager, TriKE® platform, today announced fourth quarter and full-year 2023 results for the period ended December 31, 2023. “We continue to make good progress with the FDA regarding IND clearance for GTB-3650, and eagerly anticipate the start of Phase 1 this year,” said Michael Breen, Executive Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Office of GT Biopharma. “We are also anticipating an IND submission for our 2nd asset, GTB-5550, for multiple solid tumors, including breast and prostate cancers, in Q4 of this year. We have sufficient cash runway into 2025 and anticipate having initial data from our Phase 1 trial with GTB-3650 by the end of 2024/early 2025.” Fourth Quarter and Year End 2023 Financial Summary Cash Position: The Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $13.97 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to $16.51 million as of December 31, 2022. This is anticipated to provide sufficient runway to fund operations into 2025. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.36 million compared to $2.84 million for the same quarter of 2022. R&D expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $6.47 million compared to $8.81 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The $2.34 million reduction in R&D for the year ended December 31, 2023 over 2022 was primarily due to a $3.59 million reduction in licensing and administrative costs, offset by an increase of $1.25 million in R&D costs related to our continued development and production of our most advanced TriKE® product candidates GTB-3650 and GTB-5550 along with the progression of other promising product candidates. The reduction of $3.59 million in licensing and administrative costs over the previous year was primarily due to better management of R&D expenses with consultants and reduction in stock compensation to employees. We anticipate our direct clinical and preclinical expenses to continue to increase in 2024 as we plan to advance our next generation GTB-3650 camelid nanobody product into the clinic and enroll patients, perform tests for data collection, complete the product development of GTB-5550 and anticipate submission of IND application for GTB-5550 in the fourth quarter of 2024. We do not, however, anticipate an increase in related R&D licensing and administrative costs. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $1.81 million compared to $2.94 million for the same quarter in 2022. G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $7.11 million compared to $12.45 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in G&A of $5.34 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 was primarily attributable to a reduction of $1.68 million in stock compensation expenses for officers, employees and board of directors and $1.92 million for outside consultants, a reduction of $1.31 million in consulting board advisory board fees, and a reduction of $0.50 million in patents and insurance costs. G&A decreased due to better managing and use of consultants and advisors, and overall reductions in other general and administrative expenses in 2023. Other Income Other income net of other expenses, for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $0.21 million compared to $0.19 million for the same quarter ended December 31, 2022. Other income, net of other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $5.98 million compared to $0.37 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Other income and expenses consisted of interest income, interest expense, change in the fair value of warrant lability, gain on extinguishment of debt, and unrealized gain and loss on marketable securities. The increase in other income net of expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the change in fair value of warrant liability as a result of fair value remeasurement which resulted in a gain of $4.8 million and $0.12 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Net Loss: The Company reported a net loss of $2.96 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to a loss of $5.58 million for the same quarter in 2022. The Company reported a loss of $7.60 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net loss of $20.88 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. About Camelid Antibodies Camelid antibodies are single domain antibodies (sdAbs) from the Camelidae family of mammals that include llamas, camels, and alpacas. These animals produce two main types of antibodies. One type of antibody camelids produce is the conventional antibody that is made up of two heavy chains and two light chains. They also produce another type of antibody that is made up of only two heavy chains and no light chain. This is known as heavy chain IgG (hcIgG). While these antibodies do not contain the CH1 region, they retain an antigen binding domain called the VHH region. VHH antibodies, also known as single domain antibodies, contain only the VHH region from the camelid antibody. Camelid antibodies have key characteristics, which include high affinity and specificity (equivalent to conventional antibodies), high thermostability, good solubility and strictly monomeric behavior, small size, relatively low production cost, ease of genetic engineering, format flexibility or modularity, low immunogenicity, and a higher penetration rate into tissues.

The company faced challenges such as Medicare reimbursement restrictions, supply chain limitations, and reduced international distributor orders. Despite these obstacles, Iridex remains focused on its strategic review to unlock shareholder value. Positive Generated total revenue of $12.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 Experienced a 7% decrease in Retina product revenue year-over-year Launched new Iridex 532® and Iridex 577® Lasers in the U.S. Market in January 2024 Engaged in the RUNWAY Study to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of MicroPulse® TLT for post-cataract glaucoma patients Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2023, were approximately $7.0 million Ongoing strategic review process to benefit stockholders Negative Decrease in Cyclo G6 product family revenue and sales Reduction in Retina product revenue Withdrawal of Medicare reimbursement LCDs impacting U.S. demand for glaucoma systems Net loss increased to $9.6 million for the full year 2023 Lower gross profit and gross margin in 2023 compared to the prior year Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Iridex Corporation for Q4 and the full year of 2023 indicate a notable downturn in revenue and an increased net loss compared to the previous year. The reduction in total revenue from $57.0 million in 2022 to $51.9 million in 2023, alongside a decrease in gross margin from 44.5% to 42.0%, suggests a contraction in the company's profitability. This performance could be attributed to several factors, including the impact of Medicare reimbursement policy changes, supply chain disruptions and strategic reviews affecting distributor behaviors.From an investor's perspective, the company's ability to manage operating expenses, which decreased slightly despite the introduction of a new ERP system and strategic review costs, may be seen as a positive sign of cost control. However, the decline in cash and cash equivalents by $1.0 million in the quarter raises concerns about liquidity and cash burn rate. The company's strategic review process and potential asset sales could be a pivotal factor for its future financial stability and investor sentiment. Market Research Analyst The medical device sector is highly sensitive to regulatory changes and reimbursement policies, as evidenced by Iridex's performance following the Medicare reimbursement LCDs withdrawal. The company's report highlights the importance of such policies on product demand, particularly in the U.S. market. It's essential for investors to monitor regulatory environments as they can significantly impact medical device companies' revenues and market strategies.Additionally, the mention of new product launches and positive reactions at a key industry conference suggests that Iridex is focusing on innovation to drive future growth. The introduction of new laser platforms could potentially revitalize sales and improve competitive positioning. However, the actual market acceptance and the financial impact of these new products will be important to assess in the coming periods. Medical Device Industry Expert The decrease in sales of Cyclo G6 Glaucoma Laser Systems and probes indicates a potential shift in market dynamics or competitive pressures within the ophthalmic laser market. The reported decline in international distributor orders may reflect not only the strategic review but also broader market trends, such as increased competition or alternative treatment modalities gaining traction. Investors should consider the company's R&D pipeline and how its products align with current and emerging medical practices in glaucoma and retinal disease treatment.The RUNWAY Study and the UK multicenter registry for MicroPulse TLT clinical studies are significant undertakings that could enhance the company's clinical credibility and support long-term growth if the outcomes are positive. However, the costs and timelines associated with clinical trials are substantial and thus, the company's ability to manage these while navigating current financial challenges will be critical to observe. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Advances strategic review to unlock shareholder valueMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iridex Corporation (Nasdaq: IRIX), a worldwide leader providing innovative and versatile laser-based medical systems, delivery devices, and procedure probes for the treatment of glaucoma and retinal diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 30, 2023, and provided a business update. Fourth Quarter 2023 Results & Recent Highlights Generated total revenue of $12.5 million, compared to $15.2 million in the prior year periodCyclo G6® product family revenue in the fourth quarter of $3.0 million, compared to $4.2 million in the prior year period Sold 12,700 Cyclo G6 probes, compared to 16,400 in the prior year quarterSold 35 Cyclo G6 Glaucoma Laser Systems in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 78 in the prior year quarter Retina product revenue was $7.5 million, representing a decrease of 7% year-over-year Launched new Iridex 532® and Iridex 577® Lasers in U.S. Market in January 2024Completed clinical protocol and engaged first sites for the RUNWAY Study, a large-scale, multicenter prospective trial to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of MicroPulse® TLT for post-cataract glaucoma patientsEnrolled first patient in UK multicenter registry for MicroPulse TLT clinical studies led by Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust with over 20 other sites to participate Withdrawal of the restrictive Medicare reimbursement Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) in late December 2023 that had suppressed U.S. demand for glaucoma systems and probes Cash and cash equivalents as of December 30, 2023 was approximately $7.0 million, a reduction of $1.0 million in the quarter. The previously announced initiatives to reduce operating expenses and cash usage resulted in the lowest quarterly cash use of 2023. Full Year 2023 Results Generated total revenue of $51.9 million, compared to $57.0 million in 2022Cyclo G6 product family revenue of $13.4 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year Sold 54,800 Cyclo G6 probes, compared to 59,800 in the prior yearSold 164 Cyclo G6 Glaucoma Laser Systems compared to 237 in the prior year Retina product revenue was $29.4 million, representing a decrease of 7% year-over-year “In the fourth quarter we experienced a combination of unique events that impacted our revenue. These included: (i) the LCDs, which restricted Medicare reimbursement for our laser treatment in moderate glaucoma, and caused surgeons to temporarily reduce orders for procedure probes and defer adoption of laser systems in the US, (ii) continued physician capital equipment purchasing deferrals related to higher financing costs, (iii) supply chain limitations that created a larger than typical yearend backlog, and (vi) the largest impact was from a double-digit decline in orders from key international distributors as they reduced inventory significantly in reaction to our previously-announced strategic options review and Iridex’ launch of new platforms. The aggregate effect was lower revenue in the quarter and weaker than expected overall 2023 performance.” Mr. Bruce continued, “During the first quarter of 2024, we are seeing business flows more consistent with historical pattens, this includes (i) U.S. glaucoma orders trending toward more normalized levels following retirement of the LCDs; (ii) improving seasonally-adjusted capital purchasing trends especially for Pascal® scanning laser systems; (iii) the resolution of the supply chain issues; and (iv) normalizing distributor orders. In January at the Hawaiian Eye and Retina conference we saw continuing interest in our new Pascal scanning laser and introduced our new Iridex 532 and Iridex 577 single spot platform of retina lasers and we intend to capitalize on our improved and refreshed retina portfolio as the year unfolds.” “We have been, and continue to be, actively pursuing our strategic review process since announcing it in the third quarter last year. Discussions are ongoing with multiple parties relating to all aspects of our business, and we are open to any transaction or series of transactions that will benefit our stockholders. We believe we are on track to reach our first agreement on the sale of certain assets soon,” Bruce added. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the three months ended December 30, 2023 was $12.5 million compared to $15.2million during the same period of the prior year. Retina product revenue decreased 7% compared to the prior year period to $7.5 million. Total product revenue from the Cyclo G6 glaucoma product group was $3.0 million, a decrease of $1.2 million versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Other revenue decreased to $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the prior year period of $2.9 million, primarily driven by decreased royalties due to expiration of licensed patents and lower service revenue. Fourth quarter revenue was impacted by several factors. In the retina business, deferral of capital purchases led to lower system sales in the U.S. and internationally, international distributors destocked inventory in advance of new laser platform launches and to minimize any potential impact from transactions resulting from Iridex’s strategic review. The Company experienced isolated supply chain limitations which caused deferral of product shipment and elevated order backlog. In glaucoma the reimbursement uncertainty in the U.S. led to temporary softness in glaucoma probe and new system sales. Internationally, the largest distributor significantly reduced normal replenishment orders causing a meaningful decline in probe and systems sales in the quarter. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $4.9 million or a 39.2% gross margin, a decrease compared to $6.7 million, or a 43.9% gross margin, in the same period of the prior year driven by lower overhead absorption and product mix. Operating expenses of $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 were essentially flat compared to $8.1 million in the same period of the prior year as cost optimization efforts were offset by the cost of ERP implementation and strategic review expenses. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $3.0 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.07 per share, in the same period of the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $7.0 million as of December 30, 2023. Cash use of $1.0 million in the fourth quarter decreased compared to $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Full Year 2023 Financial ResultsRevenue for the year ended December 30, 2023 was $51.9 million compared to $57.0 million in 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by soft fourth quarter results attributable to lower system and probe sales combined with decreased royalty revenue. Retina product revenue was $29.4 million compared to $31.7 million in the prior year, a decrease of 7%, driven by decreased capital system sales and distributor destocking. Total product revenue from the Cyclo G6 glaucoma product family was $13.4 million compared to $14.7 million in fiscal year 2022, driven by lower capital system sales and probe utilization resulting reimbursement uncertainty in the United States and distributor inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. Other revenue was $9.1 million in 2023 compared to $10.6 million in the prior year primarily driven by decreased royalties due to expiration of licensed patents. Gross profit for the full year 2023 was $21.8 million, representing 42.0% gross margin, compared to $25.4 million, or 44.5% gross margin, during the prior year primarily driven by the reduction in royalty revenues and product mix. Operating expenses for 2023 decreased 3% to $31.8 million compared to $32.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the staffing and planned cost reductions partially offset by one-time expenses related to new ERP implementation. Net loss for 2023 increased to $9.6 million, or $0. 59 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.47 per share in the prior year.

The company's net revenues increased by 37.7% to $132.1 million, with a net loss of $2.4 million. Hour Loop aims to enhance profitability by managing expenses and remains cautiously optimistic for 2024. Positive Hour Loop achieved a substantial revenue growth of 37.7% in 2023, reaching $132.1 million. The net loss for the year was $2.4 million, compared to $1.5 million in 2022. Despite challenges like inflation and intense competition, Hour Loop managed to decrease operating expenses percentage by 0.5%. The company's cash position decreased to $2.5 million in 2023, from $4.6 million in 2022. Hour Loop anticipates a net revenue range of $145 million to $172 million for 2024, with expected net income between $0.5 million to $2 million. Negative Gross margin decreased by 0.8% to 50.3% in 2023 due to increased market competition and aggressive clearance sales. Net loss increased to $2.4 million in 2023, impacting the company's cash position. Inventory decreased to $14.3 million in 2023, reflecting sales made throughout the year. Market Research Analyst The reported revenue growth of 37.7% in a challenging e-commerce landscape is a notable achievement for Hour Loop, Inc. This outperformance relative to peers indicates a robust operational model and effective market penetration strategies. However, the decrease in gross margin by 0.8% and an increase in net loss from the previous year are areas of concern. The reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues suggests effective cost management, yet it was insufficient to counterbalance the margin contraction.Investors should be aware of the potential risks associated with the company's increased competition and aggressive discounting strategies, which are likely contributing factors to the reduced margins. The guidance for 2024, with expected net income turning positive, reflects management's confidence but must be viewed in the context of the broader economic uncertainties and the company's recent performance trends. Financial Analyst Hour Loop's financial health can be partially assessed by examining its cash position, which decreased significantly year-over-year. This decline, coupled with a net loss, may raise questions about the company's liquidity and long-term sustainability. The reduction in inventories suggests that the company is effectively turning over its inventory, which is positive for cash flow.From an investment perspective, the projected revenue growth for 2024 indicates optimism about the company's future performance. However, investors should scrutinize the company's ability to improve profitability and manage expenses amidst inflationary pressures and higher Amazon fees. The provided guidance range is quite broad, which suggests there is still a degree of uncertainty regarding the company's future performance. Economist Hour Loop's performance must be contextualized within the broader e-commerce sector and macroeconomic environment. The company's growth amidst inflationary pressures and a challenging e-commerce environment is commendable. Nonetheless, the macroeconomic headwinds, such as inflation and potential shifts in consumer spending, could affect future performance. The company's ability to manage these headwinds while maintaining growth will be critical to its success.Long-term sustainability will hinge on the company's ability to adapt to the dynamic e-commerce market. The guidance for 2024 indicates a cautious yet optimistic outlook, which seems reasonable given the current economic uncertainty. Stakeholders should monitor how Hour Loop navigates these challenges and capitalizes on demand for its products. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Demonstrates Strong Revenue Growth Despite Challenging e-Commerce Environment Provides Full Year 2024 Revenue and Net Income Guidance Redmond, WA, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hour Loop, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOUR) (“Hour Loop”), a leading online retailer, announces its financial and operational results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Financial Highlights for 2023: Net revenues increased 37.7% to $132.1 million, compared to $95.9 million in 2022;Net loss totaled $2.4 million, compared to net loss $1.5 million in 2022; andCash used for operating activities was $2.1 million and $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management Commentary “We are pleased to report our full year 2023 results, in which we continued to deliver significant revenue growth,” said Sam Lai, CEO of Hour Loop. “The revenue growth rate for 2023 was 37.7%, compared with 2022, and outperformed most peers that we know.” “However, our gross margin, compared with 2022, was negatively affected by the inflation impacted macroeconomy, a challenging e-commerce environment, intense competition across the industry, and more aggressive clearance sales during the holiday season. Our operating expenses percentage decreased compared with 2022 because of efforts made for expense management this year amid higher Amazon related fees. Overall, we believe we’ve built a solid foundation to continue generating strong growth. We also aim to continue making improvements on profitability.” “Looking forward, we’re cautiously optimistic. Despite an uncertain economy, we continue to see strong demand for our products so far in 2024. We are confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our vendors, customers, and shareholders.” Full Year 2023 Financial Results Net revenues in 2023 were $132.1 million, compared to $95.9 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to continued growth and maturity in our operating model, despite intense competition. Gross margin decreased 0.8% to 50.3%, compared to 51.1%, of net revenues in 2022. The decrease was a function of increased market competition and more aggressive clearance sales during the holiday season. Operating expenses percentage decreased 0.5% to 52.6%, compared to 53.1%, of net revenues in 2022. The decrease reflected better management of shipping charges, advertising expenses, and labor costs amid higher Amazon related fees. Net loss in 2023 was $2.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in 2022. The decrease was driven by decreased gross margin as a result of the reasons mentioned above despite efforts made for expense management. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2.5 million in cash, compared to $4.6 million as of December 31, 2022 due to operating loss. Inventories as of December 31, 2023, were $14.3 million, compared to $18.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease is due to sales made throughout the year. Full Year 2024 Financial Outlook For the full year 2024, Hour Loop is providing guidance for net revenue to be in the range of $145 million to $172 million, representing 10% to 30% year-over-year growth. The Company expects 2024 net income to be in the range of $0.5 million to $2 million. About Hour Loop, Inc. Hour Loop is an online retailer engaged in e-commerce retailing in the U.S. market.

Current Benchmark New Benchmark Solactive United States Energy Regulated Capped Index Bloomberg US Energy Select Index The benchmark of the Fund will be moving to the Bloomberg US Energy Select Index (the ""Index""), which measures the performance of U.S. oil and gas producers. ABOUT ETF ARCHITECTVeteran owned and operated; ETF Architect is one of the market leaders for best-in-class ETF operations. ETF Architect partners with advisers, ETF sponsors, mutual fund managers, and industry veterans to launch ETFs. For more information, visit www.ETFArchitect.com. If you have any questions regarding the Fund, please call 215-882-9983. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Fund, please visit our website at www.strivefunds.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. The principal risks of investing in DRLL include: Energy Sector Risk. The market value of securities in the energy sector may decline for many reasons including, fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand of energy fuels caused by geopolitical events, the success of exploration projects, weather or meteorological events, taxes, increased governmental or environmental regulation, resource depletion, rising interest rates, declines in domestic or foreign production, accidents or catastrophic events that result in injury, loss of life or property, pollution or other environmental damage claims, terrorist threats or attacks, among other factors. Markets for various energy-related commodities can have significant volatility and are subject to control or manipulation by large producers or purchasers. Companies in the energy sector may need to make substantial expenditures, and may incur significant amounts of debt, to maintain or expand their reserves through exploration of new sources of supply, through the development of existing sources, through acquisitions, or through long-term contracts to acquire reserves. Factors adversely affecting producers, refiners, distributors, or others in the energy sector may adversely affect companies that service or supply those entities, either because demand for those services or products is curtailed, or those services or products come under price pressure. Issuers in the energy sector may also be impacted by changing investor and consumer preferences arising from the sector's potential exposure to sustainability and environmental concerns. Oil and Gas Sector Risk. The profitability of companies in the oil and gas sector is related to worldwide energy prices, exploration costs, and production spending. Companies in the oil and gas sector may be at risk for environmental damage claims and other types of litigation, as well as negative publicity and perception. Companies in the oil and gas sector may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophes, changes in exchange rates, interest rates, changes in prices for competitive energy services, economic conditions, tax treatment, government regulation and intervention, and unfavorable events in the regions where companies operate (e.g., expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets and property or imposition of restrictions on foreign investments and repatriation of capital, military coups, social unrest, violence or labor unrest). As a result, the value of these companies may fluctuate widely. Companies in the oil and gas sector may have significant capital investments in, or engage in transactions involving, emerging market countries, which may heighten these risks. Any of these factors could result in a material adverse impact on the Fund's securities and the performance of the Fund. Equity Investing Risk. An investment in the Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund holding equity securities, such as market fluctuations, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The values of equity securities could decline generally or could underperform other investments. Index Calculation Risk. The Index relies on various sources of information to assess the criteria of issuers included in the Index, including fundamental information that may be based on assumptions and estimates. Limited Operating History Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with a limited operating history. As a result, prospective investors have a limited track record or history on which to base their investment decision. The Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

Financially, revenues increased driven by precision devices adoption, sales, and marketing investments. However, cost of revenue and expenses also increased, impacting the bottom line. Positive None. Negative Cost of revenue and expenses increased, affecting the bottom line despite revenue growth. Financial Analyst The reported growth in revenues and the strategic focus on reducing operating expenses are indicative of ProSomnus's operational success and efficiency gains. The company's significant revenue increase, both quarterly and annually, suggests strong market demand for its non-CPAP therapy devices for OSA. Notably, the 35% and 43% year-over-year revenue growth rates are impressive, potentially signaling a robust competitive position and successful sales and marketing strategies.However, the rise in cost of revenue and operating expenses, particularly in sales and marketing, could raise concerns regarding the company's scalability and margin pressure. The 53% cost of revenue in Q4 indicates a need for continued efficiency improvements, especially as the company scales up. The cash and restricted cash decrease also warrants attention, as it reflects a significant burn rate that could impact financial stability if not managed alongside the strategic growth initiatives. Medical Device Market Analyst ProSomnus's record revenues highlight the growing acceptance of alternative OSA treatments in the medical device market. The company's Next Generation Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) device represents a technological advancement that could disrupt traditional OSA treatment modalities. The successful pilot study and the FDA submission for label expansion suggest potential for market share growth in the severe OSA segment.However, the market will be closely watching the FDA's decision on the label expansion, as it will have significant implications for the company's product reach and competitive edge. The ISO 13485:2016 certification is a positive indicator of quality management, which could enhance provider and patient confidence, potentially leading to increased adoption rates. Healthcare Industry Analyst The strategic review of financing options indicates that ProSomnus is actively looking to fortify its balance sheet, which is important for funding future growth in the competitive healthcare market. The company's focus on maintaining high on-time delivery and satisfaction rates is essential for customer retention and brand reputation in the healthcare industry, where trust and reliability are paramount.Moreover, the company's investment in R&D, as evidenced by the increased expenses, underlines its commitment to innovation, which is vital for long-term sustainability in the healthcare sector. The investment in clinical studies and FDA submissions could lead to expanded indications and market opportunities, but these efforts must be balanced with financial prudence to avoid overextending resources. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM PLEASANTON, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProSomnus, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSA), the leading non-CPAP therapy™ for the treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

We continued to fine-tune our operations in an effort to progress towards cash flow breakeven while maintaining strong top line growth. In all, it was a tremendous year of achievements as we advance our mission to position ProSomnus as the leading non-CPAP therapy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. I am proud of the 2023 results, and I look forward to building upon this momentum during 2024.” Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenues increased to $7.8 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. This reflects an increase of $0.8 million, or 11%, and $2.0 million, or 35%, compared to the quarters ended September 2023 and December 2022, respectively. Revenue for the full year 2023 increased to $27.7 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 43%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by increased adoption of our precision devices, increased sales and marketing investments, and mix shift to the EVO Product, all of which contributed to increased unit volumes. Cost of revenue totaled $4.1 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023, representing 53% of revenue. This reflects an increase of $0.6 million, or 15%, and $1.4 million, or 54%, compared to the quarters ended September 2023 and December 2022, respectively. For the full year 2023 cost of revenue totaled $13.6 million, representing 49% of revenue, an increase of $4.5 million, or 49%, compared to $9.1 million, or 47% of revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to product costs associated with higher sales volume of our devices and increased overhead stemming from our move into our new manufacturing facility during early 2023. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $3.4 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Relative to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the commencement of our expense reduction initiative, sales and marketing has decreased 6% and as percentage of revenue has decreased from 53% to 43% for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Fourth quarter 2023 sales and marketing expense reflects a modest increase compared to the quarter ended September 2023, and an increase of $1.0 million, or 40%, compared to the quarter ended December 2022. Sales and marketing expenses for the full year 2023 totaled $13.1 million, an increase of $4.2 million, or 48%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This year-over-year increase reflects an increase in personnel and consulting-related expenses of $2.7 million due to expansion of the sales team during mid-2023, distribution, marketing events, and advertising expenses of $1.2 million, and commissions paid on higher revenues. General and administrative expenses totaled $4.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Relative to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, general and administrative expenses decreased 11% and as percentage of revenue has decreased from 65% to 51% for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Fourth quarter 2023 general and administrative expenses reflect an increase of $0.5 million, or 16%, compared to the quarter ended September 2023, and a decrease of $1.7 million, or 30%, compared to the quarter ended December 2022. For the full year 2023 general and administrative expenses totaled $15.2 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 54%, compared to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was driven primarily by $2.9 million increase in costs that scale with top line and production growth including credit card fees, utilities, rent and depreciation associated with the new manufacturing facility, and public company expenses including $2.5 million increase in professional services, $1.3 million increase in personnel costs, and $1.0 million in insurance, partially offset by $1.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses totaled $1.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Relative to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the commencement of our expense reduction initiative, research and development expenses remained consistent and as percentage of revenue has decreased from 20% to 17% for the quarters ended December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Fourth quarter 2023 reflects an increase of $0.3 million, or 31.4%, and $0.3 million, or 28% compared to the quarters ended September 2023 and December 2022, respectively. For the full year 2023 research and development expenses totaled $4.8 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 61%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in expenses associated with the ongoing development of the RPMO2, the Front Line OSA Therapy (“FLOSAT”) clinical study and costs associated with preparing the 510(k) Premarket Notification to U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the severe indication label expansion. Other income (expense) is comprised of interest expense and accounting charges associated with changes in fair values of certain assets and liabilities and charges associated with financings and debt restructuring. Total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 aggregated to $5.0 million compared to total other income of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The other income resulting from the valuation changes in certain of our liabilities reflect the price decline of our publicly traded stock which is a significant input into the fair value valuation assumptions for the liabilities revalued. This other income was offset during 2023 by a loss on debt restructuring associated with changes in the terms of certain of our senior and subordinate indentures as part of our September 2023 financing transactions. Interest expense reflects the interest on our senior and subordinate indentures and equipment financing liabilities. Cash and restricted cash at December 31, 2023 totaled $7.1M, reflecting a decrease of $4.9 million from the $12.0 million reported at September 30, 2023. The decrease noted includes approximately $1.0 million of cash used to renew the Company’s insurance policies during December 2023.

Financial Analyst When analyzing the financial performance of nCino, Inc., the reported increase in total revenues by 13% in Q4 and 17% for the fiscal year 2024 indicates a consistent upward trajectory in the company's earnings. This performance is particularly noteworthy in the context of the global financial services industry, which has been facing various challenges such as fluctuating interest rates and regulatory changes.The subscription revenues, which saw a 16% increase in Q4 and a 19% rise for the fiscal year, suggest a solidifying recurring revenue stream. This metric is critical as it points to the sustainability and predictability of future earnings. Investors often value companies with strong subscription-based models due to the stable cash flow they can provide.However, the announcement of the Chief Revenue Officer transition could signal upcoming strategic shifts or potential disruptions in sales processes. It is important to monitor how this change will affect the company's revenue growth momentum in the subsequent quarters. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, nCino's growth in subscription revenue is indicative of a broader trend towards cloud-based solutions in the financial services sector. As financial institutions continue to invest in digital transformation, nCino's cloud banking platform appears to be capturing more market share. This is likely contributing to the company's revenue growth.Moreover, the company's performance should be contextualized within the competitive landscape. If nCino is outpacing its competitors in terms of revenue growth, it could be gaining a competitive advantage. On the flip side, if the industry as a whole is growing at a similar or faster rate, nCino's growth may be in line with market trends rather than indicative of outperformance. Economist Considering the macroeconomic environment, nCino's revenue growth can be seen as a positive sign of resilience. In periods of economic uncertainty, businesses often cut back on new software investments, making nCino's growth particularly commendable. It's also reflective of an ongoing digital push within the financial sector, which seems to be less sensitive to economic downturns than other industries.Looking ahead, the company's future performance will likely be influenced by economic factors such as interest rates, which can affect clients' investment capacities. It will be important to observe how nCino navigates these challenges while maintaining its growth trajectory. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Q4 Total Revenues of $123.7M, up 13% year-over-year Fiscal Year 2024 Total Revenues of $476.5M, up 17% year-over-year Q4 Subscription Revenues of $107.5M, up 16% year-over-year Fiscal Year 2024 Subscription Revenues of $409.5M, up 19% year-over-yearCompany Announces Chief Revenue Officer Transition WILMINGTON, N.C., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- nCino, Inc.

restricted cash, end of period$87,418 $117,444 Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn nCino’s public disclosures, nCino has provided non-GAAP measures, which are measurements of financial performance that have not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to its GAAP measures, nCino uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results. For the reasons set forth below, nCino believes that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our operating results, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles. nCino incurs amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions. Because these costs have already been incurred, cannot be recovered, are non-cash, and are affected by the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations, nCino excludes these expenses for our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Although nCino excludes amortization expense for purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. nCino excludes stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that nCino excludes from our internal management reporting processes. nCino’s management also finds it useful to exclude these expenses when they assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use, nCino believes excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies. Acquisition-Related Expenses. nCino excludes expenses related to acquisitions as they limit comparability of operating results with prior periods. We believe these costs are non-recurring in nature and outside the ordinary course of business. Litigation Expenses. nCino excludes fees and expenses related to litigation expenses incurred from legal matters outside the ordinary course of our business as we believe their exclusion from non-GAAP operating expenses will facilitate a more meaningful explanation of operating results and comparisons with prior period results. Restructuring Costs. nCino excludes costs incurred related to bespoke restructuring plans and other one-time costs that are fundamentally different in strategic nature and frequency from ongoing initiatives. We believe excluding these costs facilitates a more consistent comparison of operating performance over time. Adjustments to stock-based compensation in connection with restructuring events are presented in Stock-Based Compensation Expenses. Tax (Benefit) Provision Related to the SimpleNexus Acquisition. Upon the acquisition of SimpleNexus, nCino reduced the valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in a one-time tax benefit recorded in Income tax (benefit) provision. We believe that the exclusion of this benefit from our non-GAAP net loss attributable to nCino and non-GAAP net loss attributable to nCino per share provides a more direct comparison to all periods presented. Income Tax Effect on Non-GAAP Adjustments. The income tax effects are related to the imputed tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses.Adjustment to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interest. nCino adjusts the value of redeemable non-controlling interest of its joint venture nCino K.K. in accordance with the operating agreement for that entity. nCino believes investors benefit from an understanding of the company’s operating results absent the effect of this adjustment, and for comparability, has reconciled this adjustment for previously reported non-GAAP results. There are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by nCino’s management about which items are adjusted to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures. nCino compensates for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in its public disclosures. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. nCino encourages investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables below.

Positive Successful results from the SAD portion of the BT-600 clinical trial showcasing targeted drug delivery to the colon Lower systemic drug levels observed with NaviCap devices compared to conventional oral delivery Progression of the BT-600 trial with anticipated conclusion in Q2 2024 and plans for a clinical study in H2 2024 Reduction of net debt by 75% in 2023 and raising $19.8 million through note exchanges BioJet platform's advancement with successful animal studies and potential partnerships in the pipeline Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The completion of the single-ascending dose (SAD) portion of the BT-600 clinical trial by Biora Therapeutics signifies a important step in the development of a novel therapeutic delivery system for ulcerative colitis. The reported data indicating targeted drug delivery and absorption in the colon, with lower systemic drug levels, suggests a potential for improved treatment efficacy and reduced side effects. This could represent a shift in the treatment paradigm for ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that affects millions worldwide. The Medical Research Analyst perspective here focuses on the implications of these clinical results for future drug development and patient care. The reduction in drug levels in the blood implies a more localized effect, which could lead to fewer systemic side effects and an improved safety profile, a common concern among patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, the dose-proportional pharmacokinetics observed with tofacitinib, the active drug in BT-600, are indicative of predictable and controllable drug exposure, an important factor in managing chronic conditions. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the positive clinical trial results of BT-600 and the progression of the BioJet platform are likely to be seen favorably by investors and could potentially increase Biora Therapeutics' market value. The company's efforts in reducing its net debt by 75% and raising $19.8 million through note exchanges reflect a strategic approach to capital structure optimization. These moves could improve the company's financial flexibility and investor sentiment. Furthermore, the monetization of an investment and the resolution of a legacy legal matter add to a more streamlined and focused financial strategy. However, despite these positive developments, the reported net loss of $124.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, is a significant increase from the previous year. This underscores the inherent risks and financial pressures in the biotech industry, especially for companies in the clinical stage without revenue-generating products. Market Research Analyst The biotech sector is highly competitive and sensitive to clinical trial outcomes, which can significantly influence stock performance. Biora Therapeutics' announcement of successful SAD clinical trial results could impact its competitiveness in the ulcerative colitis treatment market. The ability to demonstrate targeted delivery with lower systemic exposure could differentiate BT-600 from existing treatments and potentially capture market share if the subsequent multiple ascending dose (MAD) trials and planned clinical studies in active ulcerative colitis patients are successful. The preclinical success of the BioJet platform, achieving higher bioavailability, positions Biora to potentially disrupt the oral delivery market for biologics, a market that has traditionally relied on injections. The anticipation of partnership agreements could signal further validation of the technology and potential revenue streams. However, the long-term market impact will depend on continued positive clinical outcomes, regulatory approvals and the ability to commercialize these platforms effectively. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM All performance targets achieved in single-ascending dose (SAD) cohorts of BT-600 clinical trial Results demonstrated targeted drug delivery and absorption in the colon, with 3-4 times lower drug levels in blood Remainder of BT-600 clinical trial progressing well and on schedule Management will host conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern / 1:30 PM Pacific SAN DIEGO, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biora Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIOR), the biotech company that is reimagining therapeutic delivery, today provided a corporate update and reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “We are thrilled by the results from the single ascending dose (SAD) portion of our clinical trial for BT-600. The data indicate exactly what we had hoped: NaviCap devices consistently delivered tofacitinib directly to the colon, resulting in systemic drug levels three to four times lower than conventional oral delivery. This demonstrates the NaviCap platform’s unique ability for targeted delivery to the colon, and is consistent with potentially higher drug levels in colon tissue at the site of the disease,” said Adi Mohanty, Chief Executive Officer of Biora Therapeutics. “We eagerly anticipate the conclusion of the multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the trial during the second quarter of 2024, which will provide additional insight into the performance of BT-600. We are working to create a new treatment paradigm that leads to better outcomes for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis, and we are encouraged by the data so far,” stated Mr. Mohanty. “Meanwhile, our BioJet platform is progressing well. We just completed animal studies with another collaborator molecule, and we remain focused on our planned goal of progressing to partnerships this year,” continued Mr. Mohanty. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 and Recent Highlights NaviCap™ Targeted Oral Delivery Platform and BT-600 in ulcerative colitis Completion of SAD Portion of Phase 1 Clinical Trial for BT-600. Results from the single-ascending dose (SAD) portion of the trial were consistent with desired performance targets: NaviCap devices were well tolerated by study subjects in the SAD cohort.All participants who received devices containing active drug showed systemic drug absorption, indicating that the NaviCap devices released and delivered drug as intended.Measurable tofacitinib in blood was first observed at approximately six hours, with maximal concentrations at approximately eight hours post ingestion, which is indicative of drug delivery and absorption in the colon, as intended.Plasma levels of tofacitinib were approximately 3-4 times lower than what is observed with conventional oral tofacitinib at the same doses, which is a positive sign consistent with passage of drug through the colonic tissue and into systemic circulation. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics were also observed, with consistently lower plasma drug concentrations with the 5 mg dose than the 10 mg dose. BioJet™ Systemic Oral Delivery Platform preclinical development BioJet Research Collaborations. Biora has now successfully performed animal studies with peptides, antibodies, and nucleic acids, exceeding its performance target of 15% bioavailability compared to IV administration, and achieving 30-40% bioavailability with its most recent studies. The company recently completed animal studies with another large pharma research collaborator; final study data is anticipated during Q2. Capital Markets Optimization of Capital Structure. During 2023, Biora reduced its outstanding notes by more than $80 million, resulting in a 75% reduction in net debt. With an additional note exchange in March 2024, the company has brought in a total of $19.8 million in new investment through these transactions, demonstrating continued support from institutional investors.Resolution of Legacy Matters. Biora recently monetized its investment in Enumera Molecular, Inc., generating $3 million in non-dilutive capital, and also reached an agreement in principle to resolve a legacy securities litigation matter. The company believes that remaining legacy issues will have minimal impact on Biora going forward. Anticipated Milestones NaviCap™ Targeted Oral Delivery Platform and BT-600 in ulcerative colitis Conclusion of the Phase 1 clinical trial of BT-600 is anticipated. The company expects to receive final SAD/MAD data, including colon tissue biopsy results, during Q2 2024 and plans to present topline data from the trial shortly afterward.A clinical study in active ulcerative colitis patients is planned during the second half of 2024. BioJet™ Systemic Oral Delivery Platform development The company expects data from a recently completed animal study with its newest large pharmaceutical collaborator during Q2.An update on data from recent animal studies will be shared at the Next Gen Peptide Formulation & Delivery Summit in June 2024.Biora anticipates continued progress toward a partnership agreement for the BioJet platform.

The $538 million transaction is expected to drive incremental benefits, support future growth, and capture $7 million of synergies. The acquisition is set to be immediately accretive to EBITDA margins. Positive Acquisition of Ipackchem Group SAS enhances Greif's portfolio and market position. Transaction value of $538 million with additional $38 million for a ticking fee. Integration strategy to drive incremental benefits and capture $7 million of synergies. Expected immediate accretion to EBITDA margins post-acquisition. Financial results of Ipackchem to be reported within Greif's Global Industrial Packaging segment. Payment funded through the Company's existing credit facility. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Ipackchem by Greif, Inc. represents a strategic move that aligns with Greif's Build to Last strategy, indicating a focus on long-term growth and market expansion. The integration of Ipackchem's expertise in small plastic containers and jerrycans into Greif's portfolio diversifies the company's product offerings and potentially opens up new market segments. The anticipated $7 million in synergies suggests that Greif is looking to optimize operations and reduce costs, which could lead to improved profit margins over time.From a market perspective, the transaction increases Greif's global footprint and competitive edge. The deal's immediate accretive effect on EBITDA margins is a positive signal to investors, as it implies that the acquisition will enhance the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue. This financial metric is often used to assess a company's operating performance and profitability. The inclusion of Ipackchem's financials in the upcoming earnings release will provide stakeholders with a clearer picture of the acquisition's impact on Greif's financial health. Financial Analyst The financial structuring of the acquisition, with a transaction value of $538 million plus a $38 million ticking fee, indicates a significant investment by Greif. The use of the company's existing credit facility to fund the payment suggests confidence in the acquisition's return on investment. However, it's important to monitor the company's debt levels post-acquisition to understand the long-term financial implications.Investors should consider the effect of this acquisition on the company's leverage and liquidity ratios, as these will influence its ability to meet financial obligations and invest in future growth opportunities. The fact that the acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to EBITDA margins can be seen as a mitigating factor against the risks associated with increased debt. Nevertheless, it is essential to evaluate future earnings reports and guidance to assess the actual performance against the projected $7 million in synergies. Mergers and Acquisitions Expert The strategic integration of Ipackchem into Greif's operations is a textbook example of a company seeking to enhance its market position and operational capabilities. The mention of planning the integration strategy over the past several months indicates a meticulous approach, which is important for realizing the full potential of such mergers. Effective post-acquisition integration is key to achieving projected synergies and avoiding common pitfalls that can erode anticipated benefits.It is also noteworthy that the acquisition includes a ticking fee, which compensates the seller for the earnings accrued to Greif during the period between the deal agreement and closing. This reflects the dynamic nature of M&A deals and the need to account for time-sensitive variables such as earnings and foreign exchange impacts. The immediate post-closing implementation of the integration strategy underscores the urgency with which Greif is pursuing the realization of synergies and growth opportunities. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM DELAWARE, Ohio, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greif, Inc.

Positive Record Q4 2023 revenue of $22.3 million marked a 100% increase from Q4 2022, surpassing guidance. Fiscal year 2023 saw revenue double to $65.9 million, with RYVYL EU revenue growing by 294%. Processing volume in Q4 2023 hit $1.0 billion, exceeding expectations. Partnership with R3 introduced RYVYL Block, a blockchain-as-a-service infrastructure. CEO Fredi Nisan emphasized strong revenue growth, debt reduction, and market expansion. Expected revenue decline in Q1 2024 due to product transitions and banking partner change. Positive outlook for 2024 with robust business pipeline, new partnerships, and service expansions. Negative Net loss in Q4 2023 was $30.0 million, compared to $16.0 million in Q4 2022. Operating expenses decreased by 57% to $10.6 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million in Q4 2023, compared to a loss of ($2.9) million in Q4 2022. Financial Analyst The reported revenue growth for RYVYL Inc., which doubled in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, is a robust indicator of the company's top-line performance. The significant reduction in total indebtedness, particularly the convertible note principal balance, suggests a strategic move to strengthen the balance sheet. This fiscal maneuvering reflects positively on the company's creditworthiness and could potentially improve its risk profile among investors.Moreover, the operational shift from terminal-based to app-based processing in North America, alongside the change in banking partner due to compliance and regulatory demands, underscores the dynamic nature of the fintech industry. These changes, while potentially disruptive in the short term, could pave the way for improved margins and market adaptability in the long run. The collaboration with R3 to introduce a blockchain-as-a-service solution may also signal an innovative leap, potentially opening up new revenue streams.However, the reported net loss, despite the revenue surge, raises questions about the cost structure and scalability of RYVYL's business model. The increase in cost of revenue and other expenses tied to debt restructuring necessitates a deeper analysis of the company's operational efficiency and long-term profitability trajectory. Market Research Analyst The substantial revenue growth in the European Union segment, which surged by 294%, indicates a strong market penetration and expansion strategy in international markets. This geographic diversification could be a hedge against market-specific risks and an avenue for sustained growth. Additionally, the processing volume growth of 83% to $3.1 billion in 2023 suggests that RYVYL is successfully capturing a larger share of the payment processing market.The transition to app-based processing and the upcoming Visa Direct integration are indicative of RYVYL's commitment to staying at the forefront of payment technology. These developments are expected to enhance the customer experience and could lead to higher retention rates and an expanded client base.Investors should note the seasonality in RYVYL's business, as indicated by the expected revenue decline in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Such fluctuations are common in the fintech sector and should be factored into forecasting and valuation models. Blockchain Technology Consultant The introduction of RYVYL Block, a blockchain-as-a-service infrastructure, signifies the company's strategic investment in emerging technologies. Blockchain's inherent features, such as security, transparency and efficiency, are well-aligned with the needs of the digital payments industry. RYVYL's adoption of this technology could offer competitive advantages, including reduced transaction costs and enhanced trust among users.However, the successful integration and adoption of blockchain technology require careful consideration of regulatory compliance, particularly in the international payments space. The company's proactive approach towards regulatory changes, as evidenced by the banking partner switch, is a positive sign of its commitment to navigating the complex compliance landscape.Investors should assess the potential impact of these technological advancements on the company's long-term value proposition, keeping in mind the balance between innovation-led growth and the associated implementation risks. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Record Q4 2023 Revenue of $22.3 Million Increased 100% Compared to Q4 2022 and Exceeded Guidance of $19 Million to $21 Million Company Management to Host Conference Call at 4:30 p.m. E.T on Tuesday, March 26, 2024 SAN DIEGO, CA, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RYVYL Inc. (NASDAQ: RVYL) (""RYVYL” or the ""Company""), a leading innovator of payment transaction solutions leveraging proprietary blockchain ledger and electronic token technology for the diverse international markets, reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Operational Highlights Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Compared to Same Periods in 2022 Record fourth quarter 2023 and fiscal year 2023 revenue both doubled to $22.3 million and $65.9 million, respectively, over the same time periods in 2022. 2023 RYVYL EU grew revenue 294% to $16.9 million. Fourth quarter processing volume of $1.0 billion exceeded guidance and increased 98% from the prior year same period. 2023 FX and International payments had $590 million in business volume, 14% higher than the third quarter 2023.North America merchant acquiring business volume increased to $278 million, 30% higher than the third quarter 2023. 2023 processing volume grew 83% to $3.1 billion.Total indebtedness decreased to $19.2 million after reducing the convertible note principal balance by $66.3 million.The partnership with R3 introduced RYVYL Block, a next-generation blockchain-as-a-service infrastructure that enables streamlined and secure digital transformation. CEO Fredi Nisan said, “Continuing our path to shape the future of financial transactions, in 2023, we delivered the strongest year in our history. Impressive business volume growth resulted in record company revenues. Ryvyl EU revenue nearly tripled, and the market continues to present a lucrative long-term opportunity, including our Visa Direct integration that we expect to complete by mid-2024. “Further, by executing several foundational initiatives, we improved our ability to scale. During the fourth quarter of 2023, to expand payment processing and banking-as-a-service solutions, we strategically decided to optimize the coyni technology platform. By maintaining a consolidated product roadmap, we expect to leverage coyni in both existing and targeted new vertical markets for better operating efficiencies and enhanced profitability. “During 2023, we focused on fortifying our balance sheet and executed two exchange agreements with our convertible noteholder, reducing the principal balance over 70% by year end. We believe this demonstrates the noteholder’s ongoing support and belief in our core mission. “In 2024, we continue to expect strong revenue growth, with the second half of the year contributing more than the first half. That said, first quarter 2024 revenues are expected to decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, due to lower business volume reflecting a product transition and a coincident change in our banking partner. Specifically, in February 2024, in North America one of RYVYL’s products moved away from terminal-based to app-based processing. Changes in the compliance environment and banking regulations prompted us to select a new banking partner. “Overall, our pipeline of business is robust with multiple opportunities to enter new markets and acquire new customers. There are underlying growth trends in business volume and international markets supported by new initiatives, and new partnerships such as ACI Worldwide and R3. Coupling our coyni platform with improved efficiencies, we expect to introduce services in new business verticals and to continue enabling transformation of the digital payments ecosystem,” concluded Nisan.

We exclude these items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that the exclusion of these items will provide for more meaningful information about our financial performance, and do not consider the excluded items to be part of our ongoing results of operations. Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; (d) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, net income (loss) and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the periods indicated: Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) attributable to RYVYL, Inc., to Adjusted EBITDA for theThree and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022(in thousands, except share and per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net loss$(30,003) $(16,016) $(53,101) $(49,236)Interest expense 30 754 3,340 8,169 Accretion of debt discount 3,508 2,440 13,134 13,980 Income tax expense (benefit) 151 (46) 289 (8)Depreciation and amortization 654 16,037 2,553 20,917 EBITDA (25,660) 3,169 (33,785) (6,178) Other non-cash adjustments Changes in fair value of derivative liability 35 (2,265) (6,544) (16,857)Derecognition expense on conversion of convertible debt 23,516 (4,053) 25,035 5,710 Stock compensation expense 1,544 240 1,853 2,969 Special Items Non-recurring legal settlements and ongoing matters and related legal fees - - 5,308 - Carryover effects of financial statement restatements in prior periods 691 - 1,913 - Non-recurring provision for credit losses on legacy matters - - 1,994 - Accounting fees related to the restatement of prior period financial statements - - 237 - Non-recurring impairment of right of use asset - - 100 - Non-recurring costs of spin-off - - 29 - Adjusted EBITDA$126 $(2,909) $(3,860) $(14,356) Loss from operations$(2,832) $(18,769) $(12,302) $(37,838) What was RYVYL's Q4 2023 revenue, and how did it compare to Q4 2022?

Detailed analysis of positive and negative aspects. Positive Exceeded high-end guidance on net sales and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2023. Received FDA approval for Acthar Gel Single-Dose Pre-filled SelfJect Injector with launch planned for 2024. Successful launch of Terlivaz and FDA clearance of INOmax EVOLVE DS Delivery System. Appointed new board members with expertise in pharmaceuticals, healthcare, finance, and operations. Provided 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $520 million to $560 million. Negative Net sales decrease in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Specialty Brands segment net sales decline due to competition and overall pharmaceutical spending pressure. Decrease in adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to competition and product mix shift. Cash balance decreased at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Financial Analyst The financial results of Mallinckrodt plc, a specialty pharmaceutical company, indicate a mixed performance with net sales for the fiscal year exceeding guidance but a decrease in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year. The company's net income for the fourth quarter shows a significant increase, primarily due to the reorganization impacts of Chapter 11 proceedings. However, the Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and fiscal year witnessed a decrease, suggesting a potential concern for profitability and operational efficiency.From a financial perspective, the repayment of debt and the current liquidity position provide a more stable foundation for future operations. The guidance for 2024 Adjusted EBITDA suggests cautious optimism, with expectations of continued growth in Specialty Generics. The approval of new products and delivery systems may contribute to future revenue streams, but it's important to monitor the impact of competition and market dynamics on the company's Specialty Brands segment. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The pharmaceutical market is highly competitive and the loss of exclusivity for Amitiza has impacted Mallinckrodt's Specialty Brands segment. The launch of Terlivaz and the growth in Therakos have partially offset this impact. The FDA approval of the SelfJect and the expected rollout of the INOmax EVOLVE delivery system in 2024 are strategic moves that could strengthen the company's market position in niche therapeutic areas.It's essential to analyze the market acceptance of these new products and their contribution to the company's revenue. The Specialty Generics segment's growth is promising, particularly in the context of ongoing disruptions in product quality and supply across the broader market. The segment's performance suggests a competitive advantage that Mallinckrodt may continue to leverage. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's approval of Mallinckrodt's SelfJect for Acthar Gel is a significant development, potentially enhancing patient compliance and convenience. The clearance of the INOmax EVOLVE delivery system represents an advancement in the delivery of critical care for neonatal patients, which may improve therapeutic outcomes. The company's investment in marketing for Terlivaz and the focus on hospital adoption are important for the drug's success.Understanding the clinical impact of these products and the company's research and development pipeline is vital for assessing the long-term viability of Mallinckrodt's business strategy. The medical community's reception of these innovations and their real-world efficacy will play a important role in the company's growth trajectory. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM Exceeds High End of Guidance Range on Net Sales and Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal Year Received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval of Supplemental New Drug Application for Acthar® Gel (repository corticotropin injection) Single-Dose Pre-filled SelfJect™ Injector (SelfJect) With Launch Planned for 2024 Accomplished Key Milestones in Specialty Brands in 2023, Including Successful Launch of Terlivaz® (terlipressin) and FDA Clearance of INOmax® EVOLVE™ DS Delivery System With Rollout in 2024 Appointed New Board Members With Expertise in Pharmaceuticals, Healthcare, Finance and Operations Provides 2024 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance of $520 Million to $560 Million DUBLIN, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt plc (""Mallinckrodt"" or the ""Company""), a global specialty pharmaceutical company, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2023.1 ""We are pleased with the meaningful progress we made in 2023 as we exceeded the high end of our annual net sales and Adjusted EBITDA guidance, drove significant growth in Specialty Generics, achieved key milestones in Specialty Brands, and strengthened Mallinckrodt's financial foundation,"" said Siggi Olafsson, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""As we entered 2024, we welcomed four experienced directors to our Board, reflecting our ongoing commitment to building a stronger Mallinckrodt for the benefit of our patients, customers, partners, employees and investors."" Mr. Olafsson continued, ""Ongoing growth in our Specialty Generics segment underscores the reliability and quality of our manufacturing and supply capabilities, the benefits of our vertically integrated manufacturing base and focused execution by our team. We expect strong performance to continue in the new year as we continue to meet market needs with accessible, high-quality medicines. In Specialty Brands, we are well-positioned to continue the momentum we achieved last year with the successful launch of Terlivaz, consistent growth in Therakos® and signs of stabilization in Acthar Gel. With the FDA's clearance of our INOmax EVOLVE delivery system in December, we are pleased that the rollout of this innovative product in hospitals has begun. In addition, we were pleased to receive FDA approval of the Supplemental New Drug Application for SelfJect, which we plan to launch later this year. We are excited for the opportunities ahead as we continue advancing our strategic priorities and delivering for our patients."" 1 As a result of emerging from Chapter 11, the period November 15, 2023 through December 29, 2023 reflects the Successor period, while the period December 31, 2022 through, and including, November 14, 2023 reflects the Predecessor period. The combined periods of December 31, 2022 through November 14, 2023 (Predecessor) and November 15, 2023 through December 29, 2023 (Successor) are referred to herein as ""fiscal 2023"" and the combined periods of January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 (Predecessor) and June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 (Predecessor) are referred to herein as ""fiscal 2022."" Please see ""Predecessor and Successor Periods"" below for further information. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Mallinckrodt's net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $469.3 million, comprising $226.3 million in the Predecessor period and $243.0 million in the Successor period, as compared to $489.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This reflects a decrease of 4.1% on a reported basis and 4.3% on a constant currency basis. The Company's Specialty Brands segment reported net sales of $270.7 million, comprising $130.9 million in the Predecessor period and $139.8 million in the Successor period, as compared to $320.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decreases of 15.6% on a reported basis and 15.8% on a constant currency basis are primarily due to the impact of competition, including the loss of exclusivity for Amitiza® in the U.S., and continued pressure on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending, partially offset by the launch of Terlivaz and return to growth of Therakos. Mallinckrodt's Specialty Generics segment reported net sales of $198.6 million, comprising $95.4 million in the Predecessor period and $103.2 million in the Successor period, as compared to $168.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting an increase of 17.8% on a reported and constant currency basis. This increase was primarily due to growth in finished-dosage products as the broader market experienced ongoing disruptions in product quality and supply. The Company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,052.4 million, comprising net income of $1,090.6 million in the Predecessor period offset by a net loss of $38.2 million in the Successor period, as compared to a net loss of $249.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven primarily by the reorganization impacts of the Chapter 11 and liabilities management processes, certain non-restructuring intangible asset impairments, and the application of fresh start accounting. Mallinckrodt's Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $123.8 million, comprising $55.5 million in the Predecessor period and $68.3 million in the Successor period, as compared to $175.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 29.5%. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of competition, including generic competition in the U.S. Amitiza market, and a shift in the Company's overall product mix as the Specialty Generics segment increased to approximately 42.3% of overall net sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 versus 34.5% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by strength in the Specialty Generics segment, growth in Therakos and the launch of Terlivaz. In addition, the Company continued to invest in the launch of Terlivaz, and included in Adjusted EBITDA are approximately $15 million of non-recurring compensation costs in the fourth quarter of 2023 and approximately $30 million of non-recurring compensation costs year-to-date related to the Company's Chapter 11 process. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of sales was 62.3% for the fourth quarter of 2023, as compared to 65.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022. The decline in gross profit was primarily due to the Company's shift in overall product mix. Mallinckrodt's cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 was $262.7 million. During the fourth quarter, Mallinckrodt repaid the outstanding principal amount of $100.0 million on its up to $200 million revolving accounts receivable financing facility, ending the quarter with approximately $460 million in liquidity including availability under that facility. Total principal debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1,647.8 million, with net debt of $1,385.1 million outstanding. Fiscal Year 2023 Results Mallinckrodt's net sales for fiscal 2023 were $1,865.9 million, comprising $1,622.9 million in the Predecessor period and $243.0 million in the Successor period, as compared to $1,914.3 million for fiscal 2022, comprising $874.6 million for the period January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 and $1,039.7 million for the period June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022. The Company's net loss for fiscal 2023 was $1,669.5 million, comprising $1,631.3 million in the Predecessor period and $38.2 million in the Successor period, as compared to $911.2 million for fiscal 2022, comprising $313.1 million for the period January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 and $598.1 million for the period June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022. Mallinckrodt's Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2023 was $571.9 million, comprising $503.6 million in the Predecessor period and $68.3 million in the Successor period. Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Business Segment Update Specialty Brands Segment Acthar Gel reported net sales of $104.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, comprising $47.4 million in the Predecessor period and $57.0 million in the Successor period. While fiscal 2023 net sales were slightly below guidance, fourth quarter net sales reflected positive momentum and underlying business strength, with improved performance in three out of five therapeutic areas versus the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, the Company remains on track to launch SelfJect in the second half of 2024 following FDA approval. Mallinckrodt expects fiscal 2024 Acthar Gel net revenue to decline in the low single digits, compared with fiscal 2023. This represents significant progress toward net revenue stabilization for the brand. In addition, Mallinckrodt expects Acthar Gel net sales performance to improve over the course of fiscal 2024, as prescribing momentum within the category continues to grow. Terlivaz reported net sales of $5.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, comprising $3.3 million in the Predecessor period and $2.3 million in the Successor period, and $15.6 million in fiscal 2023, comprising $13.3 million in the Predecessor period and $2.3 million in the Successor period, reflecting a strong first full year of product launch as Mallinckrodt exceeded its formulary access targets. The Company received more than 200 formulary approvals during the year, setting a firm foundation for continued momentum as the product moves into its next phase. In fiscal 2024, the Company will continue to invest in marketing for Terlivaz to drive hospital adoption and early patient identification. INOmax (nitric oxide) gas sales grew outside of the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2023, driven largely by volume growth in Japan, while persistent competitive pressures continued to impact U.S. sales. Mallinckrodt received FDA clearance of the INOmax EVOLVE DS Delivery System in the fourth quarter of 2023. The next-generation nitric oxide delivery system combines mini-cylinder technology, automation, integration and interaction into one device, representing an important contribution to serve the needs of NICU patients. The Company is focused on the rollout of this system, which is currently underway in select U.S. hospitals participating in the EVOLVE DS Pilot program, with wider rollout planned later this year. Therakos sales grew year over year for the third consecutive quarter, driven by strong performance in the U.S. and international markets. Therakos growth reflects the continued need for a safe and efficacious immunomodulatory therapy in an evolving market. Total product net sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew 14.8% on a reported basis and 13.5% on a constant currency basis, or $9.2 million, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Mallinckrodt continues to expect the product to grow in the mid-single digits over the next several years. Specialty Generics Segment The Company delivered strong growth in its Specialty Generics segment in fiscal 2023 versus prior years, with year over year net sales growth of 20.5%. Performance was driven by the finished-dosage products business, manufacturing excellence in the Acetaminophen (APAP) business and three successful new product launches, including generic Mydayis® and generic Vyvanse® capsules for ADHD and morphine sulfate tablets. The business also gained regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2023 for a reformulation of the Company's fentanyl patch product, which it reintroduced to the market in multiple strengths in the first quarter of 2024. Mallinckrodt's Specialty Generics business will continue to be differentiated as a reliable, consistent supplier, creating stable pricing dynamics and a competitive advantage with customers amidst ongoing shortages and supply chain constraints. 2024 Financial Guidance For the full-year fiscal 2024, Mallinckrodt expects: 2024 Guidance Total Net Sales $1.800 billion to $1.900 billion Adjusted EBITDA $520 million to $560 million The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP guidance to the comparable GAAP measures as these items are inherently uncertain and difficult to estimate and cannot be predicted without unreasonable effort. Please see the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Guidance"" included in this release for a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for the fourth quarter of 2023 and fiscal 2023. Board Updates On February 2, 2024, Mallinckrodt announced that Paul Bisaro has been reappointed to his previous role as Board Chair and Katina Dorton, Abbas Hussain and Wesley Wheeler have been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, which now comprises seven directors.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release contains financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted R&D expenses, and net sales growth (loss) on a constant-currency basis, which are considered ""non-GAAP"" financial measures under applicable SEC rules and regulations. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income or loss prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (""GAAP"") and adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of the operational performance of the business. Adjustments to GAAP amounts include, as applicable to each measure, interest expense, net; income taxes; depreciation; amortization; restructuring charges, net; non-restructuring impairment charges; inventory step-up expense; discontinued operations; changes in fair value of contingent consideration obligations; significant legal and environmental charges; divestitures; liabilities management and separation costs; changes in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities; gains on debt extinguishment, net; unrealized gain or loss on equity investment; reorganization items, net; share-based compensation; fresh-start inventory related expenses; and other items identified by the Company. Adjusted gross profit, adjusted SG&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses represent amounts prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of the operational performance of the business. Adjustments to GAAP amounts include, as applicable to each measure, the aforementioned items in the Adjusted EBITDA paragraph. The adjustments for these items are on a pre-tax basis for adjusted gross profit and adjusted SG&A expenses. Segment net sales growth (loss) on a constant-currency basis measures the change in segment net sales between current- and prior-year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior-year period. The Company has provided these adjusted financial measures because they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the Company's operating performance. In addition, the Company believes that they will be used by investors to measure Mallinckrodt's operating results. Management believes that presenting these adjusted measures provides useful information about the Company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. These adjusted measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these adjusted measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Because adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of certain of these historical adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release. Further information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website. Predecessor and Successor Periods Mallinckrodt's financial results presented in this press release include Successor and Predecessor periods. The Company reports its results based on a ""52-53 week"" year ending on the last Friday of December. The period November 15, 2023 through December 29, 2023 reflects the Successor period, while the period December 31, 2022 through, and including, November 14, 2023 reflects the Predecessor period. The combined periods of December 31, 2022 through November 14, 2023 (Predecessor) and November 15, 2023 through December 29, 2023 (Successor) (""fiscal 2023"") and the combined periods of January 1, 2022 through June 16, 2022 (Predecessor) and June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022 (Predecessor) (""fiscal 2022"") consisted of 52 weeks, while the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (Predecessor) (""fiscal 2021"") consisted of 53 weeks. Upon emergence from Chapter 11 on each of November 14, 2023 (the ""2023 Chapter 11 Cases"") and June 16, 2022 (the ""2020 Chapter 11 Cases""), we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 852 - Reorganizations (""ASC 852""), and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of the effective dates of the 2023 and 2020 Chapter 11 Cases. References to ""Successor"" relate to the financial position as of December 29, 2023 and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to November 14, 2023, while references to ""Predecessor"" relate to the financial position as of December 30, 2022 and results of operations of the Company for the period from December 31, 2022 through November 14, 2023, the period from June 17, 2022 through December 30, 2022, and for the periods prior to, and including June 16, 2022. All emergence-related transactions related to the effective dates of the 2023 and 2020 Chapter 11 Cases were recorded as of November 14, 2023 and June 16, 2022, respectively. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for the Successor are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor periods and the consolidated financial statements for the combined predecessor period from June 17, 2022 through November 14, 2023 are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements for the predecessor period prior to, and including June 16, 2022. Mallinckrodt's results of operations as reported in its consolidated financial statements for the Successor and Predecessor periods are in accordance with GAAP. The comparison of the Predecessor and Successor periods for the periods presented herein is not in accordance with GAAP.

(ANNX) announces pivotal Phase 3 data for ANX005 in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) expected in Q2 2024, initiation of Phase 3 ANX007 ARCHER II trial in Geographic Atrophy (GA) in mid-2024, and clinical proof-of-concept data with ANX1502 oral inhibitor of the Classical Pathway in the second half of 2024. The company reported a robust balance sheet with approximately $260 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, ensuring runway into mid-2026. Positive Positive aspects include successful achievement of key clinical and regulatory milestones in 2023, strong execution across priority programs, and upcoming catalysts in 2024. ANX005's potential as the first targeted treatment for GBS, ANX007's unique mechanism of action in GA, and ANX1502's clinical proof-of-concept data are key highlights. The company secured $125 million financing in December 2023, extending the operating runway into mid-2026, and reported significant progress in flagship and next-wave programs. Granting of Fast Track, orphan drug designations, and alignment with regulatory agencies for pivotal trials demonstrate the company's strategic advancements. Financially, Annexon reported a healthy balance sheet with cash reserves to fund operations into mid-2026, reflecting prudent financial management. Anticipated milestones in 2024 include topline data from pivotal trials, initiation of global pivotal trials, and proof-of-concept trial data, showcasing a busy and promising year ahead for Annexon. Negative None. Biopharmaceutical Financial Analyst The financial results and anticipated milestones from Annexon, Inc. are significant for investors, as they provide insights into the company's current cash position and expected cash runway, which is projected to extend into mid-2026. This is a key indicator of the company's financial health and its ability to sustain operations without the immediate need for additional capital. The reported cash and cash equivalents, along with short-term investments, indicate a robust balance sheet that can support the company's clinical trials and R&D activities.Furthermore, the reduction in both R&D and G&A expenses compared to the previous year suggests improved operational efficiency. However, the net loss has increased year-over-year, which is not uncommon in the biopharmaceutical industry, where significant upfront investments are often required before a product can be commercialized. Investors should consider the potential of the company's pipeline products to offset these losses in the future, particularly if the upcoming clinical trials prove successful and lead to FDA approvals. Clinical Research Analyst The upcoming clinical milestones for Annexon's flagship programs, particularly the pivotal Phase 3 data for ANX005 in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), are a focal point for both the medical community and investors. The potential for ANX005 to become the first targeted treatment for GBS represents a significant advancement in the field. The initiation of the pivotal Phase 3 ANX007 ARCHER II Trial in Geographic Atrophy (GA) and the clinical proof-of-concept data for ANX1502 also highlight the company's commitment to addressing unmet medical needs in neuroinflammatory diseases.Given the orphan drug designations and Fast Track status granted by regulatory agencies, these programs could benefit from expedited review processes, enhancing their commercial potential. The alignment with the FDA on primary outcome measures for ANX007 in GA is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a clear regulatory pathway forward. The focus on vision preservation as a primary outcome measure, rather than lesion growth, could set a new precedent for future trials in the field. Market Research Analyst The strategic planning and execution by Annexon are evident in their alignment with the FDA on trial endpoints and the successful financing round, which should reassure investors of the company's potential for long-term growth. The market opportunity for treatments in GBS and GA is substantial, given the lack of targeted therapies currently available. The company's focus on a precision medicine approach, as indicated by the exploratory analyses of ANX005 in ALS, suggests a tailored strategy that may enhance the drug's efficacy and marketability.It is important to note that while the clinical data and regulatory designations are promising, the actual market impact will depend on the outcomes of the upcoming trials and the subsequent commercialization efforts. The competitive differentiation of ANX007 and the novel oral inhibitor ANX1502 could position Annexon favorably in the market, provided the clinical results are positive and the treatments receive regulatory approval. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM Pivotal Phase 3 Data for ANX005 in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) Expected in Second Quarter 2024 Initiation of Pivotal Phase 3 ANX007 ARCHER II Trial in Geographic Atrophy (GA) Expected in mid-2024, a Global Sham-Controlled Trial Using Vision Preservation as Primary Outcome Measure Clinical Proof-of-Concept Data with ANX1502 Oral Inhibitor of the Classical Pathway Expected in Second Half of 2024 Robust Balance Sheet with Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments of Approximately $260 Million as of December 31, 2023, and Anticipated Runway into mid-2026 BRISBANE, Calif., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Annexon, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANNX), a biopharmaceutical company advancing a late-stage clinical platform of novel therapies for people living with devastating classical complement-mediated neuroinflammatory diseases of the body, brain, and eye, today highlighted portfolio progress and reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. “Our strong execution in 2023 across our three priority programs successfully achieved key clinical and regulatory milestones and created a solid foundation from which to reach several important upcoming catalysts in 2024,” said Douglas Love, president and chief executive officer of Annexon. “Importantly, our approach in blocking C1q to stop classical complement-driven neuroinflammation in diseases of the body, brain and eye continues to show unique and consistent functional outcomes across our pipeline programs.” Mr. Love continued, “In the year ahead, we are excited by ANX005’s near-term potential to be the first targeted treatment for GBS, and we are on track to report topline data from our pivotal, placebo-controlled trial in the second quarter. For our global registrational program in GA, we plan to initiate two pivotal trials in 2024 to underscore the unique mechanism of action of ANX007 and its competitive differentiation in visual function. Finally, we anticipate clinical proof-of-concept data from our novel oral inhibitor ANX1502 later in the year. With our balance sheet strengthened and anticipated runway into mid-2026, we are poised to generate significant near- to mid-term value for patients and our shareholders.” Recent Corporate and Clinical Program Updates Successful $125 Million Financing: In December 2023, Annexon announced a $125 million financing and extension of operating runway into mid-2026. Flagship Programs ANX005 in GBS: First-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to block C1q and the entire classical complement pathway in both the body and the brain. Completed enrollment of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial (N=241) designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ANX005 in patients with GBS.Initiated a real-world evidence (RWE) comparability protocol with International Guillain-Barré Syndrome Outcomes Study (IGOS), with initial RWE data expected in the first half of 2025 to support a planned Biologics License Application (BLA) submission. IGOS is a global, prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study that has enrolled ~2000 patients who were followed for one to three years.Granted Fast Track and orphan drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Granted orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) based on a meta-analysis of past studies with ANX005 and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) demonstrating notable, early improvement in muscle strength with ANX005 that translated into observable gains in health status, including a reduction in the need of mechanical ventilation.Hosted an R&D Day on the burden of disease, current treatment paradigm and market opportunity for GBS in March 2024. ANX007 in GA: First-in-class, non-pegylated antigen-binding fragment (Fab) designed to block C1q and activation of the classical complement cascade locally in the eye with an intravitreal formulation. Gained alignment with FDA on persistent best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ≥ 15-letter loss as primary outcome measure and trial with comparison to an injection agent; no requirement to evaluate lesion growth, a surrogate anatomical endpoint for vision used previously for the approval of other GA programs. Pivotal primary endpoint alignment is based on the randomized, sham-controlled Phase 2 ARCHER trial demonstrating ANX007 is the first and only program reported to show statistically significant and consistent protection against vision loss in a broad population of patients with GA. Granted Fast Track designation from the FDA.Granted Priority Medicine (PRIME) designation by the EMA, the first and only therapeutic candidate for the treatment of GA to receive such a designation. ANX1502 in Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD): First-in-class oral small molecule inhibitor of the classical complement pathway designed to target chronic autoimmune diseases. Announced Phase 1 single-ascending dose (SAD), and multiple-ascending dose (MAD) data from a clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics. Key findings include: ANX1502 was generally well tolerated across cohorts with no serious adverse events.Target levels of active drug achieved in healthy volunteers with oral twice daily dosing.Supportive impact on pharmacodynamic biomarker of complement activity that supports clinical advancement. Next Wave Programs ANX005 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): First-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to block C1q and the entire classical complement pathway. Completed a signal-finding open-label Phase 2a study evaluating the safety and tolerability of chronic dosing of ANX005 in patients with ALS. Key topline findings include: Study met all primary objectives, demonstrating ANX005 was generally well-tolerated, displayed rapid and sustained full C1q inhibition, and reduced downstream pharmacodynamic complement markers.Consistent with what has been shown in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington’s disease, exploratory analyses indicated that patients with higher baseline classical complement activation who enrolled within 12 months of diagnosis achieved better outcomes, including less functional decline on the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and stabilization of neurofilament light chain (NfL).These analyses support a precision medicine approach to identify patients most likely to respond to anti-C1q therapy in clinical trials with recently diagnosed patients with ALS who have elevated baseline levels of classical complement activity.Annexon plans to submit the Phase 2a data for presentation at an upcoming medical conference later this year. Key 2024 Anticipated Milestones for Flagship Programs ANX005 in GBS: Topline data from pivotal, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial expected in the second quarter of 2024. Initial data from RWE comparability protocol with IGOS expected in first half 2025 to support a planned BLA submission.ANX007 in GA: Global pivotal Phase 3 ARCHER II trial vs. sham control expected to initiate in mid-2024. Pivotal Phase 3 head-to-head ARROW trial vs. SYFOVRE® (pegcetacoplan injection) planned to initiate in the second half of 2024. ANX1502 in CAD: Proof-of-concept (POC) trial evaluating the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of an oral tablet formulation in CAD anticipated to provide initial data in the second half of 2024, with plans for program expansion in autoimmune indications upon completion of clinical POC. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash and operating runway: Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were $259.7 million as of December 31, 2023. Annexon continues to expect its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, to be sufficient to fund the company’s planned operating expenses into mid-2026.Research and development (R&D) expenses: R&D expenses were $23.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting the advancement of the Company’s priority programs, including GBS, GA and ANX1502, compared to $28.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and $112.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.General and administrative (G&A) expenses: G&A expenses were $6.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $8.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.Net loss: Net loss was $27.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $34.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, and $141.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Financial Analyst The recent financial results of Marpai, Inc. reflect a notable year-over-year improvement in both quarterly and annual figures. From a financial analysis perspective, the 14% increase in net revenues and the 6.5% increase in gross profit for Q4 2023 indicate a positive trajectory in the company's earnings capability. However, the company still reports an operating loss, which, despite a 42.3% improvement, suggests ongoing challenges in achieving profitability.Investors may find the 52.6% increase in annual net revenues and 79.2% increase in annual gross profit compelling, as these metrics often serve as indicators of a company's growth and efficiency in generating income relative to costs. The reported increase in operating expenses by 19.7% year over year could raise concerns about the company's cost management strategies. However, the reclassification of goodwill impairment and gain on sale of a non-core business as contributing factors offers context to these figures.The improvement in basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) suggests a reduced loss per share, which may be viewed favorably by shareholders. However, the overall net loss increase of 8.6% year over year warrants scrutiny. While the EPS improvement is a positive signal, the absolute figures indicate that the company is still in a loss-making position. Healthcare Industry Analyst The Third-Party Administration (TPA) sector is a competitive space within the healthcare industry and Marpai's focus on affordable, intelligent healthcare for self-funded employer health plans is a strategic move to capture market share in the $22 billion TPA market. The acquisition of Maestro Health is a strategic initiative that appears to be driving financial improvement, as highlighted by the CEO.From an industry standpoint, the ability to reduce costs for clients and improve the quality of care is a strong value proposition in the TPA market. Marpai's emphasis on operational and financial improvements could resonate well with potential clients looking for cost-effective healthcare solutions. The company's performance should be continuously monitored to assess whether these improvements translate into sustained profitability and market expansion.Long-term, the integration of the Maestro Health acquisition and the effectiveness of corrective actions taken in Q4 will be important to Marpai's ability to compete effectively. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to changes in policy, which could impact Marpai's operations and financial performance. Investors should consider these factors when evaluating the company's future prospects. Market Research Analyst While Marpai's financial results show promise in revenue growth, the market will likely focus on the company's ability to turn around its net loss situation. The operational efficiencies and strategic acquisitions are positive steps, but the market will look for evidence of sustainable profitability. The goodwill impairment reclassification indicates a non-cash accounting adjustment, which, while significant for financial reporting, may not directly affect the company's cash flow position.The TPA market's demand is influenced by trends in employer-funded healthcare plans, which are subject to economic cycles and policy changes. Marpai's performance in the upcoming quarters will be critical in assessing whether the company can leverage its technology and service offerings to gain a competitive edge and achieve a positive net income.Overall, the company's stock performance will likely be influenced by its ability to demonstrate continued revenue growth coupled with cost containment. The investor community will be keen to analyze the upcoming webcast for insights into management's strategy for the next fiscal year and beyond. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM Full Year Benefit of Maestro Acquisition and Q4 Corrective Actions Driving Financial Improvement TAMPA, Fla., March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Marpai, Inc.

The company's adjusted EBITDA for FY 2023 improved significantly compared to the previous year. Non-GAAP measures are used to provide additional insights into the company's performance. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from GameStop Corp. reflect a mixed performance, with a decline in net sales year-over-year but a reduction in Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of net sales and a shift from a net loss to net income for the fiscal year. The reduction in SG&A expenses, from 28.4% to 25.1% of net sales, suggests that the company has improved its operational efficiency, which is a positive indicator for investors. However, the drop in net sales from $5.927 billion to $5.273 billion raises concerns about the company's top-line growth and competitive position in the market. The increase in net income and adjusted EBITDA is encouraging, but the sustainability of these improvements needs to be evaluated in the context of the overall sales decline.From a financial health perspective, GameStop's strong cash position, with $1.199 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, provides the company with liquidity to navigate the current retail environment. The limited long-term debt, associated with a government response loan, indicates a manageable debt level. However, investors should be cautious about the company's future growth prospects and the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives, given the reduction in year-over-year sales. Market Research Analyst GameStop's performance must be contextualized within the broader retail and gaming industry trends. The decline in net sales could be attributed to several factors, including shifts in consumer behavior, the increasing prevalence of digital game downloads and competition from other retail channels. The gaming industry is highly dynamic, with new platforms and distribution methods continuously emerging. GameStop's ability to adapt to these trends and to innovate in terms of customer experience and product offerings will be critical for its future success.Moreover, the company's decision not to hold a conference call may signal a strategic choice to communicate primarily through written reports and filings. This could impact investor relations by reducing opportunities for direct engagement and clarification of company strategies and performance. Investors may seek additional transparency and engagement from the company to build confidence in its long-term vision and execution. Legal Expert GameStop's use of non-GAAP financial measures is a common practice among companies seeking to provide a different perspective on performance. These measures are intended to isolate the core operating results and exclude certain items that can obscure the underlying business trends. However, it is important for investors to understand that non-GAAP measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation. They should be viewed in conjunction with GAAP results to get a complete picture of the company's financial performance.Investors should also be aware of the regulatory environment surrounding the use of non-GAAP measures. The SEC has provided guidelines to ensure that these measures are not misleading and are presented with equal or greater prominence than GAAP measures. GameStop's disclosure that non-GAAP measures should be viewed as supplementing GAAP results aligns with these guidelines, but investors should still exercise due diligence in evaluating these measures. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM GRAPEVINE, Texas, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (“GameStop” or the “Company”) today released financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. The Company’s consolidated financial statements, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, are below. The Company’s Form 10-K and supplemental information can be found at https://investor.gamestop.com. FOURTH QUARTER OVERVIEW Net sales were $1.794 billion for the fourth quarter, compared to $2.226 billion in the prior year's fourth quarter.Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $359.2 million, or 20.0% of net sales, for the fourth quarter, compared to $453.4 million, or 20.4% of net sales, in the prior year's fourth quarter.Net income was $63.1 million for the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $48.2 million for the prior year’s fourth quarter.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.199 billion at the close of the quarter.Long-term debt remains limited to a low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government's response to COVID-19. FULL YEAR OVERVIEW Net sales were $5.273 billion for fiscal year 2023, compared to $5.927 billion for fiscal year 2022.SG&A expenses were $1.324 billion, or 25.1% of net sales, for fiscal year 2023, compared to $1.681 billion, or 28.4% of net sales, for fiscal year 2022.Net income was $6.7 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to a net loss of $313.1 million for fiscal year 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of $64.7 million for fiscal year 2023, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($192.7) million for fiscal year 2022. The Company will not be holding a conference call today. Additional information can be found in the Company’s Form 10-K. NON-GAAP MEASURES AND OTHER METRICS As a supplement to the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), GameStop may use certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the Company’s core operating performance. Adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA exclude the effect of items such as certain transformation costs, asset impairments, severance, as well as divestiture costs. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures otherwise included in net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities. The Company’s definition and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company’s actual and future financial condition and performance.

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use by investors in evaluating the Company’s financial performance. 14 Weeks EndedFebruary 3, 2024 13 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 2023 53 Weeks EndedFebruary 3, 2024 52 Weeks EndedJanuary 28, 2023Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities$(11.0) $338.2 $(203.7) $108.2 Capital expenditures (7.7) (11.6) (34.9) (55.9)Free cash flow$(18.7) $326.6 $(238.6) $52.3 Non-GAAP Measures and Other Metrics Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share are supplemental financial measures of the Company’s performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, plus net interest income, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, transformation costs, business divestitures, fixed asset impairments, severance and certain other non-cash charges. Net income (loss) is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Furthermore, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Some of these limitations include: certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure;adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs;although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; andour computations of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We compensate for the limitations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measure, understanding the differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decision-making process. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted earnings (loss) per share may be defined and determined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.

Rent the Runway Announces 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split,2024-03-26T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Rent the Runway, Inc. announced a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock to increase the per share market price and comply with Nasdaq listing requirements. The split is effective April 2, 2024, with trading under the symbol 'RENT' starting on April 3, 2024.","Rent the Runway Announces 1-for-20 Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Rent the Runway, Inc. announced a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock to increase the per share market price and comply with Nasdaq listing requirements. The split is effective April 2, 2024, with trading under the symbol 'RENT' starting on April 3, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Rent the Runway's 1-for-20 reverse stock split is a strategic move aimed at addressing compliance issues with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. This tactic is often employed by companies facing delisting threats due to their stock trading below the required threshold. The immediate effect is an artificial inflation of the stock price, which could potentially make the stock more attractive to institutional investors who may be barred from investing in stocks below certain price levels.However, it's important to note that reverse splits do not change the company's underlying fundamentals. Investors should be aware that while the market price per share will increase, the overall market capitalization remains unchanged. This move does not directly impact the company's financial health or operational performance, but it can have psychological effects on the perception of the stock. Historically, reverse stock splits have had mixed outcomes, with some companies successfully regaining compliance while others continue to struggle. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Rent the Runway's reverse stock split reflects a broader industry trend where companies seek to maintain their listing status and improve marketability. The adjustment of equity awards and warrants is a standard procedure to preserve the value for existing stakeholders. While this does not provide new value, it maintains the proportional ownership, which is important for investor confidence.For potential investors, the reverse split might signal a red flag, indicating that the company has been underperforming in terms of stock price. It's essential to evaluate the company's operational performance and growth prospects in conjunction with this financial maneuver. Investors should also consider the liquidity post-split, as the reduced number of shares could lead to lower trading volumes, potentially increasing volatility. Securities Lawyer The reverse stock split is a legal mechanism that requires careful compliance with both corporate governance and securities regulations. Rent the Runway's adherence to the process, including shareholder approval and the role of Equiniti as the exchange and transfer agent, underscores the procedural rigor involved. For shareholders, the conversion of fractional shares into a cash payment is a routine way to handle the impossibility of issuing partial shares. This process must be conducted with transparency and fairness, as stipulated by securities law, to ensure equitable treatment of all shareholders.From a legal standpoint, the reverse stock split does not alter shareholders' legal rights, but it is a significant corporate event that requires precise execution. Shareholders should pay close attention to the information provided by the company and their respective banks or brokers to understand the implications for their holdings and any tax consequences that may arise from receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares. 03/26/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rent the Runway, Inc. (“Rent the Runway” or the “RTR”) (NASDAQ: RENT) today announced that it will proceed with a 1-for-20 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”) of its outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (collectively, the “Common Stock”) following approval by its Board of Directors. This ratio is within the ratio range approved by stockholders at a special meeting of RTR shareholders held on March 21, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split is expected to become effective at 5 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 2, 2024. RTR expects the Company’s Class A Common Stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on April 3, 2024 under the symbol “RENT” with the new CUSIP number 76010Y 202. The primary goal of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the per share market price of the Common Stock to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. When the Reverse Stock Split is effective, every 20 shares of Rent the Runway Common Stock issued and outstanding will be combined automatically into 1 share of Common Stock. The Reverse Stock Split will apply equally to all outstanding shares of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, and each stockholder will hold the same percentage of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately following the Reverse Stock Split, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Holders of Common Stock will receive a cash payment (without interest) in lieu of any fractional shares. Additionally, all equity awards and warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be proportionately adjusted. Equiniti Trust Company, LLC (“Equiniti”), formerly American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, is acting as the exchange agent and transfer agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. The Company does not have any outstanding certificated shares. Stockholders owning shares through a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split and will receive payment for any fractional shares in accordance with their respective bank’s, broker’s, or nominee’s particular processes.

The company's subsidiary, SurancePlus, issued the first Tokenized Reinsurance Securities under a publicly-traded company's sponsorship. The establishment of a new Web3-focused division, SurancePlus Inc., without incurring debt or shareholder dilution, showcases prudent financial management. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The introduction of Tokenized Reinsurance Securities by Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited marks a noteworthy development in the reinsurance industry. This innovation could potentially offer increased liquidity and accessibility to reinsurance investments, which traditionally have been the domain of specialized investors due to their complexity and high entry barriers. The company's ability to launch this product without incurring debt or diluting shareholder value speaks to a strong balance sheet and fiscal prudence, which are attractive qualities to investors. However, it is essential to monitor how the market receives these securities and the regulatory landscape, as tokenization is a relatively new and evolving area. Blockchain Technology Expert Transitioning into Web3 with a focus on tokenizing real-world assets is a strategic move that aligns with current technological trends. Tokenization can streamline processes, enhance transparency and improve the traceability of transactions. The establishment of a Web3-focused division indicates that Oxbridge is positioning itself at the forefront of innovation within its sector. However, it's important to assess the technical robustness and cybersecurity measures of such platforms, as they will be critical in ensuring investor confidence in the integrity and security of these new financial instruments. Market Research Analyst The reinsurance market has been facing a period of transformation, with technology playing an increasingly central role. Oxbridge's move into tokenized securities could potentially tap into new investor demographics seeking alternative assets. The long-term impact on the company's market share and revenue streams could be substantial if they successfully capitalize on the first-mover advantage. Still, it's important to consider the competitive response and the potential for market saturation with similar offerings in the future. Understanding the adoption curve and market demand for tokenized reinsurance securities will be key to evaluating the strategic success of Oxbridge's new venture. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oxbridge Re Holdings Limited (NASDAQ: OXBR), (the “Company”), which together with its subsidiaries is engaged in the business of tokenized Real-World Assets (“RWAs”), initially in the form of tokenized reinsurance securities, and reinsurance business solutions to property and casualty today, reported its results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023. ""We are delighted by our operational performance this year, highlighted by significant milestones achieved. Notably, our subsidiary, SurancePlus, has issued what we believe to be the inaugural Tokenized Reinsurance Securities under the sponsorship of a publicly-traded company. Additionally, the establishment of our new Web3-focused division, SurancePlus Inc., marks a significant accomplishment. This wholly-owned subsidiary was formed without incurring any debt or dilution to our existing shareholders, demonstrating prudent financial management. We are particularly enthusiastic about the prospects of our venture into RWA tokenization and the direction it sets for our company. The establishment of SurancePlus Inc. underscores our commitment to capitalizing on the burgeoning opportunities in the Web3 space. Through strategic initiatives undertaken this year, we are positioning ourselves for substantial growth within our SurancePlus subsidiary as a premier RWA Web3-focused entity. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jay Madhu, remarked, 'Further reinforcing our strategic vision, Blackrock has announced its intention to tokenize $10 trillion of its assets. Concurrently, we witness the steady adoption of blockchain technology across traditional financial institutions and asset classes, including fiat currencies, equities, government bonds, and real estate. As pioneers in the RWA market, we are energized by the transformative potential of our repositioning and the expansion into new business lines, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Moreover, we are pleased to report that investors in our 2023 issued Delta CatRe tokens are poised to realize returns exceeding 45%, surpassing our initial expectations of 42%. This achievement is particularly noteworthy, given the challenges posed by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in 2023. In conclusion, we remain steadfast in our commitment to driving innovation and delivering value to our stakeholders, and we look forward to continued success in the evolving landscape of reinsurance and Web3 technologies."" Financial Performance Net premiums earned for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $523,000 compared to $nil in the same prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, net premiums earned increased to $1,255,000 from $995,000 in the prior year. The increases are due to the higher rates on reinsurance contracts in force during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, when compared with the prior periods. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company generated net loss of $2.67 million or ($0.46) per basic and diluted loss per share compared net income of $678,000 or $0.12 per basic and diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred a net loss of $9.9 million or ($1.69) per basic and diluted loss per share compared to net loss of $1.8 million or ($0.31) per basic and diluted earnings per share in the prior year. The decrease observed in the financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, can be attributed mainly to fluctuations in the fair market value of the Company's equity investment in Jet.AI. Additionally, there were slight increases in general expenses incurred during the launch of SurancePlus throughout the year ended December 31, 2023, in comparison to the previous year. Total expenses, including losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses, were $536,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, when compared with $363,000 for the same period in 2022. The increase was due to the recognition of previously deferred offering costs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total expenses was $2.3 million, compared with prior period total expenses of $2.6 million. The decrease in 2023 was due to both an increase general and administration expenses being more than offset by the decrease in loss and loss adjustment expenses in 2023, when compared with losses of $1,073 thousand in fiscal 2022 as a result of Hurricane Ian. At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 million compared to $3.9 million at December 31, 2022. Financial Ratios Loss Ratio. The loss ratio, which measures underwriting profitability, is the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net premiums earned. The loss ratio decreased to 0% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 107.8% in the prior year due to the limit losses suffered on two of our reinsurance contracts as a result of Hurricane Ian, in the previous year. Acquisition Cost Ratio. The acquisition cost ratio, which measures operational efficiency, compares policy acquisition costs with net premiums earned, increased marginally to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 11.1% in the prior year. Expense Ratio. The expense ratio, which measures operating performance, compares policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses with net premiums earned. The expense ratio increased to 185.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, from 153.1% for the prior year due to higher general and administrative expenses in 2023 primarily from the recognition of previously deferred expenses associated with the Company’s Form S-3 registration as well as the successful launch of SurancePlus Inc. private placement offering. Combined ratio. The combined ratio, which is used to measure underwriting performance, is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. The combined ratio decreased to 185.2% for the year ended December 31, 2023, from 260.9% for the prior year. The decrease is due to the decrease in loss ratio during the year ending December 31, 2023, as a result of no underwriting losses suffered in 2023, when compared with underwriting losses suffered in 2022 as a result of Hurricane Ian.

(NASDAQ: DRS) unveils a cutting-edge combat computing product, fully compliant with U.S. Army standards, aimed at enhancing Army network modernization. The new CMFF system offers advanced capabilities for mission command, maneuver, and fires, providing improved situational awareness and networking on the battlefield. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The announcement by Leonardo DRS, Inc. about its new combat computing product aligns with the broader defense industry's trend towards modular open systems architecture (MOSA). The compliance with the U.S. Army's C4ISR/Electronic Warfare Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS) indicates a strategic move to meet military requirements for interoperability and future-proofing technology.From a business perspective, this development is significant as it demonstrates Leonardo DRS's commitment to the U.S. Army's modernization efforts, which could lead to enhanced market positioning and potential contract advantages. The emphasis on MOSA platforms like the CMFF system aligns with the Department of Defense's push for cost-effective and rapidly upgradable systems, which can reduce long-term expenses and accelerate the integration of new technologies.Investors should note the potential for increased revenue streams from such advanced systems, especially given the company's established track record in tactical computing. However, the defense industry is subject to rigorous testing and certification processes, which could impact the speed of adoption and delivery of the new systems. Military Technology Expert The integration of assured positioning navigation and timing (APNT), mission command applications and multi-band software defined radios into a single platform is a technological leap. This move towards a unified platform reflects a strategic shift in military operations where situational awareness and networked communications are paramount.For the U.S. Army, the adoption of such technology could lead to enhanced operational capabilities, especially in multi-domain operations. The ability to continuously field future technology capabilities without vendor lock or proprietary IP constraints is a significant advantage, as it allows for more agile responses to evolving threats and technological advancements.Understanding the technical aspects, such as 3U-VPX capability cards, is important for stakeholders. These are a form of rugged electronic module standards for computing systems, which are designed to withstand harsh military environments. Their plug-and-play nature enhances the system's flexibility and upgradability, which is a strong selling point for the technology. Investment Analyst Leonardo DRS's involvement in the Modular Open Systems Approach and its role as a principal member of the SOSA consortium may provide it with a competitive edge in securing future contracts. As defense budgets are scrutinized, the U.S. military's emphasis on cost-saving and upgradeable systems could lead to a favorable market for companies like Leonardo DRS that are investing in aligned technologies.While the immediate financial impact of this announcement may not be substantial, the long-term implications for Leonardo DRS's revenue and market share could be positive. The company's investment in next-generation C5 technologies and AI processing solutions positions it well for future Department of Defense requirements. However, investors should consider the cyclical nature of defense spending and the possibility of shifts in government priorities, which could affect the demand for such technologies. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM Demonstrates the company’s focus on developing and fielding cutting-edge open systems architecture convergence platform for mounted platforms in support of U.S Army network modernization ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Leonardo DRS, Inc.

The company's adjusted EBITDA increased by 11% to $11.3 million. Full-year 2024 revenue guidance stands at $170 million – $190 million. Despite a slightly weaker fourth quarter performance due to industry trends, the company aims to capitalize on the successes of 2023 and expand further in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 76% year-over-year revenue growth for Direct Digital Holdings is indicative of a strong performance in the digital advertising sector. This growth trajectory, particularly being the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, suggests that the company has effectively capitalized on the expanding digital ad market. The transition towards a cookie-less advertising environment is a strategic move, considering the industry's shift due to privacy concerns and changing regulations.However, the full-year net income of $2.0 million, when juxtaposed with the substantial revenue figure, raises questions about the company's cost management and profit margins. Investors may want to scrutinize the operational expenses and the scalability of the business model. The guidance for 2024, projecting revenues between $170 million and $190 million, reflects optimism but also introduces a range that may be indicative of uncertainty in market conditions or the company's growth initiatives. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the adjusted EBITDA increase of 11% is a modest gain, especially when compared to the revenue surge. This could imply that the company is investing heavily in growth, which is not immediately yielding proportional profitability. Investors should consider the implications of this strategy on long-term financial health. While the top-line growth is impressive, the bottom line and cash flow generation will ultimately determine the company's ability to sustain investments and finance further expansion.The mention of proactive measures in response to changing macro industry trends suggests that management is attempting to mitigate risks, which is reassuring. However, the specifics of these measures and their potential impact on future earnings are not clear, which could be a point of concern for stakeholders looking for stability and predictability in their investments. Advertising Technology Expert The substantial increase in average monthly impressions and bid requests processed through the company's sell-side advertising segment is a testament to the scalability of Direct Digital Holdings' technology infrastructure. The growth in sell-side revenue per advertiser is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the company is not only increasing volume but also enhancing the value of its ad inventory.The shift towards a cookie-less future is an industry-wide challenge and the company's proactive approach could provide it with a competitive advantage if executed effectively. However, the actual performance of these strategies in a post-cookie landscape remains to be seen. The success of such initiatives will be critical for maintaining the growth momentum and for the company's positioning in a privacy-first advertising ecosystem. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM Company's Full-Year 2023 Revenue Up 76% Year-Over-Year to $157.1 Million, the Eighth Consecutive Quarter of Double-Digit Growth Full-Year 2023 Net Income of $2.0 million; Adjusted EBITDA(1) Up 11% Year-Over-Year to $11.3 Million Company Issues Full-Year 2024 Revenue Guidance of $170 Million – $190 Million HOUSTON, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Direct Digital Holdings, Inc.

Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 increased sequentially from operating expenses for the third quarter of 2023 of $7.3 million reflecting an increase of $2.0 million, or 28%.Net loss was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to net income of $1.4 million in the same period of 2022, driven by lower operating income described above.Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $3.1 million in the same period of 2022.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Highlights: Revenue in fiscal year 2023 was $157.1 million, an increase of $67.8 million, or 76% over $89.4 million in fiscal year 2022.Sell-side advertising segment revenue grew to $122.4 million and contributed $62.4 million of the increase, or 104% growth, over $60.0 million of sell-side revenue in fiscal year 2022.Buy-side advertising segment revenue grew to $34.7 million and contributed $5.3 million of the increase, or 18% growth, over $29.3 million of buy-side revenue in fiscal year 2022.Operating expenses were $30.9 million in 2023, an increase of $9.5 million, or 45%, over $21.3 million in 2022.Consolidated operating income in fiscal year 2023 was $6.6 million compared to consolidated operating income of $8.0 million in fiscal year 2022.Net income for fiscal year 2023 was $2.0 million, compared to net income of $4.2 million in fiscal year 2022.Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $11.3 million in fiscal year 2023, compared to $10.2 million in fiscal year 2022, an increase of 11% year-over-year.

The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss). In addition to operating income and net income, we use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operational efficiency. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons: Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision for income taxes, and certain unusual, one-time or non-recurring items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; andAdjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.Our use of this non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP.

The offering is subject to market conditions. Proceeds will be used for corporate purposes, acquisitions, and debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Bowman Consulting Group's announcement of a public offering up to $50 million, including a $45 million sale by the company and $5 million by key executives, is a strategic move that could indicate several underlying objectives. Firstly, the capital raise through common stock issuance can be interpreted as a step towards bolstering the company's balance sheet, providing flexibility for organic expansion and potential acquisitions. It's notable that the company is considering using the proceeds for the repayment of borrowings under its revolving credit facility, which could improve debt ratios and reduce interest expenses.However, the fact that executive members are selling a portion of their shares could be viewed with caution by investors, as it might suggest a realignment of personal financial interests, although this is not uncommon in public offerings. The market's reception of this news will be contingent on investor confidence in Bowman's growth strategy and current market conditions. The 30-day option for underwriters to purchase additional shares provides a buffer to ensure the offering's success but also introduces potential dilution for existing shareholders. Market Research Analyst The involvement of established financial institutions like BofA Securities and Baird as joint lead book-running managers, with Roth Capital Partners also acting as a joint book-running manager, lends credibility to the offering and could enhance investor confidence. These institutions' roles in managing the book indicate robust interest and a potentially wide distribution network for the offering.It's also important to consider the impact of this offering on Bowman's stock price. Market dynamics such as investor sentiment, the performance of the engineering and infrastructure sector and overall economic conditions will play significant roles in the offering's success. Investors will be keen to analyze the preliminary prospectus supplement, which will provide critical financial data and detailed use of proceeds, to assess the potential return on investment and the risks involved. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the offering's success hinges on compliance with SEC regulations. The effectiveness of the shelf registration statement filed with the SEC is a procedural requirement that Bowman has met. This allows the company to issue securities expeditiously, subject to market conditions. The legal framework also mandates that the offering be conducted through a prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus, which ensures transparency and provides investors with the necessary information to make informed decisions.The disclaimer regarding the offer and sale of securities only in jurisdictions where it is lawful highlights the regulatory complexities surrounding public offerings. The company's adherence to these legal stipulations is essential to avoid potential legal repercussions and instill investor confidence in the company's governance practices. 03/26/2024 - 04:03 PM RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bowman Consulting Group Ltd.

The company also completed a public offering and private placement to strengthen its financial position. Positive Positive clinical data for tuspetinib in AML, showing broad activity and favorable safety profile. Completion of Luxeptinib G3 formulation evaluation, demonstrating desired plasma exposure levels for future studies. Successful completion of a public offering and private placement to raise funds for research and development. Stable financial position with sufficient capital to fund operations through August 2024. Negative Net loss increased by $9.4 million to $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the previous year. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2023, from $47.0 million at the end of 2022. Research and development expenses increased by $8.7 million in 2023, primarily driven by higher program costs for tuspetinib. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The advancement of tuspetinib into a triplet therapy pilot study represents a significant stride in the treatment landscape for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly for newly diagnosed patients ineligible for induction chemotherapy. The study's focus on a combination of tuspetinib, venetoclax and a hypomethylating agent (TUS/VEN/HMA) could potentially address a substantial unmet medical need, given the limited options for these patients.From a research perspective, the reported broad activity of tuspetinib across mutational subtypes and its favorable safety profile are noteworthy. These factors, combined with the drug's unique kinase targeting pattern, suggest a differentiated approach that could offer therapeutic benefits over existing treatments. Moreover, the reported complete remission (CR/CRh) rate of 36% in certain patient subsets is encouraging and warrants further investigation in larger, controlled studies.The financial implications for Aptose Biosciences and its stakeholders are multifaceted. On one hand, the progression into clinical studies is a resource-intensive endeavor that will likely increase R&D expenses. On the other hand, the potential for a successful therapy could lead to significant revenue generation. The recent public and private financings reflect an effort to support these initiatives, although the premium pricing in the private placement with Hanmi Pharmaceutical suggests confidence in the company's prospects. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial results of Aptose Biosciences, the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $46.9 million in 2022 to $9.3 million in 2023 is quite stark. This highlights the burn rate of the company as it invests heavily in its R&D programs. However, the subsequent financings in January 2024, which raised approximately $13.7 million, provide a lifeline that extends the company's operational runway through August 2024.Investors should note the dilutive effect of the common share offerings, which could potentially impact share value. The increase in R&D expenses by $8.7 million underscores the company's commitment to advancing its drug candidates, but also reflects the high costs associated with clinical development. The decrease in general and administrative expenses, particularly in stock-based compensation, might be seen as a cost-containment measure in response to the increased R&D spend.It is important to monitor the company's cash position and burn rate closely, as these will be key indicators of its ability to sustain operations and reach critical milestones without requiring additional dilutive financing. The company's strategic partnership with Hanmi Pharmaceutical also introduces an element of regional market interest and potential future collaboration benefits. Market Research Analyst Within the pharmaceutical industry, especially in the oncology segment, the development of new therapies like tuspetinib can significantly disrupt market dynamics. The current AML treatment market is competitive, with a need for therapies that can offer both efficacy and safety for a broad patient population. Tuspetinib's advancement into a triplet therapy pilot study signals potential market entry that could capture a share of the AML treatment space, particularly if the therapy proves effective in a broader range of mutational subtypes.The company's strategic moves, such as the partnership with Hanmi Pharmaceutical and the successful public and private offerings, indicate a proactive approach to financing and collaboration. These actions not only provide necessary capital but also potentially pave the way for market expansion and penetration, especially in Asia with Hanmi's involvement.Given the early stage of the clinical studies, the long-term market impact remains speculative. However, the progression of tuspetinib into further studies is a positive signal for investors monitoring the company's pipeline. The upcoming milestones, such as the initiation of the TUS/VEN/HMA pilot study and early data presentations at major conferences, will be critical in shaping market perceptions and investor confidence. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM Tuspetinib to Advance to TUS+VEN+HMA Triplet Therapy Pilot Study in 1L AMLTuspetinib Continues Broad Activity Across Mutations with Excellent Safety ProfileLuxeptinib G3 Formulation Achieves Desired Levels and Positions for Future TrialsConference Call and Webcast at 5:00 pm ET Today SAN DIEGO and TORONTO, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aptose Biosciences Inc. (“Aptose” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APTO, TSX: APS), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing highly differentiated oral targeted agents to treat hematologic malignancies, today announced financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. “The data we have generated from tuspetinib thus far – as a single agent and in combination therapy with venetoclax in relapsed and refractory AML – have demonstrated a distinctly favorable safety profile and broad activity for tuspetinib across mutational subtypes. This profile also extends to FLT3 wildtype AML, which represents the majority of AML patients, and in which few agents have shown such broad activity,” said William G. Rice, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “These data have propelled us to initiate a clinical study of tuspetinib in a triplet combination with venetoclax and azacitidine in frontline therapy for newly diagnosed AML, including both FLT3 wild type and FLT3 mutated subtypes.” Key Corporate Highlights Aptose Completes Public Offering – On January 30, 2024, Aptose closed a public offering of 5,649,122 common shares of the Company and warrants at a combined offering price of US $1.71 per share. This included 736,842 Common Shares and warrants pursuant to a full exercise by the underwriter of its over-allotment option. Total gross proceeds from the public offering were approximately $9.7 million before deducting underwriting costs, placement agent commissions and other offering-related expenses.Private Placement – On January 31, 2024, Aptose closed a US $4 million private placement of common shares with strategic partner Hanmi Pharmaceutical. Under the terms of the strategic investment, Hanmi purchased each common share at a price of US $1.90, representing an 11% premium over the price of the common shares issued as part of the public offering. The Company also issued Hanmi warrants to purchase common shares at an exercise price of US $1.71 per warrant share. Total gross proceeds from the private placement were approximately $4 million, excluding underwriting discounts, placement agent commissions and other offering-related expenses.Tuspetinib Advancing to Triplet Therapy Pilot Study – Tuspetinib (TUS), a once daily oral agent with a unique kinase targeting pattern, is being developed for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). More than 170 patients to date received TUS alone or in combination with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) during the Phase 1/2 clinical program in the very ill relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML patient population. At the single agent 80 mg recommended Phase 2 dose, TUS achieved a favorable safety profile and a CR/CRh rate of 36% among patients who were naive to VEN. The safety profile of TUS remained favorable when TUS was combined with VEN in R/R AML patients, and responses were achieved in both patients naive to VEN and those who failed prior therapy with VEN. TUS avoids many typical toxicities observed with other agents and achieves broad activity across AML patients with a diversity of adverse genetics. Tuspetinib is now being advanced to a triplet combination therapy of tuspetinib, venetoclax and a hypomethylating agent (TUS/VEN/HMA) for the frontline treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients ineligible for induction chemotherapy.Luxeptinib G3 Evaluation Completed – During 2023 and early 2024, clinical evaluation of the new generation 3 (G3) formulation of luxeptinib (LUX) was completed. The G3 formulation was tested in a single dose bioavailability study in 20 patients, including both B-cell cancer and AML patients, and across 5 dose levels (10mg to 200mg). The G3 formulation then was evaluated in R/R AML patients with continuous dosing using two different dose levels (50mg BID and 200mg BID) in a total of 11 patients. Data show the G3 formulation dosed at 200mg twice daily can achieve 2-3uM steady state plasma levels, with approximately 10-fold better absorption, and interestingly even better tolerability, than the original G1 formulation. Thus, the G3 formulation achieved the desired plasma exposure benchmark and can serve as the formulation of choice for future studies with LUX. Aptose is exploring alternative development paths and collaborations to advance LUX as a single agent or in combination with VEN to treat defined R/R patient populations of high unmet need.

Changes to the components of our R&D expenses presented in the table above are primarily related to the following activities: Program costs for tuspetinib increased by $14.8 million. The higher program costs for tuspetinib in 2023 represent the enrollment of patients in our APTIVATE clinical trial, our healthy volunteer trial, manufacturing activities to support clinical development, purchase of clinical trial materials, and related expenses.Program costs for luxeptinib decreased by approximately $4.9 million, primarily due to lower clinical trial costs and lower manufacturing costs as a result of the current formulation requiring less API than the prior formulation.Program costs for APTO-253 decreased by approximately $101 thousand due to the Company's decision on December 20, 2021, to discontinue further development of APTO-253.Personnel-related expenses decreased by $0.3 million due to lower headcount in 2023.Stock-based compensation decreased by approximately $845 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to stock options granted with lower grant date fair values in the current period. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and travel, including stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, business development, human resources, and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses and professional fees include auditing, and legal services, investor relations and other consultants, insurance. and facility related expenses. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase for the foreseeable future as we incur additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company and to support our pipeline of activities. We also expect our intellectual property related legal expenses to increase as our intellectual property portfolio expands.

Financial Analyst Reviewing the financial results of BioAtla, Inc., the reported cash balance of $111.5 million suggests a stable financial position, with sufficient runway into the second half of 2025. This is a critical indicator for investors, as it implies the company can continue its operations and clinical development without the immediate need for additional financing. However, it's worth noting the increase in net cash used in operating activities year-over-year, from $90.4 million in 2022 to $104.0 million in 2023. This could signify escalating costs associated with advancing clinical trials, which investors should monitor as it may affect future financial stability.Moreover, the slight decrease in R&D expenses projected for the first half of 2024 could be a positive sign of cost control, but stakeholders should seek clarity on how this might impact the progression of clinical trials. The reduction in G&A expenses due to lower stock-based compensation and insurance premiums is also beneficial for the company's bottom line. The net loss figures are relatively consistent year-over-year, which is not uncommon for clinical-stage biotech companies focused on R&D. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, the clearance of the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period for the CAB-CTLA-4 (BA3071) at 700 mg is an encouraging development. DLTs are critical safety assessments in early-phase clinical trials and their clearance indicates an acceptable safety profile at this dosage. The anticipation of initial Phase 2 data readouts for several of BioAtla's therapies in 2024 is a pivotal moment that could significantly influence the company's valuation and strategic partnerships. The potential for these therapies, especially if they show positive efficacy and safety profiles, could disrupt current treatment paradigms for solid tumors.It's also important to note the company's commitment to enrolling patients in potentially registrational studies, such as the CAB-AXL (BA3011) in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). A registrational trial is one that, if successful, could lead to regulatory approval of the drug. The data presented at ESMO on the disease control rate in treatment-refractory sarcomas and the manageable safety profile of Mecbotamab Vedotin (CAB-AXL-ADC) indicate a promising therapeutic potential. However, the actual impact will hinge on comprehensive data from the ongoing and upcoming trials. Market Research Analyst For investors, the clinical advancements of BioAtla's pipeline are of paramount importance. The company's focus on Conditionally Active Biologic (CAB) antibody therapeutics is a novel approach that could offer competitive advantages in the oncology market. The successful enrollment of Phase 2 trials for CAB-ROR2 (BA3021) in melanoma and SCCHN and the upcoming data readouts in 2Q 2024 are key milestones that could impact BioAtla's market positioning and investor sentiment. These milestones, along with the anticipated FDA guidance for the CAB-AXL (BA3011) study, will likely be closely monitored by the market for indications of potential commercial success.Additionally, the in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel NextGen linker system for the Anti-Nectin-4-ADC (BA3361) and its anticipated IND submission in 2Q 2024 demonstrate BioAtla's commitment to innovation. The impact of these developments on the stock market will depend on the outcomes of these trials and subsequent regulatory actions. Positive results could lead to increased investor confidence and potential partnerships, whereas any setbacks might negatively affect the company's stock price and market valuation. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM CAB-CTLA-4 (BA3071) Phase 1 study cleared dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period with 700 mg (10 mg/kg); initial Phase 2 monotherapy data readout anticipated in 2Q 2024 and in combination with pembrolizumab in 2H 2024CAB-ROR2 (BA3021) Phase 2 melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) clinical trials fully enrolled; on track for data readouts in 2Q 2024CAB-AXL (BA3011) Phase 2 potentially registrational study in undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) on track for enrollment completion of approximately 20 patients in April with anticipated FDA meeting for guidance on the remaining portion of the potentially registrational trial in 2H 2024CAB-EpCAM x CAB-CD3 (BA3182) Phase 1 dose-escalation study on track with full data readout anticipated in 2H 2024; potential initiation of Phase 2 study in 2H 2024Cash balance of $111.5 million at year-end 2023 is expected to fund operations into 2H 2025Management to host conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time SAN DIEGO, March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioAtla, Inc.

The increase of $0.8 million was due to clinical development expenses primarily related to the launch of our BA3011 UPS potentially registrational trial in 2023 and overall accelerated enrollment across our clinical trials in 2023, offset by a decrease in expense for our pre-clinical programs and selected clinical indications due to our program prioritization in 2023. We expect our R&D expenses to decrease overall in the 1H of 2024 due to recent completion of enrollment in clinical trials for data sets expected to enable potentially registrational trials for our ADC programs, BA3021 and BA3011. General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $5.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to $6.7 million for the same quarter in 2022. The $0.8 million decrease was primarily due to lower stock based compensation and D&O insurance premiums. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $26.9 million compared to a net loss of $27.6 million for the same quarter in 2022. Net cash used in operating activities for the full year ended December 31, 2023 was $104.0 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $90.4 million for the same period in 2022. Cash used for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $29.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 were $111.5 million, compared to $215.5 million as of December 31, 2022. We expect our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operations into the second half of 2025.

About Mecbotamab Vedotin (BA3011)Mecbotamab vedotin, CAB-AXL-ADC, is a conditionally and reversibly active antibody drug conjugate targeting the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. This Phase 2 stage clinical asset is targeting multiple solid tumor indications, including the treatment of soft tissue and bone sarcoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have previously progressed on PD-1/L1, EGFR or ALK inhibitor therapies. The Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) at FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to mecbotamab vedotin for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. About Ozuriftamab Vedotin (BA3021)Ozuriftamab vedotin, CAB-ROR2-ADC, is a conditionally and reversibly active antibody drug conjugate directed against ROR2, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed across many different solid tumors including lung, head and neck and melanoma. This Phase 2 stage clinical asset is targeting multiple solid tumor indications, including the treatment of NSCLC patients who have previously progressed on PD-1/L1, EGFR or ALK inhibitor therapies, melanoma patients who have previously progressed on PD-1/L1 therapy and SCCHN patients who have previously progressed on PD-1/L1 therapies with or without platinum chemotherapy. About Evalstotug (BA3071)BA3071, is a CAB anti-CTLA-4 antibody that is being developed as an immuno-oncology agent with the goal of delivering efficacy at least comparable to the approved anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, but with lower toxicities due to the CAB's tumor microenvironment-restricted activity. This may enable safer anti-CTLA-4 antibody combination therapies, such as with anti-PD-1 antibody checkpoint inhibitors, and potentially broaden the patient population tolerant to combination therapy and deliver greater efficacy. Like our other CAB candidates, this Phase 2 clinical asset is designed to be conditionally and reversibly active in the tumor microenvironment. BA3071 is being developed as a potential therapeutic for multiple solid tumor indications that are known to be responsive to CTLA-4 treatment in combination with a PD-1 blocking agent. About BA3182 BioAtla is developing BA3182 as a potential anticancer therapy for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma. BA3182 is a conditionally active biologic (CAB) EpCAM x (CAB) CD3 bispecific T cell engager antibody that contains two binding sites for EpCAM and two binding sites for CD3ε. The binding sites for EpCAM and CD3ε have been designed to bind their respective targets specifically and reversibly under the conditions found in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to have reduced binding outside of the TME. The CAB selective binding to both the CAB EpCAM and CAB CD3ε arms are required to activate the T cell engagement against the tumor, thus enabling the combined selectivity of each CAB binding arm in the bispecific antibody. BioAtla continues to advance the ongoing Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of BA3182 in advanced adenocarcinoma patients. About BA3361BA3361, CAB-Nectin4-ADC, is a conditionally and reversibly active antibody drug conjugate directed against Nectin4, a cell-cell adhesion molecule overexpressed in multiple human malignancies. The Nectin4-binding domains of BA3361 have been optimized for binding under tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions and reduced binding under normal physiological conditions. BA3361 is the first molecule containing one of BioAtla’s novel NextGen ADC linkers with highly improved stability and tumor specific payload release. BA3361 showed superior activity in patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenograft models. About BioAtla®, Inc.

The reported cash and cash equivalents of $166.1 million, bolstered by a significant private financing round, signal a strong liquidity position. This is particularly noteworthy for investors as it implies a robust cash runway into 2026, which is critical for a biopharmaceutical company in the preclinical and development stages. The increase in R&D expenses, while expected in a growth phase, should be monitored for its impact on the burn rate. However, the company's ability to manage these expenses while progressing through preclinical milestones can be seen as a positive indicator of efficient capital allocation. Medical Research Analyst Korro Bio's announcement regarding the progression of its lead candidate, KRRO-110, for the treatment of AATD is a significant stride in the field of RNA editing therapeutics. The preclinical data suggesting high specificity and the potential to correct protein misfolding directly addresses a key unmet medical need in AATD. The mention of no detectable bystander edits and the secretion of functional AAT protein after a single dose could indicate a competitive edge in safety and efficacy. The translation of editing efficiency from mice to NHPs further strengthens the case for potential clinical success. For stakeholders, this suggests a promising outlook for the company's proprietary OPERA platform and its pipeline, which could translate into value creation upon successful clinical validation. Biotech Market Analyst The strategic financial and operational updates from Korro Bio have implications for market positioning within the biotechnology sector. The company's private financing success and the subsequent cash position present a narrative of investor confidence and market interest. The anticipated regulatory filing and interim clinical readout for KRRO-110 in the coming years are key events that could influence the company's stock performance. Additionally, the advancement of the OPERA platform and the generation of CHORDs demonstrate innovation and diversification potential, which are critical factors for long-term market competitiveness in the rapidly evolving biotech landscape. 03/26/2024 - 04:01 PM On track for regulatory filing for First-in-Human study of KRRO-110 in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) patients anticipated in the second half of 2024Demonstrated the versatility of Korro’s RNA editing platform by generating de-novo protein variants via multiple targets in non-human primates (NHPs) Demonstrated greater than 50% editing using GalNAc conjugates in the liver with subcutaneous administration in a preclinical mouse modelEnded 2023 with a strong balance sheet of $166 million of cash and cash equivalents, including $117 million of proceeds from a successful private financing completed in November 2023Cash runway into 2026, which enables key readouts for KRRO-110 and progression of additional pipeline candidates CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Korro Bio, Inc. (Korro) (Nasdaq: KRRO), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a new class of genetic medicines for both rare and highly prevalent diseases, today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and reiterated its recent progress and anticipated milestones. “Last year was a remarkable year for us as we achieved multiple major milestones, including selecting KRRO-110 as a development candidate, a potentially best-in-class therapeutic for AATD, becoming a public company, and closing $117 million in financing,” said Dr. Ram Aiyar, CEO and President of Korro. “2024 is off to a strong start and is poised to be a transformative year for us. We expect multiple milestones throughout the year, including a regulatory submission for KRRO-110 in the second half of 2024, further progression of our pipeline programs, and expansion of platform innovation. Our dedication to providing potential disease-modifying therapies for patients in need, coupled with our conviction in the pivotal role of RNA editing in the development of these therapeutic options, uniquely positions us to make a meaningful impact on patients’ lives.” Pipeline and Business Updates: Nominated KRRO-110 as first development candidate for the potential treatment of AATD. KRRO-110 is the first RNA editing oligonucleotide product candidate from Korro’s platform called Oligonucleotide Promoted Editing of RNA (OPERA™). KRRO-110 is designed to co-opt an endogenous enzyme, Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR), to edit the “A” variant on SERPINA1 RNA, repair an amino acid codon, and restore secretion of normal alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein. This repair of the endogenous protein has the potential to clear protein aggregates from within liver cells to create a potentially clinically differentiated benefit for liver function and to preserve lung function by providing an adequate amount of normal AAT protein. Reported preclinical data for KRRO-110 that supports continued development as a potentially best-in-class therapeutic for AATD patients. Preclinical data demonstrated high specificity with no detectable bystander edits in human (MZ) primary hepatocytes and secretion of ~50µM functional AAT protein after a single dose in a preclinical human transgenic PiZ mouse model with durability in mice based on an increase in AAT protein with the inhibition of elastase activity. Advanced OPERA platform to generate differentiated Customized High-Fidelity Oligonucleotides for RNA Deamination, or CHORDs™. Aided by proprietary algorithms, Korro developed CHORDs with enhanced in vivo potency and durability. Using CHORDs, Korro achieved greater than 50% editing using GalNAc conjugates with subcutaneous administration to the liver in a preclinical mouse model. Demonstrated translation of RNA editing efficiency from mice to NHPs in multiple targets. For its AATD program, with a single dose, Korro has shown greater than 40% editing in NHPs utilizing a surrogate oligonucleotide designed to edit and create a de novo AAT protein variant in NHPs in a transient manner. Additionally, Korro demonstrated the creation of a de novo protein variant of an undisclosed transcription factor, leading to sustained downstream activity in NHPs lasting longer than 21 days, demonstrating the potential to increase the half-life of the transcription factor and enhance its function. Strong balance sheet with cash runway into 2026. Cash and cash equivalents of approximately $166.1 million are expected to fund operations and multiple potentially value-creating milestones into 2026, including advancement of KRRO-110 through a potential interim clinical readout, progression of additional product candidates through the Company’s pipeline, and demonstration of OPERA applicability across additional tissue types. Expanded Board of Directors with two independent director appointments. Added Dr. Rachel Meyers, an industry veteran with decades of experience developing RNA therapeutics while at Alnylam, and Tim Pearson, an industry veteran and financial expert operating large and small biotechs, both of whom bring unique perspectives and deep expertise to Korro’s Board. Upcoming Milestones: Regulatory filing for KRRO-110 in AATD on track for the second half of 2024.Anticipated interim clinical readout for KRRO-110 in AATD in the second half of 2025. Full Year 2023 Financial Results: Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $166.1 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $55.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Korro expects that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operations into 2026. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses were $57.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $42.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by preclinical activities for the KRRO-110 AATD program and expenses related to the advancement of its pipeline and platform. General and Administration (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase is driven primarily by merger-related personnel costs, as well as additional personnel and facility costs to support growing R&D function. Net Loss: Korro’s net loss was $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

"Surgery Partners, Inc. Announces Pricing of New Senior Notes Offering",2024-03-26T19:51:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ: SGRY) announced a private offering of $800 million in senior unsecured notes due 2032 by its subsidiary, Surgery Center Holdings, Inc. The proceeds will be used to redeem existing notes, pay related fees, and fund future acquisitions.","Surgery Partners, Inc. Announces Pricing of New Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ: SGRY) announced a private offering of $800 million in senior unsecured notes due 2032 by its subsidiary, Surgery Center Holdings, Inc. The proceeds will be used to redeem existing notes, pay related fees, and fund future acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Surgery Partners, Inc. to issue $800 million in senior unsecured notes at a 7.250% interest rate reflects a strategic move to restructure its debt profile. By redeeming higher-interest notes due in 2025 and 2027, the company is effectively lowering its cost of capital. This is a common financial strategy where a company takes advantage of market conditions to refinance part of its debt at a lower interest rate, thereby reducing interest expenses over time.Investors should note the senior unsecured nature of the notes, which means they rank above other unsecured debt in case of liquidation but do not have collateral backing them. While this might imply a higher risk compared to secured notes, the interest rate offered seems to compensate for the risk premium. The guarantee by domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries also adds a layer of security for the note holders.The use of excess proceeds for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions, indicates an aggressive growth strategy. This could signal to investors that the company is looking to expand its market presence, which may have positive long-term implications if managed effectively. However, it also entails additional risks as acquisitions can lead to integration challenges and potential dilution of shareholder value if not executed properly. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the issuance of these notes by Surgery Partners can be seen as a response to the current interest rate environment and the company's outlook on future rates. If the company anticipates that interest rates will rise, locking in a rate now could be beneficial. However, if rates were to decrease, the company might have to carry a higher interest rate than necessary.Moreover, the healthcare sector, particularly the outpatient surgical space, is experiencing consolidation, with companies seeking to expand their service offerings and geographical reach. Surgery Partners' intent to use proceeds for acquisitions aligns with this trend. This could make the company more competitive and possibly increase its market share, which is an important consideration for stakeholders.It's also worth noting that the private nature of the offering, targeting 'qualified institutional buyers,' suggests that the company is looking for sophisticated investors who understand the risks and are capable of making large investments. This might imply a level of confidence in the company's financial health and growth prospects. Debt Capital Markets Expert When assessing the impact of Surgery Partners' note issuance, one must consider the terms of the debt and the company's leverage. A 7.250% coupon rate for a non-investment grade issuer is relatively high in today's market, reflecting the inherent credit risk. However, it's lower than the rates of the notes being redeemed, which suggests an improvement in the company's creditworthiness or a strategic play to capitalize on current investor demand for higher yields amidst a low-interest-rate environment.The redemption of existing notes before maturity can also be a positive signal to the market, indicating proactive financial management. However, investors should be cautious of the potential for increased leverage if the company does not manage the new capital effectively or if the anticipated acquisitions do not yield the expected returns.It is also important to analyze the terms and covenants associated with the new issuance, as they can have significant implications for both the issuer and the investors. For example, more restrictive covenants can limit the company's operational flexibility, while lenient terms might suggest confidence from investors in the company's financial stability and growth trajectory. 03/26/2024 - 03:51 PM BRENTWOOD, Tenn., March 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) (“Surgery Partners” or the “Company”) today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Surgery Center Holdings, Inc.

(NYSE American: IGC) secures a $3 million strategic investment from Bradbury Asset Management, supporting the development of investigational medicines like IGC-AD1. The investment involves issuing 8,823,529 shares of common stock. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic investment of $3 million into IGC Pharma by Bradbury Asset Management is a significant infusion of capital that can have material implications for the company's financial health and operational capabilities. This investment, priced at the closing price of $0.34 per share, indicates a level of confidence in the company's potential, particularly in its investigational medicine IGC-AD1. The issuance of 8,823,529 shares represents a dilution of current shareholders' equity, but it is a common practice for companies seeking to raise funds without incurring debt. Investors should monitor the impact of this dilution on earnings per share and the company's overall market capitalization.Furthermore, the designation of the funds for general corporate purposes and the advancement of investigational medicines suggests a strategic focus on research and development. The success of IGC-AD1 and other medicines in the pipeline will be important in determining the long-term return on this investment. Short-term, the market may react to the increased liquidity and potential for accelerated company growth. However, the shares being unregistered and not immediately tradable could limit the immediate impact on the stock's liquidity and price volatility. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, strategic investments such as the one made by Bradbury Asset Management in IGC Pharma often signal to the market that institutional investors have vetted and see potential in a company's future. This can be particularly impactful for a company listed on the NYSE American, which is a platform for growth companies. The investment could be interpreted as a positive signal, potentially attracting further attention from other investors and analysts.It's also important to understand the broader market dynamics. The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive, with investor sentiment often swayed by progress in clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Given that the funds are earmarked for the advancement of IGC-AD1, the market's response may be contingent upon the company's forthcoming announcements regarding the development stages and efficacy of this investigational medicine. The timing of the investment may also be strategic, possibly ahead of significant milestones or data releases that could affect the company's valuation. Biotech Industry Analyst The biotech industry is driven by innovation and the potential for breakthrough therapies. IGC Pharma's focus on advancing its investigational medicine IGC-AD1 is indicative of the industry's high-risk, high-reward nature. The $3 million investment from Bradbury Asset Management could be a pivotal moment for the company, providing the necessary resources to reach critical clinical trial milestones or to scale up manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of a successful trial outcome.Investors should note that the development of investigational medicines is a lengthy and uncertain process, with many potential setbacks. The success of IGC-AD1 is not guaranteed and the investment by Bradbury should be viewed in the context of the inherent risks associated with drug development. However, should IGC-AD1 prove successful, the impact on IGC Pharma's stock could be substantial, with significant implications for patient care in the therapeutic area being targeted by the medicine. 03/26/2024 - 03:00 PM POTOMAC, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- IGC Pharma, Inc.

Novo Integrated Sciences Provides Update on Certain Current Actions and Events,2024-03-26T18:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Positive,"Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NVOS) provides updates on recent actions and events, including the purchase of a gemstone collection for $60 million, awaiting approval for a $70 million promissory note drawdown, and actively pursuing monetization of a $1 billion gold-backed bond.","Novo Integrated Sciences Provides Update on Certain Current Actions and Events Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NVOS) provides updates on recent actions and events, including the purchase of a gemstone collection for $60 million, awaiting approval for a $70 million promissory note drawdown, and actively pursuing monetization of a $1 billion gold-backed bond. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst With Novo Integrated Sciences' recent strategic moves, including the acquisition of the Ophir Collection and the issuance of a substantial promissory note, there are multiple layers of financial implications. The acquisition, funded by a promissory note, indicates a pivot towards asset diversification. However, the purchase of gemstones, which are typically considered non-liquid assets, raises questions about asset turnover and valuation methods. Additionally, the unsecured nature of the promissory note, coupled with a non-compounding yield, suggests a favorable borrowing cost for Novo. Yet, it also indicates potential risk for the note holder due to lack of collateral. The involvement in a gold-backed bond monetization effort points to an aggressive strategy to leverage high-value assets. The 12.5 percent simple interest rate on the bond is notably high, which may reflect underlying risk or an expectation of inflationary pressures. Investors might be concerned about the company's focus on such unconventional assets and the associated risks, compared to more traditional and liquid investments. Financial Analyst Novo's compliance with the SPA and RC Note terms is a positive sign of management's commitment to its financial obligations. The approval for the initial drawdown from the promissory note is important for funding the gemstone acquisition and may impact the company's cash flow analysis. The structure of the RC Note, particularly its non-compounding interest, implies a relatively stable long-term liability on the balance sheet, which could be attractive for certain investors looking for predictable financial structures. However, the lack of debt conversion or equity issuance options in the RC Note could limit the company's financial flexibility. The absence of collateral is a double-edged sword; it benefits Novo by avoiding encumbrance of assets but could deter potential investors who seek security in tangible backing. The market will need to assess the creditworthiness of Novo and the likelihood of successful monetization of the gold-backed bond to fully understand the potential impact on the company's valuation. Commodities Expert The decision to invest in a gold-backed bond and gemstones suggests Novo is positioning itself to capitalize on the intrinsic value of precious commodities. The gold market is often seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty and a 15-year term for holding the bond could indicate a long-term strategy to benefit from potential increases in gold prices. The pursuit of monetization options for the bond demonstrates proactive management but also introduces complexity into the company's revenue model. For stakeholders, the key consideration will be the company's ability to effectively manage and liquidate these high-value assets. The gemstone market, while potentially lucrative, is niche and requires specialized knowledge to navigate successfully. The expertise required to monetize such assets is quite specific and the company's success in these endeavors will be closely watched by investors familiar with the commodities market. 03/26/2024 - 02:30 PM BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVOS) (the “Company” or “Novo”), today provides an update with respect to certain actions and events, as follows: Purchase and Sale Agreement – Ophir Collection: As previously disclosed, on November 21, 2023 Novo entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“Ophir Agreement”) between the Company and Blake Alsbrook, solely in his capacity as Court-appointed successor receiver (the “Successor Receiver”) in Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation v.

The UCC-3 filing provides for the partial assignment and transfer of the full face-value of the Bond to Novo for a maximum term of 15-years without the benefit of annual interest. The Company is aggressively pursuing monetization of the Bond with internationally based facility providers. About Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. is pioneering a holistic approach to patient-first health and wellness through a multidisciplinary healthcare ecosystem of services and product innovation. Novo offers an essential and differentiated solution to deliver, or intend to deliver, these services and products through the integration of medical technology, advanced therapeutics, and rehabilitative science. We believe that “decentralizing” healthcare, through the integration of medical technology and interconnectivity, is an essential solution to the rapidly evolving fundamental transformation of how non-catastrophic healthcare is delivered both now and in the future. Specific to non-critical care, ongoing advancements in both medical technology and inter-connectivity are allowing for a shift of the patient/practitioner relationship to the patient’s home and away from on-site visits to primary medical centers with mass-services. This acceleration of “ease-of-access” in the patient/practitioner interaction for non-critical care diagnosis and subsequent treatment minimizes the degradation of non-critical health conditions to critical conditions as well as allowing for more cost-effective healthcare distribution. The Company’s decentralized healthcare business model is centered on three primary pillars to best support the transformation of non-catastrophic healthcare delivery to patients and consumers: First Pillar: Service Networks. Deliver multidisciplinary primary care services through (i) an affiliate network of clinic facilities, (ii) small and micro footprint sized clinic facilities primarily located within the footprint of box-store commercial enterprises, (iii) clinic facilities operated through a franchise relationship with the Company, and (iv) corporate operated clinic facilities. Second Pillar: Technology. Develop, deploy, and integrate sophisticated interconnected technology, interfacing the patient to the healthcare practitioner thus expanding the reach and availability of the Company’s services, beyond the traditional clinic location, to geographic areas not readily providing advanced, peripheral based healthcare services, including the patient’s home. Third Pillar: Products. Develop and distribute effective, personalized health and wellness product solutions allowing for the customization of patient preventative care remedies and ultimately a healthier population. The Company’s science-first approach to product innovation further emphasizes our mandate to create and provide over-the-counter preventative and maintenance care solutions. Innovation through science combined with the integration of sophisticated, secure technology assures Novo Integrated Sciences of continued cutting-edge advancement in patient-first platforms.

Duke Energy's Carolinas Lineman's Rodeo in New Hill was one of three regional Lineman's Rodeos taking place this spring across Duke Energy's service areas, displaying the talent and skills of the company's dedicated lineworkers. Lineman's rodeos are specialized contests that test job-related skills line technicians rely on daily to restore power day and night – often in unpredictable outdoor conditions. Events take place on de-energized equipment in a simulated environment, but participants are scored based on simulations of on-the-job work, with deductions for mistakes. Competitors are judged on efficiency, agility, technique and safety procedures. Categories scored included equipment repair, pole climbs and hurt man rescues. Duke Energy holds three regional competitions to qualify lineworkers for the international competition – including in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. The Carolinas rodeo this year included one senior team, 46 journeyman teams and 76 apprentices. Team divisions are based in part on tenure. An apprentice is a lineworker with less than four years of utility experience. A journeyman or senior journeyman with Duke Energy has more than four years of utility experience. The senior division in a lineman's rodeo denotes lineworkers who are 50 years old or older. ""Our lineworkers are always prepared for any circumstance, but the extreme elements associated with storms, oppressive heat and bitterly cold temperatures can add challenges,"" said Scott Batson, chief power grid officer at Duke Energy. ""We are able to keep the lights on for millions of customers who depend on us thanks to our line teams' dedication to training, experience in the field, passion for their craft and supporting one another."" Elevated expertise Duke Energy Carolinas regional rodeo winners will join other top lineworkers from Duke Energy rodeos in Florida and the Midwest to compete in the International Lineman's Rodeo in Bonner Springs, Kan., on Oct. 19, an international event that attracts the most talented lineworkers from around the world. The best lineworkers at Duke Energy and its legacy companies have showcased their talents at the International Lineman's Rodeo for more than two decades. ""Many linemen are competitive by nature which makes the rodeo fun, but more importantly it gives our families an opportunity to see what we do every day and what can sometimes take us away for work in the middle of the night,"" said Jay Tipton, journeyman lineworker with Duke Energy's Asheville Operations Center. ""It's wonderful that Duke Energy continues to support us and this event that is so significant for those closest to us."" Duke Energy Carolinas competitors advancing from regional rodeos to the International Lineman's Rodeo include: Apprentice Overall Awards East Division First place – David HutterSecond place – Ryan PriceThird place – Grayson LassiterWest Division First place – Eli MedfordSecond place – Dawson HendersonThird place – James SmithOverall Best Apprentice – David Hutter Journeyman Overall Awards East Division First place – Josh Haithcock, Zack Haithcock, William GandySecond place – David Grissom, Austin Jackson, Grant ThompsonThird place – Ryan Denning, Lane Pickett, Austin BowdenFourth place – Preston Pernell, Gavin Frederick Tyler PegramWest Division First place – Sandy Barnhill, Jay Tipton, Keith GriffinSecond place – Matt Josey, Aaron Smith, Shane StillwellThird place – Miles Bell, Daniel Burrell, Jordan HendersonFourth place – Tyler Manick, Tyler Nickols, Joshua BucknerOverall Best Journeyman Team – Sandy Barnhill, Jay Tipton, Keith Griffin Overall Best Senior Team – Sandy Barnhill, Jay Tipton, Keith Griffin ""The rodeo is a great place to showcase skills that we utilize on a daily basis – and getting to compete in rain and inclement weather like we saw Saturday reflects the scenarios we deal with on a day-to-day basis,"" said William Gandy, journeyman lineworker with Duke Energy's Florence Operations Center. ""I'm fortunate to compete with a team that has the same determination and dedication to the job and our customers, as working hand in hand through storms and daily work makes competing at the rodeo together that much more meaningful."" The 2024 Carolinas Lineman's Rodeo was supported by volunteers from across the Duke Energy community. Sixty Duke Energy volunteers, 18 volunteers from South Wake Storm Youth Sports Association, 20 volunteer students and staff from seven community colleges, 72 judges and six bucket truck operators were on hand during the competition. Powering the future grid Lineworkers play a key role in power grid improvement projects that help modernize and strengthen Duke Energy's system against storms and other impacts, making it more reliable and resilient. This can include work to upgrade lines and poles, underground outage-prone lines where data indicates it makes sense to do so, and enhancing grid reliability through the integration of smart, self-healing technology – which saved more than 1.5 million customer interruptions and avoided more than 3.5 million hours of customer outage time in 2023. Hiring and developing entry-level craft and skilled talent is critical to address the growing needs of residential and nonresidential customers, as well as to deploy a cleaner, diverse energy mix to meet current and future needs for these customers and their communities. These vital employees also help enable the connection of more renewables and added protection from cybersecurity and physical threats. Duke Energy continues to hire lineworker talent and works closely with community colleges across its company footprint to recruit diverse, skilled candidates. Individuals interested in a lineworking career with Duke Energy should contact community colleges directly for more information on their specific lineworker training programs, including available funding for tuition. ""Safely powering our customers and communities is the most important job we have,"" said Batson. ""We are proud to be able to source extraordinary talent through our community college partners to join our line teams and serve as ambassadors for the company with our customers.""

Last year, the Foundation’s work in this Pillar included partnering with the Don Hanson Charitable Foundation and Jane Goodall Institute’s youth action program Roots & Shoots USA to launch the Hanson Box project in the United States, delivering free educational books and lesson plans to thousands of schools across the country. In Oregon, the Avangrid Foundation has partnered with SMART Reading for nearly a decade to support their child literacy programs. SMART Reading works alongside schools and teachers to provide access to books and one-on-one reading time. Since 2016, the Foundation has provided the organization with $295,000 to support SMART Reading programs in cities across Oregon. In addition, the Avangrid team from the company’s Portland, Oregon office volunteer to read with students and help restore donated books for the SMART Readings Book Bank. “Reading is a powerful tool that benefits us in countless ways,” said Pablo Colón, director of corporate citizenship at Avangrid and executive director of the Avangrid Foundation. “It unlocks a world of knowledge and opportunity. This National Reading Month, I encourage everyone to promote literacy in their community by getting involved with their local book bank, volunteering at their local library, or donating books to an organization in need.” The Avangrid Foundation’s other key literacy related partnerships include employees volunteering to support New Haven Reads’ book bank and one-on-one afterschool tutoring; the company’s Pride@Avangrid business resource group collecting and donating more than 6,700 books to Rochester, New York’s Little Free Libraries since 2021; and the President’s Pick Book program in Maine that provided literacy resources and books from a Maine author to more than 600 Maine communities last year.

But these Grade 12 students are especially pumped as they'll return from Dawson Creek proudly knowing they've built a house!Yes, Templeton and Bougerolle helped construct a house as part of their carpentry program at Northern Lights College.""It's pretty awesome-I've learned how to build a house from foundation to roof. Honestly, that was a game changer because I really enjoyed the course I'm doing,"" says Templeton.""I've been doing carpentry stuff all my life-building cabinets, building doors. It's something I'm good at. To expand upon my skills was a great opportunity,"" adds Bougerolle.The two high school students are in their final months of their Enhanced Carpentry Foundation program, where they'll get carpentry credits for an apprenticeship certification. That's happening a month before they even graduate from high school in June.Templeton and Bougerolle's carpentry program is part of the dual credit programs, which offer Grade 11 and 12 students a chance to take post-secondary courses while still in high school. The students can enroll in trades courses or other post-secondary courses of their choosing to kick-start their chosen career early.That's because School Districts (SD) in the Peace River South (SD 59), Peace River North (SD 60) and Fort Nelson (SD 81), Chalo First Nation School, Northern Lights College, and industry partners formed a partnership called Northern Opportunities-providing young adults with a smooth progression from secondary to post-secondary training.The tuition fees for the dual credit programs are covered by the students' schools. However, other expenses such as living costs and school supplies needed in the programs must be shouldered by the students and their families.""Quite often, students have to leave their communities to access training, and leaving their home is already tough. So, the scholarship helps to cover their financial worries in terms of transportation costs, residence fees, and the purchase of necessary tools and materials for their courses,"" says Brian Campbell, SD 60 Principal.To help alleviate financial barriers, Enbridge has supported Northern Opportunities through a scholarship, providing students with financial support to help them complete their dual credit programs. For almost 20 years now, Enbridge has allotted about $40,000 every year to the Northern Opportunities Enbridge Bursary.Students enrolled in the dual credit program must apply for the scholarship by March 15 for spring intake. The application form is available through a high school's dual credit coordinator.

Our board members have significant, complementary, and diverse expertise, including rail transportation, operations, finance, regulatory and governmental relations, safety, sustainability, cybersecurity, and other relevant skills to continue the board's effective, independent oversight. The board embraces change and feedback from investors to ensure alignment with shareholders' best interests. Indeed, the board has led a thoughtful and comprehensive refreshment process to ensure it is best positioned to hold management accountable and deliver results for shareholders. This includes appointing six new directors in the past five years. The board most recently nominated Richard Anderson, former CEO of Delta and Amtrak, and Mary Kathryn ""Heidi"" Heitkamp, former U.S. Senator and rail safety advocate. As a result of its ongoing refreshment process, Norfolk Southern has assembled a board comprising leaders who represent the best of their respective industries: Admiral Philip Davidson (retired four-star Admiral in the U.S. Navy);Francesca DeBiase (former EVP and global chief supply chain officer at McDonald's Corporation);Marcela Donadio (former audit partner and Americas Oil and Gas sector leader at Ernst & Young);John Huffard, Jr. (seasoned technology and cybersecurity executive with over two decades of experience as co-founder of Tenable Holdings, Inc.);Christopher Jones (former corporate VP and president of the technology services sector of Northrop Grumman Corporation);Colm Kelleher (Chairman of the Board of UBS Group AG and former president of Morgan Stanley);Amy Miles, independent chair of the board (former CEO of Regal Entertainment Group);Claude Mongeau (renowned railroad executive and former CEO of Canadian National);Jennifer Scanlon (current CEO of UL Solutions Inc., a leading global safety science organization, and former CEO of USG Corporation);Alan Shaw (Norfolk Southern's president and CEO responsible for developing and implementing our balanced strategy, and who previously served as EVP and CMO and VP, Intermodal Operations); andJohn Thompson (former senior executive and director at multiple customer-facing publicly traded companies, including Best Buy Co., Inc.).It is this cohort of extremely talented and experienced directors that Ancora would have shareholders dismantle and replace with inferior nominees who the board has determined lack the necessary qualifications to serve on the board. They are being put forward solely as part of Ancora's campaign to remove management and take control of the board to implement Ancora's ill-conceived and reckless strategy. Ancora's attempt is not only unwarranted, it would introduce significant risk to our strategy and result in value destruction for our shareholders. Your Vote is Important We strongly urge you vote for the entire slate of 13 highly qualified and experienced Norfolk Southern director nominees. Your vote is extremely important, no matter how many shares you own. Please use the enclosed WHITE proxy card to vote ONLY FOR Norfolk Southern's 13 nominees today.

If you inadvertently voted using a Blue proxy card, you may cancel that vote simply by voting again TODAY using the Company's WHITE proxy card. Only your latest-dated vote will count!

(Graphic - OriginClear) Enviromaintenance (www.enviromaintenance.com) is a leading provider of large community scale-on-site wastewater treatment and disposal systems, with a significant market presence in the Mobile Home Park (MHP) industry in the greater Austin area. The company plans to recommend MWS’s fully integrated, modular wastewater treatment systems to MHPs, thereby providing mobile home park owners an affordable, reliable and efficient way to treat their wastewater. Tightening regulatory requirements combined with older failing on-site septic drain field systems are driving the need for upgrades to full on-site wastewater treatment systems – essentially a “micro-utility in every MHP”. MWS, a division of OriginClear subsidiary Water On Demand™, manufactures a series of robust and durable wastewater treatment systems and has commercialized highly-standardized systems for MHPs, incorporating either IFAS (Integrated Film Activated Sludge) or MBR (Membrane Bio Reactor) treatment capabilities. “Dan Early, PE, and his innovative MWS team have perfected an effective treatment approach for compact wastewater systems with a treatment capacity of 5,000 gallons per day,” said Enviromaintenance owner Bryan Klepzig. “Modular Water Systems’ ability to manufacture large rectangular structural plastic tanks, whether standardized individual tanks for bulk storage or larger multi-compartment tanks, reflects a game-changing ability to deliver not only the tank but an integrated treatment system capability. This is exciting as it offers the ability to deliver projects in less time while also providing a superior system that will last decades longer than conventional concrete tank-based projects.” Klepzig went on to say, “Modular Water Systems and its affiliated Water On Demand business model can offer a unique financing model that makes these systems affordable for MHP owners, while enabling them to significantly reduce their dependence on expensive municipal water grids. This combination of project financing and equipment delivery could turbocharge the rollout of these systems, as it greatly simplifies the delivery of much-needed on-site wastewater solutions. We are honored to help pilot this new way of solving a problem within the current system of wastewater treatment.” “Bryan Klepzig and Enviromaintenance are uniquely positioned in the Greater Central Texas Region, have an awesome track record of project success, and have an expanding network of business relationships,” said Daniel M. Early, P.E., president of Modular Water Systems (www.modularwater.com). “Their local repute and capabilities combined with OriginClear’s MWS treatment systems will create a dynamic relationship that should capture a tremendous market share of work in the greater Austin region and beyond.” A recent video illustrated the speed and ease of installation at a Mobile Home Park location: https://youtu.be/Mr4wZojKJ2g?si=TPhSOLMhk5xBxGcf “We’re very excited that Enviromaintenance has agreed to be our first pilot partner in exploiting these standardized systems,” added Early. “Our recent EVT 5K-IFAS system approval by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) represents a watershed event. This regulatory approval precedent will now allow Modular Water Systems to dramatically increase its treatment systems footprint in central Texas.” The Partners acknowledged that the MOU is non-binding and no contractual relationship has been created but agree to work together towards a definitive agreement in the true spirit of partnership. About OriginClear Inc. Challenging the government monopoly on water treatment, local businesses are demanding the ability to treat and recycle their water. To serve the pent-up demand, OriginClear® has now developed a world-class combination: Water On Demand is a fintech open to Main Street investors, Progressive Water Treatment is the “can-do” engineering company, and Modular Water Systems™ builds proprietary, drop-in-place systems.

Held annually, this unique relay race runs from the city of Baker, California, known as the gateway to Death Valley National Park, to Las Vegas, Nevada. 2024 marks the 39th edition of the race. The largest law enforcement event of its kind in the world, Baker to Vegas draws more than 9,000 participants, staff, and spectators each year. “In 2024, Verizon Frontline has once again stepped up to keep law enforcement officers from around the globe safe at the Baker to Vegas Challenge Cup Relay,” said Rick Santos, race coordinator for Baker to Vegas. “Without Verizon Frontline’s continued support, we could not safely put on this great event. I would like to thank Verizon Frontline for their continued support of law enforcement officers throughout the world.” To support first responders across the 120-mile race route, including the medical teams tasked with constantly evaluating runners and providing aid when needed, the team delivered five Satellite Picocells on Trailers (SPOTs), two rapid response connectivity units (RRCUs), cellular and wi-fi capabilities, and many other Verizon Frontline solutions. SPOTs are rapidly deployable and help provide critical voice and data service in remote areas where connectivity can be challenging, including the challenging terrain of some areas of California and Nevada. Establishing these capabilities allowed the medical teams and race organizers to maintain critical communications with the race command post in Las Vegas, giving race officials and first responders the situational awareness needed to keep all participants safe over the nearly 24-hour length of the race. “The Baker to Vegas Challenge Cup Relay is something we look forward to every year,” said Curtis Mentz, an associate director with the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team. “Supporting our first responders and public safety professionals is our mission and passion, so being here and building those relationships with the runners, support teams and race officials is critical to us.” The Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team provides on-demand, emergency assistance during crisis situations to government agencies and emergency responders on a 24/7 basis.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/26/2024 - 12:45 PM The cobas Malaria test is the first FDA-approved molecular test to screen U.S. blood donors for malariaMalaria is a serious and potentially fatal parasitic infection most commonly transmitted by mosquitoes that can also be spread through blood transfusionRoche is dedicated to saving patients’ lives through diagnostic solutions that aid in the protection of the global blood supply from infectious diseases Basel, 26 March 2024 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the cobas® Malaria test for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 Systems. This approved test can aid healthcare professionals in reducing potential risks of patient infection from transfused blood products. The cobas Malaria test provides a highly sensitive and specific solution to help ensure that infected blood units are removed from the blood supply. The cobas Malaria molecular test screens whole blood samples for the five main species of Plasmodium parasites that are known to cause human infection. The potential value of a molecular donor screening test for malaria is to improve both blood safety and availability. The test is intended for use in screening blood, organ and tissue donors. “As the first FDA-approved blood screening test for malaria, this represents an important step forward in safeguarding the global supply of donated blood,"" said Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics. “The approval of cobas Malaria represents a significant advancement in malaria detection, offering healthcare professionals a reliable tool for donor screening and improving the safety of patients worldwide.” Globally, a large number of possible donors are excluded from giving blood because of travel to or from residences in malaria-endemic areas. Existing microscopy and serological tests are not sensitive enough to reliably mitigate malaria transfusion risk. The Roche Blood Safety Solutions offering provides the most comprehensive molecular, serological testing and automation options for donor screening in the US market. In 2022, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. While sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden, the WHO regions of Southeast Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Western Pacific, and the Americas also report significant numbers of cases and deaths. There were an estimated 249 million cases of malaria in 2022, and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608,000. In 2022, the African Region was home to 94% and 95% of malaria cases and deaths, respectively. 2 The test will be available in the United States at the end of Q2 2024. Approval in CE-marked countries is anticipated later this year. About the cobas Malaria testThe cobas Malaria test, a qualitative in vitro nucleic acid screening test, allows for direct detection of Plasmodium RNA and DNA in whole blood samples from individual human donors. The test, which can be performed with other routine blood donor screening tests, is designed for use on the cobas 6800/8800 Systems in the U.S. The test is not intended for use to diagnose Plasmodium infection, for use on cord blood samples or for use on cadaveric blood specimens. The test utilises the Roche Whole Blood Collection Tube, which allows for direct draw from the donor and is loaded directly onto the cobas 6800/8800 Systems for increased workflow efficiency. About the cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 SystemsSince 2014, the cobas 6800 and cobas 8800 Systems have established the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully integrated, automated solutions that serve the areas of donor screening, infectious disease, sexual health, transplant, respiratory and antimicrobial stewardship. The current molecular donor screening assay menu includes cobas® MPX, cobas® DPX, cobas® HEV, cobas® WNV, cobas® CHIKV/DENV, cobas® Zika and cobas® Babesia (not all tests are available in the U.S.). About MalariaMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by a parasite that commonly infects a certain type of mosquito which feeds on humans. People who get malaria typically experience high fever, shaking chills and flu-like symptoms. The disease can also be transmitted through blood transfusion, organ transplant or the shared use of needles or syringes contaminated with blood.1 Malaria is preventable and curable. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species – Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax – pose the greatest threat.
