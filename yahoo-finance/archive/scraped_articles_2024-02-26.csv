Options on artificial-intelligence darling Nvidia accounted for 25 cents of every dollar of premium - the price of contracts - traded in U.S. single-stock options over the past month, nearly $3 billion in options premium traded in the chipmaker's options every day on average, a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data showed.  During several recent sessions, Nvidia surpassed Tesla as the option market’s most heavily traded name for the day.",
Yahoo Finance,Stock buybacks are rising this earnings season,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-buybacks-are-rising-this-earnings-season-183926828.html,An increase in share buybacks during fourth quarter earnings reports is the latest sign that companies are feeling better about their financial situation despite higher interest rates.,"Stock buybacks are increasing in a sign that companies are feeling better about the trajectory of the US economy.Companies such as Meta (META), Disney (DIS), and Uber (UBER) have all repurchased their own stock this earnings season. The first week of February brought nearly $63 billion in buybacks, per research from Deutsche Bank, marking the largest single-week total of buybacks since May 2023.Deutsche Bank director of global asset allocation and US equity strategy Parag Thatte explained to Yahoo Finance that as earnings rise, buybacks often follow suit. This happens because as earnings improve, companies' free cash flow often increases. Corporates will first spend that money on paying down debt. Then, remaining funds are often utilized for paying dividends, boosting capital expenditures to reinvest in the company, and, potentially, buying back shares.Stock buybacks lower the amount of total shares outstanding to the public, boosting investors' stake in the company and their share of any potential dividends. It's viewed as a positive for investors, but is often the first thing to be cut when times are tough.This means that the return of buybacks can seen as a sign that companies feel they're in a stronger position than the past few quarters when buybacks hit a lull. Uber CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah described the launch of the company's first ever repurchasing plan as a ""vote of confidence in the company’s strong financial momentum."" Disney CEO Bob Iger echoed a similar sentiment when discussing why his company boosted its dividend and announced plans to buy back shares for the first time since 2018.""Our current position of strength, and confidence in our path ahead, already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month ... As we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet, we also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years."" Iger said on the company's earnings call on Feb. 7.Story continuesMeta, for its part, is now planning to offer a quarterly dividend for the first time ever while also authorizing a $50 billion share repurchase program.The buybacks are a noted shift for Meta, Disney, and Uber, which underwent layoffs over the last year and now appear more confident in where their businesses stand to start 2024.While companies are still managing higher borrowing costs and fears of a potential recession, the increase in buybacks indicates companies think their financial positioning is rounding the corner.""They're not yet stating that all is clear and we are maybe completely free of a slowdown,"" Thatte said. ""But at the margin they are saying, 'Yes, we are seeing signs or things turning up.'""The Walt Disney Co. logo appears on a screen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Richard Drew/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)There's another sign of corporate confidence: Deals, another way companies spend their cash flow, have increased to start the year too.With Capital One's (COF) $35 billion offer to buy Discover Financial Services (DFS) leading the way in deal value, dealmaking year to date is up 55% compared to the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods recently told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman that the increase in deals is a ""confidence builder for markets.""""Rates have stabilized and have given companies more confidence to pursue deals,"" Woods said.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index is seen highlighting the bumpy path the central bank faces in achieving its 2% target. That means the data should also validate recent Fedspeak underscoring officials are in no rush to ease policy.“Economic data will return to center stage,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “After hotter-than-expected CPI and PPI readings earlier this month, more people may be looking to the PCE to for insight into the reinflation threat, and how it may influence the Fed’s timing of rate cuts.”Traders will also keep a close eye on how the bond market will manage to absorb heavy Treasury and corporate issuance amid month-end positioning. The US investment-grade bond market is gearing up for robust issuance, following the biggest sales spree in almost two years. Syndicates are forecasting about $35 billion in fresh bond sales this week. That means the February record of $150 billion — set last year — is within reach as companies race to exploit robust investor demand.The S&P 500 hovered near 5,100. Treasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.26%. The dollar fluctuated.Stock markets have room to extend gains beyond record highs if the economic outlook remains upbeat and investors pour money into recent laggards, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists.Story continuesThe S&P 500’s run to an all-time peak has left investor positioning “extremely” concentrated in the so-called Magnificent Seven, the team led by Cecilia Mariotti said. While that does create the risk of a pullback, there’s also “space for bullish sentiment and positioning to be further supported, especially if we start seeing a more meaningful rotation out of cash and into risky assets and laggards within equities,” the strategists wrote.“Now, as a result of the artificial intelligence-induced surge, investors wonder if the market will top out or broaden out,” said Sam Stovall at CFRA. “We think it will broaden out – eventually, but not before investors feel assured that the Fed will not postpone the first rate cut beyond the second quarter of this year.”Meantime, HSBC strategists upgraded their view on global stocks to neutral from underweight, saying their decision to downgrade in January was “wrong” as they failed to predict the rally in artificial-intelligence stocks.Listen to the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify and the Bloomberg Terminal. Read the transcript.“Our message to investors is to continue to focus on the sectors and companies that are seeing growth,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “Tech, healthcare and selected discretionary names are seeing strong earnings growth and that is where we want to focus. This can also be outside the US as well.To Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management, investors looking to boost portfolio diversification have a broad range of opportunities outside of US large-caps.“For example, we have identified high-quality growth stocks in Europe that, in our estimates, offer similar earnings growth prospects as the ‘Magnificent Seven’ in the US, while India is among our most preferred region within emerging markets. We also see value in US small-caps and small- and mid-caps in Europe,” Marcelli noted.A number of forecasters have raised their targets for equity benchmarks due to an optimistic outlook for corporate earnings, but profit margins might actually be peaking, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka write margins are currently elevated by historical standards.Muted corporate demand for software and hardware, along with cost-cutting efforts to protect margins, will set the tone for report cards from Salesforce Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc., Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. this week.Corporate Highlights:Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. posted an increase in operating earnings as higher interest rates and fewer catastrophes benefited the conglomerate’s insurance business.US aluminum producer Alcoa Corp. made a $2.2 billion offer to acquire its Australian joint-venture partner Alumina Ltd. to consolidate ownership of key upstream assets with long-term demand for the metal forecast to rise.Microsoft Corp., under mounting political scrutiny globally for its deep ties to OpenAI, has cut a deal with the startup’s primary competition in Europe.
