Such tightened grip on trading activity risks upending popular strategies used by hedge funds and other institutional investors, and may further alienate foreign funds who have already left the market in droves.The equity rout a few weeks ago was exacerbated by quant funds stampeding to exit position, according to an analysis by Man Group fund manager Ziang Fang, who said in a note this week that the unwinding of these positions was so massive that it spurred small-cap stocks to underperform by a historic margin.Beijing has also started drafting a law to promote the development of the private sector economy.

Bloomberg,"Nvidia Spurs Global Stocks Rally, Japan at Record: Markets Wrap",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asia-mixed-nvidia-lifts-us-230532675.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A rally in global stocks headed to Europe after Nvidia’s blowout sales forecast reinforced investor conviction in a boom in generative AI use.

South Korea equities rose, while Chinese benchmarks climbed. The moves lifted a gauge of Asian shares to its highest level in almost two years.“After some recent consolidation, Nvidia’s earnings beat is just the perfect catalyst for Japanese equities to reach record highs,” said Charu Chanana, strategist at Saxo Capital Markets. “Structural tailwinds from geopolitics to corporate reform, as well as a weak yen, continue to suggest that Japanese equities is a story where macro meets momentum and a peak is still rather far,” she said.Gains in US contracts during Asian hours were spurred on by Nvidia results. The tech company’s shares soared as much as 11% in post-market trade after it said first-quarter revenue would likely hit $24 billion, above prior estimates of around $22 billion.The results were expected to provide a catalyst for global equities, and delivered on the promise. Nvidia’s Asia-based suppliers SK Hynix Inc and Advantest Corp climbed as did a region-wide index of semiconductor companies.“As goes Nvidia, so goes the market,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer of Bokeh Capital Partners LLC. “And it looks like the results are good enough. It does confirm the narrative that AI is going to continue to be strong for the foreseeable future. This narrative supported the markets last year, why wouldn’t it do the same this year?”Story continuesShares in mainland China are heading for their longest stretch of gains since 2020 after the raft of recent measures undertaken by authorities to stabilize the market and prop up investor sentiment.Still, the CSI 300 and Hang Seng Index trailed most Asian peers even as the securities regulator tightened its grip on the market following an order banning major institutional investors from reducing equity holdings at the open and close of each trading day, according to people familiar with the matter.“Things are still not that rosy,” said Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist for Credit Agricole, speaking on Bloomberg Television. “Deflationary pressures are likely to continue for the rest of the year even though it will be less prominent compared to last year.”Asian investors rediscovered their optimism seen toward the end of 2023 as they look set to overcome January’s losses, boosted by recovery in China and gains in Japan. Expectations of improvement in technology earnings led by chipmakers in the region has also added to the appeal of the region’s stocks.The dollar was weaker Thursday as it slipped against Group-of-10 currencies. The yen was largely unchanged at around 150 per dollar. The won pared its gains after comments from Bank of Korea’s Governor Rhee Chang-yong following the central bank’s decision to leave key interest rate unchanged.Treasuries steadied in Asia after selling off Wednesday pushing the 10-year yield five basis points higher. The selling pressure was seen across the curve, and followed a $16 billion sale of 20-year bonds and the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes that revealed caution about cutting rates. Australian and New Zealand bonds were steady.Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin highlighted persistent pricing pressures in sectors such as housing even though headline inflation is falling. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, meanwhile, pushed back against the prospect of imminent cuts.Elsewhere, Qantas Airways Ltd said first-half profit declined as airfares fell from their post-Covid spike as it delivered a A$1.25 billion underlying first-half, pre-tax profit, down from a year earlier, but less than analysts expected. United Overseas Bank Ltd.’s fourth-quarter profit expanded, powered by stronger fee income from wealth and credit cards.Later Thursday economic data set for release includes Eurozone inflation and PMIs, as well as US initial jobless claims and home sales.West Texas Intermediate crude oil added to a 1.1% gain on Wednesday, supported by tightening physical supplies.

China Resources Gas Group purchased a shipment for mid-March delivery, the traders said.The interest in additional supplies from China — the world’s biggest LNG importer — is emerging after a drop in spot prices made the fuel more cost competitive with local gas options and oil products, the traders said.Still, Chinese LNG spot demand remains subdued, especially when compared to a flurry of buying last month ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, traders added. Asian LNG prices are expected to continue sliding as ample supply outstrips the spot purchases, especially as the peak winter demand season ends.Chinese LNG imports are recovering from a slump in 2022, when virus restrictions and high prices dashed demand for the super-chilled fuel.

Reuters,GRAPHIC: Nvidia’s growing sway over U.S. stock market,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/graphic-nvidia-growing-sway-over-060625561.html,"No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp, leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.  The semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.  Given the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.","By Lewis Krauskopf and Noel RandewichNEW YORK (Reuters) - No single stock has embodied the U.S. market’s artificial intelligence fervor as much as Nvidia Corp, leaving Wall Street tied to the fluctuations of its volatile shares.The semiconductor company, whose chips are considered the gold standard in the AI industry, forecast fiscal first-quarter revenue above estimates after the market closed on Wednesday in one of the most highly anticipated earnings releases in recent memory.Given the company’s status as a bellwether of the AI industry and its heavy weighting in U.S. indexes, the way investors react to its earnings report in coming days could offer a glimpse of whether risk appetite continues to thrive in a stock market that has cruised to record highs despite climbing Treasury yields and fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in coming months.“The response to the numbers could be seen as a referendum on the market itself,” said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at GraniteShares, which manages exchange traded funds tied to Nvidia’s performance. “If Nvidia beats expectations and the stock still falls, that will tell us that people are anxious.”Nvidia shares tripled in 2023 and are up nearly 40% this year on growing excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence. That’s made it a standout performer among the so-called Magnificent Seven group of growth and technology stocks that have been the market’s key drivers over the past year.Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion mark for market capitalization in the middle of last year. Earlier this month, it passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third-largest U.S. company by market value, although its recent pullback put the company back in fifth.The company's heftier market value has given it significant sway in key indexes, including the S&P 500. As of Tuesday's close, Nvidia's soaring shares have accounted for more than a quarter of the 4% gain in the index, which hit a record high earlier this month.Story continuesNvidia's rise comes as the company has put up big increases in revenue and profit amid an artificial intelligence boom that has fueled demand for its chips. Revenue more than doubled to over $60 billion in its latest fiscal year, while net income soared to nearly $30 billion.Rapid increases in analysts' earnings estimates means its forward earnings valuation has fallen even as its share price has exploded higher.The company traded at 31 times forward earnings ahead of Wednesday's report, compared to 47 times earnings a year ago, LSEG data showed.Nvidia options late Wednesday were pricing a swing of about 10% in either direction in the two trading days following its results, according to data from options analytics service Trade Alert. A 10% move in Nvidia's nearly $1.7 trillion in market value would be roughly equivalent to the current market cap of Qualcomm or Comcast.Nvidia's shares soared 14% and 24% in the day following its quarterly reports in February and May last year, but the stock's reaction has been more tepid in recent quarters.Options wagers on where Nvidia shares could go in the next few days ran the gamut, with some traders targeting a drop below $500 by the end of this week while others are betting on a move to $1,300 by Friday, a near double. Nvidia’s shares closed at $674.72 on Wednesday.While Nvidia has been the poster child for AI, it has not been the only stock to benefit from excitement over the technology. Shares of companies such as Super Micro Computer and Arm Holdings have jumped in recent weeks, although both stocks have pulled back recently.Even beyond the semiconductor and technology fields, companies across industries have playing up their exposure to AI. Artificial intelligence has been mentioned on 38% of S&P 500 quarterly conference calls in January and February, a slightly higher percentage than during the June quarter, when AI took hold as a prominent industry and market theme.(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Noel Randewich; additional reporting by Suzanne McGee and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Stephen Coates)"

It turns out he didn't need anywhere near all that time: He wrapped up his sell-off of exactly 50 million shares in just nine trading days this month, securities filings show.At the end of December, Bezos owned 988 million shares, or just under 10% of Amazon, according to the company's proxy statement. At today's share price, that stake is worth more than $165 billion.Bezos still has about 938 million shares in Amazon after his sell-off.Bezos' net worth is $191 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.His move to Miami could save him $600 million in taxes on the sell-off, as CNBC previously reported. While Washington has a 7% capital gains tax on sales of stocks or bonds worth upwards of $250,000, Florida doesn't have a capital gains tax. For the last 29 years, Bezos has lived in Seattle, where he built Amazon, before he announced in November that he was packing up and heading to Miami.Bezos' last big Amazon selling spree was in 2021, as he prepared to step down as CEO after 27 years.

The benchmark index spent much of the day in losing territory before climbing higher just before markets closed.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also eked out a slight gain after losing ground most of the day. It rose 0.1%, to 38,612.24.The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%, to 15,580.87.Earnings remained the big focus. After markets closed, Nvidia reported earnings and revenue that handily beat Wall Street forecasts. The chipmaker has tripled over the past year thanks to a surge in investor enthusiasm over artificial intelligence.Palo Alto Networks was a big loser and a particularly heavy weight on the tech sector. The network security company sank 28.4% after giving forecasts for future billings that came in well below what analysts were looking for. Rival Fortinet slumped 3.8%.Story continuesAmazon rose 0.9% following an announcement that it would be added to the Dow. Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is leaving the Dow, fell 2.5%Bond yields gained ground. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.33% from 4.28% late Tuesday.Technology stocks drove much of the market's rally that brought it to record highs just last week. The sector is also showing some of the strongest earnings growth. Lopsided contributions from some of the bigger companies in the sector, however, have raised questions about whether the gains were overdone.Several other companies made big moves following the release of their financial results. Electronic measurement technology company Keysight Technologies fell 6.7% after its profit forecast fell short of analysts’ expectations. Garmin, which makes personal navigation devices, jumped 8.8% after beating earnings forecasts.Toll Brothers rose 3.9% after giving investors an encouraging financial update as it sees strong demand. That helped support gains throughout the homebuilding sector.Energy companies gained ground as natural gas prices jumped 12.5%. Exxon Mobil rose 2%.The Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting in January that showed most officials are worried about moving too fast to cut their benchmark interest. The central bank left the rate alone for the fourth time in a row at that meeting. Investors have all but lost hope that the central bank will cut rates at its March meeting and are looking for the first rate cut to come in June.Investors have to wait until next week for another key update on inflation. That’s when the government will release its monthly report on personal consumption and expenses, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation.Separate measures for consumer and wholesale prices in January show that inflation didn't cool as much as anticipated. That prompted investors to shift expectations for rate cuts from March to June. A weak report on retail sales added to the disappointing inflation data and raised concerns that stubborn inflation is inflicting more pain on consumers.In other trading Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 8 cents to $77.99 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 6 cents to $83.09 per barrel.The U.S. dollar was trading at 150.32 Japanese yen, up from 150.04 yen. The euro was at $1.0827, nearly unchanged."
