(JAGX) provides an update on its Nasdaq listing status, facing potential delisting due to low stock prices. The company has requested a hearing, and the stock will continue trading pending the appeal decision. Jaguar is working on data analysis for its Phase 3 OnTarget trial of crofelemer for cancer therapy-related diarrhea prevention. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company faces potential delisting from a major stock exchange like Nasdaq, it's a significant red flag for investors and stakeholders. The minimum bid price requirement serves as a benchmark for investor confidence and the financial stability of a company. Jaguar Health's stock price falling below this threshold indicates a potential lack of market confidence in the company's value and growth prospects.In the short term, the appeal hearing provides a lifeline for Jaguar to maintain its listing, which can prevent further erosion of investor confidence. However, the consistent low bid price and the threat of delisting could deter new investments and lead to increased volatility in the stock price. Long-term implications include the need for Jaguar to implement a robust strategy to boost investor confidence, possibly through reverse stock splits, operational restructuring, or strategic partnerships. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical sector is highly competitive, with stringent regulatory requirements. Jaguar Health's focus on a plant-based prescription drug for cancer therapy-related diarrhea represents a niche market with potential for growth, given the increasing interest in plant-based therapies. However, the company's financial health, as indicated by its stock performance, suggests market skepticism about its capacity to capitalize on this niche.Successful Phase 3 trial results could be a catalyst for stock price recovery and could help Jaguar regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing standards. However, the market will likely remain cautious until tangible outcomes, such as FDA approval and market adoption, are realized. The company's ability to communicate the value and efficacy of crofelemer to investors and the broader market is crucial during this period. Medical Research Analyst The preventative treatment of cancer therapy-related diarrhea is an area of unmet medical need. If crofelemer proves effective, it could improve the quality of life for patients undergoing cancer treatment and reduce the healthcare costs associated with managing side effects. The data from the pivotal Phase 3 OnTarget trial will be critical in determining the drug's efficacy and safety profile.Investors will be keenly interested in the outcomes of this trial, as positive results could significantly impact Jaguar's valuation and its ability to secure a stable position in the market. However, the path to FDA approval is rigorous and uncertain and Jaguar's financial challenges may impact its ability to sustain the drug's development through to commercialization. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Jaguar Health, Inc.

(CEI) announces ESG Clean Energy, LLC's test results showing over 90% efficiency in water removal system, a significant success for carbon capture. ESG's patented system surpasses industry standards, offering a cost-effective solution. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The recent test results from ESG Clean Energy, LLC indicating a >90% water removal rate in their patented system is a significant achievement that exceeds industry expectations, which typically regard an 80% efficiency rate as successful. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize carbon capture technology, particularly in power generation, by offering a more cost-effective and energy-efficient solution. The implications for Camber Energy, Inc. could be substantial, as increased efficiency in carbon capture can lead to operational cost savings, improved regulatory compliance and enhanced market competitiveness.From an energy sector perspective, this technology could set a new standard for environmental performance, potentially leading to increased adoption rates among power producers. The long-term impact on Camber's business model could include diversification of revenue streams and strengthening of its position in the clean energy market. However, it's crucial to monitor the scalability of this technology and regulatory responses, which could influence the pace at which it is adopted. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Analyst The high water removal efficiency reported by ESG Clean Energy resonates strongly with the growing focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria among investors. Companies that demonstrate technological advancements in reducing environmental impact are increasingly favored by the market. This development could enhance Camber Energy's ESG ratings, potentially attracting ESG-focused investments and improving its standing among socially responsible investors.Moreover, the ability to capture carbon more efficiently is directly aligned with global efforts to combat climate change and could provide Camber with strategic leverage in negotiations with partners and stakeholders interested in sustainable practices. It is essential, however, to evaluate the long-term reliability and environmental benefits of the system beyond initial tests to truly assess its contribution to ESG goals. Financial Analyst The announcement by ESG Clean Energy of their system's performance significantly surpassing modeled forecasts could have positive implications for Camber Energy's financial outlook. An increase in efficiency from the expected 80% to over 90% suggests potential for reduced operational costs and increased profit margins, given that the cost of water removal is a critical factor in carbon capture operations. This could lead to upward revisions in earnings forecasts and potentially bolster investor confidence in Camber's stock.Investors should, however, remain cautious until the technology is commercially proven and its impact on Camber's bottom line can be quantified. The capital expenditure required to implement this technology and the timeframe for return on investment are critical factors that will influence the financial implications of this announcement. Additionally, market response to this technological advancement will also play a role in determining its effect on the company's stock performance. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM Modeled Forecasts Regard ∼ 80% Efficiency a SuccessESG's Test Results Show > 90% Efficiency!HOUSTON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Camber Energy, Inc.

The submarine will enhance national security with its versatile missions and increased firepower.","HII Launches Virginia-class Submarine Massachusetts (SSN 798) at Newport News Shipbuilding Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary HII (NYSE: HII) launched the Virginia-class submarine Massachusetts (SSN 798) at Newport News Shipbuilding, showcasing advanced technologies and capabilities. The submarine will enhance national security with its versatile missions and increased firepower. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The launch of the Virginia-class submarine Massachusetts (SSN 798) signifies a crucial step in the enhancement of the U.S. Navy's operational capabilities. The Virginia-class submarines are known for their advanced technology, which includes increased firepower, maneuverability and stealth. These improvements are designed to ensure that the U.S. maintains its strategic advantage in naval warfare, particularly as older Los Angeles-class submarines are phased out.The delivery of the 25th Virginia-class submarine also reflects the ongoing commitment of the defense industry to meet the demands of national security. As one of the two shipyards with the capacity to construct nuclear-powered submarines, Newport News Shipbuilding's role in this sector is significant. The successful launch and eventual commissioning of the SSN 798 could potentially lead to further government contracts, which would benefit HII's long-term revenue streams and stock market performance. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the launch of a new Virginia-class submarine is an indicator of HII's strong positioning within the defense sector. Investors often look for such milestones as they can be indicative of a company's ability to fulfill large-scale government contracts. Given that defense contracts are typically long-term and high-value, the successful launch may reassure investors of HII's execution capabilities and its prospects for future contract awards.Moreover, the defense sector is known for its stability due to consistent government spending, which can be appealing during times of economic uncertainty. The progress in the Virginia-class submarine program could, therefore, have a positive impact on HII's stock as it underscores the company's reliability as a defense contractor and its contribution to national security priorities. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications, the launch of Massachusetts (SSN 798) is likely to have a favorable impact on HII's financial health. The construction and delivery of nuclear-powered submarines involve complex budgeting and significant capital outlay. As such, reaching construction milestones enables the company to bill the U.S. Navy for work completed, positively affecting cash flow and earnings.Additionally, the defense industry operates under the oversight of the government, which includes scheduled payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. This launch event may, therefore, correspond with a tranche of revenue recognition for HII, improving its financial metrics for the current fiscal period. Investors and analysts will closely monitor the company's upcoming financial disclosures to gauge the exact impact of this event on its profitability and working capital. 02/23/2024 - 02:15 PM NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII (NYSE: HII) announced today that Virginia-class submarine Massachusetts (SSN 798) was recently launched into the James River at the company’s Newport News Shipbuilding (NNS) division. Shipbuilders transferred the submarine from a construction facility to the floating dry dock, where it was later submerged and moved by tugboats to a submarine pier at the shipyard for final outfitting, testing and crew certification. “Following the christening of this mighty submarine in May, witnessing Massachusetts launch into the river is a source of immense pride for our shipbuilding team,” said Jason Ward, NNS vice president of Virginia-class submarine construction. “We understand the importance of Massachusetts, and we will continue to execute with purpose to bring this important national security asset to life and deliver it to the Navy.” Virginia-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarines are built for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions to replace the Navy’s Los Angeles-class submarines as they are retired. Virginia-class submarines incorporate dozens of new technologies and innovations that increase firepower, maneuverability and stealth to significantly enhance their warfighting capabilities. These submarines are capable of supporting multiple mission areas and can operate at speeds of more than 25 knots.

Positive Intel's proactive investments accounted for 94% of vulnerability disclosures in 2023, the highest level in five years. Intel achieved a combined 39% reduction in hardware and firmware vulnerabilities in 2023 compared with 2022. The report found that AMD reported three times more platform firmware vulnerabilities than Intel in 2023. ABI Research ranks Intel as the silicon leader in product security assurance, validating its leadership in security practices. Intel's transparent and proactive approach to security is crucial for maintaining high standards in quality and security assurance. Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst Intel's commitment to proactively addressing vulnerabilities is a significant step in mitigating cyber risks. The 94% figure of vulnerability disclosures stemming from proactive investments suggests a robust security protocol that could become an industry benchmark. The substantial decrease in hardware and firmware vulnerabilities by 39% signifies a successful implementation of their security assurance practices. It is critical, however, to analyze the 208% increase in software vulnerabilities. This could indicate a shift in threat vectors or an expansion in scope of Intel's software ecosystem. The comparison with AMD's reported vulnerabilities highlights the competitive landscape in cybersecurity practices within the semiconductor industry. Stakeholders should consider how these security measures can potentially reduce costs related to cyber incidents and enhance customer trust, thus impacting Intel's market position positively. Market Research Analyst The data from Intel's Product Security Report potentially reflects on the company's brand reputation and customer loyalty. Security is a top priority for consumers and businesses alike and Intel's proactive approach could influence purchasing decisions. The mention of Intel outperforming AMD in terms of fewer vulnerabilities could affect market perception and investor confidence. However, it is important to monitor the long-term effectiveness of these security measures and whether they translate into sustained market advantage. The rise in software vulnerabilities could be a concern and it is essential to evaluate how Intel plans to address this increase. The overall positive assessment by ABI Research positions Intel favorably among its peers, which could lead to increased stakeholder interest and investment. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Intel's proactive security investments are likely to have a dual impact. Initially, there may be increased costs associated with the implementation of these security measures. However, the long-term benefits could include reduced expenses from potential breaches and maintaining a competitive edge in the market. The report's findings may reassure investors of Intel's commitment to product security, potentially influencing the company's stock performance. The comparison with AMD provides valuable context for investors, as it showcases Intel's relative strength in an important operational area. The financial implications of the increased software vulnerabilities need careful assessment, as it could suggest necessary future investments in software security. 02/23/2024 - 01:00 PM Security is more important than ever as attacks grow in sophistication and system security becomes more dependent on solid hardware and software foundations. SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- What’s New: Today, Intel released the results of its 2023 Product Security Report. Intel’s industry-leading and transparent product security assurance practices improve product defenses. Proactive investments accounted for 94% of its vulnerability disclosures in 2023, the highest in five years. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240223917900/en/Intel's 2023 Product Security Report found that proactive investments accounted for 94% of the company's vulnerability disclosures in 2023, the highest level in five years. (Credit: Intel Corporation) “Intel believes a transparent approach to security is the only way to truly empower customers while delivering product innovations that build defenses at the foundation. Protecting workloads while accelerating software resilience is key to pushing the boundaries around how we define what is and what is not secure. Working with our customers and industry partners through key security assurance practices enables us to achieve the levels of secure performance people expect and deliver technology they trust.” – Greg Lavender, Intel executive vice president, chief technology officer and general manager of the Software and Advanced Technology Group Why It Matters: In the past year, Intel addressed 353 vulnerabilities, while a record 256 researchers engaged in its Bug Bounty program (up from 181 in 2022), including an elite community of ethical hackers through Project Circuit Breaker. Companies, like Intel, who have prioritized these initiatives for years remain at the forefront of security and innovation. Their efforts combat modern cyberthreats for the betterment of the entire ecosystem and provide the first line of defense for customers. They also produce tangible security benefits; the report found that AMD reported three times more platform firmware vulnerabilities than Intel in 2023. What the Report Says: Key findings from the report, which is in its fifth year, include: Intel achieved a combined 39% reduction in hardware and firmware vulnerabilities in 2023 compared with 2022. Compared with 2022, there was a decrease in firmware vulnerabilities (38% fewer), a decrease in hardware vulnerabilities (47% fewer) and an increase in software vulnerabilities (208% more), which is attributed to the growth of Intel’s Bug Bounty and security researcher engagement programs. Of the 353 vulnerabilities that were addressed in 2023, 256 were in software. In 2023, 89% of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) reported by external sources qualified for a bounty and a record 256 researchers engaged in Intel Bug Bounty programs. In 2023, AMD had more than 3.5 times as many vulnerabilities in its Chain of Trust/Secure Boot firmware components and features than Intel. A recent white paper from ABI Research1 ranks Intel as the silicon leader in product security assurance, offering a comparative assessment of the practices of top technology vendors including AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm and Arm. This validates Intel’s leadership in delivering a product portfolio with world-class security assurance built in. The research found that 89% of respondents reported security issues or breaches related to a product they've used, and 40% ranked a secure development life cycle as a highest priority when considering security assurance. Intel’s posture of transparency and proactivity is more important than ever to maintain the highest standard for quality and security assurance. About Intel’s Role: If hardware isn’t secure, then a system can’t be either – and technology vendors have an essential role to play. Intel’s ongoing prioritization of the advancement of security assurance, robust incident response, community advocacy and research help provide unique value to its many customers and partners. It is this protection at multiple levels and across workloads that defends against ever-evolving adversaries. Intel’s long-standing commitment to security, both within the company and across the entire technology ecosystem, has never been stronger.

The reinvestment of proceeds into the company's core technologies, such as the Ubiquitor and SEC financial reporting automation software, demonstrates a clear focus on their technology offerings and a commitment to innovation in the IoT and 5G sectors.By liquidating a non-core asset, Focus Universal is effectively reallocating resources to areas with potentially higher growth prospects. This could be a positive signal to investors, indicating that the company is adapting to market trends and investing in areas that could drive future revenue growth. The emphasis on the Ubiquitor's multi-functionality and efficiency in IoT applications, along with the commercialization of Data Entry Automation software, highlights the company's potential to streamline operations and reduce costs for clients, which may improve competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving IoT market. Financial Analyst The capital gain of $2.6 million from the warehouse sale represents a significant return on the original investment of $4.5 million in 2018. This financial result enhances the company's balance sheet by providing additional liquidity that can be used for strategic initiatives. Investors should consider the impact of this liquidity on the company's ability to fund research and development, marketing efforts and potentially expedite the commercialization process of their products.Furthermore, the decision to invest in the development of their Ubiquitor product and SEC financial reporting automation software could have implications for the company's efficiency and regulatory compliance. The automation software, in particular, could lead to a reduction in administrative costs and an improvement in accuracy, which are critical factors for companies in the public domain. This could also serve as a differentiator that sets Focus Universal apart from competitors, potentially leading to an increase in market share and, consequently, shareholder value. Technology Industry Analyst The IoT and 5G sectors are experiencing rapid growth, driven by the increasing demand for connectivity and smart technology integration. Focus Universal's Ubiquitor product, with its ability to control multiple sensors or actuators, positions the company to take advantage of this trend by offering a versatile solution that could reduce costs and complexity for users. This could lead to increased adoption rates and market penetration.Additionally, the Data Entry Automation software for SEC financial reporting could represent a significant advancement for Focus Universal, as it addresses a common pain point for many businesses: the time-consuming task of regulatory compliance reporting. By automating this process, Focus Universal is not only improving its own operational efficiency but also potentially creating a new revenue stream by offering this technology to other companies. As such, this development could be of interest to stakeholders within the technology and financial sectors, who may see it as an indicator of the company's potential for innovation and growth. 02/23/2024 - 09:35 AM ONTARIO, CA and LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Focus Universal Inc.

The approval sets the timeline for personal use by April 1, 2024, with social clubs operating by July 1st. The government plans to draft laws for commercial supply chains and cannabis specialty stores. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The approval of recreational cannabis use in Germany represents a significant shift in the European cannabis market landscape. As one of the largest economies in Europe, Germany's decision to legalize cannabis for adult use could serve as a catalyst for broader acceptance and potential legalization in other neighboring countries. This development could lead to increased demand for cannabis products, influencing global production and supply chains.From a market research perspective, this regulatory change opens up a new consumer market, which could significantly boost sales for companies like High Tide Inc. that operate within the cannabis industry. The establishment of a legal market in Germany might also attract new investments and partnerships, potentially leading to an increase in market capitalization for companies poised to enter or expand within the German market.Furthermore, the 'social clubs' model, which is distinct from the more common dispensary model seen in North America, may require a tailored approach to branding and consumer engagement. Companies will need to understand the cultural nuances and consumer behavior in Germany to effectively capitalize on this new opportunity. Legal Expert The legislative progress in Germany is not only a cultural milestone but also a complex legal undertaking that will have implications for international trade agreements and domestic law. The introduction of 'pillar 2' of the legalization plan suggests a careful, phased approach to legalizing commercial supply chains and for-profit cannabis stores.This phased approach may provide a framework for other nations considering legalization, potentially influencing international drug policy. Companies like High Tide Inc. will need to navigate the new regulatory environment, which will involve compliance with both German laws and any applicable international treaties.Legal experts will be closely monitoring the drafting and implementation of the new laws to ensure that businesses can operate within the legal parameters while maximizing their growth potential. The legal landscape will also affect intellectual property considerations, as branding and trademarks in the cannabis sector become increasingly important in a competitive market. Financial Analyst The legalization of cannabis in Germany could significantly impact the financial projections for companies operating in the cannabis space. As the market opens, early movers like High Tide Inc. could experience a considerable uptick in revenue. This could translate into stronger financial performance, potentially improving their stock valuations.Investors will be keenly observing how High Tide Inc. positions itself to take advantage of this new market. Strategic partnerships, supply chain readiness and market entry strategies will be critical factors in determining the company's ability to leverage this opportunity. The potential increase in competition as the market matures may put pressure on margins, making operational efficiency and brand strength key determinants of long-term success.It's also important to consider the potential risks associated with regulatory changes. While the current outlook seems favorable, any delays or restrictions in the implementation of the legalization plan could affect expected financial outcomes for companies like High Tide Inc. 02/23/2024 - 09:55 AM CALGARY, AB, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - High Tide Inc.

The split will not change the authorized shares, and fractional shares will be rounded up. The reverse split affects outstanding warrants, stock options, and restricted stock units, with adjustments made proportionately. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is often a strategy employed by companies to bolster their stock price, particularly to meet listing requirements such as Nasdaq's Minimum Bid Price Rule. In the case of Auddia Inc., the 1-for-25 reverse stock split aims to consolidate shares and elevate the stock price above the $1.00 threshold. This is a significant ratio, indicating the company is taking assertive action to address its stock price. Investors should note that while the reverse split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, it can affect investor perception and potentially improve the stock's marketability.Moreover, the adjustment of the exercise prices of warrants and stock options, as well as the proportional change in the number of shares these securities represent, is a standard procedure in reverse splits. This ensures that the intrinsic value of these derivatives remains unchanged post-split. However, investors should be aware that such corporate actions can sometimes lead to short-term volatility as the market adjusts to the new share structure. In the long term, the success of the reverse split in achieving its intended effects will largely depend on the company's operational performance and its ability to sustain a higher stock price. Market Research Analyst The reverse stock split by Auddia Inc. is indicative of a company striving to maintain compliance with Nasdaq's listing standards. From a market research perspective, the reduction in shares from approximately 20.47 million to 818,000 will result in a more exclusive stock, which can sometimes appeal to certain institutional investors. However, it is critical to observe market reaction once the split-adjusted trading commences as it will provide insights into investor confidence in Auddia's future prospects.While the reverse stock split does not directly impact the company's fundamental value, it is often perceived as a signal of potential issues, such as a lack of positive growth catalysts. Therefore, it's important to monitor the company's subsequent operational announcements and performance metrics closely. If Auddia can demonstrate improved financial health and growth prospects following the reverse split, it may regain investor confidence and stabilize its position on the exchange. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the reverse stock split process involves amending the company's Certificate of Incorporation, which requires shareholder approval and a filing with the Secretary of State in Delaware. The legal formalities, including the issuance of a new CUSIP number, are standard procedures to ensure regulatory compliance and proper tracking of the new share structure. It is important for shareholders to follow the instructions provided by the transfer agent to exchange their shares to avoid any discrepancies in their holdings.Additionally, the rounding up of fractional shares to the nearest whole share is a shareholder-friendly move, as it avoids the need to cash out small shareholders and instead gives them a stake, albeit small, in the post-split company. This action can be seen as a measure to maintain good shareholder relations during the transition period. However, shareholders with less than 25 shares will be significantly affected, as their ownership percentage will be drastically reduced. This aspect of the reverse split could have implications for shareholder sentiment and should be considered when evaluating the company's post-split performance. 02/23/2024 - 11:45 AM BOULDER, CO, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Auddia Inc., (“Auddia” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: AUUD, AUUDW), a proprietary AI platform for audio identification and classification and related technologies, that is reinventing how consumers engage with AM/FM radio, podcasts, and other audio content, today announced that effective before market open on Tuesday February 27, 2024, it will complete a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of its common stock. On December 29, 2023, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to affect a reverse stock split with the exact ratio to be set by its Board of Directors. The Board resolved to set the reverse stock split at the ratio of 1-for-25. The Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State in Delaware effective February 26, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. As a result, every twenty five (25) issued shares of common stock will automatically be combined into one share of common stock. The Company believes that affecting the reverse stock split will assist in its efforts to meet the Nasdaq continued listing standards and to continue to have its common stock remain listed and traded on Nasdaq. In particular, the Company expects the reverse stock split to increase the per share price and bid price of its common stock above the $1.00 required by Nasdaq’s Minimum Bid Price Rule. Shares of the Company’s common stock will be assigned a new CUSIP number (05072K 206) and are expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on Tuesday, February 27, 2024. The reverse stock split will not change the authorized number of shares of the Company’s common stock. No fractional shares will be issued and any fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. Therefore, stockholders with less than 25 shares will receive one share of stock. The reverse stock split will apply to the Company’s outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units. The number of shares of common stock into which these outstanding securities are convertible or exercisable will be adjusted proportionately as a result of the reverse stock split. The exercise prices of any outstanding warrants or stock options will also be proportionately adjusted in accordance with the terms of those securities and the Company’s equity incentive plans. Once the reverse stock split becomes effective, stockholders holding shares through a brokerage account will have their shares automatically adjusted to reflect the 1-for-25 reverse stock split. Existing stockholders holding common stock certificates will receive a letter of transmittal from Auddia’s transfer agent, Vstock Transfer, with specific instructions regarding the exchange of shares. The Company expects to have its issued and outstanding common shares decrease from approximately 20.47 million pre-split shares to approximately 818,000 post-split shares outstanding as a result of the reverse stock split.

Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from the MANDARA Phase III trial for FASENRA (benralizumab) signify a notable advancement in the treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA), a rare autoimmune disease. The trial's results, which indicate that FASENRA can enable patients to taper off oral corticosteroids while maintaining remission, have profound implications for patient quality of life and healthcare costs. Corticosteroids, while effective, are associated with severe side effects and the ability to reduce their use without compromising disease control is a significant benefit. The data suggests that benralizumab could become a preferred treatment option, potentially impacting the market share of current treatments like mepolizumab.From a research perspective, the trial is groundbreaking as it is the first head-to-head comparison of biologic therapies in EGPA. The reported non-inferiority to mepolizumab and the high rate of remission achieved by benralizumab-treated patients (59%) underscore the efficacy of eosinophil-targeting biologic therapies in managing this condition. Furthermore, the reduction in blood eosinophil counts and the well-tolerated profile of benralizumab align with the drug's known mechanism of action, which involves the depletion of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell implicated in the pathophysiology of EGPA. Financial Analyst The data presented from the MANDARA trial could have a significant impact on AstraZeneca's financial performance, considering the potential for FASENRA to capture a larger segment of the market for EGPA treatment. The trial's positive outcome positions FASENRA favorably against mepolizumab, the only other approved treatment for EGPA, which could lead to increased market penetration and revenue growth for AstraZeneca. The ability to administer FASENRA as a single monthly subcutaneous injection offers a convenience factor that could be appealing to both patients and healthcare providers, potentially increasing adoption rates.Furthermore, the safety profile and efficacy in reducing the need for oral corticosteroids may lead to cost savings for healthcare systems and payers, as the reduction in long-term steroid use could decrease the incidence of steroid-related adverse effects and subsequent medical costs. As AstraZeneca seeks regulatory approval for benralizumab in EGPA, investors should monitor the company's progress, as approval could lead to an uptick in the company's stock value, driven by the expansion of FASENRA's label and its potential market growth. Health Economist EGPA is a rare disease with a relatively small patient population, yet the economic burden is considerable due to the chronic nature of the disease and the high costs associated with long-term corticosteroid use and its complications. The introduction of a treatment like FASENRA, which can reduce reliance on corticosteroids, has the potential to alleviate some of this economic burden. By improving the management of EGPA and reducing the frequency of relapses, healthcare systems may see a decrease in hospital admissions and a reduction in the need for additional treatments for steroid-induced side effects.It is also important to consider the broader economic implications of improved disease management. Patients who achieve remission and can taper off corticosteroids are likely to experience an overall improvement in health-related quality of life, which can translate into increased productivity and reduced absenteeism from work. These factors contribute to the societal value of effective treatments like FASENRA and should be taken into account when assessing the drug's economic impact. 02/23/2024 - 01:23 PM FASENRA enabled patients to taper off oral corticosteroids while preventing relapses WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Positive results from the MANDARA Phase III trial for FASENRA® (benralizumab) in patients with EGPA were published in the New England Journal of Medicine today,1 as the first head-to-head trial of biologics in patients with EGPA,2 and the first to demonstrate that more than half of patients achieved remission with eosinophil-targeting biologic therapies.1 These findings were also presented today as a late-breaking poster at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) Annual Meeting in Washington, DC, February 23-26.3 MANDARA compared benralizumab to mepolizumab in patients with EGPA receiving oral corticosteroids (OCS) with or without stable immunosuppressive therapy.2 Patients were randomized to receive either a single 30 mg subcutaneous injection of benralizumab, or three separate 100 mg subcutaneous injections of mepolizumab, once every four weeks.2 Full results showed that benralizumab met the primary endpoint of the trial and demonstrated non-inferior rates of remission compared to mepolizumab.1 The primary endpoint of adjusted rate of remission was 59% for benralizumab-treated patients at weeks 36 and 48, compared with 56% for mepolizumab (difference in rates: 3%; 95% CI:, –13,18).1 Remission in EGPA is defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)=0 and OCS dose less than or equal to 4 mg/day.2 A higher proportion of FASENRA-treated patients were able to fully taper off OCS during weeks 48 through 52 (41% in the benralizumab arm vs. 26% in the comparator arm (difference: 16%; 95% CI: 1,31).1 Additionally, 86% of benralizumab patients vs. 74% in the comparator arm (difference: 12%; 95% CI: −1, 25) had at least a 50% reduction in OCS dose during weeks 48 through 52.1 Dr. Michael Wechsler, Professor of Medicine and Director of The Asthma Institute at National Jewish Health, and International Coordinating Investigator of the MANDARA trial said: “Patients with EGPA typically rely on long-term, high-dose OCS, which can cause serious and lasting side effects, and often suffer recurrent relapses when attempting to taper off their treatment. These findings are an exciting step forward as they affirm that eosinophil-targeting biologic treatments helped more patients achieve remission and taper off of steroid therapy.” Sharon Barr, Executive Vice President, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca said, “The results from this trial are an important step forward for the EGPA community, as this is the first trial to demonstrate that remission from EGPA with an eosinophil-targeting biologic is achievable for the majority of patients. This is a significant advancement and shows that benralizumab helped patients achieve remission and reduce chronic OCS usage, in a convenient, single, monthly subcutaneous injection, and could alleviate some of the impact of this debilitating disease.” Elevated levels of eosinophils play a central role in EGPA disease pathophysiology.4 All patients with EGPA have very high levels of eosinophils at some point in their disease, both in peripheral blood and in affected tissues or organs.5,6 Approximately half of patients with EGPA have concomitant, adult-onset severe eosinophilic asthma, and often have sinus and nasal symptoms.5,7 FASENRA has a unique mode of action that leads to near complete depletion of eosinophils.8,9 Treatment with benralizumab was associated with a greater reduction of blood eosinophil counts from week 1 compared to mepolizumab and maintained at all timepoints.1 At week 1 mean blood eosinophil count ratio to baseline was 0.15 vs. 0.39 respectively (adjusted geometric mean ratio: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.49) and 0.10 vs. 0.26 at week 52 (adjusted geometric mean ratio: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.49).1 Benralizumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals, which is consistent with the known profile of the medicine.1 FASENRA is currently approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for SEA in 80 countries including the US, Japan and in the EU, and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries.10-13 AstraZeneca has been working with regulatory authorities around the world in order to bring benralizumab to EGPA patients as quickly as possible. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS Known hypersensitivity to benralizumab or excipients. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, rash) have occurred after administration of FASENRA. These reactions generally occur within hours of administration, but in some instances have a delayed onset (ie, days). Discontinue in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease FASENRA should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms, acute exacerbations, or acute bronchospasm. Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage Do not discontinue systemic or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with FASENRA. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a physician. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. Parasitic (Helminth) Infection It is unknown if FASENRA will influence a patient’s response against helminth infections. Treat patients with pre-existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with FASENRA. If patients become infected while receiving FASENRA and do not respond to anti-helminth treatment, discontinue FASENRA until infection resolves. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 5%) include headache and pharyngitis. Injection site reactions (eg, pain, erythema, pruritus, papule) occurred at a rate of 2.2% in patients treated with FASENRA compared with 1.9% in patients treated with placebo. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS A pregnancy exposure registry monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to FASENRA during pregnancy. To enroll call 1-877-311-8972 or visit www.mothertobaby.org/fasenra. The data on pregnancy exposure from the clinical trials are insufficient to inform on drug-associated risk. Monoclonal antibodies such as benralizumab are transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy; therefore, potential effects on a fetus are likely to be greater during the third trimester of pregnancy. INDICATION FASENRA is indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype. FASENRA is not indicated for treatment of other eosinophilic conditions FASENRA is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus Please read full Prescribing Information, including Patient Information and Instructions for Use. You may report side effects related to AstraZeneca products. Notes Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome, is a rare, immune-mediated inflammatory disease that is caused by inflammation of small to medium-sized blood vessels.4,5 It is estimated that 118,000 people throughout the world live with EGPA.14 EGPA can result in damage to multiple organs, including lungs, upper airway, skin, heart, gastrointestinal tract and nerves.5 The most common symptoms and signs include extreme fatigue, weight loss, muscle and joint pain, rashes, nerve pain, sinus and nasal symptoms, and shortness of breath.5,6 Without treatment, the disease may be fatal.5,6 Almost half (47%) of patients do not achieve remission with current treatments.15 There are limited treatment options for EGPA. Patients are often treated with chronic high-dose OCS and experience recurrent relapses when attempting to taper off OCS.6,16 Mepolizumab is currently the only approved treatment for EGPA.17 MANDARA MANDARA was a randomized, double blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel group, multicentre 52-week Phase III trial which compared the efficacy and safety of FASENRA to mepolizumab in adult patients with relapsing or refractory EGPA.2 In the blinded trial, 140 patients were randomized 1:1 (70 per treatment group) to receive either a single 30mg subcutaneous injection of FASENRA or three separate 100mg subcutaneous injections of mepolizumab once every four weeks.1 The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were in remission at both weeks 36 and 48.2 Remission is defined as Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS)=0 and OCS dose less than or equal to 4 mg/day.2 FASENRA remission was compared to the historical placebo rate from mepolizumab’s Phase III trial, MIRRA.18 The primary statistical analysis was to demonstrate non-inferiority of FASENRA versus mepolizumab based on the primary endpoint.1 All patients who complete the 52-week double-blind treatment period were eligible to continue into an ongoing open label extension (OLE) period, intended to allow each patient at least one year of treatment with open-label FASENRA.2 Mepolizumab is a humanized IL-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody.3 FASENRA FASENRA is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of blood and tissue eosinophils in most patients via apoptosis (programmed cell death).8,9 FASENRA (benralizumab) is currently approved in more than 80 countries, including the US, EU, Japan, and is approved for self-administration in the US, EU and other countries.10-13 FASENRA has been prescribed to over 120,000 patients globally.19 FASENRA is in development for other diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and hypereosinophilic syndrome.20-22 FASENRA was developed by AstraZeneca and is in-licensed from BioWa, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., Japan.

How did FASENRA help patients with EGPA? FASENRA enabled patients to taper off oral corticosteroids while preventing relapses, with a higher proportion of patients being able to fully taper off OCS during weeks 48 through 52. What is the primary endpoint of the trial? The primary endpoint of the trial was the adjusted rate of remission, with benralizumab-treated patients at weeks 36 and 48 achieving a 59% remission rate compared to 56% for mepolizumab. What is the difference in rates of remission between benralizumab and mepolizumab? The difference in rates of remission was 3% (95% CI: -13, 18) favoring benralizumab. What is the unique mode of action of FASENRA? FASENRA is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to IL-5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of blood and tissue eosinophils in most patients via apoptosis."

The company sees this as a significant step forward in German drug policy, aiming to improve patient care and offer a wider range of treatment options. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent development in Germany's medical cannabis policy is poised to influence the market dynamics significantly. As Germany is one of the largest economies in Europe, any legislative changes regarding medical cannabis can have a ripple effect on the industry. The opening of the German market represents an expansion opportunity for companies like Tilray, which may result in increased revenue streams and a broader consumer base. With the new legislation, we can anticipate a rise in demand for medical cannabis products, which could lead to a surge in sales for producers who are prepared to meet this new demand.Moreover, the localization of production facilities, like Tilray's Neumünster site, aligns with a growing trend of supply chain regionalization, which could lead to reduced logistics costs and improved margins. This strategic positioning within Germany can also serve as a competitive advantage, potentially leading to market share growth. Investors should monitor the company's ability to scale operations and its agility in responding to the increased demand, as these factors will be critical in realizing potential financial benefits from the policy change. Legal Expert The enactment of the German Medical Cannabis Act signifies a substantial shift in drug policy and regulation, which has direct implications for the legal landscape of the medical cannabis industry. This change can be seen as part of a broader trend towards the legalization and regulation of cannabis for medical use across various jurisdictions. Companies operating in this sector, such as Tilray, will need to navigate the new regulatory framework, ensuring compliance with German standards for production and distribution.Understanding the legal intricacies of this new act is crucial for businesses to mitigate risks associated with regulatory compliance. The act's focus on high-quality cannabis medicines produced in Germany suggests that there may be stringent quality control measures and certifications required. This could lead to increased operational costs for producers, but also serves as a barrier to entry for new competitors, potentially benefiting established players like Tilray. Medical Research Analyst The opening of the German medical cannabis market under the new Medical Cannabis Act is a pivotal moment for patient care and medical research. With easier access to medical cannabis, there is potential for a broader range of clinical studies and trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cannabis-based treatments. For companies like Tilray, which are heavily involved in medical cannabis research, this could lead to new discoveries and the development of innovative therapies.It is essential to monitor how this increased access impacts patient outcomes and to ensure that the medical community is kept abreast of the latest research findings. The ability of companies to contribute to evidence-based medicine in this field will not only affect their reputation but also their market position. As research progresses and more data becomes available, we could witness an evolution in treatment protocols that incorporate cannabis-based medicines, further driving demand for these products. 02/23/2024 - 10:38 AM New Medical Cannabis Act in Germany Provides Easier Access to Medical Cannabis for Patients Through the MedCanGCOLOGNE, Germany and NEUMÜNSTER, Germany, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tilray Brands, Inc.

The facility features significant refrigerated and frozen capabilities, aligning with AMCON's strategic growth objectives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of a new distribution facility by AMCON Distributing Company represents a strategic expansion that could significantly enhance the company's logistics and distribution capabilities. This move is indicative of AMCON's commitment to improving service delivery and expanding its footprint in key regions. The addition of a facility with a large refrigerated and frozen capability could cater to the growing demand for foodservice distribution, which has seen an uptick due to changing consumer preferences and increased demand for convenience.From a market perspective, this expansion into the Rocky Mountain, Intermountain and Southwest regions positions AMCON competitively, potentially increasing market share in these areas. The investment in the facility also suggests a forward-thinking approach to infrastructure, which is crucial for distribution companies looking to maintain efficiency and reduce operational costs in the long run. Financial Analyst AMCON's investment in the new distribution facility could have considerable financial implications. The capital expenditure required for such an expansion, including the development of refrigerated and frozen capabilities, will likely be substantial. However, the expected increase in operational efficiency and the ability to serve a broader market may result in improved revenue streams over time. Investors should monitor the company's financials in subsequent quarters to assess the return on investment and the impact on the company's profit margins.Furthermore, the collaboration with the Southern Colorado Economic Development District hints at potential financial incentives or support, which could mitigate some of the investment costs and positively affect AMCON's financial positioning. This strategic move could enhance shareholder value if executed effectively, aligning with the company's growth objectives. Economist The economic implications of AMCON's expansion via the new distribution facility are multifaceted. On a local scale, the partnership with the Southern Colorado Economic Development District indicates a commitment to regional economic growth. This could lead to job creation in Pueblo County and stimulate local economic activity. The presence of a major distributor can have a multiplier effect, potentially attracting related businesses and services to the area.On a broader scale, enhancing distribution capabilities in the Rocky Mountain, Intermountain and Southwest regions could improve the supply chain efficiency within the United States. This is particularly relevant as supply chain resilience has become a major economic focus in the wake of disruptions caused by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The strategic location and improved infrastructure could also benefit the broader economy by ensuring the consistent availability of consumer goods in these regions. 02/23/2024 - 09:15 AM OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMCON Distributing Company (“AMCON”) (NYSE American: DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska-based Convenience and Foodservice Distributor is pleased to announce it has acquired a new distribution facility located in Colorado City, Colorado. “This strategic move represents a significant expansion of our operations and underscores AMCON’s commitment to enhanced service for our customers in the Rocky Mountain, Intermountain and Southwest regions of the United States. We are making meaningful additional investments to this facility to expand the frozen and refrigerated footprint to support our growing foodservice initiatives,” said Christopher H. Atayan, AMCON’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

The facility will offer over 700 indoor rooms with climate-control options, high-end security features, and affordable prices. U-Haul aims to hire 10 Team Members locally, supporting job growth in the community. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The establishment of a new U-Haul retail, moving and self-storage center in Lawrenceville signifies a strategic expansion for the company, tapping into a growing market demand for storage solutions. This expansion is indicative of the company's confidence in the local economy and its commitment to long-term investment in the area. By offering over 700 climate-controlled storage units with high-end security features, U-Haul is positioning itself to capture a significant share of the local market. The move aligns with industry trends that show an increasing preference among consumers for secure and climate-controlled storage options.Furthermore, the creation of new jobs is likely to have a positive ripple effect on the local economy. U-Haul's commitment to hiring locally, particularly veterans, underscores its corporate social responsibility and may enhance its brand reputation. The emphasis on sustainability through initiatives such as the U-Box Load Share program, which recently won an award, could also appeal to eco-conscious consumers and differentiate U-Haul from competitors in the industry. Financial Analyst U-Haul's investment in a new facility represents capital expenditure that could impact the company's financials in the short-term but has the potential for revenue growth once operational. The project completion by the end of 2025 suggests a timeline for when investors might expect to see returns on this investment. The mention of affordable pricing could indicate a competitive pricing strategy, which may affect profit margins but potentially increase market penetration and customer volume.The decision to build a flagship store rather than franchising could reflect a strategic move to strengthen control over brand experience and operational efficiency. This direct investment in property and infrastructure may lead to improved asset utilization and cost savings over time, contributing positively to the company's return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). Sustainability Expert U-Haul's focus on sustainability and shared-use business models is a critical aspect of its corporate strategy. The company's efforts to promote green business practices, such as the Adaptive Reuse program and initiatives to improve fuel economy, are not only environmentally responsible but could also resonate with a consumer base that is increasingly valuing sustainability. These practices may lead to cost savings in the long run through reduced waste and energy consumption and the positive environmental impact could enhance the company's brand image and customer loyalty.The recognition of U-Haul's U-Box Load Share as the Most Environmentally Friendly Service of the Year is a testament to the company's innovation in sustainable practices. This award could serve as a marketing tool to attract customers who prioritize environmental stewardship in their choice of service providers. 02/23/2024 - 01:50 PM LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga., Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- U-Haul® is revealing plans for a new retail, moving and self-storage center in Lawrenceville after purchasing 1.76 acres at 243 Buford Drive. U-Haul Storage at Buford Drive is scheduled for completion by the end of 2025. This will be the first U-Haul-owned and -operated facility in Lawrenceville. A multi-story self-storage building will provide more than 700 indoor rooms with climate-control options. Units will have high-end security features at affordable prices. Storage customers will be able to apply for after-hours access. ""Local small businesses serving as U-Haul dealers have been serving Lawrenceville customers for decades, and now we'll have a flagship store in the community,"" said Rod Tape, U-Haul Company of Georgia Northeast president.

(M) declares a 5% increase in quarterly dividend to 17.37 cents per share, payable on April 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Macy's, Inc. increasing its quarterly dividend by 5% is a positive signal to investors, reflecting the company's confidence in its financial stability and profitability. Such a decision often suggests that the company's cash flow is robust enough to distribute a larger portion of profits to shareholders. It's important to consider the payout ratio in this context, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A modest increase that is well-covered by earnings can be a sign of prudent financial management.Investors typically view dividend increases as a sign of a company's strong financial health and a commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, it is also crucial to examine the company's growth prospects and whether retaining more earnings for reinvestment could potentially yield higher returns. In the retail sector, where competition is fierce and consumer habits are rapidly changing, the ability to invest in innovation and customer experience is vital for long-term growth. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the dividend increase by Macy's may influence the stock's attractiveness to income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where stable dividends from established companies are sought after. The retail industry is undergoing significant transformation with the rise of e-commerce and changing consumer preferences. Macy's response to these trends through strategic investments or restructuring initiatives will be critical to maintaining its market position.It's also worth noting the timing of the dividend increase. Retail companies often align dividend announcements with their fiscal calendars and strategic planning cycles. This timing could coincide with Macy's capital allocation strategy and its efforts to balance shareholder returns with necessary capital expenditures. Investors will be interested in how these dividends are being funded, whether from existing cash reserves or through debt and what this implies about the company's operational efficiency and long-term strategic planning. 02/23/2024 - 01:00 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Macy's, Inc.

(NASDAQ:VMAR) announces a partnership with Nautical Ventures Marine Group for 50 units of the Phantom, a sustainable electric boat, and an exclusive distributorship in South Florida. The collaboration aims to promote eco-friendly marine solutions and enhance market visibility. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The partnership between Vision Marine Technologies and Nautical Ventures Marine Group represents a strategic move within the recreational boating industry, which is increasingly prioritizing sustainability. The initial purchase order of 50 units of the Phantom signifies a robust demand forecast for eco-friendly boats. This demand is driven by consumer trends favoring sustainable products, which could lead to a competitive advantage for Vision Marine in the boating market. The exclusive distributorship agreement for South Florida, a key boating market, may enhance the company’s market share and brand recognition in a region known for its affluent demographic and environmental consciousness.The showcasing of the Phantom at the Miami Boat Show, resulting in additional sales, highlights effective marketing strategies and the importance of industry events in generating buzz and customer interest. The sales at such events are indicative of the Phantom's market appeal and serve as a barometer for future commercial success. The long-term implications for stakeholders include potential market expansion and increased revenue streams if the Phantom is well-received by the market. Environmental Sustainability Expert The Phantom's construction from fully recyclable materials is not only a significant step towards reducing the environmental impact of boating but also aligns with global efforts to promote sustainability. This innovation could set a precedent in the industry, encouraging other companies to follow suit in developing eco-friendly products. The long-term benefits include reduced marine pollution and a positive environmental image, which can translate into brand loyalty and customer retention. However, the challenge lies in balancing the costs of using sustainable materials with maintaining price competitiveness. Stakeholders should monitor the adoption rate of such sustainable solutions in the boating industry and consider the potential for regulatory incentives that could further encourage eco-friendly practices. Financial Analyst The financial implications of this partnership for Vision Marine Technologies are multifaceted. The immediate revenue from the initial order of 50 units will contribute to the company's financial performance. However, the true financial impact will depend on the Phantom's ongoing sales trajectory and the ability to scale production to meet potential demand increases. The exclusive distributorship agreement suggests a calculated risk in concentrating on a single regional market, but if successful, it could lead to a strong foothold and possibly justify expansion into other markets. Investors should weigh the potential for increased operating expenses against the anticipated revenue growth from this strategic partnership. It is also important to consider the Phantom's pricing strategy in relation to its sustainable features and how that compares to traditional offerings in the market. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM MONTREAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Vision Marine Technologies Inc.

L3Harris Announces Quarterly Dividend Increase,2024-02-23T14:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"L3Harris Technologies (LHX) announces a dividend increase from $1.14 to $1.16 per share quarterly, marking the 23rd consecutive annual increase.

The annualized rate rises from $4.56 to $4.64, reflecting the company's focus on free cash flow growth and capital deployment priorities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of L3Harris Technologies' increase in quarterly cash dividend from $1.14 to $1.16 per share is a clear signal of the company's financial health and confidence in its future cash flow. This move is particularly significant as it marks the 23rd consecutive year of dividend increases, a testament to L3Harris' commitment to shareholder returns. The incremental increase in the annualized rate from $4.56 to $4.64, while seemingly modest, compounds over time and can have a substantial impact on investor yields, especially for those with a long-term investment horizon.From a financial perspective, the decision to increase dividends is often seen as a distribution of excess capital which indicates that the company has sufficient funds to meet its operational needs and invest in growth opportunities. However, investors should also consider the payout ratio and whether the increased dividends are sustainable in the long run without compromising the company's reinvestment capabilities or causing an increase in debt. Market Research Analyst Dividend increases are generally well-received by the market as they provide tangible returns to shareholders. In the case of L3Harris Technologies, this consistent increase in dividends could be seen as a positive indicator of the company's market position and operational efficiency. It's also a strong message to potential investors that L3Harris is committed to maintaining a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy.It is important to analyze the company's dividend yield in comparison to industry peers and the broader market to gauge investor sentiment. A higher-than-average yield might attract income-focused investors, but it is also crucial to assess the growth potential of the company. A balance between dividend yield and growth prospects is typically sought after by a discerning investor. Economist When examining the macroeconomic implications of dividend increases like that of L3Harris Technologies, one must consider the current economic climate, including interest rates and inflation. In a low-interest-rate environment, increased dividends can make equities more attractive relative to fixed-income securities. Conversely, in a high-interest-rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding dividend-paying stocks may increase, potentially impacting stock valuation.Moreover, consistent dividend growth can be indicative of a company's resilience to economic cycles, which might provide a degree of stability to a diversified investment portfolio. This approach to capital deployment should be analyzed in the context of the company's long-term strategic goals and the overall economic outlook. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM MELBOURNE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) approved an increase in the company’s per share quarterly cash dividend rate from $1.14 to $1.16 commencing with the dividend for the first quarter of the year, payable March 22, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2024. The dividend corresponds to an increase in the annualized rate from $4.56 to $4.64. “This represents the company’s 23rd consecutive annual dividend increase, enabled by expected free cash flow growth, and is aligned with L3Harris’ capital deployment priorities,” said Christopher E. Kubasik, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. About L3Harris Technologies L3Harris Technologies is the Trusted Disruptor in the defense industry.

Positive None. Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 10:15 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / GoDaddyOriginally published on GoDaddy Resource LibraryTell us a little bit about yourself and your role.My name is Sandeep Sidhu and I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember. I always encourage my kids to pursue what they love. Initially, I started studying to become a chartered accountant, just like many others in my year group. However, during my final year of before graduation, I happened upon a summer project involving computers and fell in love with it. Despite the odds and familial expectations, I decided to deviate from my initial path. I dropped out and taught myself computer programming using books and magazines, as there were no local computer courses or colleges available at the time. Eventually, I pursued a master's in computer applications while working as a system administrator. Since then, I have never looked back.Throughout my career, I have held numerous roles including System Admin, IT Manager, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). Each role has contributed to my personal growth. I consistently update my knowledge of new technologies, primarily because I enjoy working with systems and technology.At GoDaddy, I am part of the Recomm SRE Team as an SRE-V. Our team oversees the infrastructure for multiple EMEA brands and reseller teams. This infrastructure consists of hundreds of micro-services hosted on Kubernetes clusters and numerous on-premises servers. We ensure everything operates smoothly and carry out all necessary maintenance and improvement tasks. We handle a multitude of services used by various EMEA brands.What project has been the most rewarding throughout your career journey?Over the years, I've been involved in numerous projects, the most rewarding of which involved saving time and effort for multiple teams.During my tenure at my previous company, I worked on an internal project that allowed several teams to check the status of customer VMs without the need for calls or waiting on other teams. It also enabled them to perform some diagnostics directly without providing full access. This meant that support staff at all levels could quickly check, report, and assist customers. This project saved countless hours that would otherwise be spent making calls or navigating multiple portals for the same information.Within my team at GoDaddy, I had the opportunity to automate our certificates rotation. We manage hundreds of micro-services which we support, and they have hundreds of internal/external URLs across all environments. All these URLs use HTTPS and require regular certificates rotation, and some of those steps required manual intervention. To address this, I developed an internal operator compatible with our internal systems, automating the entire process of certificates rotation. This saved considerable man-hours and effort, and eliminated potential outages of missed cert rotations.How has GoDaddy helped you grow as an individual?GoDaddy has fostered my growth by allowing me to be myself. The company cultivates an environment where engineers are urged to do what's right. This ethos, which is embedded in our core values, always prioritizes the betterment of our customers. When you propose valuable ideas, team members support you in advancing them. Working on such projects enables you to grow, learn new things, and collaborate with colleagues globally.It's beneficial that GoDaddy has roots as a servers and systems company. It houses many talented engineers, many of whom have ascended to management roles. Having managers who comprehend your technical challenges significantly aids project delivery.Since joining GoDaddy, I feel I've grown not only technically but also in interpersonal skills through interactions with other exceptional engineers from various teams.What advice would you give to an individual who is interested in a career in Site Reliability Engineering?Being an SRE is a rewarding and fulfilling role. It guarantees that no two days are the same. You're always looking for ways to enhance existing infrastructure, designing new systems, and aiding developers with your systems engineering knowledge.If you're interested in an SRE role, my advice would be to learn to have a holistic view of the infrastructure. In your daily tasks, don't just focus on the current task at hand. Start thinking about the broader impact of these changes. Consider questions like: How will this infrastructure be maintained? Who will maintain it? What's the backup plan? What happens if it fails? How will it be monitored? Do we have the necessary skills within the team for this new technology? Can all team members support this?As an SRE, you're constantly asking these types of questions when designing, implementing new solutions, evaluating existing solutions, or addressing new requirements.With an SRE role, the lines between being a developer and an engineer are even more blurred than in DevOps roles. Don't limit yourself to just the systems area. Venture into frontend development and explore new technologies in Node.js, React, or Vue.js. Understanding the language of the people you work with every day makes it easier for them to convey their issues and for you to understand those issues. Knowledge of UI and frontend tools can also help you build internal tools for the engineering team, resulting in a win-win situation.Finally, strengthen your systems/networking fundamentals and develop a pragmatic approach to problem-solving. I strongly believe that solid fundamentals are crucial and will help you in the long run to become an outstanding engineer. Good fundamentals enable better debugging, troubleshooting, and even foreseeing potential problems before they occur.What's your motto or personal mantra?Stay Hungry and Stay Foolish. In other words, stay curious, keep learning, and keep growing. Always strive to be more interested than interesting.What do you enjoy doing outside of work?Beyond work, I love cooking. I enjoy preparing various dishes for my family, including all kinds of Indian dishes, perfectly round chapatis, and parathas (Indian flatbread).I also enjoy cycling with my children and visiting local parks on sunny days. We often have picnics, or I'll lie on the grass, listening to their stories.Are you enjoying this series and want to know more about life at GoDaddy? Check out our GoDaddy Life social pages!

With a focus on US-based manufacturing, Adtran provides OLTs, cabinets, ONTs, and pluggable optics to meet the BEAD program's requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Policy Expert The recent announcement by Adtran regarding its preparedness to support the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program under the Build America, Buy America (BABA) rule is a significant development in the telecommunications sector. This initiative is part of a broader federal effort to bridge the digital divide in the United States, particularly in underserved areas. The policy implications of this announcement are substantial, as it signals a commitment to not only enhance broadband access but also to adhere to mandates for domestically produced equipment, which could have ripple effects on the supply chain and manufacturing within the country.From a policy perspective, Adtran's alignment with the BABA ruling exemplifies a proactive approach to compliance with federal requirements. This readiness to supply BABA-compliant products such as OLTs, cabinets, ONTs and pluggable optics positions the company to potentially secure a significant portion of the $42.5 billion allocated for grants under the BEAD program. The emphasis on US-based production could stimulate local economies and create high-quality jobs, reinforcing the government's objectives of fostering economic growth and digital inclusivity. Telecommunications Industry Analyst Adtran's strategic positioning to offer BABA-compliant fiber access solutions is a calculated move that could enhance its competitive edge in the telecommunications industry. By ensuring their products meet the criteria for the BEAD program, Adtran is not only ready to contribute to the expansion of high-speed broadband infrastructure but is also likely to benefit from the substantial federal investment in this area. The company's three-decade history of US-based manufacturing and its comprehensive range of products showcase its capability to meet the demand that the BEAD program will generate.It is important to note that the certification of BABA-compliant products by the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) will be a critical factor in determining the success of vendors like Adtran in the market. The company's offerings, which will be showcased on the NTIA’s certification website, must be rigorously evaluated to ensure they meet the high standards required for deployment in the BEAD program. The potential impact on Adtran's market share and financial performance will be closely watched by industry stakeholders as the BEAD program progresses. Economic Development Analyst The BEAD program's focus on connecting underserved homes to high-speed broadband is poised to have a transformative impact on economic development, particularly in smaller US cities and rural areas. Adtran's readiness to provide BABA-compliant solutions is a testament to the potential economic benefits that can be realized through such federal programs. By advancing equitable broadband access, the BEAD program is expected to support education, telehealth and foster innovation, which are key drivers of economic prosperity.Moreover, the emphasis on domestic manufacturing in compliance with the BABA rule could lead to a resurgence in American manufacturing capabilities, potentially reducing dependency on foreign supply chains. This could have long-term benefits for the national economy, including increased self-sufficiency and resilience. Adtran's role in this initiative, given its manufacturing expertise and innovation legacy, may serve as a model for other companies looking to capitalize on similar government-funded opportunities. 02/23/2024 - 11:40 AM News summary: Adtran welcomes final Build America, Buy America ruling and stands prepared to help BEAD recipients close America’s digital divide Capitalizing on its 30-year history of US-based manufacturing, Adtran leads the market with BABA-compliant fiber access solutions BEAD recipients will benefit from Adtran’s comprehensive range of BABA-compliant OLTs, cabinets, ONTs and pluggable optics HUNTSVILLE, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adtran today announced its readiness to support the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, welcoming the clarity and guidance provided by the Build America, Buy America (BABA) rule.

As we continue to align our efforts with the program’s objectives, we’re looking forward to the National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) providing the certification process and website details. This step is crucial for operators to design their BEAD networks with confidence, ensuring they can leverage our BABA-compliant solutions and accelerate the deployment of high-speed broadband infrastructure across the nation,” said Robert Conger, GM of software platforms and strategy at Adtran. “The BEAD program is improving access to key digital services and driving economic growth while also empowering communities by generating high-quality jobs. At Adtran, we have a longstanding tradition of harnessing home-grown innovation and building on American soil. That’s why our support for the BABA Act isn’t a new direction for us — it’s a reaffirmation of our legacy.” With over three decades of manufacturing expertise in Huntsville, Alabama, Adtran is perfectly placed to meet the stringent criteria for BABA-compliant technology, positioning the company as a key player in the BEAD program’s mission. By advancing equitable broadband access, BEAD will be instrumental in promoting economic growth, supporting education and telehealth, fostering innovation and creating job opportunities for millions of Americans. Adtran’s open, software-driven OLTs empower service providers to rapidly expand their networks, making it easier to bring cost-effective and high-quality services to underserved customers. Furthermore, its pluggable optics solution boosts transport capacity while ensuring affordability, sustainability and efficiency. “Fiber broadband has the power to transform society by unlocking economic growth, tackling poverty and sparking innovation. Yet, despite its potential, many smaller US cities – particularly those with fewer than 10,000 households – still face a significant digital divide. The BEAD program is addressing this challenge, aiming to enhance access to digital services and drive economic progress. Adtran’s readiness with BEAD-compliant fiber solutions is commendable, as well as their longstanding dedication to American innovation and manufacturing,” commented Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “By supporting BABA, companies like Adtran are helping create a digitally inclusive nation where universal broadband access is a reality for all.” More information on the BABA ruling and how Adtran is ready to help customers is available in this video.

(NTIP) declares a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.05 per common share. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024, subject to the Board of Directors' discretion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a semi-annual cash dividend by Network-1 Technologies signifies a distribution of earnings to shareholders, reflecting the company's current financial health and commitment to shareholder returns. From a financial perspective, the dividend payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders, is a critical metric to assess. It provides insight into how much money the company is returning to shareholders versus reinvesting back into the business. A consistent dividend payout can be a sign of a company's stable earnings and cash flow, which may positively influence investor sentiment and potentially the stock price.However, investors should also consider the company's future growth prospects and whether the capital used for dividends could have been better invested in business opportunities with higher returns. The Board's statement that the dividend policy is subject to periodic review and can change based on financial needs and other factors, suggests that investors should not assume the dividend is guaranteed indefinitely and should monitor the company’s earnings and financial strategy closely. Market Research Analyst Within the broader market context, dividend declarations can impact investor perceptions of a company's sector, especially if the company is seen as a bellwether. If Network-1 Technologies operates in a sector where dividend payments are common, its actions may align with industry norms. Conversely, if dividend payments are rare within the sector, this could signal a divergence from industry practices that may warrant further analysis.Investors often look to dividend-paying stocks for passive income, which can make these stocks more attractive during periods of market volatility or low-interest rates. Therefore, Network-1's dividend declaration could potentially increase the stock's appeal to income-focused investors. It's also worth noting that dividends can sometimes be a signal of confidence by the management in the company's future performance, which could influence market sentiment. 02/23/2024 - 12:30 PM NEW CANAAN, CT / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Network-1 Technologies, Inc.

Company decides not to appeal Nasdaq's decision.","GREENBROOK TMS ANNOUNCES DELISTING FROM NASDAQ Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Greenbrook TMS Inc. receives final delisting notice from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with minimum bid price and stockholders' equity requirements. Common shares to be suspended on February 26, 2024, with plans to quote on OTC Markets. Company decides not to appeal Nasdaq's decision. Positive None. Negative Greenbrook TMS Inc. faces delisting from Nasdaq due to non-compliance with listing requirements, potentially impacting investor confidence and liquidity of common shares. Financial Analyst The delisting of Greenbrook TMS Inc. from the Nasdaq Stock Market is a significant financial event with material implications for the company's stock liquidity and investor perception. Typically, when a company is delisted due to non-compliance with listing standards, such as minimum bid price or stockholders' equity, it reflects underlying financial distress or operational challenges. Delisting can lead to reduced visibility among investors and analysts, which often results in lower trading volumes and potentially higher volatility due to a thinner market for the shares.For current shareholders, the transition to the OTC Markets could mean a change in the trading environment. OTC Markets are generally considered less prestigious and less regulated than major exchanges like Nasdaq, which can affect investor confidence. Furthermore, institutional investors may have mandates that prevent them from holding stocks not listed on major exchanges, potentially leading to a sell-off. This event could also impact the company's ability to raise capital in the future, as being listed on a major exchange is often a prerequisite for certain types of financing deals. Market Research Analyst The delisting notice received by Greenbrook TMS Inc. indicates a period of underperformance in terms of stock price and possibly the company's financial health. A stock's failure to meet Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement suggests that investor interest and confidence might be waning. This could be due to various factors such as unsatisfactory financial performance, competitive disadvantages, or broader market trends affecting the sector.Moreover, the decision not to appeal the delisting notice suggests that the company's management is either confident in their ability to operate and raise capital outside of the major exchanges or possibly that they acknowledge the challenges in reversing the current stock price trajectory. Transitioning to OTC Markets can sometimes be a strategic move to reduce regulatory costs and complexities associated with major exchange listings, but it also raises questions about the company's growth prospects and long-term strategy. Legal Expert Greenbrook TMS Inc.'s delisting and the subsequent filing of a Form 25-NSE with the SEC is a legal process that formalizes the removal of the company's common shares from Nasdaq and their registration under Section 12(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This step is the culmination of a regulatory pathway outlined by Nasdaq for companies that fail to meet listing requirements. The legal implications for the company include a shift in reporting requirements and compliance obligations, as the regulatory framework for OTC Markets is different from that of Nasdaq.Shareholders should be aware that while the OTC Markets provide an alternative platform for trading, the oversight and investor protections are not as stringent as those on Nasdaq. This could potentially expose investors to higher risks. Companies trading on OTC Markets still have to comply with SEC regulations, but the frequency and detail of financial reporting may differ, which could impact the transparency and information available to investors for making informed decisions. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM TORONTO, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Greenbrook TMS Inc. (NASDAQ: GBNH) (""Greenbrook"" or the ""Company"") today announced receipt of the final delisting notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") due to the continued failure to satisfy either the $1.00 minimum bid price listing requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) or the minimum stockholders' equity requirements in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b).

Fields as President and CEO Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ATI (NYSE: ATI) announces Kimberly A. Fields as President and CEO, succeeding Robert S. Wetherbee who will become Executive Chairman. Fields, with a strong operational and commercial background, is set to lead ATI towards $5 billion in revenue and $1 billion in EBITDA by 2027. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The appointment of Kimberly A. Fields as President and CEO of ATI is a strategic move that could influence the company's direction and market performance. Analyzing the impact of such leadership changes requires understanding the market's perception of stability and continuity, as well as the potential for new strategies that may be implemented. Fields' previous roles and successes suggest a strong operational background, which could translate into efficient management and possibly improved margins for ATI.Furthermore, the company's stated goal of reaching $5 billion in revenue and $1 billion in EBITDA by 2027 sets a clear financial target for investors to monitor. The achievement of these goals will likely hinge on Fields' ability to leverage ATI's integrated operations and her experience in driving profitability and growth in previous positions. Investors will be keen to see how her leadership influences ATI's performance, particularly in the high-demand sectors of aerospace and defense, where the company has positioned itself as a leader. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the transition of leadership at ATI could signal continuity and confidence to the market, given Fields' internal promotion and her involvement in the company's recent operational growth. The stock market typically values such internal successions positively, as they often entail less risk of strategic pivots that could disrupt the company's trajectory. The focus on operational advantages and capacity expansion under Fields' COO tenure may also suggest that ATI will continue to prioritize operational efficiency under her leadership as CEO.ATI's financial targets are ambitious and investors will closely scrutinize the company's quarterly reports for evidence of progress toward these goals. The stock price could react to both the achievement of short-term milestones and the company's guidance on long-term financial health. It's also noteworthy that the outgoing CEO will assume the role of Executive Chairman, which could provide continuity in strategic vision and potentially ease the transition period for stakeholders. Aerospace Industry Analyst ATI's focus on the aerospace and defense sectors places it at the heart of industries with high barriers to entry and stringent quality requirements. The company's emphasis on high performance materials and solutions for critical applications positions it to capitalize on industry trends, such as increased demand for advanced materials in aerospace design and defense systems. Fields' experience in growing GE's penetration in metals and petrochemicals could be particularly relevant, as these are key components in ATI's product offerings.Understanding the company's proprietary process technologies and unique customer partnerships will be crucial in assessing ATI's ability to maintain its competitive edge. The company's commitment to innovation and solving difficult challenges through materials science could lead to the development of new products and solutions that meet the evolving needs of their customers, potentially opening up new revenue streams and strengthening market position. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM Robert S.

Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, Vencanna will acquire all of the outstanding membership units of Cannavative through an all-share exchange. The Transaction will result in materially less dilution than was contemplated in earlier agreements due to: (a) a significant reduction in the purchase price; (b) implementing a performance-based earn-out structure, and (c) an increased value of the Company's share price attributable to its New Jersey opportunities. At closing, Vencanna Acquisition Inc. (""AcquisitionCo""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vencanna, will issue: (a) 56.8 million common shares of AcquisitionCo (""Exchangeable Shares""); (b) 10.6 million Exchangeable Share purchase warrants, each exercisable for one Exchangeable Share at an exercise price of C$0.10 for 9 months, and (c) 12.5 million Exchangeable Share purchase warrants each exercisable for one Exchangeable Share at an exercise price of C$0.13 for a period of 18 months following the date of issuance. The exchangeable securities are exchangeable, at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis for equivalent securities of Vencanna. Contingent upon the business of Cannavative achieving specific 2024 and 2025 financial milestones, holders of membership units will be eligible to receive up to 96.6 million additional earn-out units, each consisting of one Exchangeable Share and 0.5 of a Exchangeable Share purchase warrant, each such full earn-out warrant exercisable for one Exchangeable Share for 12 months from the date of issuance at an exercise price of the greater of C$0.10 and the market price at the time of issue (collectively, the ""Transaction""). The maximum number of equity securities issuable pursuant to the Transaction, including earnout securities and securities issued to Cannavative's financial advisor in leu of a cash payment, is 224.3 million. As a condition to the completion of the Transaction, the unsecured convertible debenture issued by Vencanna on July 3, 2020, in the principal amount of US$1,300,000 (the ""Debenture""), plus its accrued interest, will be converted into a total of 40.9 million common shares of the Company (""Shares"") and 20.45 million Share purchase warrants, each warrant exercisable at C$0.075 for 12 months from the date of issue. The Company currently has 181.3 million Shares outstanding, and following the completion of the debenture conversion, but not including the completion of the Transaction, the Company will have approximately 222.1 million Shares, 20.25 Share purchase warrants and 5.0 million options outstanding.

In addition to certain other escrow restrictions described in the Amended Agreement, all of the equity securities issuable pursuant to the Transaction will be subject to a restriction from trading until ten trading days after a business acquisition report has been filed in respect of the Transaction. Further details regarding Cannavative and the Transaction are available in the listing summary of Vencanna dated February 23, 2024 (the ""Listing Summary""), which is available on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) under Vencanna's issuer profile. The completion of the Transaction is expected to occur in April 2024. In alignment with the Company's evolving operations, brand and corporate vision and existing investment strategy, the Company has officially rebranded as Vencanna Ventures Inc., and effective today, the Company's shares will resume trading on the CSE and the OTCB under the symbols VENI and TPPRF, respectively, as an investment issuer. On January 17, 2023, at an annual general and special meeting, the shareholders of Vencanna approved the name change. Strategic Market TimingThe acquisition of Cannavative, coupled with our ongoing developments in New Jersey, will position Vencanna to offer its shareholders opportunities in the U.S. cannabis market. The landscape of U.S. cannabis reform is rapidly evolving. Notably, on October 6, 2022, President Biden directed the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (""HHS"") to undertake an administrative review of the scheduling of cannabis, presently categorized as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substance Act. On August 29, 2023, the HHS forwarded a letter to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (the ""DEA"") recommending the reclassification of cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. This proposed change would eliminate the application of IRC 280E, a tax provision currently applicable only to Schedule I & II substances. Such a move would substantially alleviate the tax burden on U.S. state-compliant cannabis businesses, including Cannavative, leading to increased cash flows for the sector. Senior officials have been quoted as stating they do not recall the DEA to have deviated from a scheduling recommendation from the HHS. Ongoing legislative reforms, such as the SAFE Banking Act, and the potential re-scheduling of cannabis, stand as near-term material catalysts currently under consideration, though the exact timing remains uncertain. David McGorman, Vencanna's CEO, expressed: ""The U.S. cannabis market has faced its challenges, but our strategic objective has consistently been to identify operations with top-tier management, products, and market penetration. Cannavative aligns perfectly with our strategy. They were among the first in Nevada to secure both a cultivation and manufacturing license, establishing deep roots in one of the most dynamic recreational states in the U.S.. The product development and talent pool at Cannavative are readily exportable into new markets, aligning with the expanding cannabis reform landscape in the U.S. We eagerly anticipate integrating the Cannavative team into our operations."" Post-Transaction Management and DirectorsManagement and the board of directors will be comprised of professionals from both entities, forming an integrated team capable of executing the Company's forward-looking business plan. This plan includes expanding market penetration in Nevada, venturing into New Jersey, and exploring potential investment opportunities.

Effective as of closing of the Transaction, Matthew Christopherson and Smoke Wallin will be stepping down from the Company's board. New Jersey & NJ EntitiesVencanna is making substantial strides in advancing its investments in New Jersey through three community partnerships: TGC New Jersey LLC. (""TGC""), CGT New Jersey LLC (""CGT""), and October Gold LLC (""October Gold,"" collectively referred to as the ""NJ Entities""). The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory Commission has awarded TGC an annual cultivation and manufacturing license, with the conditional retail license pending approval, and each of CGT and October Gold has received a conditional retail license. New Jersey, with a population of 9.3 million (and another 35 million residing in its border states), ranks as the 11th most populous, and the most densely populated state in the United States. While adult cannabis was legalized in April 2020, its roll out has been slow. This has been in part due to a nascent medical market before adult legalization, and the fact that less than 25% of state's municipalities has opted-in. Adding to the challenges, most opted-in municipalities limit the number of retail locations and generally pose restrictive zoning parameters. Vencanna is pleased to announce that TGC has secured a 15,500-square-foot facility in Cinnaminson, NJ. The site shall house cultivation, manufacturing and retail sales. This single-site vertical operation will enable direct product showcasing to customers. This strategically located site is just off the Hwy-130 corridor between Trenton and Camden, which effectively borders Pennsylvania. Retail sales in Cinnaminson are restricted, as they are only allowed if the establishment is co-located with cultivation. In addition, currently all the adjoining municipalities either do not allow retail operations or limit their number, making the TGC site positioned for success. TGC expects to become operational later in 2024. In addition to TGC, Vencanna is very pleased to announce that CGT has also successfully secured a site; a 4,150 s.f. location in Bellmawr NJ, that is less than 10 miles from Philadelphia. The location has direct egress off HWY 24, the main artery from Philadelphia. The location is situated between the I-295 and the NJ Turnpike, on the southbound side of HWY 42 thereby capturing the afternoon traffic from Philadelphia. The south bound traffic on HWY 42 alone sees over 145,000 cars each day. CGT has received its joint land use approval from the municipality, and is now working with them in obtaining its retail support letter. Should CGT successfully obtain its retail operating licence, they would be only the second cannabis retailer in Bellmawr (Bellmawr currently allows only two retailers). The Company continues to review potential sites for October Gold, collaborating closely with local municipalities, and working with additional community partners, in order to expand its New Jersey network. In addition to supporting the New Jersey entities through funding and managerial oversight, Vencanna will also bring its SOP's and top Nevada brands to this new market, further expanding our reach. The retail market in New Jersey is anticipated to remain very attractive, as the real estate and market challenges are anticipated to continue thereby limiting new entrants in the near term. Normal Course Issuer Bid The Company announces the re-commencement today of a normal course issuer bid (""NCIB""). The previous NCIB expired on October 11, 2022. During the prior NCIB, the Company did not purchase any Shares. Under the new Bid, the Company may purchase up to 5% of the Company's Shares. The Bid commenced today and will terminate on the earlier of February 23, 2025 and the date on which the maximum number of Shares that can be acquired pursuant to the Bid have been purchased. The Company reserves the right to revoke the Bid earlier if it determines that it is appropriate to do so. The actual number of Shares that may be purchased under the Bid and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by the Company. Vencanna is executing the Bid because it believes that, from time to time, the market price of its Shares does not reflect the underlying value of the Company and its prospects, and that depending on the trading price of its Shares and other relevant factors, purchasing its own Shares represents an attractive investment opportunity and is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. All Shares will be purchased under the Bid on the open market and through the facilities of the CSE and payment for the Shares will be made in accordance with CSE policies. The timing and extent of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, valuation of Shares, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations. The price paid for Shares will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase and all Shares acquired by the Company will be cancelled. The Company has 181,283,390 Shares issued and outstanding as of today's date. Purchases may be suspended at any time, and no purchases will be made other than by means of open market transactions during the term of the Bid. The Company has engaged Independent Trading Group (ITG) Inc. to act as the broker through which the Bid will be conducted.

The new launches aim to blend richness, heritage, and design, reinforcing the brand's commitment to artistry and a well-crafted life. Positive None. Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM New brand introductions and latest launches reinforce the House of Rohl brand commitment to artistry, curation and a life well-crafted IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This year at KBIS, House of Rohl® is excited to announce the expansion of its brand portfolio and the debut of new luxury plumbing collections that seamlessly blend richness, heritage and design. House of Rohl proudly welcomes the recently acquired brands Emtek® and Schaub, leaders in personalized hardware for cabinets and doors, into its portfolio. Emtek, an innovator in premium residential door and cabinet hardware, is assembled to order in Los Angeles, providing customers with endless opportunities to customize the products for every project. Schaub cabinet hardware is created with passion and expert craftsmanship – every piece is rich in design details that will make a home truly stand apart. Bringing these brands into the family enables House of Rohl to expand its position as a trailblazer in luxury plumbing in the kitchen and bath and helps deliver on the vision of becoming the leader in luxury décor throughout the home. This is the New House of Rohl. The integration of Emtek and Schaub is not the only news from House of Rohl. New, exquisitely crafted kitchen and bath collections that bring to life artistry, provenance and passion will be displayed at KBIS as well. The latest offerings empower homeowners to curate a luxurious living space with the brands within House of Rohl: Riobel®, Perrin & Rowe®, Shaws®, Victoria + Albert® and ROHL®. ""House of Rohl is all about elevated design and showcasing how homeowners and designers can move throughout our portfolio to curate the kitchen, bath and ultimately whole home of their dreams,"" said Rachel Roberts, Vice President of Luxury Marketing at House of Rohl. ""Our latest products and collections deliver on the consumer need for quality performance and craftsmanship, while highlighting our evolution into a portfolio of luxury décor brands."" THE HOUSE OF ROHL BATHROOM EXPERIENCE ROHL introduces a new bathroom collection inspired by the haute couture runways of Milan and Paris – the ROHL Modelle™ Collection by House of Rohl. Haute couture is fashion elevated into art and requires fine attention to detail and material purity. Famed furniture and interior designer Xander Noori designed the Modelle Collection with the same exactitude, originality and artistry. Modelle brings heightened beauty to the bath that, just like couture, is always in style. The collection is available in a full bath suite in antique gold, polished chrome, unlacquered brass, satin nickel and matte black. Victoria + Albert brings to life three new color palettes inspired by culinary flavors of a tasting menu in partnership with Food & Wine: Victoria + Albert Cravings from Food & Wine by House of Rohl. These palettes take their cue from culinary tastes and heightens them with light and softness and depth and dimension to translate into a menu of irresistible shades. Course I awakens the palette and consists of flavorful colors of bright oranges and lively yellows, fresh garden greens and olive shades, soft creams, rosé and ruby-red wines; Course II invokes the main course and dips deeper into full-bodied shades, such as cabernet, the verdant freshness of leafy greens, the glow of honey and rustic orange, and the smoothness of cream; Course III ranges from dark and rich to sweet pastels to bring to life desserts and after-dinner drinks. These colors can be applied to all Victoria + Albert freestanding bathtubs and vessel sinks and provide design inspiration for all elements of the bathroom. Also new this year from Victoria + Albert is the Seros™ Collection by House of Rohl, which highlights the ongoing trend of spa-like bathrooms. In the same way rivers carve curves and waves into canyons and rocks, Seros captures the rippling motion of water in sculpted form. Its oval silhouette is surrounded by the flowing lines and contours of currents for an organic shape that encapsulates the fluid expression of water. Seros is designed to enhance the serenity of a bath and calm the mind and body in a lush, spa-like experience. This collection includes freestanding tubs and vessel sinks in different sizes, all available in RAL colors. Victoria + Albert reaffirms the brand's leadership in the bath space with the Luminaries™ Collection by House of Rohl. This palette of three metallic, shimmering shades can be applied to freestanding bathtubs and vessel sinks: Shimmering Sand; Sparkling Champagne; and Stardust. They elevate the bath to a new level of luxury through eye-catching tones that play with their environment. The Riobel Arca™ Collection by House of Rohl pays homage to the unmistakable and elemental form of the arch, while being inspired by the innovative aqueducts of classical Rome. The Arca Collection captures the beauty of the arch in line and curve – the spout follows a clean, rounded geometry, while nuanced, two-step details on the handles and base create a solid foundation. Arca embodies symmetry that is effortless, exquisite and always relevant. The collection is available in a full bath suite in a handful of finishes to fit any aesthetic. THE HOUSE OF ROHL KITCHEN EXPERIENCE New to the kitchen is the ROHL Apothecary™ Collection by House of Rohl, an extension of the popular award-winning bathroom collection. It draws its inspiration from the beautiful shapes of old apothecary bottles that are now sought-after collectibles. Designer Xander Noori looked to the past for inspiration and brought it into the present with unique chamfered details, beveled edges and balanced arcs, resulting in a silhouette of contoured elegance and nuanced simplicity. Apothecary adds an element of nostalgia and warmth to any space for an enduring design that's eminently collectable in and of itself. The Perrin & Rowe Southbank™ Collection by House of Rohl takes its name from the vibrant neighborhood of London where Mid-century architecture predominates. Past and present merge harmoniously here, just as they do in the Southbank Collection. Flourishes of curves and contours enhance its elegant, classic design. The straight lines of the handles and rounded detailing echo elements characteristic of Mid-century furniture. Yet, the collection stands apart from its inspiration to create its own rich aesthetic and flow – arresting, rhythmic and refined. Symmetry and asymmetry come together in the Riobel Lateral™ Collection by House of Rohl to create a fresh, warmly minimalist balance. The design decision to offset the lever and place it on the edge transforms proportion and perspective, which is further complemented by other design elements such as the rounded arc of the spout and high base. The collection answers the call for effortless, unique style. Throughout House of Rohl's booth (N2627), attendees will see the new bath and kitchen collections on display with complementary hardware from the newly integrated Emtek and Schaub brands. An example worth noting is the Emtek Select Collection featured in the Emtek vignette. This collection provides a higher level of hardware customization, allowing homeowners and designers to mix finishes, textures and styles with ease. Make a design impact with extended sizes that offer a sleek and contemporary look, and their elongated shape benefits both design and function. Within Emtek's standalone booth (N2005), discover more innovative product lines and introductions such as the new product visualizer. This tool allows web users to create mixed finish and mixed style levers and knobs for their passage and privacy products, bringing a whole new level of customization with no additional upcharge or lead time. Other standout products on display include the Hercules Entry Sets, Oval Stretto interior locksets, Select Cabinet Collection Expansions and more.

Treasure Global Announces 1:70 Reverse Stock Split,2024-02-23T16:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Very Positive,"Treasure Global Inc (NASDAQ: TGL) announces a 1-for-70 reverse stock split to maintain Nasdaq listing compliance, effective February 27, 2024. The split aims to meet the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement, approved by stockholders on January 5, 2024.","Treasure Global Announces 1:70 Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Treasure Global Inc (NASDAQ: TGL) announces a 1-for-70 reverse stock split to maintain Nasdaq listing compliance, effective February 27, 2024. The split aims to meet the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement, approved by stockholders on January 5, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst A reverse stock split is a corporate action where a company reduces the number of its outstanding shares in the market by consolidating multiple shares into one. Treasure Global Inc's decision to implement a 1-for-70 reverse stock split is a strategic move to boost its share price and comply with Nasdaq's $1.00 minimum bid price requirement. This action often indicates that a company's share price has been under pressure and it is attempting to avoid delisting.From a financial perspective, the reverse split does not fundamentally alter the company's valuation, as the market capitalization remains the same. However, it can have psychological effects on investors, as a higher stock price might be perceived as more stable or attractive. It's important to note that while the reverse split aims to maintain the listing, it does not address the underlying issues that may have led to the low share price. Furthermore, the adjustment of equity awards, warrants and convertible notes is a standard procedure to maintain proportional ownership and rights post-split.Investors should be aware that the reverse stock split does not change the intrinsic value of the company. Instead, it is a cosmetic change that might affect liquidity and marketability of the shares due to a reduced number of shares available for trading. Long-term implications will largely depend on the company's performance post-split and its ability to address the reasons behind the initially low share price. Market Research Analyst Reverse stock splits are often met with mixed reactions in the market. While they can help a company maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements, they can also be seen as a red flag by investors, signaling potential financial distress or a lack of positive growth prospects. It is crucial to monitor the market's response to Treasure Global's reverse stock split, as it may affect investor confidence and stock liquidity.Market research indicates that companies undergoing reverse splits may experience a temporary boost in share price, but the long-term effects are uncertain and can depend on the company's subsequent performance and strategic initiatives. Investors and analysts should closely examine Treasure Global's future earnings reports, product developments and market expansion strategies to assess whether the reverse stock split will have the intended positive impact on the company's market position and investor perception. Legal Expert The legal implications of a reverse stock split involve the amendment of the company's Certificate of Incorporation, as well as compliance with both state laws and securities regulations. Treasure Global's filing of a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware is a procedural requirement to effectuate the reverse stock split. It is also noteworthy that the decision was made following stockholder approval, indicating corporate governance adherence to shareholder rights and interests.Moreover, the legal aspect of rounding up fractional shares to the nearest whole share is a common practice to avoid the complexities of dealing with fractional ownership. This has implications for shareholders, as it can result in a slight increase in their total share count. The uniform effect on all stockholders ensures fairness in the process, as all shareholders are subject to the same terms of the reverse split. 02/23/2024 - 11:00 AM NEW YORK and KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Treasure Global Inc (NASDAQ: TGL) (“Treasure Global” or the “Company”), an innovative technology solutions provider, announced today that it will effect a 1-for-70 reverse stock split (“Reverse Stock Split”) of its common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Common Stock”). Treasure Global’s Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) under the existing symbol “TGL” and will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on February 27, 2024. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split will be 89458T205. The Reverse Stock Split is primarily intended to bring the Company into compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for maintaining its listing on Nasdaq. There is no guarantee the Company will meet the minimum bid price requirement. On January 5, 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved a proposal to authorize a reverse stock split of the Common Stock at a ratio within the range of 1-for-10 and 1-for-70 with the authority delegated to the Board of Directors of the Company, to determine the exact reverse split ratio and when to file the Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Company’s Board of Directors approved a 1-for-70 reverse split ratio and on February 22, 2024, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split. The 1-for-70 reverse stock split will automatically combine and convert seventy current shares of the Common Stock into one issued and outstanding new share of Common Stock. Proportional adjustments also will be made to shares underlying outstanding equity awards, warrants and convertible notes, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the Company’s stock incentive plans and certain existing agreements. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the par value of the Common Stock nor the authorized number of shares of Common Stock, preferred stock or any series of preferred stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. All fractional shares will be rounded up to the next whole share. The Reverse Stock Split will affect all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s equity. The Company’s transfer agent, Vstock Transfer, LLC, will serve as the agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Registered stockholders holding pre-split shares of the Common Stock electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares.

(TSX-V: CZO; OTCQX: CRPOF) (“Ceapro” or the “Company”), today provided an update on its progress across its current business. On December 14, 2023, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to combine operations with Aeterna Zentaris Inc. (“Aeterna Zentaris”), a TSX and Nasdaq listed specialty biopharmaceutical company, in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to be effected by way of a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the “Arrangement”). The Arrangement is subject to various conditions, including the approval of the Company’s shareholders and optionholders (collectively, the “Securityholders”) at the special meeting of Securityholders scheduled for March 12, 2024 (the “Meeting”). In addition to the proposed Arrangement, the Company continues to execute on progress across its ongoing development projects, as detailed below. “We continue to make promising progress across all areas of our business. Given the recent developments, we anticipate that all key success factors will align to expand our business model. Through the planned merger with Aeterna Zentaris, we aim to become a combined company with high potential for value creation in the biopharmaceutical industry. We look forward to an exciting future ahead for the Company and generating value in the short and long term for all stakeholders,” stated Gilles Gagnon, M.Sc., MBA, President and CEO. Pipeline Development Ceapro’s focus is on avenanthramides, beta glucan from oat and yeast and new chemical complexes/delivery systems. Avenanthramides (Avs): Phase 1-2a clinical trial being conducted at the Montreal Health Institute: Following the successful completion of bioassays for measurement of Avs in human tissues, the trial is maintaining rapid progress forward. Since December 9, 2023, three cohorts of eight healthy subjects have already been completed with ascending doses from 30mg to 60mg and 120mg. No significant adverse events have occurred with the first two doses and members of the Data Safety Monitoring Board will complete the full analysis of results from the 120mg cohort during the first week of March, being able to declare whether the trial may be pursued as planned and to give a green light for the next dosage of 240mg. These results are very promising given that the higher the dose without safety concerns, the larger the potential for extending to various inflammation-based diseases. Oat beta glucan powder (OBG): Samples of powder formulation have been successfully prepared and shipped to Symrise AG, Ceapro’s long-term partner, for liquid reformulation and assessment for the Chinese market. Yeast beta glucan (YBG): Specifications have been standardized and the product is ready to be used for the PGX scale up projects in Edmonton and Austria. Depending on the successful scale up of PGX technology and approval from health authorities, this product could be offered as an immune booster before year end 2024. Enriched Oat Flour with High Concentration of Avenanthramides: The first batch has been successfully produced. Samples have been sent to one major customer.The Company is assessing the potential of this product for preventive antimicrobial properties when used to produce oat based nutritional products. New Product Development Chewable Oat Beta Glucan (OBG): Ceapro’s team has successfully developed a unique, standardized formulation for a healthy confection which includes a high concentration of OBG with daily dosage according to approved claims in 10 developed countries.Health Canada has approved Ceapro’s Novel Nutraceutical Product (NPN 80127493). The substantive claims derived from this approval include reduction of LDL cholesterol, supporting cardiovascular health reduction of Type 2 diabetes risks, source of fiber for the maintenance of general good health and support of a healthy digestive system.Ceapro’s team anticipates the official commercial launch of its approved natural health product in H2, 2024, marking an important chapter in the Company's journey toward promoting wellness while expanding its business model. According to Future Market Insights, the oat beta-glucan market is expected to reach US$ 846.1 Million in 2032. Whey Proteins: Using its PGX Technology, Ceapro and University of Alberta researchers successfully processed in one economical step a very complex mixture containing animal-based proteins, and in particular whey proteins that are typically found in liquid that remains after cheese production. While these proteins are widely used in sport drinks, baked goods, meal replacements, protein supplements and infant formulas due to their recognized nutritional and functional properties, current commercial purification processes require many steps and considerable amounts of water. PGX Technology can be a very efficient and economical alternative for this product offering.Results from this ground-breaking study were published in the Journal of Food Engineering in an article titled “Single-step concentration of whey proteins using the pressurized gas eXpanded (PGX) liquid technology: Effect on physicochemical properties and scale-up,”. They have also been submitted for a presentation at the 20th European meeting on supercritical fluids in Maribor, Slovenia, May 26-29, 2024.

Entravision Inaugurates State-of-the-Art News Facility in Las Vegas,2024-02-23T14:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Entravision Communications Corporation (EVC) reinforces its commitment to Nevada's Latino community by opening a new state-of-the-art news facility in Las Vegas.

The company's three-decade dedication to empowering the Latino community is evident through this milestone. With Latinos accounting for 30% of Nevada's population, Entravision aims to amplify Latino voices and engage with this crucial demographic, especially in this critical election year. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Entravision's establishment of a new news facility in Las Vegas is a strategic move that aligns with demographic trends and consumer behavior. With Latinos making up a significant portion of Nevada's population, this expansion can be seen as an effort to capture a larger market share in a key demographic. It's important to note that the Latino community is not only growing but also becoming increasingly influential in consumer markets and elections.From a market research perspective, this move could enhance brand loyalty among Latino viewers, potentially increasing viewership and advertising revenues. Moreover, the recruitment of nearly 40 individuals suggests a scaling up of operations, which may indicate positive growth projections and a bullish outlook on the market potential in Nevada. The emphasis on civic engagement and political influence among Latinos could also attract political advertising spends, especially in an election year, which can be a lucrative revenue stream for media companies. Financial Analyst Entravision's investment in a new facility directly impacts its operational costs and capital expenditures. However, the long-term benefits could outweigh these initial costs if the facility succeeds in generating higher advertising revenues. Investors should monitor the company's quarterly financials for increases in revenue from the Nevada market, as well as any changes in operating margins that reflect the efficiency of the new facility.Furthermore, the timing of the investment aligns with the upcoming elections, which historically have led to increased spending on political advertising. If Entravision can capitalize on this, it could see a significant boost in short-term revenue. However, investors should also be aware of the cyclical nature of election-related advertising and consider the sustainability of revenue streams beyond election seasons. Media Industry Analyst Entravision's expansion in Nevada reflects broader industry trends where media companies are localizing content to better serve diverse audiences. This hyper-local approach can be particularly effective in regions with large, underrepresented populations. By more than doubling local news programming, Entravision is likely aiming to become the go-to source for news for the Latino community, a move that could pay off in terms of viewer engagement and brand differentiation.Investors should consider the competitive landscape and how Entravision's investment positions the company against other media outlets in the region. The ability to deliver culturally relevant content is a competitive advantage that can lead to increased market penetration and advertising premiums. However, it's also crucial to assess whether the company's content strategy aligns with changing media consumption habits, such as the shift towards digital and mobile platforms. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM Further Reinforces Entravision’s Commitment to Nevada’s Latino Community.

Market Research Analyst The partnership between Coca-Cola Canada and Cricket Canada represents a strategic move to capitalize on the burgeoning popularity of cricket in Canada. This collaboration is likely to enhance Coca-Cola's brand visibility and market penetration within a niche yet rapidly expanding demographic. Cricket's growing fanbase in Canada provides a fresh audience for Coca-Cola’s marketing initiatives, potentially leading to increased sales and customer loyalty.From a market research perspective, aligning with national sports teams can significantly boost brand awareness and favorability. The timing coincides with a series of high-profile events, including the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, which is expected to garner substantial attention. The association with such events can create a halo effect, improving consumer perception of Coca-Cola's brands among cricket enthusiasts.Moreover, the multi-faceted nature of the partnership, which includes collaborative initiatives to promote the sport, suggests a long-term commitment to community engagement. This could lead to sustained brand equity growth for Coca-Cola, as they are perceived as supporters of national sports development, aligning with consumer values of community and inclusivity. Sports Marketing Expert The deal between Coca-Cola Canada and Cricket Canada signifies an important trend in sports marketing, where companies invest in emerging sports to establish early brand dominance. By becoming the official beverage sponsor, Coca-Cola not only secures prominent branding on kits and training gear but also ingrains itself in the cultural fabric of the sport within the country.For Cricket Canada, the association with a global brand like Coca-Cola could lead to increased exposure and credibility. It may also attract further investment from other brands looking to associate with cricket's growth trajectory in Canada. This partnership could serve as a catalyst for the sport's commercialization, providing a blueprint for other sports organizations seeking to attract corporate sponsorship.The emphasis on collaborative initiatives beyond mere branding, such as enhancing sport accessibility and fan engagement, reflects a modern approach to sports partnerships. These initiatives are likely to resonate with a younger, more socially conscious audience, potentially leading to a stronger, more engaged fan base for cricket in Canada. Financial Analyst For investors, the partnership between Coca-Cola Canada and Cricket Canada could be indicative of Coca-Cola's strategic initiatives to diversify its marketing efforts and tap into new consumer segments. The financial implications of this deal are not immediately clear without disclosure of the terms; however, it is reasonable to anticipate that the investment is calculated to generate a positive return through increased brand engagement and potential market share gains in the beverage sector.It is important to monitor the consumer response to the partnership and the subsequent impact on Coca-Cola's sales in Canada. If the cricket audience in Canada continues its upward trend, Coca-Cola’s investment in this partnership could yield significant dividends. The company's stock performance could see a favorable impact if this venture aligns with overall growth strategies and contributes positively to its revenue streams.Investors should also consider the broader implications of such sponsorships on Coca-Cola's global marketing strategy, as it reflects the company's agility in adapting to regional market dynamics and consumer interests. This localized marketing approach could be a key factor in driving Coca-Cola's growth in diverse markets around the world. 02/23/2024 - 12:51 PM BODYARMOR to become the Official Sports Drink of Cricket Canada TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cricket Canada and Coca-Cola Canada today announced that both groups have entered into a new partnership that will see Coca-Cola become the official beverage sponsor – and BODYARMOR the Official Sports Drink – of Cricket Canada.

Allstate Announces Quarterly Dividends,2024-02-23T15:12:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) has increased its quarterly dividend by $0.03, or 3.4%, per share compared to the previous quarter. The company also declared quarterly preferred dividends, showcasing its commitment to rewarding shareholders and financial strength.","Allstate Announces Quarterly Dividends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) has increased its quarterly dividend by $0.03, or 3.4%, per share compared to the previous quarter. The company also declared quarterly preferred dividends, showcasing its commitment to rewarding shareholders and financial strength. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in Allstate's quarterly dividend from $0.89 to $0.92 represents a 3.4% hike, which is a positive signal to investors about the company's profitability and cash flow management. This decision likely reflects a stable earnings outlook and a strong balance sheet, which allows the company to return value to shareholders while maintaining enough capital for operational needs and potential investments. The modest increase is in line with industry practices, where insurers aim to provide steady returns without compromising their financial stability.From a valuation perspective, dividend increases can affect the stock's yield, making it potentially more attractive to income-focused investors. However, it is important to monitor the payout ratio to ensure that dividends are sustainable and do not impede the company's growth prospects. Given Allstate's history and market position, this dividend increase may be seen as a reaffirmation of its commitment to shareholder returns, possibly leading to positive sentiment in the market. Market Research Analyst The declaration of dividends on preferred stock, with varying annual dividend rates, is indicative of Allstate's tiered approach to investor returns. Preferred stocks often appeal to investors seeking stable income with priority over common stock dividends. The specific rates announced, such as 7.375% for Series J, are competitive and could attract investors looking for higher yields in a low-interest-rate environment.Moreover, the aggregate amount of approximately $29.3 million in preferred dividends suggests that Allstate is managing a substantial amount of preferred equity. This form of financing can be beneficial for the company's capital structure, as it typically comes with lower cost than common equity and provides tax advantages. Investors may interpret the preferred dividend declarations as a sign of Allstate's strategic financial planning and its ability to cater to diverse investor preferences. Economist The announcement of Allstate's dividend increase falls within a broader economic context where interest rates and inflationary pressures are key concerns for investors. A dividend increase can be a hedge against inflation for investors, as it offers a boost in income that might help offset the diminished purchasing power. In a rising interest rate environment, insurance companies like Allstate may benefit from higher investment income on their large portfolios, potentially supporting more generous dividend policies.However, it's crucial to consider the economic cycle's impact on insurance claims and premiums. A robust economy can lead to more vehicles on the road and higher asset values, potentially increasing claims. Conversely, during downturns, claims may decrease but so can the ability to raise premiums. Allstate's dividend increase suggests confidence in its ability to navigate these economic fluctuations while maintaining a solid financial performance. 02/23/2024 - 10:12 AM NORTHBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) announced that its board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.92 on Feb. 22, 2024, which is an increase of $0.03, or 3.4%, per share compared to last quarter.

Announces Q1 2024 Common Dividend of $0.22 Per Share Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Summit Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMF) declares a first quarter 2024 dividend of $0.22 per share. The $4.6 billion financial holding company focuses on in-market commercial lending and other business banking services. Summit serves clients in multiple states through digital and mobile banking platforms. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a quarterly dividend by Summit Financial Group, Inc. signals a return of capital to shareholders, which is often indicative of the company's financial health and stability. A dividend of $0.22 per share can be seen as a commitment to returning value to shareholders and can affect investor sentiment positively. It is essential to examine the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price. If the yield is higher than average for the industry or the broader market, it might attract income-focused investors.Furthermore, the payout ratio, the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, is crucial. A sustainable payout ratio, typically below 75% for healthy companies, suggests that the dividend is well-covered by earnings and there is room for future growth. However, if the payout ratio is too high, it may raise concerns about the company's ability to maintain or increase the dividend in the long term. Market Research Analyst Summit Financial Group's focus on in-market commercial lending and business banking services, as well as its digital and mobile banking platforms, positions it in a competitive stance in the financial services industry. By leveraging efficient operations and core deposits in legacy locations, Summit may achieve cost advantages and increase profitability. The company's footprint across several states and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area diversifies its market exposure and could mitigate risks associated with regional economic downturns.It's important to analyze customer and market trends, such as the shift towards digital banking, which has been accelerated by the pandemic. Summit's investment in digital platforms could cater to changing consumer preferences and enhance customer retention. However, it also means that Summit faces stiff competition from both traditional banks investing in digital transformation and fintech startups that are digital-native. Economist The economic environment affects the banking sector significantly, with interest rates and regulatory changes being particularly influential. As an economist, assessing the impact of current economic conditions on Summit's business model is vital. In a rising interest rate environment, for instance, net interest margins for banks can improve, potentially increasing profitability. Conversely, higher rates can also lead to a decrease in loan demand and an increase in payment defaults.Regulatory changes could also affect Summit's operations, especially in the areas of commercial and consumer lending. It's essential to monitor any legislative developments that could impact the banking industry, such as changes in capital requirements or consumer protection laws. These factors could influence Summit's strategic decisions and financial performance over time. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM MOOREFIELD, W.Va., Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summit Financial Group, Inc.

"Global Biopharma R&D Boasts Increased Funding, Productivity and Product Launches in 2023, says IQVIA Institute Report",2024-02-23T14:00:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Global biopharma R&D productivity rebounded in 2023, with higher composite success rates due to industry-wide adoption of data-driven innovation. Clinical trial starts returned to pre-pandemic levels, focusing on newer modalities like cell and gene therapy, neurology, and rare diseases.","Global Biopharma R&D Boasts Increased Funding, Productivity and Product Launches in 2023, says IQVIA Institute Report Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Global biopharma R&D productivity rebounded in 2023, with higher composite success rates due to industry-wide adoption of data-driven innovation. Clinical trial starts returned to pre-pandemic levels, focusing on newer modalities like cell and gene therapy, neurology, and rare diseases. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in clinical development productivity, with a composite success rate of 10.8%, indicates a more efficient and effective pharmaceutical R&D landscape. This uptick is significant for investors as it suggests a higher likelihood of investment in R&D converting into marketable products. The introduction of 69 novel active substances (NASs) represents a robust pipeline that could translate into revenue growth for biopharma companies, particularly those with first-in-class launches.From a market perspective, the focus on cutting-edge modalities like cell and gene therapy and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), highlights a shift towards innovation with potentially higher margins. The increased deal activity, with a total value of $140Bn, underscores confidence in the sector's growth prospects, despite a drop in median deal value. The prominence of ADCs in these deals points to a strategic interest in targeted cancer therapies, which have been gaining traction due to their potential for improved efficacy and safety profiles. Financial Analyst The resurgence in biopharma R&D productivity is a positive signal for the industry's financial health and could impact stock valuations. A 17.4 value on the Clinical Development Productivity Index suggests a recovery from previous lows, which may restore investor confidence after the decline in R&D funding levels in 2022. The return to pre-pandemic funding levels of $72Bn and the increase in M&A activity are indicative of a robust investment environment.It is important to note the geographic diversification in NAS launches, with China's rising domestic industry potentially creating new investment opportunities. However, the disparity between NAS launches in the U.S. and Europe could indicate regulatory and market access challenges. Investors should monitor the distribution of R&D funds and the strategic alignment of M&A activity with high-growth areas such as oncology and neurology, which could drive long-term returns. Medical Research Analyst The adoption of innovative trial designs and digital methodologies in clinical development is a critical factor in the improved success rates. These methodologies have the potential to reduce costs and shorten time-to-market for new therapies, benefiting both patients and biopharma companies. The shift in focus to areas like neurology and metabolic diseases aligns with global health trends and unmet medical needs, potentially leading to significant clinical advancements.The surge in obesity trials by 68% and the development of oral GIP/GLP glucagon receptor agonists reflect an evolving treatment landscape for metabolic diseases. This could have profound implications for public health and healthcare spending, given the global rise in obesity rates. The emphasis on personalized medicine, as evidenced by the use of predictive biomarkers, may also lead to more effective and tailored treatments, further enhancing the value proposition of biopharma R&D investments. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM Clinical development productivity rose in 2023, primarily due to an improvement in the composite success rate, a function of phases successfully completed in the year, which rose to 10.8%. This was the highest level since 2018. Industry and regulator adoption of innovative and technology-driven enablers contributed to productivity gains. These enablers included the use of predictive biomarkers, novel trial design, and digital and decentralized trial methodologies. A total of 69 novel active substances (NASs) were launched globally in 2023 – 6 more than the prior year – including 24 first-in-class launches in the U.S. Clinical development programs among larger biopharma companies are moving toward newer modalities, including cell and gene therapy, antibody drug conjugates, and radioligand therapies. This is coupled with an increased focus on neurology, infectious diseases, metabolic diseases (including obesity), and rare diseases. R&D funding levels and deal activity recovered in 2023 following a steep decline in 2022 from peak levels in 2020-21. RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global biopharma R&D productivity rebounded in 2023 with higher composite success rates enabled by industry-wide and regulator adoption of data and technology driven innovation, including novel trial design, optimized biomarker use, and digital and decentralized trial methodologies. This rebound occurred while clinical trial starts and funding returned to pre-pandemic levels, according to the new report, “Global Trends in R&D 2024: Activity, Productivity, and Enablers,” released by the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. “The improvement in clinical productivity and composite success was notable across all therapy areas, particularly in Phases I and III and in regulatory review,” said Murray Aitken, executive director of the IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. “This reflects industry-wide ingenuity and regulatory acceptance of innovative data and technology-driven enablers in trial design and digital trial execution. Clinical trial starts have returned to pre-pandemic levels, signaling a recognizable shift in pipelines and clinical development programs to a focus on innovative modalities in oncology, immunology, neurology and metabolic diseases.” A few key highlights of the report include: Clinical development productivity: Industry-wide clinical development productivity rose primarily through better success rates, which surged from historic lows to the highest levels since 2018. Efforts to manage trial complexity and duration have had more mixed results. Clinical development productivity reached a value of 17.4 in 2023 on the Clinical Development Productivity Index, which provides a composite metric that combines success rates, clinical trial complexity and trial duration on an annual basis. This is compared to the 2010 base level of 20 and shows a continued rebound from a low of 12.8 in 2020, with the majority of this growth driven by an increase in success rates. Productivity enablers: Regulatory agencies are generally attempting to make changes which the industry finds positive, including greater simplication, transparency and speed, but the pace of change differs across geographies. Large pharmaceutical companies have shifted country utilization over the last decade by reprioritizing and rationalizing country selection for trials. Innovative program approaches, including use of biomarkers and compressed trial strategies, yield significant time savings and greater productivity. Novel trial designs were used in 18% of trials in 2021-2023, led by oncology where more than 29% of trials use a novel design. Decentralized methodologies peaked but remain a stable feature of trial activity, albeit at a lower level than 2020, which was driven by COVID-19. New drug approvals and launches: A total of 69 novel active substances (NASs) were launched globally in 2023 – six more than the prior year – and representing a return to pre-COVID-19 levels. A total of 362 NASs have launched globally in the past five years, including 113 NASs launched in the U.S. but not launched in Europe as of the end of 2023. While the number of NAS launches in China is rising, an increasing number are not available in other countries, reflecting both a rising domestic industry and a mix of reduced barriers and rising incentives for multinational NAS launches. Clinical trial activity: Clinical trial starts declined 15% in 2023 from 2022, a third of which was driven by a reduction in COVID-19 trials. This decline also reflected a shift in clinical development programs among large biopharma companies away from immuno-oncology to a focus on hot spots, including cell and gene therapies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), multi-specific antibodies and obesity treatments. Emerging biopharma companies started 416 fewer non-COVID-19 trials in 2023 than at the peak in 2021, while larger companies started 524 fewer. The top four diseases in trial starts – oncology, metabolic/endocrinology, immunology, and neurology – accounted for 79% of those trial starts and declined less than other diseases. There was a notable increase of 68% in obesity clinical trials in 2023 from 2022, nearly double the number from five years ago. This included 124 drugs in active development, of which 46% have oral formulations in development and 40% are GIP/GLP glucagon receptor agonists. R&D funding: In 2023, global funding of biopharmaceutical research and development increased to $72Bn, up from $61Bn in 2022. In the same period, M&A activity jumped to $140Bn from $78Bn in 2022, while the median deal value fell for the second year in a row. The leading deals in 2023 included 11 that were over $5Bn and were focused on cancer, neurology and cardiovascular diseases. The largest focus area of deals was antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), which had six totaling $90Bn.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a regular quarterly dividend by Graham Holdings Company is a direct indicator of the company's ongoing commitment to return value to its shareholders. The dividend of $1.72 per share is a tangible distribution of profits and can be seen as a positive signal regarding the company's financial health and confidence in its cash flow stability. Investors often view regular dividends as a sign of a company's maturity and a reliable income stream, which can be particularly attractive in volatile market conditions.From a financial analysis perspective, the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the share price, is a critical metric for investors. If the declared dividend represents an increase, a decrease, or remains consistent with previous payouts, it can influence investor sentiment and stock valuation. It's also essential to assess the payout ratio, which is the proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. A sustainable payout ratio is typically below 75% for healthy companies, but this can vary depending on the industry.It is important to consider the opportunity cost of the dividends. The funds used for dividend payments could alternatively be reinvested into the company for potential growth or used for debt reduction. Shareholders might weigh these opportunity costs against the immediate benefit of receiving dividends. Market Research Analyst Examining the market context, Graham Holdings Company's dividend announcement may influence the stock's attractiveness to different types of investors. Income-focused investors, such as retirees seeking steady cash flows, might be drawn to the stock based on consistent dividend payments. On the other hand, growth-oriented investors might be less enthusiastic if they perceive that the dividend reflects a lack of lucrative reinvestment opportunities within the company.Additionally, the reaction of the stock market to dividend announcements can vary. While a dividend payment can sometimes lead to a short-term increase in stock price due to the perceived value it provides, over the long term, the stock's performance will depend on the company's overall financial health and growth prospects. It's also useful to compare the dividend yield and growth with industry peers to gauge competitiveness.In terms of market dynamics, a regular dividend can also serve as a stabilizing factor for the stock price, as it could reduce stock price volatility by providing a steady return, which might be particularly valued during periods of economic uncertainty or market turbulence. 02/23/2024 - 10:31 AM ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Graham Holdings Company (NYSE: GHC) today declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.72 per share, payable on May 9, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 18, 2024.

The collaboration aims to introduce a new DeFi paradigm with sustainable yield incentives. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic alliance between Bit Origin Ltd and Mner.Club represents a significant move within the crypto mining sector, which has seen substantial growth and volatility in recent years. The collaboration focuses on leveraging Bit Origin's expertise in crypto mining machine deployment and hosting, which is crucial for the scalability and efficiency of mining operations. The partnership could potentially increase Bit Origin's market share and influence within the industry, as successful deployment and hosting can lead to reduced operational costs and increased mining yields.The introduction of Mner.Club's Mineral Project, with its DeFi components, is particularly noteworthy. The use of BRC-20 and BRC-420 standards suggests an alignment with blockchain protocols that could facilitate wider adoption and interoperability within the crypto ecosystem. The emphasis on sustainable yield incentives and the DeFi flywheel concept could attract investors looking for innovative ways to generate returns in the volatile crypto market. If successful, this approach may set a new industry standard for how mining operations contribute to the broader DeFi space. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the strategic alliance has the potential to impact Bit Origin's revenue streams and profitability. By providing consulting and hosting services to Mner.Club, Bit Origin is diversifying its business model beyond just mining. This could mitigate the risks associated with the highly volatile crypto market. Furthermore, the periodic distributions from the Mineral Project could create a more predictable income, enhancing the financial stability of the company.Investors should monitor the company's operational efficiency and the performance of the Mineral Project. The success of the project could lead to an increase in Bit Origin's assets under management, particularly in Real World Assets (RWA) like mining machines. However, it is essential to consider the inherent risks of the crypto sector, including regulatory changes and market fluctuations, which could affect the long-term viability of such alliances and projects. Cryptocurrency Expert The alliance's focus on the deployment of crypto mining machines and the potential earnings distributions through staking introduces a combined approach to mining and DeFi strategies. The integration of foundational yield-generating assets into the DeFi sector is an innovative step that could provide a more sustainable and composability-focused framework for yield generation. The use of BRC-20 and BRC-420 standards indicates a commitment to leveraging blockchain technology that could enhance the project's compatibility with other DeFi protocols and applications.It is important to evaluate how the Mineral Project's design aligns with current DeFi trends, such as yield farming and liquidity mining and its ability to maintain competitive yields over time. The project's success will largely depend on its adoption rate within the crypto community and its resilience to the dynamic regulatory landscape governing digital assets. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bit Origin Ltd (NASDAQ: BTOG) (""Bit Origin"" or the ""Company""), an emerging growth company engaged in the crypto mining business with diversified expansion strategies, today announces it has entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement (“Agreement”) with Mner.Club for crypto miner deployment.

The Company discloses ""cash costs"" and ""all-in sustaining costs"" and other unit costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the Company's ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities. The Company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS, do not fully illustrate the ability of mines to generate cash flows. The measures, as determined under IFRS, are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities. The measures cash costs and all-in sustaining costs and unit costs are considered to be key indicators of a project's ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs, operating profit or cash flows presented under IFRS. Readers should also refer to our management's discussion and analysis, available under our corporate profile at www.sedarplus.ca for a more detailed discussion of how we calculate such measures.

(TLOFF) Chief External Affairs Officer Todd Malan led the public testimony on the Section 45X tax credit for critical minerals. Talon proposed solutions to support domestic mineral extraction. Positive None. Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 09:50 AM Washington, D.C.--(Newsfile Corp. - February 23, 2024) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC PINK: TLOFF) (""Talon"" or the ""Company"") Chief External Affairs Officer and Head of Climate Strategy Todd Malan was selected to lead the public testimony during yesterday's US Treasury's public hearing on Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit for Critical Minerals.""It was an honor to share Talon's perspective on how the 45X tax credit for critical minerals was intended by Congress to support domestic mineral extraction. We shared two proposals that we think respond to the Treasury Department's concerns about foreign sourced minerals qualifying for a domestic production incentive. If our proposals are adopted, they will provide long-term financial support to the domestic production of eligible critical minerals like nickel,"" Malan commented after addressing the Treasury/IRS panel. He added, ""As the IRA's support for secure supply chains in critical minerals is being challenged by Chinese oversupply of these minerals which is driving down prices, a comprehensive 45X tax credit that includes extraction of raw materials from the geology of the United States would be very timely support for the critical mineral supply chain.""Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is a production tax credit intending to incentivize investments in the full manufacturing supply chain of clean energy systems like electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Section 45X applies to the manufacturing of equipment used in solar, wind, hydrogen and batteries and also credits critical minerals production applying to specific elements in the periodic table. The list includes nickel, cobalt and platinum group metals that are all present in the high-grade ores that Talon plans to extract from the underground mine at the Tamarack Nickel Project (which is currently in the environmental review process conducted by Minnesota regulators and tribal sovereign governments as part of the State's permitting process).The 45X production tax credit for critical minerals is equal to 10% of the annual production cost of producing the specified element to a certain level of purity. Remarkably, the 45X tax credit for critical minerals does not decline over time or expire. Under IRS precedent, ""production cost"" would usually include the cost of acquiring raw materials along with employee costs, energy, depreciation of equipment etc. However, the US Treasury indicated in draft regulations issued on December 15, 2023, that it was withholding allowing the cost of raw materials from the calculation of production cost for the 45X critical minerals tax credit to further study potential abuse and how it could allow raw materials cost to be included consistent with the intent of Congress. Today's hearing was part of an effort to obtain input from experts and stakeholders on this specific question. Talon believes that Congress created this extraordinary tax credit for critical minerals to benefit the entire U.S. supply chain for critical minerals from mining to recycling. Also, the statutory language clearly states that the 45X tax credit only applies to production that occurs within the United States or its possessions. In the case of applicable critical minerals, the mineral is the component, so it stands to reason that only the cost of extraction of such mineral (in its raw form) occurring in the US or its possessions should qualify for the 45X tax credit in calculating the cost of production of such mineral. Malan explained to the Treasury and IRS panel that Talon remains committed to President Biden's vision for responsible mining and securing America's critical mineral supply chains. He pointed out that producing sustainably sourced critical minerals has national security implications given Chinese and Russian dominance of critical minerals like nickel. Malan outlined Talon's recommendation to the Treasury that a taxpayer producing an applicable critical mineral as specified in the law should be able to include the full cost of purchasing the ""source material"" or ore in the calculation of the 45X tax credit. To include raw materials cost in the calculation of production cost of the critical mineral to the specific level of purity, the taxpayer would need to obtain: Certification that the raw materials (mined ore that is physically processed prior to refining) has a chemical characteristic (assay) that indicates that it is the source of the final eligible critical mineral;Certification that the raw materials were extracted from the geology of the United States;Certification that such supplier has not itself claimed the 45X tax credit with regard to any of the same costs; andCertification that such supplier has not provided certification related to any of the same costs to any other entity.Talon believes this ""Buy American"" proposal for adding raw materials extraction cost to the calculation of production cost using definitions under § 1.263A - applied to raw materials extracted in the US -- is easily administrable, addresses the concerns of the Treasury Department that it must ensure that ""foreign minerals"" cannot benefit from the 45X tax credit, and is consistent with the intent of Congress in enacting 45X as applied to critical minerals: to cover the full US sourced supply chain required to produce eligible applicable critical minerals. Malan's full statement can be found here.

Healthcare Industry Analyst The infusion of capital into Tuned, a digital hearing health company, underscores a burgeoning trend within the healthcare benefits sector where employers are increasingly prioritizing holistic health services. The investment led by Unum Group, a prominent player in employee benefits, marks a strategic move to address a significant yet under-served health concern in the workforce: hearing health. The economic impact of untreated hearing issues, which can cost employers up to $9,100 per person annually, highlights the potential cost savings and productivity gains for businesses that invest in preventive health measures.From a market perspective, Tuned's comprehensive approach, which spans from prevention to intervention, is poised to disrupt traditional models of hearing care that focus primarily on treatment. This shift aligns with broader healthcare trends emphasizing preventive care to reduce long-term costs. Tuned's growth trajectory, including the expansion of its audiologist team and the development of new offerings, indicates a scaling of operations that could capture a larger market share in the employee benefits space. Financial Analyst The seed extension of $3.2 million, bringing Tuned's total funds to $8.2 million, reflects investor confidence in the company's business model and growth potential. The focus on preventive hearing health as a component of employee benefits packages could serve as a differentiator in the competitive talent acquisition landscape. By targeting the 60 percent of the workforce experiencing unaddressed hearing issues, Tuned is tapping into a sizable demographic, which could translate into a significant revenue stream.Furthermore, the introduction of Tuned's STAR solution for OSHA compliance and the pediatric benefit offering represent strategic product diversification.

The implementation of its STAR solution indicates a proactive approach to meeting federal OSHA regulations, which could mitigate risks for employers and reduce the incidence of work-related hearing loss.

The 'rising tide, building blocks' model aims to integrate disparate technologies with AI capabilities to drive revenue and equity ownership across all connected companies in the ecosystem. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The AdTech industry is experiencing significant growth, with projections indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.7% leading to a market size of $2.9 trillion by 2031. This growth trajectory presents substantial opportunities for companies like Collective Audience, Inc. to innovate and capture market share. The 'rising tide, building blocks' model, as introduced by Collective Audience, is a strategic approach aimed at fostering integration and leveraging AI to enhance the digital advertising ecosystem. This model could potentially streamline operations and improve targeting efficiency, which is crucial in a sector where the precision of ad delivery can significantly impact the bottom line.By focusing on acquiring companies and forming joint ventures, Collective Audience is positioning itself as a consolidator in the fragmented AdTech space. This strategy could lead to economies of scale and a more robust competitive stance against industry giants such as Google. It's important to note that the success of this model hinges on the effective integration of acquired technologies and the ability to drive synergistic benefits across the ecosystem. Investors should monitor the execution of these strategic acquisitions and partnerships, as they will be critical in determining the company's ability to realize its growth projections and enhance shareholder value. Financial Analyst The announcement made by Collective Audience, Inc. underscores a forward-looking approach to value creation, both for the enterprise and its shareholders. The proprietary model the company plans to implement aims to leverage acquisitions and joint ventures to drive revenue and equity ownership. This model suggests a proactive capital deployment strategy, which, if managed effectively, could result in exponential revenue growth and diversification of the company's revenue streams.Investors should consider the implications of this strategy on the company's financial health, including the potential for increased debt levels, dilution of existing shares, or the impact on cash reserves through the process of acquisitions. It is also essential to evaluate the company's track record in integrating new businesses and technologies, as this will be a significant determinant of the long-term return on investment. The comparison of Collective Audience's model to that of Google, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway provides a bold vision, yet it remains imperative to scrutinize the operational execution and financial discipline that will be required to emulate such successful conglomerates. Legal Expert Collective Audience, Inc.'s strategy to expand through acquisitions and joint ventures brings with it a host of legal considerations and potential regulatory scrutiny. As the company embarks on this growth path, it will need to navigate antitrust laws, particularly if its acquisitions are significant enough to alter market dynamics. Moreover, the integration of disparate technologies and the creation of an open digital advertising ecosystem may raise data privacy concerns, especially given the increasing global focus on consumer data protection.It is crucial for the company to ensure compliance with all relevant laws and regulations as it pursues its expansion strategy. This includes conducting thorough due diligence on potential acquisition targets and joint venture partners to mitigate legal risks. Investors should be aware of the legal complexities involved in such a growth model, as they can have material implications on the company's operations and financial performance. The legal landscape of the AdTech industry is complex and rapidly evolving and Collective Audience's ability to adeptly manage these legal challenges will be essential to its success and the protection of shareholder interests. 02/23/2024 - 08:31 AM NEW YORK, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Collective Audience, Inc.

Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 09:44 AM NEW YORK, NY, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – CGrowth Capital Inc. (OTC: CGRA) is a public holding company for alternative and undervalued assets. The company is sector and industry agnostic and currently consists of two divisions including Mining and Sports Technology. The company is focused on investing in growth-oriented opportunities where the company’s capital, expertise, and capabilities can help create significant added value for shareholders. CGRA Mining Inc. is excited to announce the successful completion of field mapping and sampling aimed at determining the potential for Lithium (Li) deposits on selected prospecting concessions owned by CGRA in the Dodoma Region of Tanzania. Following the appointment of Metminec (Pty) Ltd to execute this exploration project, the work has now been independently verified by competent persons in accordance with the industry standards of JORC, SAMREC, and NI 43-101. The comprehensive Geology Report, along with the Magnetic Data Processing & Interpretation Report, is now available for review on the CGRA Mining website. During the field mapping phase, thirty-two rock samples were collected and subsequently submitted to the SGS Laboratory in Mwanza, Tanzania, for geochemical analysis using ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry). The primary objective of this analysis was to determine the presence of economically significant elements, particularly lithium, within these rock types. To date, analytical results for twenty-four samples have been received, revealing that twenty-two contain traces of lithium, with the highest recorded content at 44 parts per million (ppm). Additionally, most samples have shown ratios indicative of potential rare element enrichment, further underscoring the area's potential for lithium extraction. This discovery is particularly significant, as the concession area is characterized by pegmatites, geological formations renowned for their capacity to host substantial deposits of spodumene. Spodumene, a critical lithium aluminum inosilicate mineral, is one of the most concentrated sources of lithium, making it highly sought after for extraction. Its extractive efficiency gives it a notable advantage over other lithium sources, such as lithium brines. Unlike these other sources, spodumene can be mined and processed in a more straightforward and predictable manner, making the mining process well established and preferable for lithium extraction. Encouragingly, the positive samples collected span both the southern and northern portions of the project area, suggesting a widespread dispersion of lithium across the entire project. This uniform distribution is a positive indicator of the extensive presence of lithium-bearing rock, enhancing the potential for a sizeable and economically viable resource. Further detailed exploration and analysis will now be undertaken to assess the full scope of this promising distribution and to ascertain the precise grade and volume of the potentially hugely significant lithium deposit that has been uncovered. Following Metminec's recommendation, the positive samples have been dispatched to South Africa for further analysis at the SGS Laboratory, utilizing the ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) instrument. This advanced technique is expected to provide a deeper analysis of the collected samples, ensuring the highest levels of precision. Additionally, SGS has been requested to employ XRD (X-ray Diffraction) analytical techniques to further assist in the identification and quantification of the minerals within the provided rock samples. “The results announced today not only justify the unwavering belief management has held in this project from the outset but also bring immense satisfaction as this belief is now supported by concrete, undeniable, and unquestionable evidence. This milestone is a testament to our team's dedication and the potential we envisioned from the very beginning of this project. These findings are particularly encouraging, given that they have been obtained from only 10% of our overall tenement area, which in total spans more than 500 square kilometers. This early success hints at the vast potential that remains untapped across the larger concession, underscoring the need for further exploration. Moreover, this exciting hard rock spodumene discovery, coupled with the resurgence in the lithium sector, instils great confidence in our team and highlights the exceptional potential this project has. In response to this significant milestone, we have instructed the Metminec team to immediately undertake follow-up sampling and drilling at the locations showing the highest traces of lithium and to continue working towards the completion of our Preliminary Economic Assessment during Q2 of this year,” commented Nicolas Link, Chairman of CGrowth Capital Inc.

Financial Analyst The recent financing completed by Biofrontera Inc. represents a strategic capital infusion that is poised to bolster the company's research and development initiatives and support its commercial growth. The structure of the deal, involving both Series B-1 and Series B-3 Convertible Preferred Stock alongside warrants, is indicative of investor confidence in the company's potential to meet operational and commercial milestones.The conversion mechanism of the preferred stock into common stock at a fixed price, along with the milestone-based second tranche of financing, is designed to align investor interests with corporate performance. This financing approach can potentially dilute existing shareholders but also provides the company with necessary capital to advance its lead product, Ameluz, for additional indications. The use of proceeds for general business operations and ongoing activities highlights the company's commitment to leveraging the funds to drive growth.Furthermore, the involvement of healthcare-focused institutional investors and the role of Roth Capital Partners as the exclusive agent underscore the transaction's credibility and the targeted approach towards investors with expertise in the biopharmaceutical sector. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and the ability of a company like Biofrontera to secure sizable funding is a testament to its market position and the perceived value of its dermatologic products. The financing news could influence the company's stock performance, as it directly impacts Biofrontera's operational capabilities and its ability to invest in commercial growth.Investors and market analysts often view such financing rounds as indicators of a company's future prospects. The specifics of the funding, such as the potential for dilution and the milestone-based second tranche, will be closely monitored by the market. The anticipation of meeting operational and commercial milestones by Q2 of 2024 suggests a timeline for evaluating the company's progress and potential stock price implications. Legal Expert It is important to note the regulatory framework under which this private placement was conducted. The offering was made under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D, which exempts certain transactions from the registration requirements. This allows Biofrontera to raise capital efficiently, although it limits the offering to accredited investors.The commitment to file a resale registration statement with the SEC for the common stock underscores the company's adherence to regulatory obligations and provides a pathway for liquidity to investors.

Electric Wind Power has a wealth of experience in international cooperation, brought its most advanced wind power technology and products, along with its most experienced team, to the Hai Anh Wind Farm Project. The Company's global green energy development strategy facilitates the transnational flow of clean and efficient energy while increasing the energy supplies of partnering countries. This optimizes the local energy consumption structure and drives green and low-carbon development around the globe. The Hai Anh Wind Farm Project is the Company's first wind power project in Vietnam and is utilizing Electric Wind Power's WH5.25-172 wind turbine unit, which boasts the largest onshore wind turbine diameter in the Vietnamese market to date.

XCOM RAN supports industrial automation, stadium streaming, enterprise, mining, and extended reality applications, meeting high-performance requirements. Positive None. Negative None. Telecommunications Industry Analyst The announcement by Globalstar, Inc. regarding the commercial availability of XCOM RAN marks a significant development in the telecommunications sector, particularly within the 5G infrastructure space. This technology, which purports to deliver capacity gains of over four times compared to baseline 5G networks, addresses some of the key challenges faced by dense wireless applications, such as spectrum efficiency and seamless mobility.From an industry perspective, the ability to eliminate handoff boundaries and reduce interference is a considerable advancement. This could lead to more stable and reliable connections, a critical factor for applications that require uninterrupted connectivity, such as industrial automation and extended reality. The scalability and economical benefits of XCOM RAN are also noteworthy, as they suggest a lower total cost of ownership and easier expansion for businesses adopting this technology.The deployment by a major global retailer serves as a validation of the technology's potential and may act as a catalyst for further adoption across various industries. The integration with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and compatibility with AI-driven applications indicates a broad applicability, from micro-fulfillment centers to large stadiums, which could disrupt the current market for in-building solutions such as small cells and DAS. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Globalstar's XCOM RAN technology could be substantial for the company and its investors. The initial deployment with a leading global retailer suggests not only a potential increase in revenue streams but also a strategic positioning within the 5G infrastructure market. The company's focus on high-performance, high-reliability requirements for warehouse automation indicates a targeting of high-value, mission-critical applications, potentially leading to higher-margin business opportunities.Globalstar's emphasis on a future-proof design and the mention of deliveries expected in 2024 suggest a long-term revenue generation strategy. This could be appealing to investors looking for growth in the tech sector, particularly in companies that are innovating within the rapidly expanding 5G ecosystem. However, the actual financial impact will depend on the technology's adoption rate post-deployment and the ability of Globalstar to secure additional contracts beyond the initial sale. Market Research Analyst The market for private 5G networks is rapidly growing as businesses seek to capitalize on the benefits of 5G technology for their specific needs. The introduction of XCOM RAN by Globalstar could potentially reshape the competitive landscape of private 5G network solutions. Its ability to support high-capacity and seamless mobility is particularly relevant for sectors with dense wireless deployments, such as manufacturing, retail and entertainment.Furthermore, the use of Open RAN (ORAN) architecture aligns with the industry's move towards more open and interoperable networks, which could facilitate wider adoption by reducing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation. The technology's alignment with current trends, such as the integration with extended reality and support for AI-driven applications, indicates a keen understanding of market needs and could position Globalstar as a leader in this niche segment. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM Provides >4X increased capacity gains over baseline 5G NR Systems Eliminates handoff boundaries Scales easily and economically Being deployed by one of the world's largest global retailers due to its ease of use, flexibility, and future-proof design COVINGTON, La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE American: GSAT) today announced the commercial availability of XCOM RAN, a multipoint radio access network (RAN) that delivers greater capacity and coverage in dense 5G wireless applications with significantly more efficient use of spectrum. XCOM RAN supports high capacity and seamless mobility that allows optimizing applications such as industrial automation systems, stadium streaming services, enterprises, campuses, mining, and extended reality. Globalstar’s XCOM RAN, which was chosen for initial deployment at select sites by a large global retailer, delivers at least 4x higher capacity gains than traditional private 5G systems both in the downlink and uplink. XCOM RAN meets the high-performance, high-reliability requirements of warehouse automation, offering ease of use and higher efficiencies within a scalable design. Globalstar is providing its connectivity solution comprising hardware, software, and services, with several systems expected to be delivered in 2024. Built on Open RAN (ORAN) architecture, XCOM RAN features joint processing algorithms that support superior end-to-end system performance, eliminating handoff boundaries and interference conditions while allowing users to scale quickly and economically. ""With XCOM RAN, we set out to apply our decades of wireless system design experience into creating transformative and differentiated performance for private wireless 5G networks and beyond. We have significantly increased the amount of data that can be transmitted over a given spectrum allocation, while improving other performance measures — all within a flexible solution that provides the ability for future performance improvements,"" said Dr. Paul E. Jacobs, CEO of Globalstar. “The many benefits of XCOM RAN support the imperatives of our initial customer to control costs and maximize revenue in their demanding and mission critical application."" According to research firm Signal Research Group, “The XCOM technology differs from traditional inbuilding solutions — such as small cells and DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems)— in that it provides extremely high downlink and uplink capacity that can be both ubiquitous and highly concentrated in nature. Further, it achieves these performance gains within a single logical cell comprised of multiple RRU (Remote Radio Units). The results are that inter-cell interference is nonexistent and there are no interruptions due to cell handovers. Most impressive, the bidirectional capacity gains documented were largely immune to the location and concentration of the devices in the network.” Globalstar Vice President of Terrestrial Network Tamer Kadous said, “5G private networks are used for many applications. While XCOM RAN can benefit the entire spectrum of use cases, it stands out when addressing the most demanding KPIs. I am delighted to see the culmination of our intensive efforts over the past few years with the launch of our first product, and proud that our first commercial sale is with one of the world’s largest retailers.” XCOM RAN technology lends itself to a variety of use applications: Micro fulfillment Center (MFC), Warehouse, Retail, Manufacturing: XCOM RAN integrates with programable logic controllers (PLC) and scales easily with additional Radio Units – providing significant performance and capacity gains as compared to traditional small cell and DAS systems. Stadiums and Arenas: XCOM RAN technology integrates seamlessly with 5G streaming services to enable fans inside the stadium with access to high-definition multimedia services. Enterprises, Campuses, Mining, and dense wireless deployments: XCOM RAN technology helps organizations enhance the 5G experience by optimizing their private wireless capabilities by speeding up operations and supporting AI-driven applications. Extended Reality / Augmented Reality: XCOM RAN technology integrates with VR head mounted displays (HMDs) to push extended reality content for diverse applications, from aiding in medical procedures and enhancing navigation and gaming experiences to revolutionizing shopping.

Despite strong revenues, the company faced challenges such as increased labor costs in Mexico and specific business situations affecting profitability. FEMSA highlighted the growth in Proximity Americas and Coca-Cola FEMSA, as well as the strategic initiatives to reach leverage objectives in the coming years. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The growth in Total Consolidated Revenues by 4.6% for FEMSA in 4Q23 compared to 4Q22 indicates a positive trend in the company's overall performance. This is particularly noteworthy given the challenging macroeconomic conditions and tough comparison bases from previous quarters. The expansion of Proximity Americas by 14.2% is significant, as it suggests a successful strategy in store expansion and an ability to maintain high-single-digit comparable sales at OXXO, which is a key driver for the company's retail growth.However, the report of increased labor costs in Mexico and other specific situations affecting profitability is a concern for investors, as it may signal rising operational costs that could impact future margins. While the company's strategic focus on capital allocation and leverage reduction is reassuring, it will be important to monitor how these cost pressures are managed in the coming quarters. Financial Analyst The decline in Income from Operations for FEMSA Consolidated (-1.4% for 4Q23 and -6.4% year-to-date) is a red flag that needs to be examined closely. This decline, amidst an increase in revenues, suggests that the company is facing margin compression, possibly due to the aforementioned labor costs and other expenses. Investors should assess the sustainability of the company's earnings, particularly in the Health segment, which reported a significant decrease in profitability with a 43.5% drop in Income from Operations for 4Q23.Additionally, the strong performance of Coca-Cola FEMSA, with both volume and revenue growth, is indicative of effective market penetration and product demand. This performance is a positive sign for the company's beverage segment and could be a stabilizing factor against the volatility seen in other segments. Economist The report mentions a challenging macro environment, particularly in Europe where Valora achieved substantial growth. This is an interesting contrast to the global economic headwinds, suggesting that FEMSA's diversification strategy and presence in different markets may be providing some resilience. The mention of a strategic plan aiming to reach a leverage objective within two to three years is also of interest. This suggests that the company is prioritizing financial stability and debt management, which is crucial in an environment where interest rates may fluctuate and affect borrowing costs.Furthermore, the growth in the company's digital segment, with Spin by OXXO and Spin Premia showing substantial active user growth, reflects the ongoing trend of digital transformation in retail. The average tender of 31.0% for Spin Premia indicates a strong customer engagement, which could translate into higher sales and customer loyalty in the long run. 02/23/2024 - 08:33 AM MONTERREY, Mexico, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.

Revenues were robust, even as we cycled tough comparison bases at certain business units. However, on the expense side we felt more directly the cumulative effect from increased labor costs in Mexico, as well as some business- and country-specific situations that impacted our profitability. “Proximity Americas increased revenues by more than 14%, driven by high-single-digit comparable sales at OXXO and reflecting an accelerated store expansion, while we continued to see healthy growth trends in South America and across formats. In Europe, Valora achieved a strong operating result with substantial growth in a challenging macro environment. FEMSA Health delivered stable revenues, but a deteriorating dynamic in the institutional business in Colombia hurt our profitability. For its part, Coca-Cola FEMSA again delivered strong results across its income statement, while Digital@FEMSA continued to add users at a brisk pace. “On the strategic front, we recently provided incremental information regarding our capital allocation framework, and we stand ready to begin executing the plan in order to reach our stated leverage objective within two to three years. “In short, we wrapped up a unique year that was transformational on the strategic front, with remarkable results resulting from our FEMSA Forward strategy. Today, we are a leaner, more focused company, ideally positioned to pursue and capture the most compelling opportunity set we have ever had before us.

Time charter revenues also decreased due to lower average charter rates, partially offset by increased ownership days from vessel acquisitions. The company declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per share. Positive None. Negative Decrease in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 2022 Decrease in time charter revenues for 2023 compared to 2022 Earnings per share decline in 2023 compared to 2022 Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Diana Shipping Inc. indicate a significant year-over-year decline in net income and earnings per share (EPS), which are critical metrics for investors assessing the company's profitability. The decrease in net income from $25.7 million in Q4 2022 to $9.4 million in Q4 2023, alongside a drop in EPS from $0.28 to $0.08, suggests a contraction in profitability that may concern shareholders. This contraction is attributed to lower average charter rates, a key indicator of market demand and pricing power within the dry bulk shipping industry.Despite the decline in charter rates, the company's strategy to offset this through increased ownership days via vessel acquisitions demonstrates a growth-oriented approach. However, investors may scrutinize the effectiveness of this strategy given the overall decline in revenue and net income. The dividend declaration of $0.075 per share, while providing immediate cash return to shareholders, may be evaluated in the context of the company's reduced earnings and its impact on future capital allocation and financial flexibility. Market Research Analyst The dry bulk shipping market is influenced by global trade volumes, commodity prices and fleet supply-demand dynamics. Diana Shipping's performance, reflected in the reduced time charter revenues from $75.7 million in Q4 2022 to $60.0 million in Q4 2023, may signal broader market trends such as oversupply or decreased demand for dry bulk commodities. Understanding these market forces is essential for stakeholders to anticipate future performance and strategic decisions by the company.Moreover, the shipping industry is cyclic and sensitive to macroeconomic factors. The decrease in average charter rates could be a result of macroeconomic headwinds, trade disputes, or changes in shipping routes. Stakeholders should consider these external factors when evaluating the company's ability to rebound or sustain profitability in a challenging market environment. Economist An economist's perspective on Diana Shipping's financial results would highlight the potential macroeconomic implications of their reported decline in revenue and net income. For instance, the reduced demand for shipping could be indicative of a slowdown in international trade, which may have broader economic consequences. Additionally, the impact of inflation on operational costs and the potential for rate volatility in the shipping industry could be areas of concern.The company's performance must also be contextualized within the economic climate of 2023, considering factors such as interest rate trends, currency fluctuations and global economic policies. These elements can significantly affect the profitability of shipping companies and their ability to maintain dividends, invest in fleet expansion, or navigate market downturns. 02/23/2024 - 08:39 AM ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diana Shipping Inc.

The decrease in time charter revenues, compared to the same quarter of last year, was due to decreased average charter rates. This decrease was partly offset by increased ownership days that resulted from vessel acquisitions. Net income for 2023, amounted to $49.8 million and net income attributed to common stockholders amounted to $44.1 million. This compares to net income of $119.1 million and net income attributed to common stockholders of $113.3 million, for 2022. Time charter revenues for 2023 were $262.1 million, compared to $290.0 million for 2022. Earnings per share was $0.44 basic and $0.42 diluted, compared to earnings per share of $1.42 basic and $1.36 diluted in 2022.

Voyage expenses include port charges, bunker (fuel) expenses or gain, canal charges and commissions. TCE is a non-GAAP measure. TCE rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters are generally expressed in such amounts. (2) Daily vessel operating expenses, which include crew wages and related costs, the cost of insurance, expenses relating to repairs and maintenance, the costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses, are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period.

The Company aims to expand the capacity of its Michigan facility up to 300 MWs and significantly grow the Montana sites. Sentinum plans to become a leader in high-density computing and AI operations, seeking infrastructure financing and partnerships for expansion. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic plan by Ault Alliance to expand and specialize its data center operations in Michigan and Montana represents a significant investment in the infrastructure required for advanced computing and AI. The targeted increase to 300 megawatts of capacity in Michigan is indicative of a substantial scale-up, which could position the company as a competitive player in the hyperscale data center market. The focus on AI development and the relocation of Bitcoin mining operations to Montana align with industry trends of specialization and sustainability.The potential impact on the business is two-fold. First, it could attract large-scale clients in need of significant computational power, particularly those in the AI sector. Second, the emphasis on eco-friendly power sources can enhance the company's reputation and align with the growing demand for sustainable operations. However, the success of this expansion hinges on securing adequate funding and strategic partnerships, which poses a risk if not realized. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the expansion plan by Ault Alliance requires a critical evaluation of the capital investment against the anticipated return on investment. The mention of infrastructure financing and partnership exploration suggests that the company is actively seeking to mitigate the financial risk associated with such a significant capital outlay. The current and projected demand for AI and high-density computing services will be a crucial determinant in the financial viability of this expansion.Investors should monitor the company's ability to secure the necessary funding and partnerships, as these factors will significantly influence the project's timeline and success. The long-term benefits could include diversified revenue streams and increased market share, but these must be weighed against the upfront costs and the ongoing operational expenses associated with running and maintaining high-capacity data centers. Sustainability Expert The focus on eco-friendly power in Ault Alliance's data center expansion is a strategic move that aligns with global sustainability trends. By leveraging renewable energy sources, the company not only reduces its carbon footprint but also anticipates future regulatory changes that may favor or mandate the use of clean energy. This approach can provide a competitive edge, as clients increasingly prioritize environmental considerations in their vendor selection process.However, the sustainability aspect also requires a detailed analysis of the energy mix and the potential for scalability. The company's commitment to eco-friendly power must be backed by a robust infrastructure that can reliably support the high demands of AI and large language model infrastructure. The long-term sustainability of operations is contingent upon continuous improvements in energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energy technologies. 02/23/2024 - 09:00 AM LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ault Alliance, Inc.

The Company plans to relocate, when possible, its Bitcoin mining operations to the Montana data center and to focus its Michigan facility solely on artificial intelligence (“AI”) hyperscale development. To support these plans, the Company is targeting to expand the capacity of its Michigan facility up to 300 megawatts (“MWs”), as well as a significant expansion of the Montana sites. Building on the foundation of the Michigan site, acquired three years ago and currently boasting approximately 30 MWs of energized capacity, Sentinum seeks to become a leader in hosting high-density computing and AI hyperscale operations. The initiative aims to significantly enhance power capacity at both sites, with the Company actively seeking infrastructure financing and exploring partnerships to ensure full funding for the expansion. Sentinum serves the AI and data processing sectors, providing critical colocation and hosting solutions through its wholly owned subsidiary, Alliance Cloud Services, LLC. The Michigan data center, located in southern Michigan, utilizes approximately 100,000 square feet within a larger 617,000 square foot building, located on a 34.5-acre site. Situated advantageously near power sources, it currently utilizes 28 MWs of eco-friendly power, with plans to increase capacity up to approximately 300MWs over the next three to five years, pending adequate funding. In addition, Sentinum is on track to have its new facility in Montana operational by March 2024, initially boosting power capacity by 10MWs, and has current capacity of approximately 20MWs, with a vision for further expansion. Sentinum believes that the capacity of the Montana sites can be significantly expanded and has begun an electrical load study in collaboration with the local utility to explore potential power upgrades. Sentinum anticipates expanding the capacity at Montana to the extent possible, after determination of the completed load study, subject to additional funding. Milton “Todd” Ault III, Founder and Executive Chairman of Ault Alliance, commented on the strategic vision and market response, stating, “Our foresight into the data center domain, together with the potential impact of AI, has positioned us at the cusp of what we believe will be significant growth. The current interest in our Michigan site and increased demand we are seeing in the market underscore the critical role of AI in shaping the future of the Company. We are fully committed to capitalizing on this momentum, steering Ault Alliance towards becoming a significant player in the AI-driven technological landscape.” The expansion efforts highlight Sentinum’s readiness to invest in substantial growth potential, with a keen interest in partnerships and financial avenues to support these ambitions. William B. Horne, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, emphasized, “Our strategic efforts in Michigan and Montana are a testament to our commitment to expanding our technology infrastructure. By actively seeking financing and strategic partnerships, we are laying the groundwork for substantial advancements in our capacity to support the AI and large language model infrastructure needs.” If successful in securing the necessary resources, this ambitious expansion would allow Sentinum to scale its operations and reinforce its position as a technology sector company, committed to advancing digital transformation and sustainability.

(OTC: SIRCD) (“SIRC” or “the Company”), an integrated, single-source solutions provider of solar power, roofing and EV charging systems provides updates on 2 major projects happening with the SIRC Family of Companies. The Solar Gard roofing project is being managed by McKay Roofing and the UCLA Medical Center - Olive View EV Charging Installation Project is being managed by PLEMCo. “Both of these projects are progressing nicely even when taking rain delays into account,” says Mohammad Suri, COO. “Sourcing materials remains the biggest challenge on many levels, but our teams have managed to work through delays and still deliver major milestones for our customers,” adds Suri. Solar Gard ProjectThis project involves the installation of a coating system over the existing roofing material. The new coating system is Title 24 compliant and has a 20-year lifespan. This project involves a 2-part process where the first coat covers the roof, and the second coat applies an acrylic coating with granules. This makes the roof safe for pedestrians to walk across when they need to access the roof for mechanical maintenance. The project should wrap up in 6-8 weeks, weather permitting. Overview of roof area to be coated. Roof before first coat (left) and roof after first coat (right). UCLA Medical Center - Olive View As mentioned in previous releases, the first phase of UCLA Medical Center - Olive View included the design portion for the installation of 33 EV Charging Stations. PLEMCo was awarded this bid and subsequently the 2nd phase involving the installation of the chargers. During phase 2, the scope of work includes performing the required saw cutting, trenching, backfilling and surfacing of the impacted lot by restoring to its original condition. In addition, this phase includes the installation of and electrically connecting the EV infrastructure by incorporating the wiring devices and all necessary associated components for a fully functional system including testing of the chargers. California mandates designated ADA accessible ports and that is also included in the project. To date, trenching and conduit is complete with asphalt roughly 90% completed. In addition, the wall construction which houses the 2 transformers, 3 disconnects and one panel is anticipated to be completed the first week of March with the overall project being completed mid-June.

1847 Holdings’ Hunt For Small Business Gems: How This PE Firm Finds Its Diamonds In The Rough,2024-02-23T13:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"1847 Holdings LLC (EFSH) showcases successful exits despite occasional losses, a diversified acquisition holding company based in New York City.","1847 Holdings’ Hunt For Small Business Gems: How This PE Firm Finds Its Diamonds In The Rough Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary 1847 Holdings LLC (EFSH) showcases successful exits despite occasional losses, a diversified acquisition holding company based in New York City. Positive None. Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 23, 2024 / Not every investment is going to be a slam dunk, but 1847 Holdings LLC (NYSE American:EFSH) seems to have some exits under its belt that prove how enough success can overshadow any losses. The publicly traded diversified acquisition holding company hailing out of New York City acquires small businesses with about $5 million of EBITDA and then deploys resources to strengthen the enterprise and improve operations. All that work can lead to a sale or IPO, often at a much higher valuation than 1847 Holdings paid. In other instances 1847 Holdings will hold on to the asset, contributing to the company's ability to pay regular and special dividends to investors. Take the IPO of 1847 Goedeker's, now going by Polish.com Inc. as one example. In April 2019, 1847 Holdings paid $6.5 million for the online purveyor of appliances, furniture and home goods. By June of 2021 when it went public, the company was valued at roughly $60 million. ""Our investors were able to sell the shares in what was a fairly robust market,"" says Ellery W. Roberts, founder and CEO. ""It's been rewarding and we're excited about the opportunity to invest capital in the businesses that we have that we believe are going in the right direction, all the while looking at new opportunities to expand our platform going forward.""Seeking Successful ExitsThat successful exit is an example of what 1847 may be able to do with its other portfolio companies which include Wolo, the maker of horn and safety products for cars, trucks and emergency vehicles which it acquired for $8.3 million in March 2021, and ICU Eyewear Holdings Inc., a designer of over-the-counter (OTC), non-prescription reading glasses, sunglasses, blue light blocking eyewear, sun readers and outdoor specialty sunglasses which 1847 Holdings bought for $4.5 million in February 2023, among others. The idea is to find those diamonds in the rough, grow their businesses and then either sell them for a higher price or hold on to them, benefiting from their improved business conditions.Not Your Normal PE Firm1847 Holdings isn't your run-of-the-mill private equity firm. Unlike traditional private equity firms that create massive funds for investors, 1847 Holdings' shareholders have stock in each individual operating entity the firm owns. ""With us you're not investing in the manager you're actually investing in the underlying operating subsidiaries,"" says Roberts. ""Our investors get shares in the additional entities or they benefit from the increase in asset value of our holding company.""When it comes to the small businesses 1847 Holdings acquires, it looks for those gems that have a clearly identifiable blueprint for growth with the potential for breakout returns, are well positioned within their respective industry and have potential value that can be created by building the management team, infrastructure and access to capital. Furthermore, acquisition targets must be headquartered in North America, and the business has to have revenues of $5 million or more, as well as a current EBITDA/pre-tax income of a minimum of $1.5 million and a history of positive cash flow.Small Business Market In Need Of Reliable Acquirers1847 Holdings opted to focus on small businesses because the M&A market for these companies is fragmented, providing an opportunity for 1847 Holdings to purchase them at cheaper valuations. Businesses with values of more than $50 million tend to get 30% more valuation premiums than enterprises with less than $50 million, says 1847 Holdings. That's typically because there are fewer potential buyers, third-party financing is harder to come by and sellers tend to worry about non-economic things such as keeping the board and/or protecting employees which can dilute the price. That provides an opportunity for 1847 Holdings to swoop in and get the asset at a favorable price.But identifying the diamond in the rough to acquire is only one reason why 1847 Holdings thinks it has an edge. It is also a diligent portfolio manager to the companies it oversees. Not only does 1847 Holdings have weekly meetings with management and quarterly board meetings but it actively helps the companies develop operating metrics, sales and financial reporting and establishes governance and other best practices, ensuring the business is running lean, efficiently and profitably. That value is passed on to 1847 Holdings' investors.Furthermore, 1847 Holdings' fixed costs as a holding company are becoming a smaller part of the overall equation as it adds more assets. ""We've reached the scale that we need so the incremental dollars or profits added from each new operating entity that we acquire, a disproportionate amount of their profits flow through to the bottom line,"" says Roberts. That is showing up in the company's results. In the third quarter of 2023 revenue increased 29.8% year-over-year and gross profits increased 64.9%. Roberts attributes that to the strength of the company's platform and its ability to support the growth and profitability of its portfolio companies. As for this year, 1847 Holdings expects more of the same.With small businesses accounting for 99.9% of all businesses, they are the backbone of America, and many are undervalued because they lack access to capital and the business experience to grow and prosper. For a select few, 1847 Holdings can help them do that all the while enriching its shareholder base.Featured photo by Riccardo Annandale on Unsplash.Contact:Ellery Robertseroberts@1847holdings.comSOURCE: 1847 Holdings LLCView the original press release on accesswire.com What is the ticker symbol for 1847 Holdings LLC?

(“FEMSA” or the “Company”) (NYSE: FMX; BMV: FEMSAUBD, FEMSAUB) announced today that, as part of its commitment to the FEMSA Forward strategy, it is implementing changes in its corporate organization. Consistent with the FEMSA Forward strategy, each of our three core business verticals will continue strengthening their already robust teams to ensure they capture the significant growth opportunities ahead of them. Their size and complexity require a strong team, dedicated to the execution of their strategies, and the achievement of their business objectives. Our FEMSA corporate organization will focus on setting the overall strategic direction and providing guidance and support for the core businesses, including all major strategic, financial, and capital market-related matters. In this context, and having largely concluded the transformational transactions stemming from FEMSA Forward, today we are announcing two changes in FEMSA’s senior leadership team. Francisco Camacho Beltrán, FEMSA’s Chief Corporate Officer, has decided to complete his cycle at the Company and pursue new professional challenges, stepping down from his role effective April 30, 2024. Since joining the Company in 2020, Francisco successfully led most of the corporate functions of FEMSA, while also playing a pivotal role in defining FEMSA’s Strategic Priorities Framework, ensuring its alignment with the new FEMSA Forward strategy, and coordinating the development of the current long-range plans of FEMSA and its business units. He leaves the Company with a clear roadmap for sustained growth, and in an enviable position to meet all the ambitious goals that the Company has set in its sustainability efforts. Eugenio Garza y Garza, FEMSA’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has also decided to finish his cycle at the Company and step down as CFO effective April 30, 2024. Since joining FEMSA in 2018, Eugenio has played an instrumental role in the strategic and corporate development of FEMSA, including the design and implementation of the FEMSA Forward strategy in record time, the successful divestment of FEMSA’s stake in Heineken, JRD, and Envoy, as well as numerous other benchmark-setting M&A and capital market transactions.

Energy Sector Analyst The introduction of the Fast & Flexible Interconnect (FIX) program by Itron, Inc., in collaboration with The Mobility House, signifies an innovative approach to addressing the burgeoning demands of electric vehicle (EV) charging on the existing power distribution systems. This solution is particularly pertinent given the forecasted surge in light commercial EVs from 24,000 in 2021 to an anticipated 3.8 million by 2030. The program's potential to expedite transportation electrification goals while mitigating the need for extensive infrastructure upgrades could offer significant cost savings to utility companies.From an energy sector perspective, the FIX program's strategies—passive, active and dynamic—provide a scalable solution to integrate EVs into the grid intelligently. The program leverages Itron’s Grid Edge Intelligence and The Mobility House’s ChargePilot® to enhance grid resilience and adaptability. The ability to exceed the capacity of electric panel boards within defined parameters could lead to a paradigm shift in how utilities manage peak loads and plan for capacity expansions. This flexibility is key to maintaining grid stability amidst the EV transition. Environmental Economist The FIX program's role in facilitating a quicker transition to zero-emissions transportation is not only a technological advancement but also an environmental imperative. By enabling more efficient integration of EV fleets into the power grid, the program supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, which is a significant contributor to climate change. The economic implications of this are far-reaching, as the program could potentially reduce the societal costs associated with environmental degradation and health impacts of air pollution.Moreover, the program's ability to turn electric vehicles into grid assets aligns with the principles of a circular economy, where resource efficiency is maximized. By optimizing the charging process and potentially utilizing EV batteries as energy storage solutions, the program can enhance the flexibility of the energy system, thereby supporting renewable energy integration and reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation. Technology Market Analyst The strategic alliance between Itron and The Mobility House represents a significant advancement in the EV infrastructure market, with the FIX program poised to set a new industry standard for EV charging solutions. As utilities and grid operators in North America prepare for the program's availability in Q1 2024, the anticipation of its impact is likely to influence market dynamics. By offering a comprehensive package that combines site-level control with utility infrastructure, the FIX program addresses a critical bottleneck in EV adoption—charging infrastructure readiness.The market demand for such integrated solutions is expected to grow in tandem with the EV market. Companies that can provide end-to-end solutions, like Itron and The Mobility House, are likely to capture a larger market share. This could potentially disrupt traditional infrastructure providers and create new opportunities for innovation in the sector. Stakeholders, including investors, may view this as a positive development, signaling a robust growth trajectory for companies at the forefront of EV charging and grid management technologies. 02/23/2024 - 08:45 AM The Fast & Flexible Interconnect (FIX) Program Enables Reliable Charging of EV Fleets in Constrained Distribution Systems LIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ: ITRI), which is innovating new ways for utilities and cities to manage energy and water, and The Mobility House, a leader in the battery charging and clean energy space, unveiled the Fast & Flexible Interconnect (FIX) program, which enables reliable charging of electric vehicle (EV) fleets in constrained distribution systems. The first-of-its-kind program is designed to help utilities and grid operators address interconnection delays and infrastructure challenges associated with EV fleet electrification. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240223008778/en/ The adoption rate of electric vehicles continues to rise steadily, with light commercial vehicles projected to increase from 24,000 in 2021 to 3.8 million in 2030, and substantially increasing strain on the electric grid. The FIX program will revolutionize EV charging management, providing low cost, reliable, rapid-to-implement alternatives to traditional distribution load assessment and infrastructure upgrade methods which are currently not fast enough to meet customer needs or national transportation electrification goals. With FIX, transportation electrification goals are achieved more quickly and at lower costs than traditional methods of distribution load assessments and infrastructure upgrades. The FIX programs suite of applications combines Itron’s Grid Edge Intelligence solutions, including its Optimizer portfolio and distributed intelligence capabilities, with The Mobility House’s industry-leading charging and energy management system, ChargePilot®, and simulation capabilities. Utility goals and challenges vary widely, which is why FIX offers three varying program strategies: Passive approach – Utility companies can provide pre-determined grid constraints and use load forecasting within the FIX program to meet the needs of fleet operators and distribution grid operators. Combined with ChargePilot, utilities avoid straining the grid by setting a fixed usage limit and adapting charging schedules to respect that limit. Active approach – Using Itron's Grid Edge Intelligence solutions and The Mobility House’s load management capabilities, utilities can combine firm capacity, which refers to a reliable electrical supply, with flexibility capacity, which allows them to adapt and adjust the amount of additional electricity available for use, based on real-time data from the distribution grid. The goal is to provide the most effective and optimized charging capabilities for electric vehicle fleets while relieving strain on local utility-side infrastructure. Dynamic approach – Offers an advanced and adaptive solution for charging electric vehicle fleets, with a focus on grid awareness, optimization and flexibility for both fleet operators and utilities. With Itron's EV Optimizer solution, constraints are discovered and load limits are measured while load capacity is forecasted in real-time With the FIX program deployed, EV charging can safely exceed the capacity of an electric panel board and utility infrastructure limitations within specific parameters, allowing utilities to plan and install components while accommodating charging requests with more flexibility. “As a result of widespread EV fleet adoption, utilities and grid operators are facing greater complexity related to grid preparedness,” said Don Reeves, senior vice president of Outcomes at Itron. “By integrating Itron’s Grid Edge Intelligence solutions with The Mobility House’s ChargePilot in a complete package, we enable site-level control with utility infrastructure.” “Our combined solution gives utilities the power to turn electric vehicles into grid assets,” said Greg Hintler, CEO North America at The Mobility House. “With our programmatic approach to addressing distribution constraints, we can create EV infrastructure abundance and ensure a quicker transition to zero emissions transportation for all.” The FIX program is available to utilities and grid operators in North America beginning Q1 2024.

For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the CHAT ETF please call 1-855-561-5728 or visit the website http://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/chat. Read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund expects to have concentrated (i.e., invest more than 25% of its net assets) investment exposure in one or more of the Technology Industries at any given time, which may vary over time. Further, the Fund expects to obtain such investment exposure by transacting primarily with a limited number of financial intermediaries conducting business in the same industry or group of related industries. As a result, the Fund is more vulnerable to adverse market, economic, regulatory, political or other developments affecting those industries or groups of related industries than a fund that invests its assets in a more diversified manner. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles. . Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund. Artificial Intelligence Company Risk. Companies involved in, or exposed to, artificial intelligence related businesses may have limited product lines, markets, financial resources or personnel. Technology Sector Risk. The Fund will invest substantially in companies in the information technology sector, and therefore the performance of the Fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector. Foreign Securities Risk. Investments in securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments and may experience more rapid and extreme changes in value than investments in securities of U.S. companies. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ""non-diversified,"" it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. Concentration Risk. The Fund will be concentrated in securities of issuers having their principal business activities in the technology group of industries.

SunPower Secures More Than $300M in Project Financing Commitments for Industry-Leading Residential Solar and Storage Lease Programs,2024-02-23T13:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"SunPower Corp secures over $300 million in project financing commitments to expand residential solar and storage lease programs. The company aims to offer diverse financing options to customers, enhancing access to clean energy solutions.","SunPower Secures More Than $300M in Project Financing Commitments for Industry-Leading Residential Solar and Storage Lease Programs Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary SunPower Corp secures over $300 million in project financing commitments to expand residential solar and storage lease programs. The company aims to offer diverse financing options to customers, enhancing access to clean energy solutions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst SunPower Corp.'s recent securing of over $300 million in project financing commitments is a significant development for the company and its stakeholders. This influx of capital is indicative of strong confidence from institutional investors, such as Apollo Funds, ATLAS SP Partners and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, in SunPower's business model and growth trajectory. The transaction is likely to enhance SunPower's liquidity position, enabling the company to scale its residential solar and storage lease programs effectively.From a financial perspective, the availability of diverse financing options is crucial for SunPower as it allows the company to cater to a broader customer base with varying financial needs. The increase in capital also suggests a potential for expansion in market share, especially considering that lease contracts have seen substantial growth from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023. This strategic move could result in increased revenue streams and a stronger competitive stance within the renewable energy sector. Market Research Analyst The renewable energy industry is experiencing a surge in demand and SunPower's focus on residential solar and storage solutions places it in a favorable position to capitalize on this trend. The company's market-leading position in new home builds and its extensive dealer network across the U.S. provide a robust platform for growth. By securing significant financing, SunPower is poised to meet the strong demand for its fastest-growing financial product, which could translate into increased market penetration and customer loyalty.Furthermore, the partnership with reputable financiers reflects positively on SunPower's reputation and reliability in the industry. It is essential to note that the company's financing agnostic model, which emphasizes customer choice, is a strategic differentiator that may drive consumer preference and adoption. The ability to expand access to clean energy at scale could have a ripple effect, potentially influencing policy decisions and accelerating the transition to renewable energy nationwide. Energy Sector Analyst SunPower's strategic collaboration with Apollo, ATLAS SP and HASI underscores a broader industry trend of integrating sustainable practices with financial innovation. The commitment from these funds not only provides SunPower with the necessary capital but also aligns with a global shift towards sustainable infrastructure investment. This alignment could enhance investor confidence and attract additional capital in the future, fostering a conducive environment for SunPower's long-term growth.The company's emphasis on solar and storage solutions is particularly relevant as energy storage is becoming increasingly important in managing the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. SunPower's ability to offer these combined solutions positions it well to address a critical need in the market. This strategic direction could lead to improved customer retention rates and a stronger brand presence in the competitive landscape of the renewable energy sector. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM Builds on the recent capital raise to provide SunPower with access to more than half a billion dollars in financing RICHMOND, Calif., Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SunPower Corp. (NASDAQ:SPWR), (the ""Company"" or ""SunPower""), a leading residential solar technology and energy services provider, today announced that it has secured over $300 million in project financing commitments from funds managed by Apollo (NYSE: APO) (the ""Apollo Funds""), ATLAS SP Partners, (""ATLAS SP"") and Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure Capital, Inc. (NYSE: HASI) (""HASI"") for its residential solar and storage lease programs, which will be paid upon installation. The transaction supports SunPower's ability to offer a variety of attractive financing options to its customers, advancing its mission to change the way our world is powered. ""SunPower's financing agnostic model is a differentiator in the industry and gives customers the ability to choose the best financing product for their needs,"" said Peter Faricy, SunPower CEO. ""We believe this new commitment will enable us to better serve our growing base as we can now provide significantly more customers with leases for solar and storage solutions, meet the strong demand for our fastest growing financial product and ultimately expand access to clean energy at scale."" Olivia Wassenaar, Head of Sustainability and Infrastructure at Apollo, said, ""We are pleased to support SunPower with this innovative financing solution, which strengthens its ability to deliver solar and storage solutions to customers across the country. This transaction demonstrates Apollo's integrated and holistic approach to clean energy investing, leveraging cross-platform expertise from our infrastructure and tax teams, as well as ATLAS SP's origination and financing capabilities, to help drive the energy transition."" Together with its recent capital raise, the Company now has access to more than half a billion dollars of capital, provided the Company meets certain funding conditions. This includes amendments to its existing first lien financing and a second lien term loan from Sol Holding LLC. Since 2010, SunPower has provided solar lease financing options to customers through its network of residential solar dealers across the U.S., new home builders where the company holds a market-leading position and direct sales teams. SunPower lease contracts made up 73% of SunPower Financial originated volume in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to 26% in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Negative None. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM Economic Growth Still Predicted to Soften as the Labor Market Shows Signs of Cooling WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Existing home sales and new single-family housing starts are expected to grow modestly in 2024 amid lower mortgage rates and slowly strengthening homebuyer sentiment, according to the February 2024 commentary from the Fannie Mae (OTCQB: FNMA) Economic and Strategic Research (ESR) Group. While housing affordability is still seriously constrained following the home price run-up of the past few years, the supply of existing homes available for sale is finally showing signs of loosening. Additionally, more households have recently signaled that they expect mortgage rates to decline, as evidenced by Fannie Mae's January 2024 Home Purchase Sentiment Index®, a newfound optimism that may signal an increased openness to moving. The ESR Group's latest forecast sees mortgage rates falling to 5.9 percent by the end of 2024 and 5.7 percent by the end of 2025, both slight upticks compared to last month's forecast. Additionally, it expects single-family starts to trend upward in 2024 despite the pullback this past month, as permits have increased for twelve consecutive months and demand for new homes remains robust. The ESR Group upgraded its 2024 macroeconomic growth outlook due to a stronger-than-expected Q4 2023 gross domestic product (GDP) report, as well as incoming data on recent population growth and immigration trends that point to faster payroll and GDP growth over the forecast horizon. Still, the ESR Group continues to expect a slower pace of economic growth in 2024 compared to 2023. An unsustainably low savings rate suggests softer consumer spending going forward, consistent with the pullback in January retail sales, and slowing local and state tax receipts point to slower direct government spending growth. Further, while payroll growth looks to have reaccelerated in December and January, other labor market measures indicate softness, including the household survey and the quits rate. On net, this suggests to the ESR Group that the labor market is likely to cool in the near future. ""Market dynamics continue to reflect significant uncertainty regarding the sustainability of stronger-than-expected recent GDP growth, the continuity of the decline of inflation, and the path of monetary policy change, not to mention the many ways in which historical relationships in housing and the larger economy remain out of balance post-pandemic,"" said Doug Duncan, Fannie Mae Senior Vice President and Chief Economist. ""Right now, our base case scenario foresees economic growth decelerating, rates gradually declining, and new single-family home sales slowly recovering as construction adds supply. However, if economic growth continues to surprise to the upside, then we believe the risk of mortgage rates remaining higher for longer will also increase.""

This accomplishment may reflect favorably on the company's current and future earnings, as it showcases the ability to complete complex projects and deliver products that meet the stringent requirements of the space industry. Additionally, the announcement could signal the company's potential for securing similar contracts in the future, which would contribute to a sustainable revenue stream.Investors will likely scrutinize the company's financial statements in subsequent quarters to assess the impact of this contract on the bottom line. The ability to consistently secure and fulfill such contracts is crucial for long-term growth and positive outcomes could lead to upward trends in the company's financial performance. However, it is important to consider the competitive landscape and the fact that the space industry is capital-intensive, which means that the long-term financial health of Sidus Space will depend on its continued innovation and the securing of additional contracts.

(PHUN) announces a 1-for-50 reverse stock split to increase market price per share and regain Nasdaq compliance. The split will be effective on February 26, 2024, with trading under the symbol 'PHUN' on February 27, 2024. All outstanding securities will be adjusted, and fractional shares will be rounded up. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Phunware, Inc. to implement a 1-for-50 reverse stock split is a strategic move to address the company's compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. This action is indicative of the company's current valuation challenges and the need to stabilize its share price. From a financial perspective, reverse splits are often perceived negatively by the market as they can signal underlying issues with the company's performance or growth prospects. However, the immediate effect of reducing the number of shares outstanding can lead to a higher stock price, potentially attracting institutional investors who may have mandates against investing in lower-priced stocks.It is crucial to note that while the reverse stock split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, it could lead to a temporary increase in volatility as the market adjusts to the new price levels. Investors should closely monitor the company's operational performance post-split to determine if the move is purely cosmetic or if it aligns with a broader strategic plan to improve business fundamentals. Market Research Analyst Phunware's reverse stock split is a tactical measure aimed at addressing market perceptions and meeting exchange listing requirements. In the broader context of Location Based SaaS solutions, the move may be interpreted by the market as an attempt to align the company's stock profile with industry standards. The adjustment of outstanding securities, including stock options and warrants, is a standard procedure in reverse splits, but it's important for stakeholders to understand the potential implications for employee compensation and investor dilution.Long-term, the effectiveness of such a split will largely depend on the company's ability to leverage its enterprise cloud platform for mobile engagement and monetization. The market will be observing whether this structural change will be accompanied by improved revenue streams or strategic partnerships that could reinforce investor confidence. The adjustment in stockholder percentages, albeit minimal due to the rounding up of fractional shares, should also be communicated transparently to maintain shareholder trust. Legal Expert In the context of securities law and corporate governance, Phunware's board of directors has exercised its discretion, as authorized by the shareholders, to effectuate the reverse stock split. This action reflects the board's fiduciary duty to maintain the company's listing status and pursue strategies that might enhance shareholder value. The legal process involves adjusting the CUSIP number—an identifier for the securities—which is a routine aspect of such corporate actions.From a legal standpoint, it's also pertinent to note that the reverse split does not modify the rights or preferences of the common stock, ensuring that the company adheres to its obligations towards its shareholders. The rounding up of fractional shares to the nearest whole share is a fair practice that minimizes the impact on shareholders who might otherwise lose out due to the consolidation of shares. 02/23/2024 - 08:30 AM AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Phunware, Inc. (Nasdaq: PHUN, “Phunware” or the “Company”), the pioneer of patented Location Based SaaS solutions and other products that offer the only fully integrated enterprise cloud platform for mobile that enables brands to engage, manage and monetize anyone anywhere, today announced that on February 26, 2024, the Company will implement a 1-for-50 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The reverse stock split will be effective as of 5 PM Eastern Time on February 26, 2024, and the Company’s common stock will trade on a post-split adjusted basis as of the commencement of trading on February 27, 2024, under the existing trading symbol “PHUN.” The CUSIP number for the Company’s common stock following the reverse stock split will be 71948P 209. The Company's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") approved implementation of the reverse stock split upon the authorization granted by the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting held on December 20, 2023, whereby the Company's stockholders approved a proposal to grant the Company's Board the discretion to affect a reverse stock split at a ratio of not less than one-for-ten (1:10) and not more than one-for-fifty (1:50), with such ratio to be determined by the Board. The reverse stock split is intended to increase the market price per share of the Company's common stock to regain compliance with the minimum bid continued listing requirement of The Nasdaq Capital Market. All outstanding securities entitling their holders to purchase shares of common stock or acquire shares of common stock of the Company, including stock options and warrants, will be adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split, as required by the terms of those securities. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 50 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the effective date will be automatically combined into one share of common stock. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Stockholders of record who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share will automatically be entitled to the rounding up of the fractional share to the nearest whole share. The reverse stock split will not change the par value of the common stock or modify the rights or preferences of the common stock. Immediately after the reverse stock split becomes effective, the Company will have approximately 8 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The reverse split affects all stockholders uniformly and will not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in the Company's equity, except to the extent that the reverse split would result in some stockholders owning a fractional share as described above. The Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, is acting as the exchange agent and transfer agent for the reverse stock split. Stockholders holding their shares in book-entry form or in brokerage accounts need not take any action in connection with the reverse stock split. Beneficial holders are encouraged to contact their bank, broker or custodian with any procedural questions.
