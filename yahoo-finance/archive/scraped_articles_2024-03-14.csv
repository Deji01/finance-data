Following the steps of the consumer-price data, the producer price index also signaled a pickup in cost pressures. Meantime, retail sales showed signs of weakening. While it’s probably way too early to draw any conclusions, the set of figures raised some eyebrows about the specter of stagflation.“Well, this is a pickle,” said Chris Low at FHN Financial. “On the heels of a second steamy CPI, and just a week before the Fed meeting, the February PPI rises at twice the expected pace — while retail sales were ‘meh’ at best, if not downright weak.”Benchmark 10-year yields climbed nine basis points to 4.28%. Fed swaps trimmed the odds of policy easing in 2024, with cuts now likely starting in July. The S&P 500 fell to around 5,150. Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. once again led losses in megacaps. Homebuilders sank after Lennar Corp.’s weak forecast. The dollar rose against all of its developed-market peers. Oil hit $81.To Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets, there was nothing within this set of economic updates that will offer anything new for next week’s Fed meeting. It’s only a couple of prints and “insufficient” to draw any broad-based conclusion, he noted.“In a way, today was the past month in microcosm — sticky inflation combined with signs of softness elsewhere in the economy,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. “The questions now are, will traders rethink how soon the Fed will cuts rates, and will that slow down the stock market rally in any meaningful way?”Story continuesMichael Shaoul at Marketfield Asset Management says the February’s producer price index suggests the tailwind of “transitory” inflation dropping out of the economy has ended — with input prices threatening to become a headwind later in 2024 if the commodity rally finds some legs.The Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged at the March 19-20 meeting for the fifth straight gathering. Coming on the heels of reports warning of persistently high inflation, there’s a lot riding for the Treasury market from the Fed’s new so-called dot-plot. The median forecast of Fed policymakers in December showed three quarter-point rate reductions for 2024.“The inflation numbers are just not giving the Fed any incentive to ease,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities.With February’s CPI and PPI data in hand, Bloomberg Economics estimates that the core PCE deflator — the Fed’s preferred inflation indicator — and core services excluding housing, known as “supercore,” will both moderate.While the February PPI was stronger than expected, the details that affect PCE inflation were on the “softer side,” according to Bank of America Corp. economists including Michael Gapen.“We continue to expect the Fed will start its cutting cycle in June,” they said. “However, it will need to see more improvement in the upcoming inflation data to have enough confidence to begin to ease.”Amid all the uncertainties, equities also struggled to pick up any traction.“Mixed overall would be our ruling on the reports in aggregate — which may continue to drive ‘choppy trading’ in stocks over the short run,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott .Meantime, soaring valuations of a few megacaps have pushed some market observers to worry about a bubble.Markets are showing characteristics of a bubble in the record-setting surge by tech’s so-called Magnificent Seven stocks and the all-time highs in cryptocurrencies, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Michael Hartnett.With inflation re-accelerating, growth a little soft and risk assets unscathed, “that is very symptomatic of a bubble mentality,” Hartnett told Bloomberg Television.While the top 10 stocks in the benchmark index are indeed historically expensive relative to the rest of the market — the other 490 are also trading at multiples significantly above their long-term averages, according to Ned Davis Research’s Ed Clissold.If a bubble is forming in US stocks, it has plenty of room to expand before it bursts, according to strategists at Societe Generale SA.A team at the bank led by Manish Kabra said the S&P 500 can climb to 6,250 — roughly 20% from its current level — before reaching the multiples seen at the peak of the dot-com boom in 2000. That suggests the stock market can continue its sharp advance despite brewing worries that it has run up too far.Corporate Highlights:US Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan said in a speech that Boeing Co. became “too big to fail” after it bought up domestic competitors and became the country’s largest commercial aerospace maker.President Joe Biden said United States Steel Corp. should retain American ownership, coming out against a takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. despite the risk of upsetting a key ally.Dollar General Inc. gave a same-store sales outlook that beat Wall Street expectations, indicating that efforts to turnaround the business are starting to show results.Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc. reported sales that surpassed analysts’ expectations, spurred by strong demand for sports gear.Reddit Inc. is telling potential investors in its initial public offering that it expects revenue in 2024 to grow by more than 20% versus the previous year, according to a person familiar with the situation.New York Community Bancorp, the troubled commercial real estate lender that just got a capital infusion from a group led by Steven Mnuchin, said it will book a gain after selling a portfolio of consumer loans with a net book value of $899 million as well as a co-op loan.SpaceX launched its Starship rocket into space in a critical test, sending the colossal craft farther and faster than it had ever flown before it was lost while returning to Earth.Key events this week:China property prices, FridayJapan’s largest union federation announces results of annual wage negotiations, just ahead of Bank of Japan policy meeting, FridayBank of England issues inflation survey, FridayUS industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire Manufacturing, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.2% as of 12:37 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 0.1%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.2%The MSCI World index fell 0.3%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.3%The euro fell 0.5% to $1.0892The British pound fell 0.3% to $1.2757The Japanese yen fell 0.3% to 148.14 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin fell 3.2% to $70,850.31Ether fell 3.1% to $3,869.29BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced nine basis points to 4.28%Germany’s 10-year yield advanced five basis points to 2.42%Britain’s 10-year yield advanced six basis points to 4.08%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.8% to $81.16 a barrelSpot gold fell 0.7% to $2,159.93 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Esha Dey, Alexandra Semenova and Liz Capo McCormick.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for ThemAmerica’s Plumber Deficit Isn’t Good for the EconomyMake Up or Break Up: Will Trump and Musk Merge?Academics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing BoomLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

He noted, ""We have seen some delinquencies in some of that debt.""His comments came after Lennar on Wednesday reported revenue that missed analyst estimates for its fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 29. Lennar stock tumbled roughly 6% Thursday on the news, dragging down D.R. Horton (DHI) and Toll Brothers, which were (TOL) both down 3%. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) slipped nearly 2%.US household debt and delinquency rates have been rising. Total household debt rose by $212 billion to hit $17.5 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The challenges of higher mortgage rates and home prices over the last year have plagued buyers trying to jump into the market. Mortgage rates have largely been on the rise this year, peaking around 7% in mid-February. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 6.74% Thursday from 6.88% the week prior, according to Freddie Mac.“What we're seeing is when you look at [our customers] in particular, more of the [customers] are having a higher percentage relating to debt to total income,” Bruce Gross, chief executive officer of Lennar Financial Services, told analysts on the earnings call Thursday.“There's more debt to pay off, and that's something new that we noticed this quarter. We often work with the buyers, and we're able to work through a lot of the conditions. But that one point is something that we've seen [different from] last quarter,” Gross added.While investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year, the central bank has indicated it will move with caution, and the timeline still remains unclear.Story continuesHigh rates have prompted builders to offer a variety of incentives from mortgage rate buydowns to price reductions. Lennar cut its average sales price to $413,000 during the quarter, an 8% drop from last year.Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless said the lower average closing price contributed to total revenues falling below consensus expectations in the latest quarter.NEWARK, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 15: Signs are posted in front of homes at the Lennar Bridgeway home development on December 15, 2021 in Newark, California.

Motley Fool,Why Rivian Stock Is Getting Clobbered Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-rivian-stock-getting-clobbered-183007848.html,"A week after the reveal of two hot future models, Rivian's shares are under heavy selling pressure.","Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) were trading lower on Thursday, a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that rival electric vehicle (EV) maker Fisker (NYSE: FSR) may be preparing to file for bankruptcy.As of 2 p.m. ET, shares of Rivian were down about 8.3% from Wednesday's closing price.Rivian last week revealed its next model, the R2 midsize electric SUV. Image source: Rivian AutomotiveKey rival Fisker is in dire straitsThe Journal reported on Wednesday afternoon that Fisker has ""hired restructuring advisors to assist with a possible bankruptcy filing,"" news that sent the struggling electric vehicle maker's stock down by over 45% in after-hours trading.It wasn't exactly a surprise, though. In a ""preliminary"" earnings release on Feb. 29, Fisker had said it likely doesn't have enough cash to survive the next 12 months, that it will lay off 15% of its workforce, and that it was hoping to get a lifeline from a major global automaker.Fisker had once hoped to build and sell over 40,000 of its Ocean electric SUVs in 2023. But after a series of early production snags -- and after demand seemingly failed to materialize -- the company built just 10,193 and managed to deliver only 4,929 of those to customers before year-end. Now, it's short on cash, and -- unless that lifeline suddenly materializes -- likely headed for bankruptcy.What does that have to do with Rivian? Rivian is a different company in a very different situation -- but both Rivian and Fisker are members of a cohort of EV start-ups that went public earlier this decade, each with investors hoping it would be the next Tesla.Most of the other EV start-ups from that era are down today as well.Rivian is in better shape, but EV stocks tend to move togetherRivian has its own challenges, of course. But the company delivered over 50,000 vehicles last year, it had $10.4 billion in cash and available credit lines as of the end of 2023, it had over 68,000 preorders for its next new model a day after it was revealed, and -- crucially -- it was able to raise cash twice last year and should be able to do so again if the need arises.Story continuesBut with Fisker seemingly on the verge of collapse, it's not really surprising that Rivian stock is taking a hit today.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Micron Technology Stock Has 30% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-technology-stock-30-upside-182456866.html,"Micron's not earning money now, but just wait until 2025, says Wolfe Research.","Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock is red hot -- more than doubling the stock price performance of the S&P 500 over the past year as investors bet that Micron's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips will prove essential to keeping the artificial intelligence revolution going.One analyst who's particularly optimistic about Micron's prospects is Wolfe Research's Chris Caso. On Wednesday, Caso raised his price target on Micron to $120 a share, implying that Micron stock will gain more than 30% over the next 12 months or so.Is Micron stock a buy?Historically, Micron stock has traded for about 11 times its average earnings -- a conservative multiple that's appropriate for a cyclical stock that can grow quickly when the semiconductor cycle is healthy, but also loses a lot of money during downturns. Caso argues that Micron should be worth closer to 14 times its projected 2025 earnings, though, on his assumption that Micron will earn nearly $8.40 per share next year, and potentially outearn its previous record of $11.51 per share (hit in 2018) by the time this earnings cycle peaks.Is that realistic, though?Micron lost money last year. It's probably going to lose money this year, too. Looking down the road, most analysts see this current cycle peaking in 2026 -- with Micron still short of earning even $7 a share (much less $12!).Caso's prediction is quite an outlier, and I'm not certain he's fully accounting for the risk that rivals with greater scale and greater market share might undercut the company on price and crimp its ability to fully take advantage of this growing market. Both South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung are several times bigger than Micron in HBM, after all. And both of these companies expect to be profitable this year, while Micron lags behind.Micron stock hitting $120 is certainly possible, but I wouldn't take this price target as a given. A price that's 11 times everyone else's peak earnings estimate for Micron -- $7 a share -- would be a much safer target at which to buy this stock.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.
