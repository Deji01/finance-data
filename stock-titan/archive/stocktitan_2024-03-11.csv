The data highlights the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in treating Alzheimer's disease, showing promising results in reducing Aβ protofibrils and plaques in the brain. The collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai has been instrumental in the development and regulatory submissions of lecanemab. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The presentation of new data on lecanemab at the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases offers insights into the drug's potential efficacy and safety in treating Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab's unique binding properties to both soluble and insoluble amyloid-beta aggregates could position it favorably in the competitive landscape of Alzheimer's treatments. The lower incidence of Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which are side effects associated with anti-amyloid-beta antibodies, could be a significant differentiator for lecanemab, potentially leading to a stronger safety profile compared to its competitors.Extended efficacy results from the Phase 3 Clarity AD open label extension study up to 30 months suggest a sustained benefit from lecanemab treatment. This is particularly relevant as Alzheimer's disease requires long-term management and treatments that can demonstrate prolonged efficacy are likely to be more attractive to clinicians and patients. Moreover, data indicating that early intervention could be more impactful underscores the importance of early diagnosis and could influence future screening and treatment protocols. Market Research Analyst The strategic collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, with the latter leading development and regulatory submissions, is a key factor in lecanemab's commercial trajectory. Eisai's global reach and Biogen's co-promotion efforts could expedite market penetration upon approval. BioArctic's commercial rights in the Nordic region, contingent on European approval, may provide a foothold in a market that is often characterized by high standards of healthcare and an openness to innovative treatments.Investor interest in BioArctic and Eisai is likely to be influenced by the outcomes of these studies, as positive data can lead to increased confidence in the drug's commercial success. The focus on early-stage Alzheimer's treatment also taps into a growing market segment, as the medical community emphasizes early detection and intervention. This could expand the target demographic and potentially increase the total addressable market for lecanemab. Economist The economic implications of an effective Alzheimer's treatment like lecanemab are vast. Alzheimer's disease has a significant impact on healthcare systems worldwide due to the costs associated with long-term care and the loss of productivity from both patients and caregivers. A treatment that can slow the progression of the disease or improve cognitive function can lead to substantial cost savings for healthcare providers and society at large. The potential for early intervention to stabilize the disease process could further enhance these economic benefits by delaying the onset of severe symptoms and reducing the need for intensive care services.Additionally, the market for Alzheimer's treatments is substantial, with a growing patient population due to aging demographics. A successful entry of lecanemab into this market could result in considerable revenue streams for BioArctic and Eisai, with the potential to recoup research and development costs and fund future innovation. This can have a positive effect on their stock valuations and investor sentiment, particularly if lecanemab becomes a first-line treatment option due to its safety and efficacy profile. 03/11/2024 - 03:18 AM STOCKHOLM, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BioArctic AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) and its partner Eisai presented new data on lecanemab (brand name: Leqembi®) at the 2024 International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and related neurological disorders (AD/PD™), held in Lisbon, Portugal and virtually, March 5–9. BioArctic's founder, Professor Lars Lannfelt, presented data on the binding properties of the anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) antibody lecanemab and other anti Aβ antibodies. Lecanemab was designed to preferentially bind soluble (protofibrils), as well as insoluble Aβ aggregates (fibrils), to reduce both Aβ protofibrils and Aβ plaques in the brain. The difference in binding to CAA[1] was presented, with lecanemab having lower binding to CAA than most other antibodies. This could explain the difference in the adverse event ARIA[2] seen between different antibodies, with lecanemab showing relatively low incidence of ARIA. In another presentation Professor Christopher van Dyke presented extended efficacy results from the Phase 3 Clarity AD open label extension study of lecanemab in Alzheimer's disease up to 30 months, showing continued benefit with lecanemab treatment. Professor van Dyke also highlighted data from the tau sub-study of Clarity AD, which showed that all cohorts of the tau population benefitted from treatment with lecanemab. Data from the low tau population, representing earlier stages of the disease, indicated that intervening in early stages of disease may be particularly impactful in stabilizing the disease process. ""It is inspiring to see all the data presented at the conference further strengthening lecanemab's efficacy and safety results, specifically from the earlier cohorts of patients which alludes to the importance of early diagnosis and treatment,"" said Gunilla Osswald, CEO at BioArctic. ""It has also been impressive to see how the field is moving forward, and we have seen encouraging data regarding both alpha-synuclein and blood brain barrier transportation approaches."" Lecanemab is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, and the anti Aβ protofibril antibody was originally developed by BioArctic based on the work of Professor Lars Lannfelt and his discovery of the Arctic mutation in Alzheimer's disease. Eisai serves as the lead of lecanemab development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. BioArctic has the right to commercialize lecanemab in the Nordic region, pending European approval, and currently Eisai and BioArctic are preparing for commercialization in the region. This release discusses investigational uses of an agent in development and is not intended to convey conclusions about efficacy or safety. There is no guarantee that such investigational agents will successfully complete clinical development or gain health authority approval.

Lecanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ). In the U.S., Leqembi was granted traditional approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on July 6, 2023. Leqembi is indicated as a disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the US. Treatment with Leqembi should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical trials. Please see full U.S. Prescribing Information. In Japan, Eisai received approval from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) on September 25, 2023, to manufacture and market lecanemab as a treatment for slowing progression of MCI and mild dementia due to AD. Furthermore, in China, Leqembi was approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) as a treatment of MCI due to AD and mild AD dementia in January 2024. Eisai has also submitted applications for approval of lecanemab in 14 different countries, including EU, Canada and Great Britain. Eisai has completed a lecanemab subcutaneous bioavailability study, and subcutaneous dosing is currently being evaluated in the Clarity AD (Study 301) open-label extension (OLE) study. A maintenance dosing regimen has been evaluated as part of the Phase 2b study (Study 201). Since July 2020 Eisai's Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) for individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. AHEAD 3-45 is conducted as a public-private partnership between the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health and Eisai. Since January 2022, the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy. About the collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai Since 2005, BioArctic has a long-term collaboration with Eisai regarding the development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The most important agreements are the Development and Commercialization Agreement for the lecanemab antibody, which was signed 2007, and the Development and Commercialization agreement for the antibody Leqembi back-up for Alzheimer's disease, which was signed 2015. In 2014, Eisai and Biogen entered into a joint development and commercialization agreement for lecanemab. Eisai is responsible for the clinical development, application for market approval and commercialization of the products for Alzheimer's disease. BioArctic has the right to commercialize lecanemab in the Nordic region under certain conditions and is currently preparing for commercialization in the Nordics together with Eisai.

Negative None. 03/11/2024 - 03:51 AM STOCKHOLM, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A number of trade unions have announced a two-week long political strike in Finland starting March 11, 2024. The strike is politically motivated and does not involve Boliden as a negotiating party. The direct industrial actions at Boliden's operations are limited, however, Boliden is heavily indirectly affected by industrial actions in Finland's harbors and railroad system. Boliden will try to limit the impact on its customers. If the strike goes through as announced, it is estimated that Boliden's operating profit in the first quarter 2024 will be negatively affected by approximately SEK 300 million, whereof SEK 100 million are due to reduced production and SEK 200 million due to delayed deliveries to customers. The SEK 200 million due to delayed deliveries is a temporary effect and is expected to be regained during the second quarter. The negative cash flow impact during the first quarter is estimated to SEK 500 million, mainly due to a temporary increase of working capital.

ADS holders have until May 28, 2024, to surrender ADSs for delivery of ordinary shares, subject to fees and taxes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The delisting of PHAXIAM Therapeutics from the Nasdaq represents a significant shift in the company's capital markets strategy. A delisting often indicates a company's intent to reduce regulatory burdens and costs associated with maintaining a listing on a major exchange. For investors, this move may affect liquidity and accessibility as the shares will no longer be readily tradable on Nasdaq. The decision to delist could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a strategic pivot, cost-saving measures, or a prelude to further corporate actions like going private or restructuring.The impact on the stock market is typically negative in the short-term, as delisting can be perceived as a loss of prestige and might diminish investor confidence. However, it's important to consider the company's rationale and future plans, as this could also be a step towards a more streamlined and financially efficient operation. Investors should closely monitor the company's performance and any strategic moves following the delisting. Legal Expert The filing of a Form 15 with the SEC is a legal procedure that companies undergo to suspend their reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. This step is crucial in the delisting process as it signifies the company's withdrawal from the public reporting system. The deregistration of the ADSs will become effective 90 days post-filing, which is a standard waiting period intended to protect investors and allow for any necessary regulatory review.For shareholders, the termination of the Deposit Agreement and the ensuing steps to exchange ADSs for ordinary shares involve legal and financial considerations, including fees and potential tax implications. Shareholders must be aware of these requirements and deadlines to ensure they manage their investments in accordance with the new structure. The legal implications of delisting, such as reduced transparency and reporting, could also influence investor decisions and the company's corporate governance practices going forward. Market Research Analyst The biopharmaceutical sector is highly competitive and capital-intensive, with companies often requiring significant investment to fund research and development activities. Delisting from a major stock exchange like Nasdaq could suggest that PHAXIAM Therapeutics is seeking alternative financing methods or restructuring its capital allocation. This move might signal a shift in the company's strategic direction that could have long-term implications for its market position and competitive edge.Analysing the company's market performance relative to its peers post-delisting will be crucial in understanding the broader impact of this decision. If PHAXIAM Therapeutics maintains its operational momentum and continues to innovate, it could still sustain its market share. However, the reduced visibility and investor outreach inherent in a delisting could potentially hinder its ability to attract capital and partnerships, which are vital in the biopharmaceutical industry. 03/11/2024 - 02:00 AM Lyon (France) and Cambridge (MA, US), March 11, 2024, at 07:00am CET – PHAXIAM Therapeutics (Nasdaq & Euronext: PHXM), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for severe and resistant bacterial infections, today announces that the Company’s voluntary delisting of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) representing its ordinary shares from The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) has become effective. Each ADS represents one ordinary share of the Company. The Company will file a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to suspend its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), in respect of the ADSs and the ordinary shares. The Company expects that the deregistration of the ADSs under the Exchange Act will become effective 90 days after the filing of the Form 15. Information for ADS Holders The Bank of New York Mellon serves as depositary (the “Depositary”) for the Company’s ADS facility. Each ADS represents one ordinary share. PHAXIAM intends to terminate the Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated May 14, 2018, among the Company, the Depositary and owners and holders of ADSs (the “Deposit Agreement”) on May 23, 2024. Under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, ADS holders will have until at least May 28, 2024, to surrender ADSs for delivery of the underlying ordinary shares. If you surrender ADSs for delivery of the underlying ordinary shares, you must pay a cable fee of $17.50, a cancellation fee of up to $0.05 per American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) surrendered and any applicable U.S. or local taxes or governmental charges. To exchange ADSs for the Company’s ordinary shares, ADS holders should instruct their brokers to surrender ADSs to The Bank of New York Mellon (DTC No. 2504). In connection with this surrender, brokers should include ongoing ordinary share delivery instructions in the comments field within DTC, including information such as the name and BIC of the appropriate local bank/broker and/or appropriate delivery code, beneficiary name and account number. U.S. brokers holding ADSs on behalf of their clients, can reach out to DRSettlements@BNYMellon.com for questions regarding the conversion and settlement process. On or about May 28, 2024, the Depositary may elect to sell the underlying ordinary shares. If the Depositary has sold such shares, holders of ADSs must surrender such securities in order to obtain payment of the sale proceeds of the underlying ordinary shares, net of the expenses of sale, any applicable U.S. or local taxes or government charges and a cancellation fee of up to $0.05 per ADS. To surrender ADRs, the address of the Depositary is: The Bank of New York Mellon, 240 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10286, Attention: Depositary Receipt Administration.

The Company bought 10,000 ordinary shares at an average price of £81.4984 per share, with the intention to cancel them. Following the transaction, the Company now has 164,354,035 ordinary shares in issue. The detailed breakdown of the purchases is provided in the PR. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent announcement by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC about the repurchase of its shares is a strategic financial move that can have several implications for the company's market valuation and shareholder value. Share buybacks are often undertaken by companies when management believes the shares are undervalued, signaling confidence in the company's future prospects. This action can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) since there are fewer shares outstanding, which can, in turn, elevate the stock price if the market perceives the buyback positively.However, one must consider the opportunity cost of such a buyback. The funds used for repurchasing shares could have been allocated to other growth opportunities or used to pay down debt. Investors would benefit from a comprehensive analysis comparing the potential returns from alternative investments with the expected increase in shareholder value from the buyback. Moreover, the timing and price of the buyback are crucial. The average price paid per share and the range provide insights into the company's valuation strategy. The repurchase at prices ranging from £80.9000 to £82.0200 should be evaluated against the current market conditions and the company's intrinsic value to assess the financial prudence of this move. Financial Analyst InterContinental Hotels Group PLC's decision to cancel the repurchased shares will reduce the total number of shares in issue, which could potentially increase the stock's scarcity and demand. This action may be part of a capital structure optimization strategy aimed at delivering higher returns to existing shareholders. It's important to analyze the effect of this buyback on the company's balance sheet and liquidity ratios, as it reflects on the company's financial health and flexibility to navigate future economic cycles.The transaction's impact on the company's debt levels and interest coverage ratios should also be assessed, as these are critical factors for the company's credit rating and cost of capital. Long-term investors should be particularly attentive to how this buyback affects the company's ability to invest in long-term growth initiatives, as well as its resilience in the face of potential economic downturns. Legal Expert The share repurchase by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC has been conducted under the authority granted by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, reflecting adherence to corporate governance norms. It is essential to ensure that all regulatory requirements have been met, including the disclosure obligations under the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Compliance with such regulations is critical to maintain the integrity of the financial markets and the trust of investors. The detailed breakdown of transactions and the role of Goldman Sachs International as the executing firm suggest transparency in the execution of the buyback, which is an essential aspect for investor confidence. 03/11/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 11, 2024 / InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (the Company) (NYSE:IHG)(LSE:IHG)(OTC PINK:ICHGF)The Company announces that on 08 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

This move ensures compliance with regional regulations and offers a competitive advantage in the customer experience platform market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Sprinklr into the Saudi Arabian market represents a strategic move to capitalize on the growing demand for digital transformation and customer experience management in the region. By offering local data hosting on Google Cloud, Sprinklr addresses a critical barrier for enterprises operating in KSA—compliance with local data governance and privacy regulations. This move could potentially increase Sprinklr's market share and strengthen its position as a leader in the Unified-CXM space.Furthermore, the partnership with Google Cloud enhances Sprinklr's value proposition by integrating advanced AI technologies, such as generative AI, which can drive innovation in customer service and marketing. The ability for customers to utilize their own AI models or create new ones for integration with Sprinklr's platform may lead to improved customization and efficiency in customer experience strategies.Overall, this development could be seen as a positive signal to investors, indicating Sprinklr's commitment to growth and innovation in high-potential markets. However, the financial impact will depend on the company's ability to convert this strategic advantage into actual sales and market penetration in the region. Cybersecurity Expert Hosting data locally in Saudi Arabia not only aligns with the regulatory requirements but also presents a significant enhancement in terms of data security and privacy for Sprinklr's clients. The Middle East is known for stringent data protection laws and this local hosting solution could mitigate risks associated with data breaches and cyber-attacks, which are critical concerns for enterprises today.The collaboration with Google Cloud, a recognized leader in cloud security, may further reassure potential customers about the robustness of Sprinklr's data protection measures. This aspect of the expansion could lead to a competitive advantage for Sprinklr, as businesses increasingly prioritize cybersecurity in their digital solutions.From a security standpoint, the move is strategic and could contribute to long-term customer trust and loyalty, which are vital for sustained business growth. Legal Expert The legal implications of Sprinklr's expansion into Saudi Arabia with local data hosting are significant.

The cloud-based SaaS post-trade processing solution aims to reduce maintenance burden and complexity, offering scalability and flexibility for future growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The partnership between Matsui Securities and Broadridge Financial Solutions represents a strategic move aimed at enhancing operational efficiency within the stock lending segment of Matsui's business. The shift to a cloud-based SaaS model is indicative of the broader industry trend towards digitization and automation, which can lead to a reduction in operational costs and improved scalability. For Matsui Securities, this transition may result in a more competitive edge in the online brokerage market, where margins are often thin and cost control is essential for profitability.From a financial perspective, the expected decrease in maintenance costs and the potential for new market penetration could positively influence Matsui's bottom line. Investors will likely monitor the implementation phase closely, as the success of this integration could set a precedent for similar future endeavors and possibly impact the company's stock performance. The ability to scale services both locally and globally without significant additional investment is a critical factor in maintaining competitiveness in the fast-paced financial services industry. Market Research Analyst With the online securities brokerage market becoming increasingly competitive, firms are seeking ways to differentiate themselves and capture additional market share. The adoption of Broadridge's cloud-based SaaS solution by Matsui Securities may serve as a catalyst for market expansion, offering the firm the agility to respond to changing market demands and client needs. The modular aspect of the platform suggests that it can be tailored to specific functions, which can be a significant selling point for attracting new clients who require customized solutions.Furthermore, the collaboration with a system integrator like Intelligent Wave indicates a comprehensive approach to the project, ensuring that front-end and back-end systems are seamlessly connected. This could enhance the user experience for Matsui's clients, potentially increasing client retention and attracting new users. The ability to streamline operations and reduce complexity could also allow Matsui to focus on innovation and service enhancement, which are key drivers of growth in the sector. Technology Consultant Transitioning to a cloud-based SaaS post-trade processing solution is a significant technological upgrade for Matsui Securities, signaling a move towards a more flexible and scalable infrastructure. The cloud's inherent advantages, such as on-demand resource availability, disaster recovery and high-level security, can provide Matsui with a robust platform for managing its stock lending transactions. The integration of Intelligent Wave's expertise in developing the front office component is crucial, as it ensures that the user interface aligns with the enhanced back-end capabilities provided by Broadridge.The technical implications of this move are substantial. By leveraging SaaS, Matsui Securities can benefit from continuous updates and improvements without the need for extensive in-house IT development. This could lead to faster deployment of new features and compliance with regulatory changes, which is paramount in the financial industry. Additionally, the ability to compute collateral requirements, calculate fees, rebates and manufactured dividends automatically enhances accuracy and reduces the risk of human error, which is an essential consideration in financial transactions. 03/10/2024 - 07:00 PM The modular cloud-based solution will open new markets and reduce maintenance burden and complexity NEW YORK and TOKYO, March 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Matsui Securities Co., Ltd., one of Japan's top online securities brokers, has selected global Fintech leader Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.'s (NYSE: BR) cloud based SaaS post-trade processing solution to drive operational efficiency in its stock lending business. System integrator Intelligent Wave will develop the front office component and system integration as well as provide project management and overall consultation to Matsui Securities. ""Hitherto, we have operated an internally developed system for stock lending transactions, but as our business has grown it has become bloated, making system maintenance a significant burden,"" said Shinichi Uzawa, Managing Director, Corporate Division at Matsui Securities. ""By adopting Broadridge's post-trade processing solution with its proven global track record, we expect to reduce our maintenance burden and facilitate a far more stable management with much greater operational efficiency.""

A Phase II, open-label, multicenter basket design study (NCT04965519) is currently underway to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RC48 monotherapy in the treatment of HER2-expressing gynecologic malignancies. The cervical cancer cohort includes patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have progressed on at least 1L anti-tumor therapy and have HER2 IHC ≥1+. The treatment regimen consists of RC48 monotherapy administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg Q2W. The primary endpoint is objective response rate (ORR) by Independent Review Committee, with secondary endpoints including ORR by Investigator, duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. As of October 31, 2023, 25 patients with cervical cancer were enrolled with a median age of 56 years (range: 35-66). Most patients (64%) had a baseline ECOG performance score of 1. 18 patients had a primary FIGO stage of IIB or higher. 16 (64%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma, and 9 (36%) had adenocarcinoma. Among the 22 efficacy evaluable patients, The ORR was 36.4% (8/22). The confirmed ORR was 31.8% (7/22), the DCR was 86.4% (19/22), and the median time to response was 1.5 months.The mDoR was 5.52 months, and the mPFS was 4.37 months.The most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) included an increase in ALT (56%), an increase in AST (56%), and a decrease in white blood cell count (52%).

(NYSE: ASX) raises concerns about the company's financial performance. The sequential and year-over-year declines in net revenues may impact investor confidence in ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. (NYSE: ASX). Financial Analyst The revised unaudited consolidated net revenues for ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd. indicate a sequential decline of 16.1% in net revenues from January to February 2024, with a slight year-over-year decrease of 0.6%. In USD terms, the decline is more pronounced at 16.8% sequentially and 4.3% year-over-year. This contraction could signal a potential softening in demand or operational challenges. Investors should consider the implications of these figures on the company's financial health and future earnings potential. The semiconductor industry is cyclical and revenue fluctuations are not uncommon; however, the extent of the decline may warrant a closer examination of market conditions and internal company factors. Market Research Analyst ASE Technology's specific segment in ATM assembly, testing and material business shows a 6.4% sequential decrease but a marginal year-over-year growth of 0.5%. The US dollar figures reflect a 7.2% sequential decrease and a 3.3% year-over-year decline. These figures suggest that while the company may be maintaining stability in its core business on a year-over-year basis, there are challenges in the short term that need to be addressed. It's important to analyze the competitive landscape and technological advancements in the semiconductor sector to understand the impact on ASE Technology's market share and revenue trajectory. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as currency exchange rates could have played a role in the reported figures, especially when considering the differences between NT$ and US$ reported revenues. Economist From an economic standpoint, the reported revenue figures from ASE Technology could be indicative of broader economic trends, such as global semiconductor demand fluctuations or supply chain disruptions. The semiconductor industry is a bellwether for the tech sector and often reflects broader economic conditions. The decrease in revenue, especially in US dollars, might suggest not only a potential slowdown in the industry but also the impact of currency valuation changes, which can affect multinational companies' reported earnings. Investors should consider macroeconomic indicators and forecasts when assessing the potential long-term performance of companies like ASE Technology. 03/11/2024 - 03:00 AM TAIPEI, March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd.

Shell Plc Fourth Quarter 2023 Euro and Gbp Equivalent Dividend Payments,2024-03-11T07:00:00.000Z,Low,Negative,"Shell PLC announces dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2023 in pounds sterling and euro equivalents, offering shareholders the option to receive dividends in US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling.","Shell Plc Fourth Quarter 2023 Euro and Gbp Equivalent Dividend Payments Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags dividends earnings Rhea-AI Summary Shell PLC announces dividend payments for the fourth quarter of 2023 in pounds sterling and euro equivalents, offering shareholders the option to receive dividends in US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Shell's fourth quarter 2023 dividend payments in multiple currencies is a reflection of the company's financial health and its commitment to shareholder returns. The ability to offer dividends in US dollars, euros, or pounds sterling provides flexibility for shareholders, potentially reducing currency exchange risk. The fixed dividend rate, when converted to local currencies, can be influenced by currency exchange fluctuations, which is a critical factor for investors to consider.Furthermore, the conversion rates based on an average of market exchange rates over specific dealing days indicate the company's strategy to mitigate the impact of volatile exchange rates on dividend payouts. This approach can result in a more predictable income stream for investors who opt for cash dividends in their local currency. However, investors should also consider the potential tax implications on these dividends, as it could affect net returns. Market Research Analyst Shell's dividend announcement is also a signal to the market regarding the company's performance and stability. Dividends are often viewed as a sign of a company's confidence in its current and future earnings. The consistency and reliability of dividend payments can impact investor sentiment and influence the company's stock market performance. Additionally, the specific dates mentioned for currency elections and dividend payouts are essential for investors to manage their portfolios effectively.Investors and analysts closely monitor such announcements for insights into the company's operational efficiency and capital allocation strategies. The impact on the stock price can be significant, as regular and stable dividends are attractive to income-focused investors. The announcement might also be compared against industry norms and competitors' dividend policies to gauge Shell's relative performance. Tax Advisor It is crucial for shareholders to understand the tax implications of their dividend income, especially in the context of international investments. Different jurisdictions have varying tax treatments for foreign dividends, which can affect the overall return on investment. The note advising shareholders to consult with a tax advisor underscores the complexity of taxation on dividends, particularly when dealing with multiple currencies and potentially cross-border taxation issues.Investors should be aware of the tax treaties between their country of residence and the country where the company is domiciled. These treaties can significantly influence the net amount received from dividends after withholding taxes. Proactive tax planning can help maximize the after-tax return from such investments. Without proper guidance, investors may face unexpected tax liabilities that could diminish the perceived benefits of the dividend payout. 03/11/2024 - 03:00 AM SHELL PLC FOURTH QUARTER 2023 EURO AND GBP EQUIVALENT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS March 11, 2024 The Board of Shell plc today announced the pounds sterling and euro equivalent dividend payments in respect of the fourth quarter 2023 interim dividend, which was announced on February 1, 2024 at US$0.344 per ordinary share.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”, “ambition”, ‘‘anticipate’’, ‘‘believe’’, ‘‘could’’, ‘‘estimate’’, ‘‘expect’’, ‘‘goals’’, ‘‘intend’’, ‘‘may’’, “milestones”, ‘‘objectives’’, ‘‘outlook’’, ‘‘plan’’, ‘‘probably’’, ‘‘project’’, ‘‘risks’’, “schedule”, ‘‘seek’’, ‘‘should’’, ‘‘target’’, ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement, March 11, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement. Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso, in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”, which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target, as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Shell expects to publish its 2024 Energy Transition Strategy on March 14, 2024, which will include an update on Shell’s energy transition strategy and sets out Shell’s climate targets and ambitions for the future. Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.

The project covers an area of 14.80 km2 (3,656.1 acres) and is located 200km southeast of Reno and 18km east of Mina, Nevada. It is well situated for the supply of power, water and skilled labour and proximity to transport infrastructure in Mineral County and is centred around four existing mineral deposits: Garnet; Good Hope; Gunmetal and Desert Scheelite, all of which possess significant skarn-style tungsten-copper-silver-zinc mineralisation. The Pilot Mountain project consists of 176 active lode mining claims and 4 filed mill site claims. The four mill site claims filed at the former Dunham mill site have secure access to groundwater supply sufficient for the proposed project.Garfield ProjectThe Garfield Project is an exciting copper-gold-silver prospect consisting of 65 lode mining claims covering 5.4 km2 (1,338 acres) located in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 14km due east of the town of Hawthorne and 120km due west-northwest of Tonopah. Exploration to date has included detailed geochemical sampling and follow up analysis which highlighted the presence of both porphyry and skarn-type mineralisation and alteration at the 'High-Grade Zone'. Further to this, mapping, prospecting and rock sampling was recently completed with results confirming presence of high-grade copper, silver and gold mineralisation as well as leading to the bedrock discovery of the Pamlico Au Zone with individual rock samples up to 18.35g/t Au, 1,225g/t Ag & 1.89% Cu. Following this, geochemical analysis of the full suite of data confirmed the strong presence of porphyry style mineralisation across the Project, as well as potentially overprinting epithermal style mineralisation leading to increased gold-silver prospectivity.Kibby Basin Lithium ProjectThe Kibby Basin Project covers two claim packages which are prospective for lithium brine mineralisation. The southern claim package is less than 250m from a 2022 drillhole which returned a significant interval (169m) of lithium brine mineralisation which was determined to be open in all directions. The Project is less than 5km to the southeast of the Company's flagship Pilot Mountain Project.Golconda Summit ProjectGolden Metal is the operator of the Golconda Summit project, which is held under an earn-in right to acquire up to 100 per cent. of the project from the mineral claim owner pursuant to an option agreement. The Golconda Summit project is an exploration stage gold and silver project located in Humboldt County and situated at the confluence of the Getchell and Battle Mountain - Eureka metallogenic trends, and consists of 44 lode mining claims, covering a total area of approximately 3.22 km2 (795.4 acres) located approximately 27km east of Winnemucca.Stonewall ProjectThe Stonewall project is an exploration stage gold-silver property prospective for epithermal gold-silver mineralisation. The property consists of 19 lode mining claims covering 1.59 km2 (392.5 acres) located on the northern flank of Stonewall Mountain, on the western edge of the Nellis Airforce Range Restricted Access Area, in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 24km south-east of the historic gold mining town of Goldfield and 60km due south of Tonopah.This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Silvercorp Clarifies OreCorp Offer Intentions,2024-03-10T22:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Silvercorp Metals Inc. announces its intention to file a third supplementary bidder statement for its off-market takeover bid for OreCorp Limited. The Company will not waive its 50.1% minimum acceptance condition, offering 0.0967 common shares of Silvercorp and A$0.19 cash per OreCorp share. The Offer is open until March 22, 2024, aiming to enhance the attractiveness of the deal while providing protection to OreCorp shareholders.","Silvercorp Clarifies OreCorp Offer Intentions Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Silvercorp Metals Inc. announces its intention to file a third supplementary bidder statement for its off-market takeover bid for OreCorp Limited. The Company will not waive its 50.1% minimum acceptance condition, offering 0.0967 common shares of Silvercorp and A$0.19 cash per OreCorp share. The Offer is open until March 22, 2024, aiming to enhance the attractiveness of the deal while providing protection to OreCorp shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, Silvercorp Metals Inc.'s decision to maintain the 50.1% minimum acceptance condition for its takeover bid of OreCorp Limited presents a strategic move to consolidate control while offering a safeguard to OreCorp's shareholders. This action signals to the market Silvercorp's confidence in the value of their offer and suggests a commitment to a majority stake, which could potentially lead to a premium on OreCorp's share price. The stipulation that contracts will be rescinded if the condition isn't met provides a layer of protection for OreCorp shareholders, potentially making the offer more attractive as it mitigates the risk of becoming a minority shareholder in a less controlled environment. Furthermore, the extension option in case of an insufficient acceptance rate by the original expiry date might induce more shareholders to accept the offer, knowing they have the possibility to withdraw if the delay extends beyond one month. This could be a tactical move to encourage a higher acceptance rate prior to the deadline, as it provides additional flexibility to the shareholders. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the non-waiver of the 50.1% minimum acceptance condition by Silvercorp could be interpreted as a commitment to only proceed with the takeover if it allows for a controlling interest in OreCorp. This approach minimizes the financial risk for Silvercorp by avoiding a scenario where it might be required to manage an acquisition without sufficient control to implement strategic changes. The offer's composition of both Silvercorp common shares and cash per OreCorp share indicates a balanced structure aiming to appeal to diverse shareholder preferences, offering both immediate liquidity and investment in Silvercorp's future growth. Investors should consider the implications of the offer's terms, which may influence OreCorp's share price and trading volume as the offer period progresses. The certainty provided by the non-waiver could lead to a more stable trading environment for OreCorp shares, as shareholders have a clear understanding of the outcomes should the condition not be satisfied. This could also potentially impact Silvercorp's share price, as the market reacts to the takeover strategy and the perceived value of the combined entity. Legal Expert Legally, the stipulation that Silvercorp will not waive its 50.1% minimum acceptance condition aligns with corporate governance practices that ensure the acquirer gains a level of control that justifies the investment. The decision to lodge a supplementary bidder's statement with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission demonstrates due diligence and transparency, which are critical in such corporate actions. This adherence to regulatory requirements not only fosters shareholder trust but also ensures that the takeover bid process is conducted within the legal framework of the Corporations Act. The legal rights afforded to OreCorp shareholders, such as the ability to withdraw their acceptance if the offer is extended beyond a certain period, are significant in providing an exit strategy should the takeover landscape change. This aspect of the offer may influence the decision-making process of shareholders, as it gives them a legal recourse in the event of an unfavorable shift in the takeover dynamics. 03/10/2024 - 06:00 PM Trading Symbol: TSX: SVMNYSE AMERICAN: SVM VANCOUVER, BC, March 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Silvercorp Metals Inc. (""Silvercorp"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) today wishes to inform its shareholders, and shareholders of OreCorp Limited (""OreCorp"") (ASX:ORR), that it intends to file a third supplementary bidder statement to indicate that the Company will not waive its 50.1% minimum acceptance condition (the ""Condition"") relating to its off-market takeover bid for all of the ordinary shares in OreCorp that it does not already own (the ""Offer"") in exchange for consideration comprising 0.0967 common shares of Silvercorp and A$0.19 cash per OreCorp share (the ""Consideration""). The supplementary bidder's statement will be lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Silvercorp's Offer is currently open for acceptances until 7:00 pm (Sydney time) on 22 March 2024, unless further extended or withdrawn in accordance with the Corporations Act (the ""Offer Period""). As a result of Silvercorp's intention not to waive the Condition, OreCorp shareholders who accept the Offer prior to the end of the Offer Period will have confirmation and comfort that unless the Condition is satisfied, Silvercorp will, at the end of the Offer Period: Rescind all contracts resulting from acceptances of the Offer and OreCorp shareholders will in that event retain their OreCorp shares; orElect to extend the Offer Period. In this case, if the time when Silvercorp has to meet its obligations under the Offer is postponed for more than 1 month from the original expiry date, OreCorp shareholders who have accepted the Offer prior to that extension will be entitled to withdraw their acceptance and retain their OreCorp shares.Silvercorp is declaring its intention not to waive the Condition in order to enhance the attractiveness of its Offer by providing OreCorp shareholders with the opportunity to realize upon the current superior value of Silvercorp's Offer, while at the same time protecting OreCorp shareholders by eliminating the risk that by accepting the Offer: Accepting shareholders will become a shareholder of a company that only holds a minority interest in OreCorp; orThat Silvercorp might take up the OreCorp shares accepted under the Offer and then use them to accept a competing offer.In the event where Silvercorp has received acceptances from more than 50.1% of shareholders, Silvercorp would take up all shares accepted that it did not previously own for the Consideration. In addition to protecting all shareholders' interests, Silvercorp believes that ensuring the Condition remains in place will assist to bring a timely resolution to its Offer. The Company encourages all OreCorp shareholders who have not already accepted the Silvercorp Offer to do so without delay.

Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from the INTEGUMENT-PED Phase 3 study of roflumilast cream 0.05% in young children present a significant advancement in the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The clinical data indicating a 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) and the achievement of a validated Investigator Global Assessment – Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 'clear' or 'almost clear' in a substantial percentage of participants, demonstrate a potential for a new, effective therapeutic option in pediatric dermatology. These results, along with the reported rapid reduction in itch, could translate into a higher quality of life for patients and could influence caregiver decisions regarding treatment adherence.From a research perspective, the consistent efficacy across different age groups and the favorable safety profile are promising. The low incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and the minimal reports of application site pain suggest a tolerable treatment alternative to steroids, which are commonly associated with more severe side effects. However, it is important to note that longer-term studies would be necessary to fully understand the long-term safety and efficacy of roflumilast cream, especially in a pediatric population that may require ongoing treatment. Pediatric Dermatologist As a specialist in pediatric dermatology, the potential approval of roflumilast cream 0.05% could represent a significant shift in the management of atopic dermatitis in young children. The steroid-free nature of the treatment addresses a critical concern about the long-term use of steroids and their systemic effects, such as growth retardation and hormonal imbalances. The early onset of efficacy, with improvements noted as soon as 24 hours after the first application, is particularly important in this patient group, where symptom control can be challenging and impactful on both the child's and family's daily life.Moreover, the aspect of the cream being formulated to not disrupt the skin barrier is crucial, as maintaining skin integrity is a key component in managing atopic dermatitis. The simplicity of a once-daily application also has the potential to improve adherence to treatment, which is a common issue in pediatric care. If the cream is approved, it will be important to integrate education for both clinicians and caregivers on its use and potential benefits, ensuring optimal outcomes. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the successful trial results of roflumilast cream 0.05% represent a potential opportunity for Arcutis Biotherapeutics to capture a share of the pediatric atopic dermatitis market, which is a segment with a notable unmet need for safe and effective treatments. The data suggesting a significant improvement over vehicle treatment could position the cream favorably among existing and forthcoming therapies, potentially leading to a strong market entry upon approval.Furthermore, the fact that these results were presented at a major dermatology conference could enhance the visibility of Arcutis Biotherapeutics among healthcare professionals, potentially increasing anticipation for the product's launch. The company's focus on immuno-dermatology could also see synergies with its existing or pipeline products, creating a more comprehensive portfolio for dermatological conditions. These factors combined could have a positive impact on the company's stock performance, as investors often react favorably to successful clinical trial outcomes and the expansion of a company's therapeutic offerings. 03/10/2024 - 04:00 PM Investigational roflumilast cream 0.05% met the primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints, showing significant improvement across multiple efficacy endpoints as early as Week 139.4% of children treated with roflumilast cream 0.05% achieved a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75), a key secondary endpointNew data highlight rapid and significant reduction in itch as early as 24 hours following first application of roflumilast cream 0.05% based on daily Worst Itch Numeric Scale (WI-NRS)New data show 35.4% of children treated with roflumilast cream 0.05% achieved a validated Investigator Global Assessment – Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ at Week 4, with significant improvements seen as early as Week 1Results for roflumilast cream 0.05%, show consistent efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability profile from the INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 pivotal trials SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARQT), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing meaningful innovations in immuno-dermatology, today presented in a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting (San Diego, CA, March 8 – 12) new data from its INTEGUMENT-PED pivotal Phase 3 study of investigational roflumilast cream 0.05% in children 2 to 5 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. The study found that treatment with once-daily, steroid-free roflumilast cream 0.05% resulted in significant improvements in atopic dermatitis across multiple efficacy endpoints and all timepoints, including disease clearance as early as Week 1 and reduction in itch in the first 24 hours following application. Results showed 25.4% of children treated with roflumilast cream 0.05% achieved the primary endpoint of IGA Success, defined as vIGA-AD score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at Week 4, compared to 10.7% treated with the vehicle (P<0.0001), with significant improvements also seen at Week 1 and Week 2. In the study, 39.4% of children treated with roflumilast cream 0.05% achieved a 75% improvement in EASI (EASI-75) at Week 4 compared to 20.6% treated with vehicle (P<0.0001). “For the pediatric patient population, tradeoffs between efficacy, tolerability, and safety are critical aspects of atopic dermatitis treatment decisions. In addition, tolerability is paramount, and if there are problems with tolerability, there is a hurdle for adherence,” said Lawrence F. Eichenfield, MD, professor of dermatology and pediatrics and vice-chair of the department of dermatology at UC San Diego School of Medicine, and study investigator. “These tradeoffs are further amplified in young children, which is why having a well-designed formulation that doesn’t disrupt the skin barrier benefits the patient and decreases the concerns of caregivers. The results from this study of once-daily application of roflumilast cream 0.05% in patients 2 to 5 years old are consistent with the findings from the INTEGUMENT-1 and INTEGUMENT-2 studies of patients down to the age of 6. If approved, this profile will be a welcome, easily adopted option for patients and clinicians alike.” Roflumilast cream is an investigational once-daily, steroid-free topical cream formulated to deliver drug without disrupting the skin barrier. INTEGUMENT-PED enrolled 652 children ages 2 to 5, with a mean Body Surface Area of 22% overall, and a range from 3% to 82%. The data reinforces the well-established efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of roflumilast cream in atopic dermatitis across the INTEGUMENT program. New data highlighted in the session included 35.4% of children treated with roflumilast cream achieved vIGA-AD clear (0) or almost clear (1) compared to 14.6% of vehicle (P<0.0001) at the end of the study (Week 4), with improvements seen as early as Week 1. In addition, the data show improvement in itch with roflumilast cream 0.05% as early as 24 hours following first application, based on LS mean change from baseline in daily WI-NRS score (P=0.0014 vs vehicle). “We are pleased to present these data from our pivotal Phase 3 INTEGUMENT-PED study of roflumilast cream in children aged 2 through 5, which provide strong support for the safety and efficacy in this young age group and are consistent with the results with roflumilast cream across our atopic dermatitis development program,” said Patrick Burnett, MD, PhD, FAAD, chief medical officer, Arcutis. “Roflumilast cream 0.05% was also shown to be well-tolerated in young children as demonstrated by both investigator and patient-reported outcomes. We know that there is a significant unmet need for safe, tolerable, and efficacious topical treatments for this young patient population, and look forward to providing meaningful innovation through the continued development of roflumilast cream.” Roflumilast cream 0.05% was well tolerated. The incidence of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) was low, and the only adverse event occurring in ≥3% of subjects in either active- or vehicle-arm was upper respiratory tract infection. The most frequent adverse events in the roflumilast arm (≥2%) included pyrexia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Local tolerability was also favorable, with application site pain only being reported in 1.6% of roflumilast-treated participants vs.1.9% for the vehicle. About INTEGUMENT-PED The “INterventional Trial EvaluatinG roflUMilast cream for the treatmENt of aTopic dermatitis in PEDiatric patients” (INTEGUMENT-PED) was a Phase 3, parallel group, double blind, vehicle-controlled trial in which roflumilast cream 0.05% or vehicle was applied once daily for four weeks to children 2 to 5 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. No moisturizers, emollients, or other products were allowed on treatment sites during the trial. A total of 652 children were enrolled in the study. The primary endpoint was IGA Success, defined as a vIGA-AD score of ‘clear’ or ‘almost clear’ plus a 2-grade improvement from baseline at Week 4. Multiple secondary endpoints were also evaluated, including the proportion of subjects who attained at least a 75% reduction in the EASI-75 at Week 4. About Roflumilast CreamRoflumilast cream is a next generation topical phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor.

United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Supports Accelerated Approval Pathway for Rexlemestrocel-L in End-Stage Heart Failure Patients with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD),2024-03-10T23:54:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Mesoblast Limited receives FDA support for an accelerated approval pathway for rexlemestrocel-L in patients with end-stage ischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and a left ventricular assist device, based on positive results from a pivotal study.","United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) Supports Accelerated Approval Pathway for Rexlemestrocel-L in End-Stage Heart Failure Patients with a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Mesoblast Limited receives FDA support for an accelerated approval pathway for rexlemestrocel-L in patients with end-stage ischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and a left ventricular assist device, based on positive results from a pivotal study. Positive None. Negative None. Cardiology Specialist The recent FDA support for an accelerated approval pathway for rexlemestrocel-L in patients with end-stage ischemic heart failure is a significant development in the field of cardiology. The product's potential to reduce mortality in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) aligns with the ongoing need for innovative treatments in advanced heart failure management. The reduction in IL-6 levels and the improved rates of weaning from LVAD support suggest a promising impact on inflammation and heart function recovery. However, it is crucial to consider the long-term outcomes and the potential for widespread application, as the current study involves a relatively small patient cohort. Biotech Industry Analyst From an industry perspective, Mesoblast's progress with rexlemestrocel-L could be a game-changer for the company's valuation and market position. The FDA's accelerated pathway can expedite the product's time-to-market, potentially providing a competitive edge. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with accelerated approvals, such as the requirement for post-marketing studies and the possibility of restricted use until further data is available. The market for LVADs is growing and Mesoblast's success could attract partnerships or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their heart failure portfolios. Healthcare Regulatory Expert The FDA's feedback under the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation is a positive regulatory milestone for Mesoblast. The accelerated approval pathway is reserved for therapies that address unmet medical needs, based on surrogate endpoints that are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefits. Mesoblast's ability to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality is a strong surrogate endpoint, but the company must be prepared for the stringent post-approval requirements that come with accelerated approval, including confirmatory trials and risk management strategies. The pre-Biologics License Application (BLA) meeting will be critical to align expectations and ensure that the data presentation meets the regulatory standards for approval. 03/10/2024 - 07:54 PM NEW YORK, March 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mesoblast Limited (Nasdaq:MESO; ASX:MSB), global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases, today announced that U.S. FDA supports an accelerated approval pathway for rexlemestrocel-L, Mesoblast’s allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cell (MPC) product, in patients with end-stage ischemic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). FDA provided this feedback in formal minutes to the company following the Type B meeting held with FDA on February 21, 2024 for rexlemestrocel-L (Revascor®) under the existing Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation. “We are very pleased with FDA’s feedback that the presented results from our pivotal study of rexlemestrocel-L in end-stage HFrEF patients with LVADs may support an accelerated approval,” said Mesoblast CEO Dr. Silviu Itescu. “We intend to request a pre-Biologics License Application (BLA) meeting to discuss data presentation, timing and FDA expectations for an accelerated approval filing.” Every year in the United States over 100,000 patients progress to end-stage HFrEF. In these patients, more than 2,500 life prolonging LVADs are implanted in the US annually, of whom approximately 80% undergo the procedure as destination or permanent therapy.1 Most patients receiving LVADs as destination therapy have an ischemic HFrEF etiology. Compared to patients with non-ischemic HFrEF, patients with ischemic HFrEF have a 76% lower likelihood of LV functional recovery following LVAD implantation,2 and increased mortality over the initial 1-2 years.3 Resistance to functional recovery in ischemic HFrEF patients is thought to be due to excessive inflammation and microvascular insufficiency in the ischemic myocardium.4 In the placebo-controlled LVAD-MPC Study #2, 70 patients with end-stage ischemic HFrEF were randomized at the time of LVAD implantation surgery to either a single intervention with rexlemestrocel-L (150 million STRO3-immunoselected and culture-expanded allogeneic cells) or placebo injected directly into the left ventricular myocardium. Key findings were: Ischemic controls were characterized by persistently elevated levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, by reduced ability to be weaned from LVAD support, and by high mortality.In contrast, in ischemic patients treated with rexlemestrocel-L, IL-6 levels returned to normal by 2 months and remained low through 12 months.63% of ischemic patients who received a single administration of rexlemestrocel-L successfully underwent temporary weaning from full LVAD support as early as month 2 as compared with 36% of controls (p = 0.008).The cumulative incidence of successful temporary weans off the LVAD device over 6 months was also increased by 1.55-fold over control in ischemic patients who received rexlemestrocel-L ([95% CI 1.01, 2.36]; p=0.02).Only 4.9% of ischemic patients treated with a single administration of rexlemestrocel-L died from month 2 through month 12, as compared with 26.9% of ischemic controls, an 82% reduction (p = 0.02). In feedback provided to Mesoblast regarding potential pathways to licensure for rexlemestrocel-L, FDA’s comments indicated that the presented results may support a reasonable likelihood of clinical benefit of MPCs against mortality in LVAD patients, consistent with the criteria for accelerated approval. Mesoblast intends to request a pre-BLA meeting with FDA to discuss data presentation, timing and FDA expectations for an accelerated approval filing in end-stage ischemic HFrEF patients with LVAD implantation. About Revascor® (rexlemestrocel-L) in Heart DiseaseREVASCOR is an allogeneic preparation of immunoselected and culture-expanded mesenchymal precursor cells (MPC) and is being developed as an immunomodulatory therapy to address the high degree of inflammation in the heart and in the circulation that is present across the spectrum of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients, from New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II through end-stage CHF, in order to reduce the high rate of major cardiac events and complications. This investigational therapy has been trialled in two large placebo-controlled randomized studies in patients with CHF, a 565-patient trial in NYHA class II/III HFrEF patients and a 159-patient trial in end-stage HFrEF patients implanted with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD). Rexlemestrocel-L has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and Orphan Drug designations for patients with end-stage HFrEF implanted with an LVAD. About Chronic Heart Failure Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by poor heart function resulting in insufficient blood flow to the body’s vital organs and extremities. This condition affects approximately 6.5 million people in the United States and 26 million people globally with increasing prevalence and incidence. CHF patients are commonly classified according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) categories based on the patient’s physical limitations. Class I (mild) patients have no limitations while Class IV patients (severe/end stage) experience symptoms even at rest. The mortality rate approaches 50% at 5 years as patients progress beyond NYHA early class II disease in parallel with increasing inflammation in the heart and in the circulation.5,6 Despite recent approvals of new therapies for HFrEF, NYHA class II/III HFrEF patients with inflammation remain at high risk for cardiac death, heart attacks and strokes. Over 100,000 patients annually in the US progress to end-stage heart failure (NYHA class IIIB/IV) and these patients have a one-year mortality exceeding 50%.7 Use of LVADs in end-stage heart failure patients to improve survival is gaining momentum, with approximately 2,000 LVADs implanted as destination therapy annually in the US,1 the majority of whom have an ischemic etiology.

Dermatology Expert The recent findings from the Phase 2 study of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% in treating hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) are significant for patients and healthcare providers alike. HS, a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent abscesses and nodules, has been difficult to manage due to the lack of approved treatments for its milder forms. The study's primary endpoint, a significant reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule count, indicates that ruxolitinib cream could be a promising topical therapy for HS, potentially changing the standard of care.Moreover, the secondary endpoints, such as the high percentages of patients achieving 50%, 75%, 90% and complete reduction in AN count, underscore the cream's effectiveness. The use of the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) as a measurement tool is particularly noteworthy. HiSCR is a widely recognized clinical outcome that assesses the reduction in inflammatory lesion count without worsening of abscesses or draining fistulas, providing a holistic view of treatment efficacy. The favorable safety profile, with a low incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, further supports the potential for ruxolitinib cream as a long-term management option for HS patients. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, Incyte's progress with ruxolitinib cream represents not only a therapeutic advancement but also a strategic business development. The absence of approved treatments for mild-to-moderate HS opens a niche market for Incyte, potentially allowing the company to establish a strong foothold in the dermatology space. Considering the chronic nature of HS and the need for ongoing treatment, the demand for an effective topical solution could translate into a steady revenue stream for the company.Investors should note the potential for market expansion, as successful Phase 2 results often lead to Phase 3 studies and, subsequently, to regulatory submissions. The market size for HS treatments is likely to grow as awareness and diagnosis rates increase, further benefiting companies like Incyte that are at the forefront of developing new therapies. It's important to monitor subsequent clinical trials and regulatory milestones, as these will be critical in determining the commercial success of ruxolitinib cream. Medical Research Analyst Assessing the research methodology and outcomes, the robustness of the Phase 2 study design is evident in the statistically significant results achieved for the primary and secondary endpoints. The use of a control group applying vehicle cream establishes a clear comparative baseline to demonstrate the efficacy of ruxolitinib cream. The International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) and the Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) are validated instruments that add credibility to the reported outcomes, particularly in terms of quantifying symptom severity and patient quality of life.While the results are promising, additional research is needed to evaluate the impact on skin pain and itch scores, as mentioned in the study. The long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib cream will also require further investigation, particularly in larger and more diverse patient populations. The medical community will be looking for these data to confirm the generalizability of the Phase 2 findings and to establish ruxolitinib cream as a standard treatment option for HS. 03/10/2024 - 04:05 PM Randomized Phase 2 study met the primary endpoint in patents with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), reinforcing efficacy and safety profile of ruxolitinib cream Results presented as a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced new results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of twice-daily ruxolitinib cream 1.5% (Opzelura®) in adult patients with Hurley stage 1 or 2 (mild-to-moderate) hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). These data were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation (Session: S050 – Late-Breaking Research: Session 2) at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, held from March 8-12, 2024, in San Diego. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a significantly greater reduction in abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count in patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5%, compared to those who applied the vehicle control (least squares mean change of -3.61 for ruxolitinib cream 1.5% vs. -2.42 for vehicle control; P<0.05) at Week 16. “The results presented today reinforce the efficacy and safety profile of ruxolitinib cream, which shows great potential for people living with milder HS,” said Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D., Group Vice President, Inflammation & AutoImmunity, Incyte. “Despite its daily impact on the lives of patients, there are currently no approved therapies for mild-to-moderate HS and the current standard of care is often inadequate. Today’s data represent an important step in progressing research for HS with the goal of being able to provide patients with an effective option to better manage their condition.” Additional secondary endpoints of the study included: More than three quarters (79.2%) of on-treatment patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in AN count (AN50), 54.2% achieved a 75% reduction (AN75), 20.8% achieved 90% reduction (AN90), and 20.8% achieved complete clearance (100% reduction, AN100), surpassing the 56.3%, 25.0%, 12.5% and 12.5% reductions, respectively, in the vehicle control group. The majority (79.2%) of patients in the ruxolitinib cream 1.5% group met the criteria for Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR), which indicates a 50% or greater reduction in AN count without an increase in abscesses or draining fistulas, compared to 50.0% of patients in the vehicle control group. Patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% showed a greater mean reduction in the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) score compared to baseline at Week 16 (-4.46) compared to the vehicle group (-2.66). Patients treated with ruxolitinib cream 1.5% showed a change -1.85 and -1.42 from baseline in the Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and Itch NRS at Week 16, respectively, versus a -2.61 and -2.75 change from those in the vehicle control group. Due to patient eligibility criteria, patients studied did not have high itch or skin pain scores at baseline; however, additional research is needed to evaluate treatment impact on skin pain and itch scores. The study results showed that ruxolitinib cream 1.5% was generally well-tolerated. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 38.2% of patients who applied ruxolitinib cream 1.5% versus 42.9% of patients who applied vehicle control. The most common TEAEs among patients receiving ruxolitinib cream 1.5% were COVID-19 (5.9%) and nasopharyngitis (5.9%). Discontinuation due to TEAEs were infrequent (ruxolitinib cream 1.5%, n=2 [5.9%]; vehicle control, n=0 [0%]), and no serious TEAEs were reported in the ruxolitinib cream 1.5% group. “HS is a chronic, debilitating skin condition that unfortunately has no cure, so managing the signs and symptoms through an effective treatment is key to ensuring patients are able to live their lives with minimal impact from this disease,” said Dr. Martina J. Porter, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. “Better disease control can help manage the persistent symptoms of HS for these patients. There still remains a very large need for effective therapies for patients with HS, particularly for those with milder HS, and I’m encouraged by the results from this Phase 2 study of ruxolitinib cream for this patient population.” More information regarding the AAD Annual Meeting 2024 can be found at https://www.aad.org/member/meetings-education/am24. About Hidradenitis Suppurativa Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful nodules and abscesses that can lead to irreversible tissue destruction and scarring.1,2 Over-activity of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway is believed to drive inflammation involved in the pathogenesis and progression of HS.3 More than 150,000 patients in the U.S. are estimated to have moderate-to-severe HS.4 Given the debilitating nature of condition, it can have a profoundly negative effect on patients’ quality of life.5 About the Phase 2 Study (NCT05635838) This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib cream 1.5% (Opzelura®) in patients with mild-to-moderate hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The study enrolled 69 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with Hurley stage 1 or 2 HS who have a total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count of 3 to ≤ 10, with no draining tunnels at screening and baseline visits. The primary outcome measure of the study is change from baseline in AN count at Week 16. Secondary outcome measures include proportion of participants achieving reduction in AN count relative to baseline, change from baseline in the Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), change from baseline in the itch NRS score, proportion of participants who achieve Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR), change from baseline in the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) score and number of TEAEs.

Results presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, underlining Lilly's dedication to health equity in dermatology. Negative None. Dermatology Research Analyst The recent study from Eli Lilly on lebrikizumab's efficacy for individuals with skin of color presents a significant advancement in the field of dermatology. Historically, clinical trials have not fully represented the demographic diversity of patients with atopic dermatitis, resulting in a gap in efficacy data for treatments across different skin types. The Fitzpatrick scale, a tool for classifying skin types, has been pivotal in this study to ensure the inclusion of individuals with darker skin tones, often underrepresented in such research.From a research perspective, the consistent results with previous Phase 3 trials suggest that lebrikizumab could be a promising biologic treatment for a broader patient demographic, addressing a long-standing need for targeted therapies. The use of the PDCA-Derm™ scale for assessing post-inflammatory pigmentation is also noteworthy, as it may provide a more nuanced understanding of treatment effects on skin discoloration, which is a common concern among patients with darker skin. The absence of new safety signals in the trial is reassuring, although ongoing monitoring in a larger population over a longer period will be essential for a comprehensive safety profile. Health Equity Advocate The focus on health equity in Eli Lilly's clinical trial for lebrikizumab is commendable and necessary for ensuring that all patient populations receive appropriate care. The proactive approach to involving patients with skin of color and addressing their specific treatment challenges is a step towards reducing disparities in healthcare. The company's commitment to improving outcomes for these patients through research, education and patient empowerment aligns with broader industry trends towards inclusive healthcare practices.Engaging with healthcare providers to increase awareness and understanding of dermatologic conditions in patients with diverse skin tones is a critical component of this initiative. By empowering patients to voice their needs and actively participate in finding solutions, Eli Lilly is not only working towards better treatment options but also fostering a more patient-centric approach to healthcare. Market Analyst From a market perspective, Eli Lilly's development of lebrikizumab has the potential to capture a significant share of the atopic dermatitis treatment market, especially among populations that have been historically underserved. The emphasis on skin of color could differentiate lebrikizumab from other treatments, potentially leading to a competitive advantage. The exclusive rights for development and commercialization outside Europe, in partnership with Almirall S.A., suggest strategic positioning to maximize market reach and profitability.Investors should note the potential for lebrikizumab to become a first-line biologic treatment after topical therapies, which could substantially increase its usage. The robust data on efficacy and safety, if sustained through further trials and upon market release, may lead to strong adoption rates by healthcare providers. However, the long-term market performance will depend on post-market surveillance, patient and provider acceptance and the competitive dynamics of the dermatology market. 03/10/2024 - 04:00 PM INDIANAPOLIS, March 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) announced results from a first-of-its-kind study of lebrikizumab specifically designed for people with skin of color and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema. In this study, treatment with lebrikizumab, an investigational medicine, showed improvement in skin clearance and itch relief. These late-breaking results from a Phase 3 study are being presented today at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting. The lebrikizumab efficacy results from this trial are consistent with data in other Phase 3 studies, which further reinforces lebrikizumab's potential to be a first-line biologic treatment following topical prescription therapies for people across a range of skin tones with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. ""People with skin of color are disproportionately affected by atopic dermatitis, often experiencing more severe symptoms, a delay in diagnosis and a lengthier timeframe to find appropriate treatment. They also have been historically underrepresented in clinical trials, which means we have lacked data pertaining to the treatment of patients with skin of color,"" said Andrew Alexis, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Clinical Dermatology and Vice Chair for Diversity and Inclusion in the Department of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine, a dermatologist at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, and lead study investigator. ""With these initial results, Lilly is taking a step toward investigating the needs of people with skin of color affected by atopic dermatitis."" The initial 16-week data from this study evaluated 50 patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and darker skin tones as measured by the Fitzpatrick scale¶, including people who self-identify as Black or African American (80%), Asian (14%), American Indian or Alaska Native (6%). Of the 50 patients, 11 also self-identified as Hispanic/Latinx (22%) with the remaining 39 self-identifying as non-Hispanic/Latinx (78%). All patients received lebrikizumab 500-mg subcutaneously initially and at two weeks followed by 250-mg subcutaneously every two weeks to Week 16. Results at 16 weeks were consistent with the 16-week results from the ADhere and ADvocate 1 & 2 studies. 68% of people experienced significant improvement of at least 75% in disease extent and severity (EASI-75)*. 46% of people experienced at least 90% improvement in disease extent and severity (EASI-90)†. 39% of people achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA 0,1)‡ with a reduction of at least two points from baseline.55% of people experienced clinically meaningful itch relief (PNRS ≥4-point improvement)§. No new safety signals were observed and there were no serious adverse events reported. The study also included a physician assessment of changes in post-inflammatory pigmentation using the newly developed PDCA-Derm™ scale. Full efficacy and safety results from the study will be shared at future congresses. ""Lebrikizumab is the first investigative treatment for atopic dermatitis to disclose robust efficacy data specifically for people with skin of color, who may experience barriers to treatment or inequitable care,"" said Mark Genovese, M.D., senior vice president of Immunology Development at Lilly.

The Company also plans to commence Phase 3 trials in hidradenitis suppurativa, targeting a market opportunity exceeding $10bn by 2035. MoonLake further announces the initiation of four additional clinical trials across dermatology and rheumatology, highlighting the potential of sonelokimab in various inflammatory diseases. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by MoonLake Immunotherapeutics regarding the ARGO trial results for sonelokimab in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a noteworthy development. The reported ACR50 response rate improvement to 60% at 24 weeks is significant, as this metric is a standard for assessing efficacy in PsA treatments. Achieving an ACR50 response means that a patient experiences at least a 50% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts, which is a substantial clinical milestone. Moreover, the trial's low discontinuation rate of around 5% suggests a favorable tolerance profile for sonelokimab.From a research perspective, the capability of sonelokimab to inhibit both IL-17A and IL-17F could position it as a potential best-in-class therapy given its multi-domain efficacy. This is particularly relevant as the treatment landscape for PsA is highly competitive, with several biologics targeting IL-17A. The differentiation of sonelokimab comes from its dual action, which may provide a more comprehensive approach to inflammation management in PsA. Market Research Analyst The projected market opportunity for sonelokimab in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) treatment exceeds $10 billion by 2035, indicating a robust commercial potential. The real-world data suggesting a ~1% prevalence of diagnosed and treated HS patients, with a higher estimated percentage including undiagnosed cases, underscores the unmet need within this therapeutic area. The low current biologic penetration rate and high dropout rate from existing treatments highlight the potential for sonelokimab to capture significant market share, provided it demonstrates superior efficacy and safety in the upcoming Phase 3 trials.Furthermore, the company's intention to explore additional indications such as palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP) and juvenile HS, where there are limited or no approved therapies, could further expand MoonLake's market reach. The strategic expansion into these areas not only diversifies the company's portfolio but also targets niche markets with high unmet medical needs, potentially enhancing MoonLake's overall valuation and attractiveness to investors. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the ARGO trial results for MoonLake are multifaceted. Positive clinical trial outcomes often lead to increased investor confidence, which can be reflected in the company's stock performance. However, it is crucial to consider the costs associated with advancing to Phase 3 trials and potential commercialization. MoonLake's financials will be impacted by these development costs, which they must manage while maintaining sufficient cash flow to support ongoing operations and additional clinical programs.Investors will closely monitor MoonLake's burn rate and fundraising strategies to ensure the company can sustain its ambitious clinical development plans without excessive dilution of shares. The ability to meet projected timelines for regulatory approval and market entry is also critical, as delays can significantly impact projected revenues and market positioning. 03/10/2024 - 12:00 PM MoonLake announces significant improvements with Nanobody® sonelokimab over 24 weeks in active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other important updates at its R&D Day Positive 24-week data from the ARGO trial of sonelokimab in PsA:Significant improvements observed across all key outcomes, including approximately 60% of patients treated with sonelokimab achieving an ACR50 response at week 24Unprecedented multi-domain responses across joints, skin and other domains, including up to 52% of patients achieving ACR50+PASI100 and up to 61% of patients achieving Minimal Disease Activity (MDA), supporting potential best-in-class profile of sonelokimabMonthly maintenance with 60mg or 120mg doses showed leading responses above TNF reference arm across all key outcomes including in higher treatment goals (ACR70, PASI100, composites) – 120mg added benefit for specific patient subgroupsLow discontinuation rate around 5% and safety profile of sonelokimab consistent with previously reported studies with no new safety signalsUpdate on sonelokimab in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS):Following interactions with the FDA and EMA, MoonLake intends to commence Phase 3 trials in HS in Q2 2024, under the VELA program; the program is expected to enroll 800 patients and reflect a similar protocol design to that used in the MIRA Phase 2 trial, with top-line primary endpoint data expected as early as mid-2025Real-world data indicates that at least 2 million Americans have been diagnosed with HS as of 2023, highlighting a significant unmet need and impact on healthcare systems, and a market opportunity exceeding $10bn by 2035 MoonLake further announces that it will imminently commence four additional clinical trials of sonelokimab across dermatology, and rheumatology, including innovative trials in palmo-plantar pustulosis, juvenile HS and seronegative spondyloarthritisThe Company is hosting an R&D Day on Sunday, March 10 at 09:00 PDT/12:00 EDT/17:00 CET via webcast (registration link below), alongside the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) annual meeting ZUG, Switzerland, March 10, 2024 – MoonLake Immunotherapeutics (“MoonLake”; Nasdaq: MLTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on creating next-level therapies for inflammatory diseases, today announces that continued treatment with Nanobody® sonelokimab led to significant improvements across all key outcomes at 24-week data from the ARGO trial in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and other important R&D updates. These updates will be presented and discussed in detail at the Company’s R&D Day to be held today, Sunday, March 10 (see access details below). Positive 24-week data from the ARGO trial in PsA The ARGO trial, which involved 207 patients with active PsA, demonstrated that the primary endpoint, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50, continued to improve from week 12 and exceeded 60% by week 24. The more rigorous ACR70 outcome was achieved by approximately 40% of patients by week 24. In addition, by week 24, over 80% and 60% of patients treated with sonelokimab achieved Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 90 and 100, respectively. Both doses of sonelokimab yielded similar results. The responses surpassed those for adalimumab, the active reference arm in the study, and were also higher when indirectly compared to competitors using the same active reference arm as a standard. Treatment with sonelokimab resulted in unprecedented improvements in composite scores that reflect responses in different domains simultaneously. ACR50+PASI90 up to 59%, ACR 50+PASI 100 up to 52%, ACR 70+PASI 100 up to 48% and MDA up to 61% response. In all composite scores, sonelokimab showed 16-29 percentage point differences to the reference adalimumab arm, comparatively higher to competitors using the same reference arm. While the 60mg dose was found to be sufficient to reach high levels of response in the general trial population, the 120mg dose was found to improve responses further in specific patient sub-groups, which suggests two doses being carried over to Phase 3. The safety profile of sonelokimab was consistent with previous trials with no new safety signals detected. The discontinuation rate of the second part of ARGO remained low at 5%, in line with other sonelokimab trials. Overall, sonelokimab continues to show a favorable safety profile. Across the sonelokimab clinical program to date, the company has not seen any signal of suicide ideation/behavior (SI/B) or liver enzyme elevations related to sonelokimab treatment. Kristian Reich, MD, PhD, Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at MoonLake, commented: “These positive results from the ARGO trial at week 24, showing that continued treatment with sonelokimab led to significant improvements across all key outcomes, reinforce the advantages of using a smaller biologic with albumin-binding capability to effectively inhibit IL-17F in addition to IL-17A for the treatment of deep tissue inflammation. We are particularly grateful to the patients and investigators who participated in our Phase 2 program and look forward to initiating our Phase 3 trials in PsA and HS this year.” Professor Joseph F. Merola, MD, MMSc, Founding President of the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Clinics Multicenter Advancement Network Consortium (PPACMAN), added: “There is a vital need for new treatment options for psoriatic arthritis - a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, and debilitating multidomain disease that has profound impact across many aspects of patients’ lives. It is highly encouraging to see that the positive high clinical responses across joint and skin endpoints and stringent composite measures, such as minimal disease activity, observed as early as week 12 with sonelokimab were further increased through week 24.” The 24-week results build upon the 12-week results announced in November 2023. Full results from the ARGO trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal. Sonelokimab is not yet approved for use in any indication. HS positive regulatory status and market opportunity MoonLake has recently announced the successful outcome of its end-of-Phase 2 interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the E.U. European Medicines Agency (EMA), with both regulatory bodies supporting MoonLake’s proposed approach for advancing its Phase 3 program of the Nanobody® sonelokimab in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). During the R&D Day, the Company will provide further details on trial design, expectations for the single 120mg dose being tested and timelines for this program, named VELA which is set to enroll 800 patients. Furthermore, the Company will share findings from a recent analysis of US real-world data pertaining to the HS market.i It revealed that between 2016 and 2023, two million unique patients were diagnosed and treated for HS, with an average of 240,000 new patients each year as per claims. This corresponds to a ~1% prevalence of diagnosed and treated patients, aligning well with estimates that over 2% of the population, including those undiagnosed and untreated, have HS. These real-world data also substantiate a potential market size exceeding $10bn by 2035. Notably there is a low penetration of current biologics (around 3%) and a high dropout rate from treatment with current biologics within the first year (median of 11 months). Moreover, claims show that HS patients are lost in their treatment journey (e.g., more than 50-60% of patients are on long term on antibiotics and many of them are also on steroids / opioids, and 15% of patients receive surgery in year 1) representing a bleak prognosis for patients, physicians, and healthcare systems. This real-world perspective substantiates the company’s market size estimates and highlights the need for more effective therapies. Professor Kenneth B. Gordon, Chair of Dermatology at the Medical College of Wisconsin, commented: “The positive data that is being generated for the Nanobody® sonelokimab across chronic inflammatory indications, including HS, is raising the bar on the level of outcomes that can be achieved for patients. Patients are waiting for new treatment options with a prolonged effect, and the start of the Phase 3 trials is bringing hope that sonelokimab could be a promising potential option to the many patients that live and suffer with HS, a disease that has not received the attention it deserves until recently.” New indications MoonLake further announces that it will imminently commence four additional development programs, across dermatology and rheumatology where IL-17A and IL17-F inhibition in deep tissues has the opportunity to lead among all therapies. In dermatology, Phase 2 work is expected to be initiated in palmo-plantar pustulosis (PPP), a debilitating disease affecting a significant number of patients (estimated 0.3% prevalence) and for which there are no currently approved therapies. This new indication will strengthen MoonLake’s standing within the dermatology community. Furthermore, MoonLake expects to initiate a Phase 3 trial in juvenile HS a disease that typically begins at this early stage of a patient’s life, and also the period in which irreversible damage and inflammatory remission is most critical. It is anticipated that this trial will run concurrently with MoonLake’s adult Phase 3 program, marking the first time clinical trial evidence is generated specifically for this demographic. In rheumatology, MoonLake will also extend its development work in seronegative spondyloarthritis. Phase 2 work in radiographic and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is expected to start this year, with trials featuring an innovative design complementing traditional clinical outcomes with modern imaging techniques, adding two new indications to the pipeline. The Company plans to also run an additional trial in PsA, to link the impact of sonelokimab in traditional clinical outcomes (e.g., ACR50) with objective imaging measurements in different domains. The new axSpA and PsA studies are designed to employ cutting-edge MRI-PET imaging. Jorge Santos da Silva, PhD, Founder and Chief Executive Officer at MoonLake, said: “The robust data that we continue to amass with our Nanobody® shows that sonelokimab has the potential to be a best-in-class product in the fast-growing inflammation field, providing us with conviction to help even more patients by expanding into further indications beyond HS and PsA. With the positive feedback received to date from the FDA and EMA, together with our strong financials, we are now rapidly pursuing plans to commence Phase 3 trials in both HS and PsA before the end of this year and are expanding the development pipeline with the aim of elevating care with our next-level therapies via truly innovative clinical trials.” R&D Day today, Sunday, March 10 MoonLake will hold an R&D Day today, Sunday, March 10 alongside the AAD annual meeting. The event will take place from 09:00 – 11:30 PDT/12:00 – 14:30 EDT/17:00 – 19:30 CET at Hotel Westin Bayview, San Diego and will be webcast for virtual attendees. The R&D Day will highlight the 24-week ARGO data, discuss regulatory interactions and paths to Phase 3, and other important business updates from MoonLake’s executive team including: Analysis of the HS and PSA market opportunities and leadership potential for sonelokimab.Pipeline updates and details of additional catalysts for 2024 and 2025, including new indications to be pursued.Summary and financials. The event will feature presentations from leading clinicians in dermatology and rheumatology. Professor Joseph Merola, Chair of Dermatology, Professor of Dermatology, Medicine and Rheumatology, UT Southwestern Medical Center and Professor Kenneth B. Gordon, Chair of Dermatology at the Medical College of Wisconsin, will share their perspectives on the potential of MoonLake’s investigational Nanobody® sonelokimab in IL-17A and IL-17F driven inflammatory diseases.

Late breaker presentation of the 24-week data from the MIRA trial in HS at the AAD As announced in March 2024, the 24-week data from the Phase 2 MIRA trial with Nanobody® sonelokimab in moderate to severe HS, will be presented by Professor Brian Kirby MD, FRCPI on March 10 at 14:00 PDT/ 17:00 EDT / 22:00 CET during the late breaking research session 2 (S050) in room 20B at the AAD Annual Meeting, taking place from March 8-12, in San Diego, California. - Ends - About Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic and progressive inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis primarily affecting the peripheral joints. The clinical features of PsA are diverse, involving pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, which can result in restricted mobility and fatigue. PsA occurs in up to 30% of patients with psoriasis, most commonly those aged between 30 and 60 years. The symptom burden of PsA can have a substantial negative impact on patient quality of life. Although the exact mechanism of disease is not fully understood, evidence suggests that activation of the IL-17 pathway plays an important role in the disease pathophysiology. About the ARGO trial The ARGO trial (M1095-PSA-201) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Nanobody® sonelokimab, administered subcutaneously, in the treatment of adult patients with active PsA. The trial is designed to evaluate different doses of sonelokimab, with placebo control and adalimumab as an active reference arm. The primary endpoint of the trial is the percentage of participants achieving ≥50% improvement in signs and symptoms of disease from baseline, compared to placebo, as measured by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response. The trial also evaluates a number of secondary endpoints, including improvement compared to placebo in ACR20, complete skin clearance as measured by at least a 100% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), physical function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, enthesitis as measured by the Leeds Enthesitis Index and pain as measured by the Patients Assessment of Arthritis Pain. Further details are available on: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05640245 About Hidradenitis SuppurativaHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a severely debilitating chronic skin condition resulting in irreversible tissue destruction. HS manifests as painful inflammatory skin lesions, typically around the armpits, groin, and buttocks. Over time, uncontrolled and inadequately treated inflammation can result in irreversible tissue destruction and scarring. The disease affects 0.05–4.1% of the global population, with three times more females affected than males. Onset typically occurs in early adulthood and HS has a profound negative impact on quality of life, with a higher morbidity than other dermatologic conditions. There is increasing scientific evidence to support IL-17A- and IL-17F-mediated inflammation as a key driver of the pathogenesis of HS, with other identified risk factors including genetics, cigarette smoking, and obesity. About the MIRA trial The MIRA trial (M1095-HS-201) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Nanobody® sonelokimab, administered subcutaneously, in the treatment of adult patients with active moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa. The trial recruited 234 patients, with the aim to evaluate two different doses of sonelokimab (120mg and 240mg) with placebo control and adalimumab as an active reference arm. The primary endpoint of the trial is the percentage of participants achieving Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response 75 (HiSCR75), defined as a ≥75% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count with no increase in abscess or draining tunnel count relative to baseline. The trial also evaluated a number of secondary endpoints, including the proportion of patients achieving HiSCR50, the change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4), the proportion of patients achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score of ≤5, and the proportion of patients achieving at least 30% reduction from baseline in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS30) in the Patient’s Global Assessment of Skin Pain (PGA Skin Pain). Further details are available at: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05322473 About Sonelokimab Sonelokimab (M1095) is an investigational ~40 kDa humanized Nanobody® consisting of three VHH domains covalently linked by flexible glycine-serine spacers. With two domains, sonelokimab selectively binds with high affinity to IL-17A and IL-17F, thereby inhibiting the IL-17A/A, IL-17A/F, and IL-17F/F dimers. A third central domain binds to human albumin, facilitating further enrichment of sonelokimab at sites of inflammatory edema. Sonelokimab is being assessed in two trials, the Phase 2 ARGO trial in PsA and the Phase 2 MIRA trial in HS. In June 2023, topline results of the MIRA trial (NCT05322473) at 12 weeks showed that the trial met its primary endpoint, the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR)75, which is a higher measure of clinical response versus the HiSCR50 measure used in other clinical trials, setting a landmark milestone. In October 2023, the full dataset from the MIRA trial at 24 weeks showed that maintenance treatment with sonelokimab led to further improvements in HiSCR75 response rates and other clinically relevant outcomes. In November 2023, MoonLake announced positive top-line results from its global Phase 2 ARGO trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of the Nanobody® sonelokimab in patients with active PsA. The trial met its primary endpoint with a statistically significant greater proportion of patients treated with either sonelokimab 60mg or 120mg (with induction) achieving an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 response compared to those on placebo at week 12. All key secondary endpoints in the trial were met for the 60mg and 120mg doses with induction. Sonelokimab has also been assessed in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial (NCT03384745) in 313 patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis. High threshold clinical responses (Investigator’s Global Assessment Score 0 or 1, and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 90/100) were observed in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis. Sonelokimab was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the active control, secukinumab (Papp KA, et al. Lancet. 2021; 397:1564-1575). In an earlier Phase 1 trial in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis, sonelokimab has been shown to decrease (to normal skin levels) the cutaneous gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Svecova D. J Am Acad Dermatol. 2019;81:196–203). About Nanobodies® Nanobodies® represent a new generation of antibody-derived targeted therapies. They consist of one or more domains based on the small antigen-binding variable regions of heavy-chain-only antibodies (VHH).

Incyte Presents New Late-Breaking Data from Phase 2 Study Evaluating Povorcitinib in Patients with Prurigo Nodularis,2024-03-10T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Incyte (INCY) announced positive results from a Phase 2 study on povorcitinib for prurigo nodularis treatment at AAD Annual Meeting.

Povorcitinib demonstrated potential as an effective treatment with well-tolerated safety profile.","Incyte Presents New Late-Breaking Data from Phase 2 Study Evaluating Povorcitinib in Patients with Prurigo Nodularis Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Incyte (INCY) announced positive results from a Phase 2 study on povorcitinib for prurigo nodularis treatment at AAD Annual Meeting. The study met primary and secondary endpoints, showing significant improvement in itch scores. Povorcitinib demonstrated potential as an effective treatment with well-tolerated safety profile. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent Phase 2 study outcomes for povorcitinib, an oral JAK1 inhibitor, signify a substantial advancement in the treatment of prurigo nodularis (PN), a chronic skin condition characterized by itchy nodules. The achievement of primary and secondary endpoints suggests not only a statistically significant improvement in patients' itch relief but also an advancement in skin clearance. This is particularly noteworthy given the chronic nature of PN and the limited treatment options currently available.From a medical research perspective, the data indicating a median time to itch relief ranging from 17 to 58 days across different dosages offers a tangible measure of the drug's efficacy. Additionally, the safety profile, with the most common adverse events being headache, fatigue and nasopharyngitis, is reassuring for clinicians considering this treatment for their patients. The low discontinuation rate due to adverse events further supports the drug's tolerability.It's important to note that the JAK1 pathway is implicated in the inflammatory process that contributes to pruritus, or itching. By inhibiting this pathway, povorcitinib may address the underlying pathophysiology of PN. As such, these results could have implications for the broader field of dermatology, potentially offering insights into the treatment of other pruritic conditions. Financial Analyst Incyte's positive Phase 2 trial results for povorcitinib could have a favorable impact on the company's financial outlook. The success in all dosing groups indicates a strong potential for market penetration upon regulatory approval. The fact that the study met both primary and secondary endpoints is likely to be seen positively by investors, as it may enhance the drug's profile in the eyes of regulatory agencies and increase the likelihood of a successful Phase 3 trial and subsequent commercialization.Given the unmet need in the treatment of PN, povorcitinib could represent a significant revenue stream for Incyte. The company's strategic focus on expanding research into new indications for povorcitinib also suggests a commitment to diversifying its portfolio and targeting niche markets with high unmet medical needs, which can be a lucrative strategy.Investors should consider the potential for increased research and development costs associated with further trials, but the long-term gains from a new, successful treatment could outweigh these expenses. Moreover, the stock market often reacts positively to such clinical advancements, potentially leading to an uptick in Incyte's stock price in the short to medium term. Dermatology Expert Prurigo nodularis is a notoriously difficult condition to manage, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach due to its impact on patients' quality of life. The introduction of a novel oral JAK1 inhibitor like povorcitinib could revolutionize the standard of care. The clinical significance of these Phase 2 results lies in the drug's ability to disrupt the itch-scratch cycle, a critical aspect of PN that perpetuates the condition.Understanding the mechanism of action of JAK1 inhibitors provides context for the drug's potential efficacy. JAK1 is part of a family of enzymes that play a key role in the signaling pathways for various cytokines involved in inflammation and immune responses. By selectively inhibiting JAK1, povorcitinib may reduce the inflammatory signals that lead to the intense itching associated with PN.The dermatology community will be interested in the longer-term efficacy and safety data, as chronic conditions like PN require sustained management. The tolerability profile, as indicated by the low rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events, will be crucial in its adoption by healthcare providers. These results could pave the way for a new therapeutic class in dermatology, pending further validation in larger, Phase 3 trials. 03/10/2024 - 04:05 PM Randomized Phase 2 study met its primary and secondary endpoints following 16 weeks of treatment across all dosing groups, reinforcing povorcitinib’s potential role in treating prurigo nodularis (PN) Results presented as a late-breaking oral presentation at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting marks Incyte’s first presentation of data in PN WILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Incyte (Nasdaq:INCY) today announced results from a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of povorcitinib (INCB54707), an oral JAK1 inhibitor, in adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN). These data were presented as a late-breaking oral presentation (Session: S050 – Late-Breaking Research: Session 2) at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Annual Meeting, held from March 8-12, 2024, in San Diego. The study met its primary endpoint with a ≥4-point improvement in itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS4) score achieved by significantly more patients who received povorcitinib across all dosing groups (36.1% [P<0.01], 44.4% [P<0.001], 54.1% [P<0.0001] for 15, 45, 75 mg, respectively) than those who received placebo (8.1%) at Week 16. Median times to itch NRS4 were 58, 35 and 17 days for patients who received 15, 45 and 75 mg of povorcitinib, respectively, and was not estimable for the placebo arm. “PN is a condition that can cause itchy bumps on the skin called nodules, which appear after excessive scratching. Despite the severity of the disease and the significant impact it can have on a patient’s day-to-day life, there remains a significant need for effective treatments,” said Kurt Brown, M.D., Vice President and povorcitinib Global Program Head, Incyte. “These Phase 2 results, particularly the demonstrated improvement in itch resolution after just four weeks of treatment, are promising for patients around the world living with this disease. We are excited to be expanding research on povorcitinib into this new potential indication.” The secondary endpoints of the study were also met. At Week 16, 13.9%, 30.6% and 48.6% of patients who received 15, 45 and 75 mg of povorcitinib, respectively, achieved an Investigator’s Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) score of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-grade improvement from baseline, versus 5.4% of patients who received placebo. Further, 8.3%, 22.2% and 35.1% of patients who received 15, 45 and 75 mg of povorcitinib, respectively, achieved both itch NRS4 and IGA-TS at Week 16, versus 2.5% of patients who received placebo. Povorcitinib was generally well-tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with previously reported data. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) among patients who received povorcitinib were headache (11.1%), fatigue (9.3%) and nasopharyngitis (7.4%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs and serious TEAEs occurred in four (3.7%) and nine (8.3%) povorcitinib-treated patients, respectively, and discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent (povorcitinib, n=5 [4.6%]; placebo, n=1 [2.7%]). “PN can often be difficult to treat due to the uncontrollable itching and scratching, which can multiply the nodules that appear on a patient’s skin,” said Dr. Martin Metz, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy, Charité. “Breaking the itch-scratch cycle is imperative when treating patients with PN, and I’m encouraged by these results illustrating improvement in itch and also skin clearance by Week 16 which shows promise for povorcitinib as a potential novel treatment option for these patients.” More information regarding the AAD Annual Meeting 2024 can be found at https://www.aad.org/member/meetings-education/am24. About Prurigo Nodularis Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense itch and thickened red bumps on the arms, legs and trunk.1 Due to the result of persistent, intense scratching and rubbing of the skin, PN results in itchy bumps on the skin called “nodules”.2 PN appears to be more common in older individuals, and the painful bumps and constant itch can have a substantial impact on a patient’s sleep and overall quality of life.1 About the Phase 2 Study (NCT05061693) This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of povorcitinib (INCB54707) in adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN), over 16 weeks, followed by a 24-week extension. The study consists of 146 adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with PN who have had inadequate response or are intolerant to prior PN therapy. The primary outcome measure of the study is proportion of participants achieving ≥ 4-point improvement in itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score over 16 weeks. The secondary outcome measures include proportion of participants achieving Investigator's Global Assessment Treatment Success (IGA-TS) at Week 16, the proportion of patients achieving both IGA-TS and a ≥ 4-point improvement from baseline in itch NRS score assessed up to Week 16 and number of participants experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), assessed up to Week 16.

Financial Analyst The announcement from Barrick Gold Corporation regarding its Loulo-Gounkoto complex's contribution of over $1 billion to the Malian economy is a significant indicator of the company's operational success and its impact on local economies. This figure not only reflects the company's ability to maintain high production levels but also its role as a key revenue generator for Mali. The statement that the complex is on track to meet its production guidance suggests operational stability and efficiency, which are critical factors in assessing the company's future revenue streams and profitability.Moreover, the absence of lost time injuries or major environmental incidents reinforces the company's commitment to safety and environmental stewardship, potentially reducing the risk of regulatory fines and enhancing its corporate reputation. Investors often consider such ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) factors when evaluating a company's long-term sustainability and risk profile.Additionally, the strategic investments in local businesses and the extension of the mine's life, as well as the exploration of new growth opportunities within the region, indicate a forward-looking approach to resource management. This could result in sustained production and potential future expansions, which are positive signals for long-term investor confidence. Energy Sector Analyst The commissioning of Phase 2 of the Loulo-Gounkoto complex's solar power plant extension to 60 megawatts, coupled with the new battery storage system, is a noteworthy development in the mining industry's shift towards renewable energy solutions. This transition not only aligns with global trends of reducing carbon footprints but also may lead to operational cost savings in the long term due to reduced reliance on traditional energy sources.For stakeholders, the investment in renewable energy infrastructure could translate into lower energy costs, increased energy security and a stronger license to operate given the increasing importance of sustainable practices. It could also provide a competitive advantage as the industry moves towards more environmentally friendly operations, potentially impacting the company's valuation positively. Geologist The mention of high-resolution airborne magnetic geophysical surveys to identify the next generation of high-impact targets suggests that Barrick Gold Corporation is employing advanced exploration techniques to enhance its resource base. For investors, this proactive approach to exploration is indicative of the company's commitment to resource longevity and could lead to the discovery of new deposits that would extend the life of the mine and contribute to future revenues.The reopening of the Baboto open pit and the extension of mineralized structures following positive drilling results demonstrate the company's ability to effectively manage and expand its resources. These developments are crucial as they may increase the proven and probable reserves, which are fundamental to the company's asset valuation and future production potential. 03/10/2024 - 06:00 AM All amounts expressed in US dollars LOULO, Mali, March 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD)(TSX:ABX) – The Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Mali, one of the world’s largest gold producers, has contributed more than $1 billion to the Malian economy over the past 12 months, maintaining its long record as one of the country’s largest and most consistent revenue generators. The complex is on track to meet its production guidance for the current quarter and the year. There have been no lost time injuries or major environmental incidents during the quarter to date. Speaking to media and stakeholders at the mine today, Mark Bristow, president and chief executive of operator Barrick Gold Corporation, said the complex showed that a world-class mining business, developed by international investors but run entirely by Malians, could deliver real value to the state and the people. “In our 29 years in Mali, we have seen multiple changes in government and administration. We have worked with each of these administrations for the mutual benefit of all stakeholders and, in the spirit of partnership, we continue to invest in the extension of Loulo-Gounkoto’s life. It is worth noting that, in line with Barrick’s policy of supporting local businesses, Malian contractors have been appointed to extend Gara West and re-open the Baboto open pit where drilling has confirmed a potential high-grade extension of the mineralized structure,” he said. “We are also looking for fresh growth opportunities within the Loulo region, among other things through a high-resolution airborne magnetic geophysical survey designed to complete the next generation of high-impact targets.” The commissioning of Phase 2 of the complex’s solar power plant extension to 60 megawatts and its new battery storage system marked another stage in its transition to renewable energy.
