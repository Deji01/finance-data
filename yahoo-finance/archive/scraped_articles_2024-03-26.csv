Yahoo Finance,Trump's Truth Social stock soars in first day of trading,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-truth-social-stock-soars-in-first-day-of-trading-133705717.html,Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social made its Nasdaq debut on Tuesday.,"Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social (DJT) surged more than 40% in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq Tuesday afternoon.Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group, Truth Social's parent company, were trading above $70 under the ticker symbol ""DJT,"" Trump's initials, around mid-afternoon.The company merged with special purpose vehicle Digital World Acquisition Corp. (DWAC) in a deal approved by shareholders last week. Prior to the merger, DWAC had been on the public market since 2021.Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook and Twitter, the platform now known as X, following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots in 2021. He has since been reinstated on the platforms.Trump will maintain a roughly 60% stake in Truth Social, with nearly 79 million shares. That translates to a valuation of more than $5 billion based on current trading levels.The merger comes as the former president faces a $454 million fraud penalty and grapples with a campaign fundraising shortfall as he gears up for a 2024 presidential rematch against current Commander in Chief Joe Biden.But Trump will have to wait before cashing in his shares.According to the terms of the merger, stakeholders are subject to a six-month lockup period before selling or transferring shares. The only exception would be if the company's board votes to make a special dispensation.According to an SEC filing from Digital World, Trump Media lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year and brought in $3.4 million in revenue.As Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman pointed out, short interest in DWAC stock — bets that the stock price will fall rather than rise — was about 11% of outstanding shares. To note, average short interest in public companies sits in the 3% to 4% range.Former President Donald Trump awaits the start of a pre-trial hearing with his defense team on Monday, March 25, 2024, in New York.

Motley Fool,Why International Paper Stock Is Folding Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-international-paper-stock-folding-194200445.html,The company appears poised to enter a bidding war for a British target.,"What happenedInternational Paper (NYSE: IP) appears set to spark a bidding war for British rival DS Smith (LSE: SMDS), attempting to disrupt a planned deal between the target and London's Mondi (LSE: MNDI). Investors appear concerned IP might have to pay up, sending shares of the paper and packaging giant down 7% as of 3 p.m. ET.U.K. paper pushThe paper and packaging industry is readjusting capacity and expectations now that a post-pandemic shipping surge is over -- and that means consolidation. Last year, Irish company Smurfit Kappa Group agreed to acquire WestRock for $11.2 billion, and earlier this month, Mondi made a $6.58 billion (or 373 pence per share) offer to acquire DS Smith.Now, apparently, IP wants in on the act. DS Smith said it's in talks with International Paper about a potential counteroffer that would reportedly value the target at between 400 pence and 420 pence per share.International Paper is larger than Mondi and presumably could outlast its British counterpart in a bidding war. But investors are worried about how far IP will be willing to go and how much dilution will be required to get an all-stock deal done.Is International Paper stock a buy following the deal talk?Investors are selling IP because of the uncertainty about what's to come. For that reason, it's not a wise move to jump in and buy shares following the drop. Buying DS Smith would have strategic advantages for IP and help broaden the company's geographic heft, but many mergers come undone because the buyer is forced to overpay.Even with Tuesday afternoon's drop, IP shares are up 11% over the past year, despite the difficult macro conditions. The company, with its 4.8% dividend yield, is an attractive option for income-focused investors. But potential buyers should wait to see how this potential bidding war plays out before buying in.Should you invest $1,000 in International Paper right now?Before you buy stock in International Paper, consider this:Story continuesThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Paper wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Seagate Technology Stock Is Soaring Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-seagate-technology-stock-soaring-192013776.html,A leading Wall Street firm thinks that Seagate stock is heading for a new record high.,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) stock is climbing rapidly in Tuesday's trading. The memory chip company's share price was up 9% as of 3 p.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Morgan Stanley published a note on Seagate this morning, raising the firm's rating on the stock from equal weight to overweight. The firm's analysts also raised their one-year price target on Seagate stock from $73 per share to $115 per share.Morgan Stanley expects Seagate shares to hit a new peakDespite climbing roughly 56% over the last year, Seagate stock is still down roughly 17% from its high. The latest coverage from Morgan Stanley indicates that the firm believes that the storage hardware specialist will go on to reach a new valuation high in the near future.Morgan Stanley's analysts expect that Seagate will benefit from continued recovery in the data storage market. The firm also expects that the company's forefront position in heat-assisted-magnetic-recording (HAMR) technologies will unlock stronger sales and earnings performance. Likely even more exciting for many investors, the analysts thinks that demand connected to the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) will wind up being a meaningful performance driver.Storage companies could ride the AI waveWith the data storage industry seemingly on a cyclical upswing and seeing new demand tailwinds related to AI, Seagate's profitability could improve significantly. In the research note published today, Morgan Stanley's analysts stated that the storage specialist's near-term earnings performance could be between 25% and 30% better than they had previously anticipated.Beyond powering stronger-than-expected profits this year, Wall Street seems to be warming up to the possibility that AI-related demand will deliver a more sustained performance boost. In addition to improving sales and earnings performance, it's possible that being connected to the artificial intelligence revolution will broadly encourage investors to assign higher valuation multiples to Seagate and other data-storage stocks.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Seagate Technology Plc right now?Before you buy stock in Seagate Technology Plc, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Seagate Technology Plc wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Tandem Diabetes Care Stock Was Zooming Higher Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-tandem-diabetes-care-stock-190544949.html,"One product in particular could juice the company's fundamentals, a pundit believes.","Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM) was a standout stock as Tuesday's trading session barreled to a close. The insulin pump maker's stock price was nearly 10% higher in mid-afternoon trading, thanks largely to a recommendation upgrade from an analyst. That performance was well exceeding the 0.2% rise of the S&P 500 index at that point.Stifel makes a recommendation upgradeThe upgrading party was Stifel's Mathew Blackman, who changed his Tandem recommendation from hold to buy after market close on Monday. In doing so, he set a price target of $37 per share, well up from his previous $24. The new target is 11% higher than the stock's current level.In the analyst note detailing the change, Blackman zeroed in on the Mobi, which the specialty healthcare company describes as ""The world's smallest, durable automated insulin delivery system.""The analyst's research indicates that the take-up for Mobi ""is potentially occurring more-rapidly, to a greater magnitude-than-expected,"" with doctors, users, and diabetes patients who previously used competing products. This led Blackman to raise his estimates for Tandem's fundamentals from this year through 2026, resulting in the recommendation upgrade and the price target raise.Good news and bad news in 2024 guidanceTandem didn't necessarily finish its 2023 on a high note. Its fourth-quarter earnings, published toward the end of February, saw the company miss analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue guidance for the entirety of 2024, however, came in above the consensus estimates, and if met would mean nearly 14% growth over the previous year.Should you invest $1,000 in Tandem Diabetes Care right now?Before you buy stock in Tandem Diabetes Care, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tandem Diabetes Care wasn’t one of them.

Bloomberg,Retail Investors Throw a Meme Stock Party In Face of High Rates,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-investors-throw-meme-stock-190231617.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The retail investing crowd is back in the throes of a meme stock mania as encouraging messaging from the Federal Reserve, GameStop Corp.’s expected earnings and sky-high stock prices ignite a euphoria among day traders.Most Read from BloombergTrump’s Net Worth Hits $6.5 Billion, Making Him One of World’s 500 Richest PeopleTrump Vows to Pay Fraud Trial Bond Cut by 68% to $175 MillionBiden Gains Ground Against Trump in Six Key States, Poll ShowsVital Baltimore Bridge Collapses After",
Yahoo Finance,"Reddit ignites meme stock resurgence, further signs of 'bull market in everything'",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-ignites-meme-stock-resurgence-further-signs-of-bull-market-in-everything-185716216.html,Reddit's stock surge is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite hasn't peaked.,"Reddit became synonymous with the meme stock rally of 2021. Now, its stock has become a meme itself.Reddit stock (RDDT) popped more than 12% on Tuesday and has rallied more than 30% since its initial public offering (IPO) last Thursday. Some reports have pegged an uptick in options volume to the recent surge in shares.The meme resurgence spans beyond one popular IPO. GameStop (GME), the original meme stock, just had its best one day rise in a year. The Donald Trump-tied media SPAC finally debuted under the name Trump Media and Technology Group and ticker symbol DJT. That stock was up more than 50% during Tuesday's trading session alone.""We are in a very exuberant market,"" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. ""We're in a very momentum driven market. One of the hallmarks of momentum is it becomes far less about fundamentals. It becomes all about price movement and much less about about valuation. Meme stocks are the epitome of that.""Beyond those popular names, other signs of a risk-on market are flashing, too.Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has pressed near $71,000 per coin. Microstrategy (MSTR), a stock that more closely follows the price of Bitcoin than typical fundamental drivers like earnings, is now up more than 200% year-to-date after a massive rally on Monday.And the commodities trade is ripping, too, with gold (GC=F) up 7% in the last month and sitting near an all-time high. The price of cocoa (CC=F) has risen nearly 50% over the same time period.To Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders, these moves are signs of ""froth"" in the market.""It's sort of the bull market in everything recently with the exception of maybe bonds,"" Sonders said. ""It's in crypto, it's in precious metals, it's in certain other commodities. It's in some of the meme stocks, again, and it is [all part] of the mix.""CEO of Reddit Steve Huffman stands next to Snoo, the mascot of Reddit, at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 21, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)The big moves come as the broader market sits at all-time highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) has hit 20 all-time highs in less than three months of trading this year, putting it on pace for the most record closes in any year ever. The ""straight-up and to the right"" nature of the benchmark's rise over the last several months — it hasn't produced a negative month since October 2023 — has had many asking if we're in a stock market bubble that's about to pop.Story continuesMany strategists have argued the answer is no.In a research note on Monday, Deutsche Bank's equity strategy team reasoned that the $260 billion that's poured into equities since last May doesn't indicate a peak in risk appetite. Instead, it's been supported by an improving outlook for both the economy and earnings.Deutsche Bank director of global asset allocation and US equity strategy Parag Thatte told Yahoo Finance the firm hasn't seen flows data pick up purely because of risk appetite yet.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
