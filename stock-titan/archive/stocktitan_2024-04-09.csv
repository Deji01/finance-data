For more information about NewHydrogen, please visit https://newhydrogen.com/. About NewHydrogen, Inc. NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™, a breakthrough technology that uses water and heat rather than electricity to produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource. Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to have a future market value of $12 trillion.

Announces Monthly Net Revenues* Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ASE Technology Holding Co., Announces Unaudited Consolidated Net Revenues for March and 1st Quarter of 2024 Positive ASE Technology Holding Co., (NYSE: ASX) reported a 19.4% sequential increase in net revenues for March 2024 compared to February 2024. The company's unaudited consolidated net revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were NT$132,803 million, showing a 17.3% decrease from the previous quarter. ASE Technology Holding Co., also disclosed a 10.4% sequential growth in net revenues for ATM assembly, testing, and material business in March 2024. Negative - The company experienced a 15.6% decrease in net revenues for the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 in US dollars. - Net revenues for ATM assembly, testing, and material business declined by 8.1% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Financial Analyst ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd.'s recently reported financial figures indicate a mixed performance with a slight year-over-year growth in net revenues for the first quarter of 2024, despite a decrease compared to the previous quarter. The sequential drop in net revenues from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 by 17.3% in NT$ terms and 15.6% in US$ terms is notable and could reflect seasonal trends or a slowdown in demand. However, the modest year-over-year increase of 1.5% in NT$ and a decrease of 1.4% in US$ suggest stability in the company's revenue stream.Investors should consider the potential implications of these figures on the company's stock performance. While the company is managing to maintain its revenue year-over-year, the significant sequential decrease could be a red flag that warrants closer inspection. It may also impact investor sentiment and future stock price movements. The stability in the ATM assembly, testing and material business segment, with a slight year-over-year growth, is a positive sign that this segment is maintaining its revenue base. Market Research Analyst The semiconductor industry is known for its cyclical nature and ASE Technology's performance needs to be contextualized within this framework. The reported decrease in net revenues on a sequential basis could be indicative of broader market conditions or competitive dynamics. For instance, if the industry is facing an oversupply or if there's a downturn in demand for electronics, this could explain the revenue drop.Furthermore, the slight year-over-year revenue growth in a highly competitive market might suggest that ASE Technology is holding its ground against competitors. However, the negative growth in US dollar terms could be attributed to currency fluctuations, which are critical to consider when evaluating a company's performance in the global market. Stakeholders should monitor industry trends, such as shifts in demand for semiconductor components and the competitive landscape, to better understand ASE Technology's future revenue potential. Economist From an economic perspective, the reported figures could be influenced by macroeconomic factors such as currency exchange rates, trade policies and global economic conditions. The discrepancy between the NT$ and US$ revenue figures suggests that currency exchange rates have played a role. This impact of foreign exchange rates on international businesses can affect profit margins and the value of foreign revenue when converted back to the company's reporting currency.Additionally, the global economic climate, including trade tensions or changes in consumer spending due to economic uncertainty, can also affect the semiconductor industry. It is essential for investors to consider these external economic factors when evaluating ASE Technology's financial health and its ability to navigate the complex global economic environment. 04/09/2024 - 03:00 AM TAIPEI, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ASE Technology Holding Co., Ltd.

Paul, M.D., as Chairman BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PureTech Health plc (Nasdaq: PRTC, LSE: PRTC) (“PureTech” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to changing the lives of patients with devastating diseases, today announced key progress on its strategic initiatives to deliver innovative medicines to patients and unlock value for shareholders. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240408771835/en/Bharatt Chowrira, PureTech Chief Executive Officer (Photo: Business Wire) Seaport Therapeuticsi Seaport Therapeutics (“Seaport”), the latest Founded Entity to be created by PureTech, today announced that it has raised $100 millionii in an oversubscribed Series A financing with participation from top tier biotech investors ARCH Venture Partners, Sofinnova Investments and Third Rock Ventures to support the development of a novel clinical-stage pipeline of neuropsychiatric medicines created and initially developed internally at PureTech. Seaport will be led by Daphne Zohar along with Founder Steven M. Paul, M.D., who is the former Chief Executive officer of Karuna Therapeutics (“Karuna”), another CNS-focused PureTech Founded Entity that was recently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb for $14 billion. Seaport was established by PureTech to advance certain neuropsychiatric programs and relevant Glyph™ intellectual property. Following the Series A financing, PureTech will hold equity ownership in Seaport of 61.5 percent on a diluted basis. Executing on PureTech’s Hub-and-Spoke Strategy Consistent with its model, PureTech has internally advanced Seaport’s neuropsychiatric medicines programs to a key inflection point such that the pipeline can now drive value for PureTech through an equity stake and license consideration. This enables PureTech to share the significant costs of later-stage development with outside investors and direct additional resources to its innovative R&D engine for the creation and validation of new therapeutic candidates. This same approach yielded PureTech’s Karuna, which resulted in approximately $1.1 billion in gross proceeds for PureTech to date after the Company directed $18.5 million to Karuna’s founding and internal development. Under its license agreement with Karuna, PureTech retains the right to receive milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals. PureTech is also owed certain royalties on net sales and is eligible to receive up to $400 million in milestone payments under its agreement with Royalty Pharma.iii PureTech’s business model is designed to repeat and scale this type of outcome with rigorous financial discipline. Proceeds are recycled into the support of new programs and returns to shareholders while maintaining at least three years of operating cash runway. The platform supporting Seaport’s pipeline is one of several programs advanced during a period in which PureTech largely fueled its internal development with funds generated from Founded Entity monetization events, and PureTech has not needed to raise capital from the public markets in six years. Management Transitions As part of the strategic advancement of Seaport, Daphne Zohar, PureTech’s founding Chief Executive Officer and a successful entrepreneur with a longstanding passion for developing neuropsychiatric medicines, will transition into the role of Seaport’s Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Zohar will formally step down from the board of directors of PureTech with immediate effect and has agreed to serve as a senior advisor and observer to the board of directors of PureTech. Long-term PureTech senior executive, Bharatt Chowrira, Ph.D., J.D., has been named Chief Executive Officer of PureTech effective as of today and will therefore continue to serve as a director of PureTech. Eric Elenko, Ph.D., a PureTech co-founder and current Chief Innovation Officer, has been promoted to the role of President of PureTech. A 30-year veteran of the biotech industry, Dr. Chowrira has been a member of the PureTech senior management team since March 2017, serving as the Company’s President and Chief Business, Finance and Operating Officer and as a member of the Board of Directors. Prior to joining PureTech, he held leadership roles including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel in multiple biotech companies, including Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals for $3.5 billion, and Sirna Therapeutics, which was acquired by Merck & Co. for $1.1 billion, and was also a Vice President at Merck & Co. Commenting on today’s announcements, Dr. Chowrira said: “I am excited to step into the CEO role and to lead PureTech through this next phase of its evolution. We have demonstrated the evergreen success of our hub-and-spoke R&D model of venture creation, where we are able to recycle proceeds from our Founded Entities into both the funding of our current and future programs to change patients’ lives and capital returns for shareholders. As we continue to derive value from our existing pipeline, we will focus on what we have always done best: innovating the next wave of highly differentiated medicines. “Our fundamentals are centered on careful de-risking and streamlined development internally, quickly de-prioritizing those programs that don’t achieve our prespecified thresholds for advancement to move resources to those that are the most promising. We maintain 100 percent ownership of programs until a key value inflection point is reached, and we then have the option to pursue outside financial or strategic partners to advance these programs or to continue development internally. “This approach has enabled our R&D engine to be both very productive, as demonstrated by the 28 therapeutics and therapeutic candidates it has generated, and uniquely capital efficient – reflected in the fact that we have not had to raise money from the public markets in more than six years and will have returned $150 million to shareholders, pending shareholder approval of our proposed $100 million tender offer, which is expected to be launched after the publication of the Company's Full Year Results, subject to market conditions. This capital efficiency also allows us to be selective in determining the best path forward for each of our programs, and – as demonstrated today with the top tier syndicate of investors now supporting Seaport – our discerning strategy has created tremendous value internally that has not yet been appropriately recognized by the market. “At Seaport Therapeutics, PureTech has brought together the proven team that helped build Karuna and some of the investors that backed Karuna’s initial funding rounds. I am confident that following our well charted strategy of starting with validated mechanisms and applying our proprietary Glyph technology to solve previous limitations will enable Seaport to provide important new options for patients with depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric conditions.” “I would like to thank Daphne for her leadership since founding PureTech and for shepherding the Company to this next phase. I am grateful that we will continue to benefit from Daphne’s entrepreneurial spirit while she transitions to run one of our new Founded Entities to drive significant value for PureTech. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our exceptional team, and I fervently believe that with this proven R&D model, supported by a robust balance sheet and strong management team, PureTech has all the ingredients for tremendous, continued growth and success.” Reflecting on today’s announcement, Daphne Zohar said: “I am extremely proud of what the PureTech team has accomplished and the pipeline of groundbreaking medicines which we have created that can have an impact on the lives of millions of people. PureTech has now reached both financial independence and the important inflection point of returning capital. The team is positioned to excel and is infused with the spirit of creativity that has been with us since the beginning. I will continue to work on behalf of PureTech shareholders by advancing the exciting Seaport programs through a structure that can help unlock their value for PureTech. “PureTech is in a strong position with an innovative portfolio of new medicines, stellar team and robust balance sheet, and I am pleased to be passing the baton to Bharatt who is a respected executive in the biotech industry and has been a key senior leader on our team over the last seven years. I have confidence that under his leadership, together with my co-founder Eric Elenko, who is now taking on the expanded role of President, and other outstanding senior team and board members, PureTech will continue to thrive, grow, and innovate on behalf of patients and shareholders. I look forward to supporting PureTech as a senior advisor, board observer and shareholder as it continues to deliver on its mission of ‘Giving Life to Science’ to change patients’ lives.” Interim Chair of the PureTech Board of Directors, Raju Kucherlapati, Ph.D., said: “On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Daphne for her vision, leadership and dedication in founding and building PureTech. Daphne pioneered the hub-and-spoke model to create cutting-edge medicines, assembled a leading team and positioned PureTech for an exciting future and continued growth. I am pleased we will have her ongoing participation. We are fortunate to have someone with Bharatt’s experience and deep knowledge of our business to step into the role of Chief Executive Officer. He is the ideal person to successfully lead PureTech through this next phase of growth.” The full text of the announcement from Seaport is as follows: Seaport Therapeutics Launches with $100 Million Oversubscribed Series A Financing Round to Advance Novel Neuropsychiatric Medicines Daphne Zohar, Founding CEO of PureTech Health and Co-Founder of Karuna Therapeutics, is Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board of Directors of Seaport Steven M. Paul, M.D., former CEO and Chair of Karuna Therapeutics, President of Lilly Research Laboratories, is Founder and Chair of the Board of Directors of Seaport BOSTON – Seaport Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is charting a proven path in neuropsychiatry, today announced the closing of a $100 million oversubscribed Series A financing round. The round was co-led by ARCH Venture Partners and Sofinnova Investments along with Third Rock Ventures and Seaport founder PureTech Health. Seaport also announced the appointment of Daphne Zohar as Founder, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, and Steven M. Paul, M.D., as Founder and Chair of the Board of Directors. Seaport is advancing a clinical-stage pipeline of novel neuropsychiatric medicines powered by its proprietary Glyph™ Technology Platform, which leverages the lymphatic system to create new medicines building on clinically validated mechanisms. The financing will support the rapid advancement of Seaport’s clinical-stage pipeline of first and best-in-class medicines as well as further development of the Glyph platform, which has demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept. The company is built on a proven development strategy and is led by the team that created and advanced the groundbreaking drug candidate KarXT (xanomeline-trospium), which is now poised to be the first new class of medicine in over 50 years for patients living with schizophrenia. Daphne Zohar, the Chief Executive Officer of Seaport, is the founder and former CEO of PureTech Health where she also co-founded Karuna Therapeutics. Under Ms. Zohar’s leadership, PureTech’s R&D engine led to 28 new medicines, including two that received U.S. FDA clearance and a third (KarXT) that has been filed for FDA approval. Dr. Paul, Founder and Chair of the Seaport Board of Directors, is the former CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors of Karuna Therapeutics, which was recently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb. Dr. Paul is also the former President of Research and Development at Eli Lilly, where he oversaw the development of CNS drugs such as Zyprexa® and Cymbalta® as well as xanomeline, where its anti-psychotic and pre-cognitive properties were initially demonstrated. ""Major depression and anxiety disorders are among the most common, disabling and potentially fatal of all medical conditions. Current standard-of-care treatments provide inadequate relief for far too many patients. Seaport’s pipeline of investigational antidepressants and anxiolytics are well positioned to more effectively treat these disorders and to help millions of people and their families,” said Steven M. Paul M.D. “Given the historically low success rates within neuropsychiatric drug development, precisely solving the previous limitations of clinically validated mechanisms improves the probability of success and enables us to significantly accelerate development.” “We are dedicated to bringing first and best-in-class medicines to those that are suffering from depression, anxiety and other neuropsychiatric disorders,” said Daphne Zohar, Founder and CEO of Seaport Therapeutics. “I’m excited to deliver on this mission along with a stellar team of senior leaders and investors.” All of the programs in Seaport’s pipeline are based on the Glyph platform, which is designed to enable and enhance oral bioavailability, avoid first-pass metabolism and reduce hepatotoxicity and other side effects to advance active drugs that were previously held back by those limitations. Seaport’s most advanced therapeutic candidate is SPT-300,iv which is an oral prodrug of allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid, in development for the treatment of anxious depression. Allopregnanolone has demonstrated therapeutic benefit in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions, but it is only approved as an intravenous infusion, which has limited the scope of its clinical use. Using the Glyph platform, SPT-300 retains the activity and potency of endogenous allopregnanolone in an oral form and has the potential to capture the breadth of the natural biological response. In a Phase 2a clinical trial, SPT-300 demonstrated proof-of-concept in a validated clinical model of anxiety in healthy volunteers. Seaport’s pipeline also includes SPT-320,v a novel prodrug of agomelatine being advanced for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, which uses the Glyph platform to bypass first-pass metabolism by the liver and thus has the potential to lower its effective dose, reduce liver exposure and eliminate the need for liver function monitoring that has held back agomelatine. SPT-348, a prodrug of a non-hallucinogenic neuroplastogen in development for the treatment of mood and other neuropsychiatric disorders, leverages Glyph to create a potential first-in-class treatment with improved pharmacokinetics and tolerability compared to conventional psychedelics. Beyond these programs, Seaport has multiple discovery and preclinical programs underway. The additional members joining the Seaport Board of Directors are Robert Nelsen (Managing Partner and Co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners), James Healy, M.D., Ph.D. (Managing Partner of Sofinnova Investments), Eric Elenko, Ph.D. (Co-founder and President of PureTech and Co-inventor of KarXT), and Bharatt Chowrira Ph.D., (newly appointed Chief Executive Officer of PureTech). Courtney Wallace (Venture Partner at Third Rock Ventures) is joining as Board Observer. “I’m thrilled to be partnering again with this outstanding team, led by Daphne and Steve, to change lives for people with neuropsychiatric disorders,” said Robert Nelsen, Co-founder and Managing Director of ARCH Venture Partners. “We were the lead investors in Karuna’s Series A and Series B financing rounds, and I’m excited to partner with these strong leaders again to deliver on Seaport’s proven strategy and robust pipeline and bring important new medicines to patients.” “Seaport has the potential to meaningfully change the lives of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders,” said James Healy, M.D., Ph.D., Managing Partner at Sofinnova Investments. “We’ve had the pleasure of knowing Steve and Daphne for a number of years, as one of the investors in Karuna, and we believe this team has the unique expertise to help solve the challenges of treating serious mental health conditions. I am eager to support Seaport as an investor and board member as the team continues to advance its clinical-stage pipeline of novel therapeutics.” About the Glyph™ Platform Glyph is Seaport's proprietary technology platform which uses the lymphatic system to enable and enhance the oral administration of drugs. With the Glyph platform, drugs are absorbed like dietary fats through the intestinal lymphatic system and transported into circulation. Seaport believes the Glyph technology has the potential to be widely applied to many therapeutic molecules that have high first-pass metabolism leading to low bioavailability and/or side effects, including hepatotoxicity. The Glyph platform has been refined at Seaport to efficiently generate multiple therapeutic candidates within the company’s pipeline. Seaport has exclusively licensed this technology from Monash University based on the pioneering research of the Porter research group, along with the co-inventors from PureTech Health and Seaport. The group and its collaborators have published research in Nature Metabolism, Frontiers in Pharmacology and the Journal of Controlled Release supporting the Glyph platform's capabilities. About Seaport Therapeutics Seaport Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing the development of novel neuropsychiatric medicines in areas of high unmet patient needs. We have a proven strategy of advancing clinically validated mechanisms previously held back by limitations we overcome with our proprietary Glyph™ technology platform. All the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline of first and best-in-class medicines are based on the Glyph platform, which is uniquely designed to enable oral bioavailability, bypass first-pass metabolism and reduce hepatotoxicity and other side effects. We are led by an experienced team that was involved in inventing and developing KarXT and other neuropsychiatric medicines and are guided by an extensive network of renowned scientists, clinicians and key opinion leaders across neurological specialties.

PureTech's R&D engine has resulted in the development of 28 therapeutics and therapeutic candidates, including two that have received both U.S. FDA clearance and European marketing authorization and a third (KarXT) that has been filed for FDA approval. A number of these programs are being advanced by PureTech or its Founded Entities in various indications and stages of clinical development, including registration enabling studies. All of the underlying programs and platforms that resulted in this pipeline of therapeutic candidates were initially identified or discovered and then advanced by the PureTech team through key validation points.

Black Axe Mangal’ to showcase how its five-star premium brewing credentials delivers the perfect platform to transition your day from work mode to evening mode. AMSTERDAM, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With 25 million serves of Heineken® across 192 countries every single day*, there is a true science to maintaining its perfectly balanced taste and refreshment. From 100% Natural Ingredients, Heineken®’s famous A-Yeast and Horizontal Fermentation Tanks – and now a ‘Beer Level’ - a ‘highly scientific’, Heineken® filled spirit level to ensure bars and tables across the globe are perfectly flat to guarantee the perfect pint presentation! The playful ‘Beer Level’ comes as Heineken® today launches its global campaign and TVC ‘The First Ahhh!’. The campaign captures the iconic and refreshing ‘first sip’ feeling you get from a crisp, uniquely balanced Heineken® when finishing your day and starting your evening – no matter where you are in the world. Nabil Nasser, Global Head, Heineken® Brand, says: “As a brand rooted in more than 150 years of brewing heritage, our perfectly balanced, refreshing taste has become known across the world as a great beer to have with friends. ‘The First Ahhh!’ embodies that feeling at the end of the day when you can grab a beer with a group of friends. We also want to bring some fun to our credentials by creating this Giant Spirit (or Beer) Level, highlighting our dedication to the craft in true Heineken® wit and style. We’re excited to bottle up that unique ‘First Ahhh!’ feeling and share it with the world.” Heineken® has delivered its consistent taste and perfectly balanced taste to the world with its unique recipe for more than 150 years. Ever wondered what makes the perfect serve? Heineken® Master Brewer Willem van Waesberghe recommends looking out for the following six signs: The glass should be held at the base – this keeps the beer as cool and crisp as possible.The tap should be opened in one firm motion – your server needs to be confident – if opened slowly, they risk squeezing the line, resulting in excess foam falling into the glass before the tap is fully opened.The glass should be tilted precisely at a 45-degree angle with the beer pouring down the inside of the glass – this creates that mesmerising whirlpool effect that whips up the foam underneath. Remember – the nozzle should never touch the beer, as this breaks the surface tension which impacts the crisp, refreshing taste.The head of foam should be solid and perfectly balanced on the arms of the iconic Red Star, all the way to the rim of the glass – in scientific terms, the perfect pint should consist of 95% beer, 5% foam, as this best brings out the beer’s aroma, whilst preventing oxidation and your beer going flat.Your server should start skimming the moment the beer overflows, using a wet skimmer at a 45-degree angle – this removes excess foam and creates an unbroken seal. Skimming removes large bubbles on top of the foam that protects it from oxygen and maintains the head for longer.Wherever you enjoy a Heineken®, the ‘first sip’ feeling is best enjoyed in a glass – no matter where you are in the world, pour your Heineken® from the bottle and into a lager glass to unlock the full flavour experience. Willem van Waesberghe, Master Brewer at Heineken® says: “It’s easy to take for granted the refreshment and uniquely balanced taste a Heineken® always provides – whether Original, Silver or 0.0 – as it is so consistent wherever in the world you enjoy it. However, there is a true science behind the sip, driven by our Five-Star Brewing Principles, including Heineken®’s famous A-yeast, quality Pure Malt, 100% natural ingredients, a horizontal brewing method and our verified Star Brewers, a title that takes 10 years to attain - that provide you with the ‘First Ahhh!’ feeling.” Heineken® has worked with renowned UK chef Lee Tiernan of London’s ‘F.K.A. Black Axe Mangal’, an expert when it comes to balancing taste and flavour, to showcase how its five-star premium brewing credentials make Heineken® a consistent ''go-to'' for diners to enjoy as the first drink of the night. Lee Tiernan, Chef and Restauranteur says: “From the moment people walk into FKABAM, they want an experience that not only starts the night, but also something they’ll remember for the rest of their evening. The end goal of a beer and food pairing is that when combined, you end up with a more balanced flavour than each would be alone. That’s why Heineken® is the perfect accompaniment for most dishes – its moderate body, light, fruity taste with a lingering fruit and balanced bitterness finish complements a huge range of flavours. My favourite ingredients to enjoy with a Heineken® include fatty lamb shanks, spicy sausages and the umami flavours of fermented shrimp.” To learn about the Heineken®’s five core brewing principles and heritage, visit the home of Heineken® in Amsterdam at the Heineken® Experience.

Negative None. 04/09/2024 - 03:03 AM LAUSANNE, Switzerland & NEWARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Logitech G, a brand of Logitech (SIX: LOGN) (NASDAQ: LOGI) and leading innovator of gaming technologies and gear, announced the Logitech G PRO X 60 LIGHTSPEED Gaming Keyboard, a compact, professional-grade keyboard that liberates valuable space to meet the evolving needs of pro-gamers. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240409367997/en/Logitech G introduces the New PRO X 60 LIGHTSPEED Gaming Keyboard. Engineered with the insights and expertise of more than 70 pro athletes, who helped us evaluate over 30 different prototypes through eight rounds of CI, research, and testing, this professional-grade keyboard liberates valuable space to meet the evolving needs of pro-gamers. (Photo: Business Wire) Pro esports athletes demand the absolute best equipment to improve their competitive play. The 60 percent keyboard form factor has become increasingly popular among pros because it leaves more space for the dynamic mouse movements required for pro-level FPS competition. A 60 percent keyboard is easier to position perfectly for maximum performance, easily fitting into their competition space, and it’s also easier for players to carry to and from tournaments. “The PRO X 60 is the perfect fit for players who need a keyboard that can adapt to any setup and condition. It's also super easy to carry around when traveling. I love it.” said Michaela 'mimi' Lintrup, G2 Esports, Valorant. While smaller format keyboards are great for competitive play, they can lack critical keys that some pro players need. To solve this, the PRO X 60 introduces an innovative new technology, KEYCONTROL, to provide gamers with customization capabilities far beyond what a standard keyboard delivers. “We have years of experience designing and building keyboards and switches for and with pro gamers,’ stated Brent Barry, Head of Esports and PRO Series at Logitech G. “Through our unique collaboration with players, we gathered important insights that played a key role in our design of the PRO X 60 and highlighted the need for KEYCONTROL. This new capability has everything a Pro player could want: a compact, portable form factor, combined with advanced new technologies all designed to give them the equipment and performance they need to win.” KEYCONTROL was developed to broaden the keyboard’s capabilities beyond that of a standard full-sized keyboard. A user-friendly tool enabled in GHUB, KEYCONTROL grants players significantly more customization options by allowing them to assign up to 15 functions per key and tailor their keyboard to their unique style. When combined with G-SHIFT, an advanced feature that players can assign to almost any button (like a mouse side button to an action), players can activate the new layer of keys and get quick access to any key or command directly under their left hand and WASD keys, or any other programmable key on the keyboard. This means the missing critical keys are right where you need them, ensuring lightning-fast access to essential commands and propelling gamers to victory. ""I love the original PRO keyboard, but now that my game has evolved, I wanted something smaller to allow for more space on my desktop for my mouse without losing all the key functions,"" said Emma “Emy” Choe, FlyQuest RED, CounterStrike 2, ""Now that I have the PRO X 60 with KEYCONTROL, I have more room for flick shots, all while being able to tailor my layout so I don't miss any keys. I can't wait to use this in competition."" The PRO X 60 also features the trusted performance and reliability of Logitech G’s LIGHTSPEED wireless technology. LIGHTSPEED wireless was designed to be as fast as wired but also extremely robust, even in the most difficult environments. When a pro player competes at a tournament, thousands of people often surround them with RF-generating devices such as mobile phones, production cameras, and various networks. Logitech tests LIGHTSPEED in a cutting-edge anechoic chamber that generates equivalent radio frequency interference to ensure our LIGHTSPEED wireless protocol functions flawlessly. Pro players can trust that their clicks and swipes will be registered precisely, enabling them to perform at their best. “It's super important to have a reliable and fast connection when you're competing because you want to have the least amount of input lag possible when you're in a competitive scenario. Having a really fast wireless connection can be the difference between winning and losing at the highest level,” said Evan ""Verhulst"" Verhulst, TSM, Apex Legends. The PRO X 60 is available with GX Optical switches in both tactile and linear configurations, offering faster actuation than standard mechanical switches for faster gameplay. Unlike mechanical switches, GX Optical actuates through the power of light, instantly sending your command, eliminating the debounce required by mechanical switches. With precision and speed, the signal is unleashed the moment you engage. The switches are also factory-lubricated and designed to provide a satisfying gaming and typing experience. Additional features in the PRO X 60 keyboard include: Dual-shot PBT keycaps LIGHTSYNC RGB lighting Game mode switch Volume roller and media controls Bluetooth 2:1 LIGHTSPEED Adapter Semi-hard carrying case Pricing and Availability Available in Black, White, and Pink, the PRO X 60 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Keyboard is available for pre-order now at LogitechG.com for $179 US and €229. It will be available from major participating retailers in late April. For more information, please visit LogitechG.com.

Corebridge Financial Completes Sale of UK Life Insurance Business to Aviva plc,2024-04-09T06:19:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Corebridge Financial, Inc. (CRBG) completes the sale of its UK life insurance business to Aviva plc, enabling a strategic shift towards Life & Retirement products in the US.","Corebridge Financial Completes Sale of UK Life Insurance Business to Aviva plc Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Corebridge Financial, Inc. (CRBG) completes the sale of its UK life insurance business to Aviva plc, enabling a strategic shift towards Life & Retirement products in the US. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of Corebridge Financial's UK life insurance business to Aviva represents a strategic refocusing on the more profitable Life & Retirement sector in the US market. This move likely aims to streamline operations and concentrate resources where Corebridge sees the most potential for growth and margin improvement. By selling off a non-core asset, Corebridge could potentially reduce complexity within its operations and achieve cost efficiencies.Investors should note the involvement of a reputable financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, which could indicate a well-negotiated transaction, maximizing value for Corebridge shareholders. The sale may also result in an influx of capital that could be used for debt reduction, share buybacks, or reinvestment into their core business segments. However, the impact on the stock will depend on how efficiently the proceeds are used and whether the market views the sale as beneficial for Corebridge's long-term strategy. Insurance Industry Analyst Corebridge's exit from the UK market is indicative of the competitive landscape of life insurance in Europe, where scale and local market understanding are critical. Aviva, being a major player in the UK, is likely to benefit from economies of scale and may integrate the acquired business to enhance its product offerings and customer base. For Corebridge, this strategic divestment allows it to focus on the US market, where it may have a stronger brand presence and distribution network.From an industry perspective, the transaction could signal a broader trend of consolidation within the insurance market, where companies are choosing to specialize in markets where they have a competitive advantage. Corebridge's decision to consolidate its efforts in the US could be a response to the evolving regulatory landscape, consumer preferences and technological advancements that are reshaping the Life & Retirement space. Market Research Analyst Understanding consumer trends and market dynamics in the financial services industry is essential for evaluating this transaction. Corebridge's sale of its UK life insurance business may reflect a strategic pivot towards markets with higher growth prospects or more favorable regulatory environments. The US Life & Retirement sector is undergoing significant transformation, driven by demographic shifts such as an aging population, which increases the demand for retirement products and services.Moreover, the adoption of digital technologies in the insurance industry is another factor that Corebridge might be capitalizing on by focusing on the US market. By reallocating resources and investments towards innovation and digital customer experiences in their core market, Corebridge could enhance its competitive edge and customer satisfaction, which is increasingly important in the digitally-driven landscape of financial services. 04/09/2024 - 02:19 AM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Corebridge Financial, Inc.

Its quad-port capability is a pioneering feature that addresses the growing demand for high-performance, multi-tasking automotive systems. The ability to connect multiple systems on chips (SoCs) to a single SSD without the need for additional storage devices or costly PCIe switches is a game-changer. This innovation not only streamlines the vehicle's architecture but also enhances the efficiency of data management, which is important for the integration of complex applications such as advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI).Furthermore, the SSD's single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV) feature permits the direct assignment of I/O streams to the hardware, bypassing the software hypervisor layer that typically introduces latency. This is particularly beneficial for vehicles that require real-time processing capabilities, such as those with autonomous driving features. Additionally, the customizable endurance modes offered by the SSD provide flexibility for various data storage needs, ranging from continuous data recording to standard operation, thus catering to the diverse requirements of modern vehicles. Cybersecurity Expert The enhanced security features of the Micron 4150AT SSD are noteworthy, especially in an era where vehicles are increasingly connected and vulnerable to cyber threats. The hardware-level isolation of data for each virtual machine (VM) provided by SR-IOV is a robust security measure. It ensures that a compromise in one VM does not affect the others, thereby safeguarding critical vehicle systems and sensitive data. This level of security is imperative as vehicles become more software-defined and reliant on data integrity and protection.From a cybersecurity perspective, the ability to maintain data privacy and resist hacking attempts is paramount. The automotive industry is particularly sensitive to these issues due to the potential safety implications of a security breach. As vehicles incorporate more autonomous features and connect to external networks, the importance of such enhanced security measures cannot be overstated. Financial Analyst Micron's move to sample this innovative SSD to automotive customers reflects a strategic positioning within the automotive industry, which is increasingly focused on software-defined vehicles. The financial implications for Micron could be substantial, as the automotive sector represents a growing market for high-tech components. The ability of the 4150AT SSD to provide data center-level performance in a ruggedized automotive design could make it an attractive option for car manufacturers looking to push the envelope on vehicle technology.Investors should pay attention to the adoption rate of the 4150AT SSD by OEMs, as it could serve as an indicator of Micron's potential market share growth in this sector. The offering of capacities up to 1.8 terabytes also positions the product well against competitors, as it meets the increasing storage demands of modern vehicles. If Micron can secure contracts with leading automotive manufacturers, it could see a significant boost in its revenue streams from the automotive segment. 04/09/2024 - 02:00 AM Micron’s virtualized, multiport 4150AT SSD enables a new model of centralized decision-making for increasingly complex, software-defined vehiclesNUREMBERG, Germany, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Embedded World -- Micron Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: MU), today announced it is sampling the automotive-grade Micron 4150AT SSD, the world’s first quad-port SSD,1 capable of interfacing with up to four systems on chips (SoCs) to centralize storage for software-defined intelligent vehicles. The Micron 4150AT SSD combines market-leading features such as single-root input/output virtualization (SR-IOV), a PCIe® Generation 4 interface and ruggedized automotive design. With these features, the automotive-grade SSD provides the ecosystem with data center-level flexibility and power. “As storage requirements race to keep up with rich in-vehicle experiences featuring AI and advanced algorithms for higher levels of autonomous safety, this era demands a new paradigm for automotive storage to match,” said Michael Basca, Micron vice president of embedded products and systems. “Building on our collaboration with the innovators redefining next-generation automotive architectures, Micron has reimagined storage from the ground up to deliver the world’s first quad-port SSD — the Micron 4150AT — which provides the industry flexibility and horsepower to roll out the transformative technologies on the horizon.” Micron’s 4150AT SSD brings enterprise-class speeds to consumer vehicles, with random read and write speeds above 600,000 input/output operations per second (IOPS) and above 100,000 IOPS, respectively, for a 4-kilobyte transfer.2 This high performance allows the drive to efficiently manage data streams from multiple SoCs at once, making it an ideal solution for vehicles that must increasingly multitask to handle diverse systems, from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) to AI-enabled cabin experiences. Micron built its 4150AT SSD to provide powerful, customizable features inspired by the design of data center SSDs but tailored to the unique challenges of next-generation automotive architectures including: Multi-port capability: The first SSD across any end market with four ports,3 the Micron 4150AT SSD can connect up to four SoCs, bringing unmatched flexibility and creating a single source of truth. For example, an automotive OEM can connect one port to an ADAS system and another to an IVI system, allowing each to store private data while accessing a common set of critical map data and reducing cost per gigabyte of storage. This boosts performance and dissolves bottlenecks as both can access shared data simultaneously and alleviates the need to keep redundant copies of data. The 4150AT’s quad ports also reduce the need for extra storage devices. Since existing solutions can typically connect to only one SoC on their own, they tend to get placed locally with each automotive system — leading to unused capacity; or alternatively, require OEMs to utilize a costly automotive-grade PCIe switch to connect a drive to multiple SoCs. By centralizing storage for multiple systems, the SSD dramatically improves efficiency while streamlining architecture.Virtualization: The 4150AT’s SR-IOV capability provides high performance for heavy multi-host workloads of up to 64 virtual machines (VMs). The unique virtualization gives each SoC and its virtual machines an isolated storage region for local processing while sharing a pool of storage, maximizing efficiency. This support for multi-host workloads is essential as today’s automotive SoCs increasingly use VMs to multitask across different functions, from autonomous driving to vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The SR-IOV capability offers an advantage by directing input/outputs (I/Os) from the VMs directly to the SSD hardware, contrasting with the typical paravirtualization in which I/Os are routed through a software hypervisor to the SSD, creating latency. By bypassing the software layer, the drive improves random read performance up to three times.4Boosted security: Due to its unique virtualization, the 4150AT drive also enables increased security for carmakers. Based on the SR-IOV virtualization, the data of each VM is isolated from others in the hardware to mitigate data or code leakage while curtailing hacking attempts in one VM from compromising another — maintaining critical data privacy and security.Customizable endurance modes: Micron’s 4150AT SSD is built with its triple-level cell (TLC) NAND but can be configured to support single-level cell (SLC) and high-endurance (HE-SLC) data endurance groups too, which respectively offer 20 times and 50 times the endurance of TLC, to best meet unique data requirements. For example, the HE-SLC endurance group can be used for heavy-write use cases such as continuous black box data recording, in which cars must constantly rerecord critical data from sensors, cameras and lidar. In such a scenario where data is being programmed and erased every few minutes, the HE-SLC mode offers the required endurance while eliminating the need for more expensive volatile memory such as DRAM. Designed for the automotive industry’s rigorous requirements: The Micron 4150AT SSD delivers Automotive Safety Integrity Level B (ASIL-B) capability to support safety system requirements and is offered in a ball grid array package to help withstand the shock and vibration typical of vehicles’ rugged environments. Like all of the solutions in Micron’s automotive-grade portfolio, the drive is engineered to withstand the extended temperature ranges found in vehicles. Micron is now delivering samples of the 4150AT SSD to automotive customers worldwide. The drive is offered in capacities up to 1.8 terabytes to enable efficient storage of AI algorithms, large language models, advanced infotainment and telemetry data for the next generation of vehicles. The company is showcasing a demo of the SSD at Embedded World in Nuremberg, Germany from April 9-11 at booth 5-109.

III announces its intent to dissolve and liquidate due to not consummating an initial business combination within the required timeframe. Shareholders will receive a redemption price of approximately $10.00 per share for Class A ordinary shares. The Company's sponsor waives redemption rights for certain shares, and warrants will expire worthless. Nasdaq is expected to delist the Company's securities. Positive None. Negative The Company's dissolution and liquidation indicate a failure to meet business combination targets, resulting in shareholder liquidation. The expiration of warrants without redemption rights may lead to financial losses for warrant holders. Financial Analyst In light of RMG Acquisition Corp. III's announcement to dissolve and liquidate, the immediate financial implication is the redemption of Class A ordinary shares at an approximate value of $10.00 per share. This action is a clear indicator of the company's inability to achieve its initial business goals within the stipulated timeframe. The redemption process, while seemingly straightforward for record holders and beneficial owners, will result in the cancellation of public shares, effectively removing the company from public trade.From an investor's perspective, the waiving of redemption rights by the company's sponsor for certain shares suggests a loss that they are willing to absorb, which could be indicative of the sponsor's longer-term strategic considerations or responsibility to other stakeholders. The lack of redemption rights for warrant holders, rendering these warrants worthless, is a significant loss for warrant investors and reflects the risks inherent in such investment vehicles. This development is a reminder of the speculative nature of investing in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and the associated risks.The expected delisting from Nasdaq and the termination of securities registration are procedural steps following the dissolution, which will finalize the company's exit from the public market. This will likely affect the liquidity and marketability of any remaining securities associated with the company. Legal Expert The announcement by RMG Acquisition Corp. III to dissolve and liquidate raises several legal considerations. The company's obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for the claims of creditors before distributing the proceeds from the trust account to shareholders is a critical step in the liquidation process. This obligation ensures that the company settles its debts in compliance with legal standards, which is a safeguard for creditors' rights.The procedural aspects, such as the filing of a Form 25 to delist the company's securities and a Form 15 to terminate the registration of its securities, are in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These filings will serve as the formal documentation of the company's cessation of public trading status and are necessary steps to comply with regulatory standards.For shareholders and warrant holders, the legal processes outlined in the announcement provide a clear framework for the next steps. However, for warrant holders, the outcome is particularly unfavorable, as the expiration of warrants without any redemption or liquidating distributions underscores the risks associated with such securities. 04/08/2024 - 09:42 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RMG Acquisition Corp. III (the “Company”) today announced that, because the Company will not consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its Fourth Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, the Company intends to dissolve and liquidate, effective as of the close of business on April 22, 2024, and will redeem all of the outstanding shares of Class A ordinary shares that were included in the units sold in its initial public offering (the “Public Shares”), at a per-share redemption price of approximately $10.00. As of the close of business on April 22, 2024, the Public Shares will be deemed cancelled and will represent only the right to receive the redemption amount. Record holders will receive their pro rata portion of the proceeds of the trust account, subject to the Company’s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors, by delivering their Public Shares to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company’s transfer agent. Beneficial owners of Public Shares held in “street name,” however, will not need to take any action in order to receive the redemption amount. The redemption of the Public Shares is expected to be completed within ten business days after April 9, 2024. The Company’s sponsor has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to (i) its outstanding Class B ordinary shares issued prior to the Company’s initial public offering and (ii) its 3,500,000 outstanding Class A ordinary shares that were converted from Class B ordinary shares into Class A ordinary shares on December 26, 2023. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company’s warrants, which will expire worthless. The Company expects that Nasdaq will file a Form 25 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) to delist the Company’s securities. The Company thereafter expects to file a Form 15 with the Commission to terminate the registration of its securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The company's role as a leading semiconductor code contributor to the Matter standard also suggests a deep understanding of the ecosystem, which could result in highly optimized and compatible products. This expertise may become a significant differentiator as the IoT landscape evolves and becomes more complex. 04/09/2024 - 12:01 AM Provides industry's highest combination of Flash, RAM, and GPIO for Matter over Thread AUSTIN, Texas, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Silicon Labs (NASDAQ: SLAB), a leader in secure, intelligent wireless technology for a more connected world, today announced their new xG26 family of Wireless SoCs and MCUs, the IoT industry leader's highest performance device family to date. The new family consists of the multiprotocol MG26 SoC, the Bluetooth LE BG26 SoC, and the PG26 MCU. All three are designed to future-proof the IoT against some of the most demanding emerging applications, like Matter, with double the Flash and RAM of other Silicon Labs multiprotocol devices. ""As users from consumer to industrial sectors extract more benefits from their IoT deployments, their requirements are steadily increasing,"" said Matt Johnson, CEO of Silicon Labs, Inc. ""The new xG26 family is built for the future, empowering device manufacturers with the confidence that their current designs will meet tomorrow's demands."" To help designers build devices capable of running advanced IoT applications, the xG26 family can be equipped with: Doubled Flash, RAM, and GPIO capacity compared to the xG24 device family, allowing IoT device builders to develop advanced edge applications. It also has double the number of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins as the xG24, meaning that device builders can connect it to twice as many peripherals for better system integration.Higher performance compute in a multicore format with an ARM® Cortex®-M33 CPU and dedicated cores for the radio and security subsystems, helping to free up the main core for customer applications.Embedded AI/ML hardware acceleration, enabling up to 8x faster processing of machine learning algorithms using as little as 1/6th the power, achieving greater energy efficiency.Best-in-Class Security with Silicon Labs Secure Vault™ and ARM TrustZone. Using the Silicon Labs Custom Part Manufacturing Service, xG26 devices can also be hard-coded with customer-designed security keys and other features in the fabrication process, further hardening them against vulnerabilities.2.4 GHz wireless connectivity leveraging Silicon Labs' proven, tested, and certified software stacks for 2.4 GHz wireless protocols, including Matter, Zigbee, OpenThread, Bluetooth Low Energy, Bluetooth Mesh, Proprietary, and Multiprotocol, with a best in class RF link budget that improves range and reduces transmission retries, providing a better user experience while improving battery life.MG26 Multiprotocol SoC Designed to be Most Advanced SoC for Matter over ThreadSilicon Labs is all-in on Matter, the rapidly deploying application layer that allows devices to be interoperable between the leading IoT networks and ecosystems. Silicon Labs is Matter's leading semiconductor code contributor and third-largest contributor. The experience gained from working on Matter gave Silicon Labs deep insight into what it takes to build a device capable of growing with the needs of the Matter standard as it adds support for new device types, security enhancements, and more. Most device types have already seen Matter's code requirements grow by 6% in the first 18 months since Matter 1.0 was released in October 2022. Consumers who invest in building Matter-enabled Smart Homes don't want their new devices to become obsolete in a few years. Instead, they want confidence that the Matter device they purchased last year will work with the same devices and be as secure as the next Matter device they buy next year. That's Matter's interoperability and security promise, which is why Silicon Labs designed the MG26 to be the most advanced SoC for the Matter standard. Building off the same platform as the award-winning MG24 Multiprotocol Wireless SoC, the MG26 doubles its predecessor's Flash and RAM capacity and can be configured with up to 3200 kB of Flash and 512 kB of RAM. It also has double the number of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins as the MG24, meaning that device builders can connect it to twice as many peripherals for better system integration. To enable greater intelligence for not only Matter-enabled applications, but all applications, the MG26, BG26, and PG26 also use Silicon Labs' proprietary Matrix Vector AI/ML hardware accelerator. This dedicated core is optimized for machine learning and can process ML operations up to 8x faster using as little as 1/6th the energy as a traditional embedded CPU. This significantly improves the family's energy efficiency because the device can offload ML-based activation or wake cues to the accelerator, allowing more power-hungry functions to sleep and minimize battery drain. This is ideal for smart home battery-operated devices like sensors or switches, where consumers look for them to fade into the background of their home and not draw their attention with the need for constant battery changes. Silicon Labs Extends IoT Leadership with New SoC and MCU FamilySilicon Labs is one of the world's leading pure-play IoT companies, and no other can match its breadth, depth, and expertise in the Internet of Things. That's why the xG26 launches as a family. While the MG26 is ideal for Matter, the BG26 Bluetooth SoC brings all the same features and is optimized for Bluetooth LE and Bluetooth Mesh, and the PG26 brings low-power intelligence to unconnected applications like CCTV cameras, remotes, and children's toys. Pin compatibility between select xG26 and xG24 devices and shared hardware and software development tools like Silicon Labs Simplicity Studios allows for easy development and seamless migration from other Silicon Labs Series 2 devices.

(NYSE: PRI), a leading provider of financial services and products in the United States and Canada, released its Financial Security Monitor™ (FSM™) survey for the first quarter of 2024, revealing two-thirds (66%) of middle-income Americans feel their education did not adequately prepare them to manage their finances as adults, with a notable discrepancy across age groups. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240408765232/en/Primerica Household Budget Index™ - In February 2024, the average purchasing power for middle-income households was 101.2%, slightly down from 101.6% in January 2024. A year ago, the index stood at 95.9%. (Graphic: Business Wire) A majority of those under age 65 said their financial education fell short, with the youngest age brackets expressing the highest level of dissatisfaction, including 73% of those ages 18-34, 69% of those 35-49, and 65% of ages 50-64. In contrast, a majority (61%) of men over 65 felt their education did a good job preparing them — the only demographic to believe so — while a majority (57%) of women in the same age group said the opposite. Specifically, most middle-income Americans said schools did not prepare them for tasks such as doing taxes (71%), paying back student loans (67%), taking out and paying back loans (64%), or setting a household budget (59%). “We are seeing a clear lack of confidence among middle-income Americans who believe their education failed to prepare them to manage their personal finances, with an overwhelming majority of young people feeling left behind,” said Glenn J. Williams, CEO of Primerica. “These are gaps we have to recognize and address as people plan their financial futures and navigate a fluctuating economic environment that, in recent years, has left middle-income Americans feeling incredibly uncertain about their financial situations.” The latest FSM™ survey coincides with the release of Primerica’s Household Budget Index™ (HBI™), which indicates middle-income households experienced a slight dip in purchasing power after a stronger start to the year, as rising costs for necessities like gas slightly outpaced income gains. The HBI fell to 101.2% in February from 101.6% in January but is still up notably from 95.9% compared to one year ago. “Gas price increases are often immediately felt by middle-income Americans, with a direct impact on their purchasing power with every fill-up. Relative to a year ago, middle-income households are doing a bit better as the prices of most necessities have increased only a small amount and gasoline has come down some while incomes have risen at a faster pace on average than overall inflation,” said Amy Crews Cutts, Ph.D., CBE®, economic consultant to Primerica. “While the slight loss of purchasing power for middle income households from January to February is equivalent to the cost of a fancy coffee drink, it is a reminder that inflation is still troublesome for households trying to keep a budget and plan for their financial future.” Key Findings from Primerica’s U.S. Middle-Income Financial Security Monitor™ Schools fall short on financial education, with generational divide. The majority (66%) of middle-income Americans feel the education they received during their upbringing didn't equip them to manage their finances as adults. Nearly half (49%) say that it did not prepare them well at all, with a third (33%) saying it prepared them very or somewhat well. Middle-income Americans are increasingly concerned about credit card debt. More than a third of middle-income Americans (38%) are more concerned about their credit card debt compared to a year ago. A majority who feel this way also report spending less overall (71%, up 9 points since December 2023), and some say they are looking at additional income sources (32%, up 6 points) or debt consolidation (16%, also up 6 points). Most middle-income Americans merge finances with their partner after marriage. About three-quarters (73%) of married Americans merge their finances with their partners, a fifth (20%) keep their finances separate from their partner, and less than a tenth (7%) say they do something else. Of note, college-educated women show a higher tendency to keep their finances separate from their partners (64% merge, 21% separate, 15% something else). Middle-income Americans are saving less for retirement. The percentage of people putting less money into their retirement accounts has increased 7 points over the past two years even as 60% do not believe they are saving enough to retire comfortably. Rising cost of necessities remains an issue. Most middle-income Americans (88%) say recent increases in food prices have impacted them and their family. Individuals report having to buy cheaper options for similar products (68%), buy less food (54%), change their eating habits (48%), use coupons more frequently (37%), and buy more in bulk (30%).

Polling was conducted online from March 6-11, 2024. Using Dynamic Online Sampling, Change Research polled 1,312 adults nationwide with incomes between $30,000 and $130,000. Post-stratification weights were made on gender, age, race, education and Census region to reflect the population of these adults based on the five-year averages in the 2021 American Community Survey, published by the U.S. Census. The margin of error is 3.0%. For more information visit Primerica.com/public/financial-security-monitor.html. About the Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) The Primerica Household Budget Index™ (HBI™) is constructed monthly on behalf of Primerica by its chief economic consultant Amy Crews Cutts, PhD, CBE®. The index measures the purchasing power of middle-income families with household incomes from $30,000 to $130,000 and is developed using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Bureau of the Census, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The index looks at the cost of necessities including food, gas, utilities, and health care and earned income to track differences in inflation and wage growth. The HBI™ is presented as a percentage. If the index is above 100%, the purchasing power of middle-income families is stronger than in the baseline period and they may have extra money left over at the end of the month that can be applied to things like entertainment, extra savings, or debt reduction. If it is under 100%, households may have to reduce overall spending to levels below budget, reduce their savings or increase debt to cover expenses. The HBI™ uses January 2019 as its baseline. This point in time reflects a recent “normal” economic time prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Periodically, prior HBI™ values may be revised due to revisions in the CPI series and Consumer Expenditure Survey releases by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Beginning with the October 2023 release of the HBI™ data, health insurance costs will no longer be included in the calculation of the HBI™ data as part of the healthcare component because of some newly acknowledged methodology that has been used by the BLS to calculate the health insurance CPI. The health insurance CPI, as calculated by BLS, does not measure consumer costs of health insurance such as the cost of premiums paid or a combination of premiums and deductibles, but rather premium values retained by health insurers we do not believe it accurately reflects consumer experiences. The healthcare component will continue to include medical services, prescription drugs and equipment. Prior published values have been adjusted to reflect this change.

The Company bought 153,276 ordinary shares at an average price of £79.2754 per share and intends to cancel them. After the transaction, the Company has 164,052,992 ordinary shares in issue, excluding those held in treasury. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The recent share repurchase by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC signifies a strategic move to enhance shareholder value. Share buybacks often indicate that a company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued and presents a good investment. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, earnings per share (EPS) may increase, potentially making the stock more attractive to investors. However, the key is to evaluate whether the capital used for repurchases could have been better invested in business growth opportunities.One must consider the context of the hospitality industry, which is recovering from the impacts of the pandemic. The decision to buy back shares rather than reinvest in expansion or renovation might reflect management's confidence in their operational efficiency and current assets. Nonetheless, it's essential to monitor how this capital allocation strategy plays out in terms of return on investment compared to sector peers who might be expanding their footprint. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the repurchase of shares by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC at an average price of £79.2754 per share requires a capital outlay of approximately £12.1 million. This action could be seen as a move to optimize the company's capital structure. The immediate effect will be a reduction in the company's equity base, which may lead to an improved return on equity (ROE) if net income remains stable or grows.Investors should also note the company's intention to cancel the purchased shares, which will permanently reduce the share count and could be a signal of management's long-term confidence. However, the market will be watching closely for the subsequent quarterly reports to assess the impact of this buyback on the company's financial health, particularly its cash reserves and debt levels. Corporate Governance Expert The share repurchase announcement also touches on aspects of corporate governance. The transaction was conducted following the authority granted by shareholders, demonstrating adherence to corporate governance principles. It is essential for shareholders to evaluate whether the repurchase aligns with their interests and the company's long-term strategy.Furthermore, the transparency provided by the detailed breakdown of purchases and the involvement of a reputable investment firm like Goldman Sachs International (GSI) adds credibility to the process. It is important for current and potential investors to consider how these governance practices might influence their confidence in the company's management and future prospects. 04/09/2024 - 02:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / April 9, 2024 / The Company announces that on 08 April 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

(GTLS) announces an increase in its revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion, with a maturity date extension to April 2029. The amendment, led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., aims to optimize the company's capital structure and achieve a targeted leverage ratio of 2.0-2.5X net leverage. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The expansion of Chart Industries' revolving credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion, along with the extension of its maturity date, signifies a strategic financial maneuver that enhances the company's liquidity and financial flexibility. This move is indicative of a company proactively managing its capital structure to align with its long-term strategic goals, such as maintaining a targeted leverage ratio. A leverage ratio within the range of 2.0-2.5X is generally considered prudent for industrial companies, balancing the benefits of leverage with the risks of excessive debt.Investors should note that the involvement of a leading financial institution like JPMorgan Chase and a consortium of banks reflects positive lender sentiment towards Chart's creditworthiness. This amendment could lead to lower borrowing costs and more favorable terms for Chart, which can contribute to improved net interest margins and potentially higher profitability. However, stakeholders should monitor the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service the increased debt, especially in the context of the cyclical nature of the industrial gas market. Market Research Analyst Chart Industries operates in the clean energy and industrial gas markets, sectors that are increasingly relevant due to the global shift towards sustainability and cleaner energy solutions. The enhanced credit facility may provide Chart with the necessary capital to invest in research and development, expand its product offerings, or pursue strategic acquisitions. Such investments could potentially increase Chart's market share and competitive edge in a growing industry.It's important for investors to consider the timing of this credit facility expansion. Given the current economic climate and the potential for interest rate fluctuations, Chart's decision to lock in terms for a longer period could mitigate risks associated with refinancing in a potentially higher interest rate environment in the future. The favorable changes to terms and conditions could also suggest that Chart has leveraged its market position to negotiate better terms, which could be a positive signal to investors about the company's negotiation capabilities and financial health. Economist From an economic standpoint, the extension and expansion of the credit facility for Chart Industries can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's financial stability and growth prospects. This financial restructuring occurs within a broader economic context where access to capital can be critical for sustaining growth and weathering potential economic downturns. The ability to secure a larger credit facility with a longer maturity period may cushion the company against short-term economic shocks and provide it with the agility to capitalize on market opportunities as they arise.However, it is essential to remain cognizant of the macroeconomic environment, including interest rate trends and economic cycles, that could affect the cost of capital and the company's financial performance. Investors should also be aware of the potential impact of such financial decisions on the company's stock performance, as changes in debt levels can influence investor perceptions and stock valuation. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM ATLANTA, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc.

Negative Allbirds received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq due to the falling bid price of its Class A common stock below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive days, potentially leading to delisting if not rectified within 180 days. Financial Analyst The notification received by Allbirds from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement is a significant event for current and potential investors. A stock price below $1 for an extended period is often seen as a red flag, indicating potential financial instability or lack of investor confidence. It's important to note that a delisting from a major exchange like Nasdaq could severely limit the ability of investors to trade Allbirds' shares and could lead to decreased visibility among institutional investors.However, Allbirds has a 180-day period to rectify the situation, which can involve various strategies such as a reverse stock split or operational improvements to boost investor sentiment. The potential for an additional 180-day extension provides some cushion, but it is imperative for Allbirds to act within these timeframes to avoid further consequences. Investors should monitor the company's actions closely in the coming months, as they will be indicative of Allbirds' ability to maintain its listing and, by extension, its financial health. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Allbirds' situation reflects broader trends that can affect the retail and fashion industry. Consumer behavior, market competition and the overall economic environment are key factors that can influence a company's stock price. For Allbirds, known for its sustainable products, the challenge lies in differentiating itself in a crowded market while maintaining profitability.Understanding consumer trends towards sustainability and how Allbirds' brand aligns with these trends, is important for predicting future performance. Additionally, the company's ability to innovate and effectively market its products can play a significant role in recovering its stock price. Investors should consider industry trends and consumer sentiment when evaluating Allbirds' potential to overcome this setback. Legal Expert Legally, Allbirds' receipt of the Nasdaq Notice triggers disclosure obligations and may affect investor relations and corporate governance. The company must now navigate the regulatory landscape to regain compliance, which could involve seeking shareholder approval for measures like a reverse stock split, if considered. This process must be transparent and adhere to securities regulations to maintain market trust.Moreover, the company's public communications and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will be scrutinized by investors and analysts for insights into Allbirds' strategy to address this issue. Any missteps in regulatory compliance or disclosures could further erode investor confidence and complicate efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN FRANCISCO, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Allbirds, Inc.(NASDAQ: BIRD), a global lifestyle brand that innovates with naturally derived materials to make better footwear and apparel products in a better way, today announced that on April 2, 2024, Allbirds received notice (the “Notice”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that Allbirds is no longer in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because the closing bid price of the Allbirds’ Class A common stock has fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive days.

Investigational camptothecin-peptide conjugates demonstrated promising tolerability and anti-tumor effects, showcasing the platform's versatility and flexibility. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The preclinical findings for Theratechnologies' camptothecin-peptide conjugates in colorectal cancer and triple-negative breast cancer models are indicative of the potential efficacy of SORT1+ Technology™ in targeted cancer therapy. The SORT1-mediated internalization process is a key mechanism that allows for the selective delivery of cytotoxic agents into cancer cells, potentially reducing systemic toxicity and improving patient outcomes. The reported synergy between different peptide-drug conjugates suggests an avenue for combination therapies that could enhance anti-tumor effects while minimizing side effects.From a research perspective, the success of these preclinical trials is a stepping stone toward clinical development. However, the transition from preclinical models to human trials is complex and fraught with challenges. The positive tolerability profile and significant tumor regression in xenograft models are promising, yet it is critical to remain cautious until these results can be replicated in human trials. The specificity of SORT1 expression in various tumor types also warrants further investigation to determine the breadth of applicability of this technology. Oncology Doctor The use of SORT1+ Technology™ for the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents represents an innovative approach in oncology. The platform's reliance on SORT1, a receptor expressed in multiple tumor types, could potentially allow for a more targeted treatment strategy. The camptothecin-peptide conjugates, by exploiting the SORT1 pathway, may offer a novel treatment option for patients with colorectal cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, two malignancies that often have limited treatment options and poor prognoses.As an oncologist, the prospect of increased tumor growth inhibition and greater tolerability is compelling, particularly for aggressive cancers like triple-negative breast cancer. The combination therapy approach, yielding complete responses in some preclinical models, is of particular interest as it aligns with the current trend in oncology to personalize and enhance treatment efficacy. However, it is important to note that xenograft models do not fully recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment and thus, the clinical relevance of these findings must be validated through rigorous clinical trials. Biotech Market Analyst Theratechnologies' presentation of preclinical data at the AACR meeting could have implications for the company's valuation and investor interest, especially given the growing market for targeted cancer therapies. The biotech sector is highly sensitive to such early-stage results, as they can significantly influence the development pipeline and partnerships. The mention of discussions with potential partners hints at strategic collaborations that could provide additional resources and expertise for further development.Investors will be closely monitoring the progression of these investigational therapies into clinical trials, as successful transition could lead to substantial long-term value creation. However, it is important to consider the inherent risks associated with drug development, including the possibility of failure in later-stage trials, regulatory hurdles and market competition. For a comprehensive investment analysis, one must consider these factors alongside the potential market size for SORT1+ Technology™, which could be substantial if the platform proves effective across multiple SORT1-positive tumors. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Novel camptothecin-peptide conjugates are well tolerated and associated with significant tumor regression in colorectal cancer and triple-negative breast cancer xenograft modelsSORT1 gene silencing results in drastic decrease in peptide-drug conjugate uptake which supports a SORT1-mediated internalization processPoster presentation broadens evidence supporting potential utility of platform-derived peptide-drug conjugates alone or in combination in numerous SORT1-positive tumors MONTREAL, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Theratechnologies Inc. (“Theratechnologies” or the “Company”) (TSX: TH) (NASDAQ: THTX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies, today presented preclinical data that highlight the versatility and flexibility of the Company’s SORT1+ Technology™ platform. In a poster session at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego, Calif., researchers reported that Theratechnologies’ investigational camptothecin-peptide conjugates are well tolerated and associated with significant tumor regression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenograft models. The study also demonstrated synergistic anti-tumor efficacy and good tolerability with the combination of two peptide drug conjugates with different payloads. “The preclinical data presented at AACR add to the sizeable body of evidence supporting the potential utility of the SORT1+ Technology™ platform as an engine for the development of novel peptide-drug conjugates to treat various types of cancer,” said Christian Marsolais Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Theratechnologies. “In addition to our lead peptide-drug conjugate, sudocetaxel zendusortide, these latest data highlight the promising tolerability and anti-tumor effects of our investigational camptothecin-peptide conjugates, further demonstrating the versatility and flexibility of the platform. We welcome discussions with potential partners who are interested in the further development of these innovative therapies.” The SORT1+ Technology™ platform relies on the use of a novel, proprietary peptide called TH19P01, which can be conjugated (attached) to numerous well-characterized anticancer drugs. Theratechnologies designed TH19P01 to interact with and be transported by the scavenger receptor sortilin (SORT1), which is involved in protein internalization, sorting, and trafficking, and is expressed in multiple tumor types. Targeting SORT1 with platform-derived peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) leads to receptor-mediated internalization (endocytosis) of anticancer agents. Once inside cancer cells, active drug is released from the peptide and exerts its cytotoxic effect directly on the cancer cell. In the poster presented at AACR, the investigators noted that SORT1 gene silencing inhibits camptothecin-conjugate uptake in human HT-29 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. This observation suggests that these PDCs enter cancer cells via a SORT1-mediated internalization process. The investigators also described the preclinical effects of three PDCs – TH2101, TH2205, and TH2310 – that have a cytotoxic payload of SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, an anticancer agent that is derived from the Chinese tree Camptotheca acuminate. In addition, the poster summarized the activity of another PDC, TH2303, which carries an exatecan payload, a structural analog of camptothecin. Compared to unconjugated irinotecan, the exatecan- and SN-38-conjugates exerted greater anti-proliferative activities against CRC cells in mice. In two different CRC xenograft models, as well as in the TNBC xenograft model, TH2303 was associated with increased tumor growth inhibition and greater tolerability compared to unconjugated exatecan or irinotecan. In another experiment described in the poster, the combination of two SORT1-targeting PDCs – sudocetaxel zendusortide (TH1902) and TH2101, which have a synergistic anti-tumor effect at reduced doses, led to increased tumor growth inhibition and some complete responses in the HT-29 xenograft model, compared to either PDC administered alone. The combination also was well tolerated. “The significant tumor regression following combination therapy is notable because the HT-29 xenograft model is known for its resistance to multiple cytotoxic drugs,” commented Prof. Borhane Annabi, Chair in Cancer Prevention and Treatment in the Chemistry Department at the Université du Québec à Montréal. “That observation, along with the impressive anticancer efficacy of the camptothecin-peptide conjugates when administered alone, underscores the potential feasibility of this approach in treating various tumor types.” A copy of the AACR poster, as well as a second poster presented at the conference, which reinforces existing data for the Company’s lead investigational PDC sudocetaxel zendusortide (TH1902) in activating anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy tumor cell-killing in SORT+1 cancers, can be found at the Theratechnologies website. About Sudocetaxel Zendusortide (TH1902) and SORT1+ Technology™ Sudocetaxel zendusortide is a first-of-its-kind sortilin receptor (SORT1)-targeting PDC, and the first compound to emerge from the Company’s broader licensed oncology platform. A new chemical entity, sudocetaxel zendusortide employs a cleavable linker to conjugate (attach) a proprietary peptide to docetaxel, a well-established cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent used to treat many cancers. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to sudocetaxel zendusortide as a single agent for the treatment of all sortilin-positive recurrent advanced solid tumors that are refractory to standard therapy. Sudocetaxel zendusortide is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial. Theratechnologies has established the SORT1+ TechnologyTM platform as an engine for the development of PDCs that target SORT1, which is expressed in multiple tumor types. SORT1 is a “scavenger” receptor that plays a significant role in protein internalization, sorting, and trafficking. Expression of SORT1 is associated with aggressive disease, poor prognosis, and decreased survival. It is estimated that SORT1 is expressed in 40% to 90% of endometrial, ovarian, colorectal, triple-negative breast (TNBC), and pancreatic cancers, making this receptor an attractive target for anticancer drug development.

(NASDAQ: ICAD), a global leader in clinically proven AI-powered cancer detection solutions, announced today that new data indicates its AI-powered solution effectively uncovers calcium deposits in the breast vessels, a sign of possible cardiovascular disease in women. iCAD research collaborator Chirag Parghi, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Solis Mammography, presented the findings at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) annual meeting taking place April 6 - 8, 2024, in Atlanta, GA. For the study, Dr. Parghi and his team included mammograms from a multiracial cohort of 117,189 women, using iCAD’s ProFound AI Heart Healthi solution, specifically designed for Breast Arterial Calcification (BAC) detection. The 15-site prospective study included 2D screening mammograms from women ages 20 to 100, with a median age of 56. “The ProFound BAC AI algorithm may provide a critical surrogate biomarker for women at risk of heart disease or stroke,” said Dana Brown, president and CEO of iCAD. “We are thrilled to be able to collaborate with Solis Mammography on this state-of-the-art software that gives women the power of knowing—earlier—if they are at potential risk of heart disease during a routine screening mammogram. This provides women valuable information that may lead to obtaining additional cardiovascular screening. We anticipate that ProFound Heart Health will positively impact cardiovascular disease prevention for women as iCAD’s ProFound Detection and Risk solutions do for breast cancer.” Analyzing the data of the prospective study involving 117,189 women, Dr. Parghi and his team found the overall prevalence of BAC (score >1) was 14.8%. Prevalence increased with age, with a 4.2% prevalence in women under 50 years old, 9.0% in women aged 50-59, 19.9% in women in the 60-69 year-old age group, and 40.7% in women 70 years and above. Future work includes tracking patients longitudinally to identify associated cardiovascular risk factors and guiding primary care physicians in managing patients with detected BAC. The study also suggests the ProFound Heart Health AI algorithm can standardize BAC detection, potentially improving efficiency and reducing variability among observers. These findings also align with previous literature emphasizing the association between BAC and cardiovascular risk, underscoring potential opportunity of BAC detection on screening mammography for women’s health. “Artificial Intelligence software can be used to detect breast arterial calcifications with high accuracy,” said Dr. Parghi. “With this tool, we will be able to identify patients that can benefit from additional cardiovascular screening, potentially intervening before adverse outcomes manifest. To be able to have one screening mammogram unveil meaningful insights for two of the leading causes of death for women – breast cancer and heart disease – is remarkable.” “At present, radiologists must rely on visual detection of breast arterial calcifications, which is time-consuming and leads to consistent underreporting of BAC results,” continued Dr. Parghi. “With an AI algorithm accurately identifying BAC, we will see more consistent BAC detection and reporting, which will ultimately benefit patients the most.” Recent research shows that calcium deposits inside the blood vessels of the breast correlate to hardening of the cardiovascular arteries, and women with BAC are 51% more likely to develop heart disease. Early cardiovascular disease detection is key, as among asymptomatic women, the first manifestation of underlying coronary heart disease is often acute myocardial infarction (MI) or sudden death. Although women tend to have a lower burden of obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography, they typically have a worse prognosis after MI compared with men. About iCAD, Inc.iCAD, Inc.

(NYSE: AHT) expects to report an Occupancy of 67% for Q1 2024 with an Average Daily Rate of $191, resulting in a RevPAR of $128. Comparable RevPAR saw a 1% decrease compared to Q1 2023. The company experienced a 2.1% increase in January 2024 but a decrease in February and March 2024. Ashford Trust remains optimistic due to increased demand and progress in deleveraging. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported figures by Ashford Hospitality Trust, such as Occupancy, Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), are critical indicators of the company's operational performance. The slight decrease in RevPAR year-over-year suggests a potential softening in the hotel market or operational issues specific to the company. However, the increase in January followed by marginal decreases in February and March may indicate market volatility or seasonal factors.When evaluating the impact on the stock market, investors should consider the company's performance relative to industry benchmarks and competitors. The deleveraging plan and the focus on paying off strategic corporate financing could be seen as a positive step towards improving the company's balance sheet and reducing interest expenses, which may enhance long-term shareholder value.The offering of non-traded preferred equity is another important aspect. While this financing strategy can provide capital without diluting common shareholders' equity, it may also imply higher fixed costs due to dividend obligations. Investors should weigh the potential benefits of capital infusion against the cost of additional preferred dividends. Market Research Analyst The hospitality sector is highly sensitive to economic cycles and consumer sentiment. The mention of increased corporate and group demand indicates a recovery in business travel, which is a positive sign for the industry. However, the impact of the Easter Holiday shift on March's performance highlights the sector's susceptibility to seasonal variations and calendar events.The company's geographically diverse portfolio and positioning in the upper upscale segment may offer some resilience against market downturns, as this segment often has a more stable customer base. However, the performance of the hospitality sector can be a leading indicator for broader economic trends and as such, the reported decline in RevPAR could signal caution to investors about potential headwinds in consumer spending. Hospitality Industry Expert Occupancy and ADR are key metrics for the hospitality industry, reflecting demand and pricing power. Ashford Trust's occupancy of 67% is reasonable, but the 1% decline in RevPAR could be a concern if it indicates a trend. The company's mention of a 'high-quality' portfolio suggests they are banking on the strength of their properties to drive performance.It's also worth noting that real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Ashford Trust often distribute the majority of taxable income to shareholders and their performance is closely tied to real estate market conditions and interest rates. The company's strategic moves, such as deleveraging and offering non-traded preferred equity, should be assessed in the context of these factors. 04/08/2024 - 04:20 PM DALLAS, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc. (NYSE: AHT) (""Ashford Trust"" or the ""Company"") reported today that the Company expects to report Occupancy of approximately 67% for the first quarter of 2024 with Average Daily Rate of approximately $191 resulting in RevPAR of approximately $128.

QuoteMedia provides banks, brokerage firms, private equity firms, financial planners and sophisticated investors with a more economical, higher quality alternative source of stock market data and related research information. We compete with several larger legacy organizations and a modest community of other smaller companies. QuoteMedia provides comprehensive market data services, including streaming data feeds, on-demand request-based data (XML/JSON), web content solutions (financial content for website integration) and applications such as Quotestream Professional desktop and mobile. Highlights for fiscal 2023 include the following: Annual revenue increased to $18,907,725 in 2023 from $17,527,605 in 2022, an increase of $1,380,120 (8%).Net income for 2023 was $361,584 compared to $444,470 in 2022, a decrease in profitability of $82,886.Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was $3,039,507 compared to $2,727,411 in 2022, an improvement of $312,096. “This was an important year for QuoteMedia,” said Robert J. Thompson, Chairman of the Board. “We invested in a major data consolidation initiative that allows us to significantly reduce our dependence on 3rd party data providers and reduce our data sourcing costs. This has been a long, difficult and costly process, but we are already beginning to enjoy the benefits, as we have much greater flexibility and control in servicing our clients, at lower costs. “2023 resulted in the completion of some major client deployments, and the startup of new client deployments that are currently in progress. Discussions and negotiations on several other large-scale projects expected to be closed in 2024, were also commenced. “While we experienced strong revenue growth, our profitability was somewhat dampened due to some large one-time expenses incurred in relation to completing the data consolidation initiative and in changing public accounting firms. Moving forward, we expect to see an improvement in profitability as our professional fees normalize, and our revenue and gross margin percentages increase. “Our teams have put in a tremendous amount of very productive hard work this year.

QuoteMedia Investor Relations Brendan HopkinsEmail: investors@quotemedia.com Call: (407) 645-5295 Note 1 on Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, as a non-GAAP pro forma financial measure, provides meaningful information to investors in terms of enhancing their understanding of our operating performance and results, as it allows investors to more easily compare our financial performance on a consistent basis compared to the prior year periods. This non-GAAP financial measure also corresponds with the way we expect investment analysts to evaluate and compare our results. Any non-GAAP pro forma financial measures should be considered only as supplements to, and not as substitutes for or in isolation from, or superior to, our other measures of financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as net income attributable to QuoteMedia, Inc. We define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to QuoteMedia, Inc., plus: 1) depreciation and amortization, 2) stock compensation expense, 3) interest expense, 4) foreign exchange loss (or minus a foreign exchange gain), and 5) income tax expense. We disclose Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is a useful metric by which to compare the performance of our business from period to period. We understand that measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are broadly used by analysts, rating agencies, investors and financial institutions in assessing our performance. Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors. The table below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income attributable to QuoteMedia, Inc., the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. QuoteMedia, Inc.

(NYSE: PAG) plans to expand its retail automotive operations into Australia by acquiring two Porsche dealerships and a Ducati motorcycle dealership in Melbourne. The company aims to strengthen its partnership with the Porsche brand and enhance customer experience in Melbourne. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition by Penske Automotive Group of two Porsche dealerships and a Ducati motorcycle dealership in Melbourne, Australia, represents a strategic expansion within the automotive retail sector. It's important to assess the growth potential in the Australian luxury vehicle market, which has seen a steady increase in demand, particularly in urban centers like Melbourne. This expansion aligns with global trends where affluent consumers are showing resilience in spending on high-end vehicles, despite broader economic headwinds.From a market research perspective, the choice of Porsche and Ducati, brands synonymous with luxury and performance, may enhance Penske's brand equity and customer loyalty. The focus on customer experience is a key differentiator in the luxury segment and could drive higher margins through premium service offerings. Moreover, leveraging existing infrastructure could result in cost synergies, enhancing operational efficiency and profitability in the long term. Financial Analyst Penske Automotive Group's financials will likely reflect the impact of this acquisition in the subsequent quarters following the closure of the deal. Considering the high-value nature of the brands involved, there is potential for a significant increase in revenue. However, investors should monitor the integration costs and the time required for the new dealerships to contribute positively to Penske's bottom line.It's also worth noting that the Australian automotive market is competitive and the initial investment and ongoing operational costs will need to be balanced against the expected revenue from the new dealerships. The move suggests confidence in the luxury car market's growth trajectory and Penske's ability to capitalize on it. The success of this expansion could serve as a bellwether for future international growth initiatives by the company. Automotive Industry Expert The strategic acquisition of the Porsche and Ducati dealerships by Penske Automotive Group is a clear indicator of the company's intent to bolster its presence in the high-end automotive retail market. The selection of Melbourne for this expansion is no coincidence; the city's economic profile and the presence of a target demographic with disposable income make it a prime location for luxury vehicle sales.Given the long-standing reputation of the Brighton dealership and the strategic placement of the Doncaster dealership in a high-growth area, Penske could see an uptick in market share within this niche segment. The integration of these dealerships into Penske's portfolio could also enhance the company's bargaining power with manufacturers and suppliers, potentially leading to better terms and cost savings. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Penske Automotive Group, Inc.

The company sold 20,300 attributable gold equivalent ounces and generated $42.8 million in revenue. Preliminary cost of sales was $5.7 million, resulting in cash operating margins of $1,781 per ounce. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported sales and revenue figures from Sandstorm Gold Ltd. for Q1 2024 indicate a decrease in both attributable gold equivalent ounces sold and revenue compared to the same period in 2023. This dip in sales and revenue is a significant indicator of the company's performance and could potentially influence investor sentiment. The decline in total sales, royalties and income from other interests year-over-year may suggest a need for further analysis of market conditions and operational efficiency within the company.Furthermore, the cash operating margin has increased slightly, which could imply an improvement in cost management. However, this increase in margin is juxtaposed with a reduction in overall revenue, which can be concerning. Investors might interpret this as a signal of the company's ability to manage costs in a challenging environment, but it also raises questions about scalability and revenue generation capabilities moving forward. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the preliminary nature of the reported figures implies that investors should exercise caution until the finalized report is released. The fact that these figures are subject to change upon final quarter-end closing adjustments means that the current data may not fully represent the company's financial position.Moreover, the use of non-IFRS measures, such as attributable gold equivalent ounces and cash operating margin, while helpful for comparison within the industry, may not provide a complete picture of the company's financial health. It is essential to consider these alongside IFRS-compliant measures for a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance. Commodities Analyst When examining the precious metals market, the performance of Sandstorm Gold Ltd. must be contextualized within broader market trends. The decrease in sales volume could be reflective of fluctuating gold prices or a shift in demand. It's important to consider external factors such as geopolitical tensions, currency fluctuations and changes in investor appetite for gold as a safe-haven asset.Additionally, the increase in cash operating margin per attributable gold equivalent ounce could suggest a favorable cost structure or efficient production processes. However, it is necessary to delve deeper into the operational aspects to confirm if this is a result of improved operations or merely a reflection of reduced sales volume impacting cost allocation per ounce. 04/08/2024 - 04:20 PM DESIGNATED NEWS RELEASE VANCOUVER, BC, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (""Sandstorm Gold Royalties"", ""Sandstorm"", or the ""Company"") (NYSE: SAND) (TSX: SSL) is pleased to report the sales and revenue figures for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 (all figures in U.S. dollars). First Quarter Preliminary Sales and Revenue During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold approximately 20,300 attributable gold equivalent ounces1 and realized preliminary revenue2 of $42.8 million (28,368 attributable gold equivalent ounces and $44.0 million in revenue for the comparable period in 2023). The Company had preliminary total sales, royalties, and income from other interests1 of $42.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 ($54.0 million total sales, royalties, and income from other interests for the comparable period in 2023). Preliminary cost of sales, excluding depletion2 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was $5.7 million resulting in cash operating margins1 of approximately $1,781 per attributable gold equivalent ounce1 ($6.5 million and $1,652 per attributable gold equivalent ounce for the comparable period in 2023, respectively). Release Date and Conference Call Details The Company will release its 2024 first quarter results on Thursday, May 2, 2024, after markets close. A conference call will be held on Friday, May 3, 2024, starting at 8:30am PDT to further discuss the first quarter results.

The presentation of these non-IFRS measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently. Note these figures have not been audited and are subject to change. As the Company's operations are primarily focused on precious metals, the Company presents attributable gold equivalent ounces as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other mining companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. Attributable gold equivalent ounces is a non-IFRS financial ratio that uses total sales, royalties, and income from other interests as a component. Total sales, royalties and income from other interests is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by taking total revenue which includes sales and royalty revenue, and adding contractual income relating to royalties, streams and other interests excluding gains and losses on dispositions, which, during the first quarter 2023, was primarily comprised of a one-time payment received as per the Company's royalty agreement on the Mt. Hamilton project. Attributable gold equivalent ounces is calculated by dividing the Company's total sales, royalties, and income from other interests, less revenue attributable to non-controlling shareholders for the period, by the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's Gold streams for the same respective period ([$42.8 million - $0.9 million]/$2,062 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and [$54.0 million – $0.6 million]/$1,882 for the comparable period in 2023) and may be subject to change.The Company presents cash operating margin as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. Cash operating margin is calculated by subtracting the average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce from the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's Gold streams (see item i above) for the same respective period. Average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce is calculated by dividing the Company's cost of sales, excluding depletion, by the number of attributable gold equivalent ounces ($5.7 million/20,300 Attributable Gold Equivalent ounces for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and $6.5 million/28,368 Attributable Gold Equivalent ounces for the comparable period in 2023).Note 2These figures have not been audited and are subject to change. As the Company has not yet finished its quarter-end close procedures, the anticipated financial information presented in this press release is preliminary, subject to final quarter-end closing adjustments, and may change materially.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS TO U.S. SECURITYHOLDERS The financial information included or incorporated by reference in this press release or the documents referenced herein has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which differs from US generally accepted accounting principles (""US GAAP"") in certain material respects, and thus are not directly comparable to financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP. This press release and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, have been prepared in accordance with Canadian standards for the reporting of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, which differ from the previous and current standards of the United States securities laws. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms ""mineral reserve"", ""proven mineral reserve"", ""probable mineral reserve"", ""inferred mineral resources,"", ""indicated mineral resources,"" ""measured mineral resources"" and ""mineral resources"" used or referenced herein and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 — Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (""NI 43-101"") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the ""CIM"") — CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the ""CIM Definition Standards""). For United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the ""SEC Modernization Rules"") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which became effective February 25, 2019. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. Issuers were required to comply with the SEC Modernization Rules in their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Corporation is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of ""measured mineral resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" and ""inferred mineral resources."" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of ""proven mineral reserves"" and ""probable mineral reserves"" to be ""substantially similar"" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the SEC will now recognize ""measured mineral resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" and ""inferred mineral resources"", U.S. investors should not assume that all or any part of the mineralization in these categories will be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves without further work and analysis. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable without further work and analysis. Further, ""inferred mineral resources"" have a greater amount of uncertainty and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to a higher category without further work and analysis. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of ""inferred mineral resources"" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms are ""substantially similar"" to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as ""proven mineral reserves"", ""probable mineral reserves"", ""measured mineral resources"", ""indicated mineral resources"" and ""inferred mineral resources"" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of SEC Industry Guide 7. CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and ""forward-looking information"" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties.

Brookdale Reports March 2024 Occupancy,2024-04-08T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,"Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (BKD) reports a 180 basis points increase in weighted average occupancy for March 2024 compared to the previous year, reaching 77.9%. This marks the twenty-ninth consecutive month of year-over-year growth. However, there was a slight decrease of (50) basis points in occupancy compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.","Brookdale Reports March 2024 Occupancy Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (BKD) reports a 180 basis points increase in weighted average occupancy for March 2024 compared to the previous year, reaching 77.9%. This marks the twenty-ninth consecutive month of year-over-year growth. However, there was a slight decrease of (50) basis points in occupancy compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in weighted average occupancy for Brookdale Senior Living Inc. is a positive indicator of the company's recovery trajectory post-pandemic. The consistent year-over-year growth over twenty-nine months suggests a robust demand for senior living facilities. This trend is likely driven by an aging population and possibly an enhanced reputation or improved service offerings by Brookdale. However, the sequential flatness to February's numbers could indicate a plateau in occupancy rates, which may be a point of concern for investors looking for continuous growth.It's essential to consider the broader industry context. The senior living industry is cyclical, with occupancy rates often influenced by seasonal trends. The reported decrease in first quarter occupancy compared to the fourth quarter of the previous year could reflect such seasonality, despite being an improvement over typical pre-pandemic patterns. Investors should monitor if this represents a temporary dip or the beginning of a longer-term trend. Financial Analyst Occupancy rates are a critical performance metric for real estate investment trusts (REITs) and companies like Brookdale that derive revenue from property operations. A 180 basis point year-over-year increase in occupancy translates directly into higher revenue potential. This improvement is indicative of operational efficiency and could lead to better financial outcomes, reflected in future earnings reports.However, investors should analyze this data point in conjunction with other financial health indicators such as average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR) and operating expenses. A comprehensive view will determine the actual impact on the bottom line. For example, if the increased occupancy is accompanied by disproportionate increases in operating expenses, the net benefit may be less significant. Demographic Trends Analyst The underlying demographic trends provide context to Brookdale's occupancy rates. The aging baby boomer generation is increasing the demand for senior living options. Brookdale's sustained occupancy growth might reflect this demographic shift. As the population continues to age, the demand for such facilities is expected to rise, potentially benefiting companies in the senior living sector.Yet, it's important to recognize that the industry is competitive and consumer preferences can shift. Innovations in home care and alternative senior living options could impact the long-term demand for traditional senior living facilities. Companies that adapt to these changes and offer services aligned with evolving consumer preferences will likely be more successful in maintaining high occupancy levels. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE: BKD) reported today its consolidated occupancy for March 2024.

(NYSE: CNM) has signed an agreement to acquire Geothermal Supply Company Inc., a leading distributor of HDPE pipe products. The acquisition aims to expand Core & Main's offerings in the geothermal, water, and sewer industries.","Core & Main Signs Agreement to Acquire Geothermal Supply Company Inc. Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Core & Main Inc. (NYSE: CNM) has signed an agreement to acquire Geothermal Supply Company Inc., a leading distributor of HDPE pipe products. The acquisition aims to expand Core & Main's offerings in the geothermal, water, and sewer industries. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Geothermal Supply Company Inc. (GSC) by Core & Main Inc. (CNM) represents a strategic expansion within the infrastructure sector. As a market research analyst, one can observe that this move by CNM aligns with the industry trend of consolidation to achieve economies of scale and widen product offerings. The integration of GSC's expertise in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe distribution and fabrication could potentially enhance CNM's competitive edge in the geothermal, water and sewer industries.Given the increasing focus on sustainable and renewable energy sources, the geothermal sector is poised for growth. CNM's acquisition of a specialized distributor like GSC could enable it to capitalize on this trend, provided the integration is seamless and the company leverages GSC's established customer relationships. However, the success of this acquisition will ultimately depend on CNM's ability to integrate GSC's operations and maintain its level of customer service and product quality. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the acquisition's impact on Core & Main's financials will be a point of interest for investors. The deal could lead to revenue growth and increased market share for CNM, but the financial terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed, which makes it challenging to assess the immediate financial implications. Investors should monitor post-acquisition financial statements to evaluate the deal's success in terms of return on investment and accretion to earnings.It is also noteworthy that acquisitions often involve integration costs and can lead to short-term financial strain. Investors should consider the potential for synergies and cost savings, which may offset these expenses in the long term. The effectiveness of CNM's post-acquisition strategy will be critical in realizing these potential benefits. Environmental Analyst As an environmental analyst, it is evident that the use of HDPE in infrastructure has environmental implications. HDPE is known for its durability, resistance to corrosion and long life span, which can reduce the need for frequent replacements and thus lower the environmental impact of infrastructure projects. Core & Main's acquisition of GSC could indicate an increased commitment to providing environmentally sustainable solutions in the infrastructure sector.The geothermal industry, which is a key market for GSC, is a clean energy source that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By strengthening its position in this sector, Core & Main may contribute to the broader adoption of geothermal technology, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. However, it will be important for the company to manage the environmental footprint of its expanded operations, including the sourcing and disposal of HDPE materials. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM ST.

The company aims to save over $4.5 million annually, leveraging its strong balance sheet for strategic priorities.","Hilton Grand Vacations Successfully Reprices Term Loan B Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (NYSE:HGV) successfully re-prices its $1.3 billion Term Loan B, reducing pricing by 25 basis points and removing credit spread adjustment. The company aims to save over $4.5 million annually, leveraging its strong balance sheet for strategic priorities. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The re-pricing of Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.'s Term Loan B represents a strategic financial move, indicating the company's leverage in renegotiating loan terms amidst a dynamic interest rate environment. The reduction of 25 basis points in the interest rate, from SOFR plus 275 to SOFR plus 250 basis points, suggests a favorable credit risk reassessment or an advantageous market condition that the company has capitalized on. This action will result in annual savings of over $4.5 million, which is significant for the company's financial health.From an investor's perspective, this development is positive as it implies management's commitment to cost savings and efficient capital allocation. The removal of the credit spread adjustment also simplifies the loan's cost structure, potentially reducing the cost of debt servicing. Over the long term, these savings could be redirected towards growth initiatives or returned to shareholders, enhancing shareholder value. Debt Market Analyst Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.'s ability to re-price its Term Loan B is indicative of its standing in the debt market. Factors such as the company's creditworthiness, prevailing market rates and investor demand for corporate debt instruments play a important role in such negotiations. The successful re-pricing could signal to the market that HGV is viewed as a lower credit risk, which may influence the pricing of its future debt issuances or refinancing options.The impact on the broader market could see other companies with similar credit profiles seeking to renegotiate their debt terms, especially if the interest rate trend continues to favor borrowers. It is important for stakeholders to monitor these market shifts as they affect the cost of capital and can influence investment decisions across the sector. Corporate Strategy Analyst The re-pricing of the Term Loan B aligns with Hilton Grand Vacations Inc.'s strategic financial management, showcasing a proactive approach to leverage market conditions to strengthen its balance sheet. This move could be part of a broader strategy to optimize the company's capital structure, reduce financial risk and increase operational flexibility. By securing lower borrowing costs, HGV is better positioned to invest in strategic priorities that may include expansion, technological upgrades, or enhancing its product offerings.Additionally, this financial maneuver could be seen as a preemptive step in anticipation of potential economic headwinds, ensuring that the company maintains a healthy liquidity profile. This kind of foresight is essential for maintaining investor confidence and can be a differentiator in the hospitality industry, which is highly sensitive to economic cycles. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. (NYSE:HGV) announces today the successful re-pricing of its existing $1.3 billion Term Loan B, maturing Aug. 2, 2028.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The delisting of multiple companies from the Nasdaq Stock Market represents a significant event with potential ramifications for investors and the broader market. Delisting often occurs when a company fails to meet the exchange's financial and reporting requirements, which could be indicative of underlying financial distress or governance issues.Investors holding these stocks may face liquidity challenges, as trading these securities over-the-counter (OTC) is typically less fluid than on a major exchange. This can result in wider bid-ask spreads and more volatile stock prices. Furthermore, institutional investors often have mandates that prevent them from holding OTC stocks, which could lead to forced selling and additional downward pressure on these stocks' prices.For the broader market, delistings can affect investor confidence, particularly if they are part of a larger trend. It's important for market participants to monitor the health of the exchange's listings, as a rise in delistings could signal broader economic or sector-specific issues. Market Research Analyst The delisting of companies, especially in clusters, can be an indicator of sectoral stress or broader market trends. For instance, if the affected companies belong to the same industry, this could suggest structural challenges within that sector, such as regulatory changes, disruptive technologies, or shifts in consumer behavior.For businesses and investors, understanding the context and reasons behind these delistings is crucial. It can inform strategic decisions, such as seeking alternative investments, diversifying portfolios, or even identifying distressed assets that may present unique opportunities.Additionally, the delisting process itself can serve as a learning experience for other publicly traded companies, emphasizing the importance of compliance with financial regulations and the consequences of failing to meet listing standards. Legal Expert Delisting from a major stock exchange like Nasdaq carries legal implications for the affected companies. They must navigate the transition to OTC markets, which includes adhering to different regulatory requirements and reporting standards. The change in status can also trigger clauses in debt covenants or investment agreements, potentially leading to renegotiations or disputes.Shareholders of the delisted companies should be aware of their rights and the legal recourse available to them, including seeking information from the company regarding the reasons for the delisting and any measures being taken to protect shareholder value. This event also underscores the importance of due diligence and the role of legal counsel in guiding companies through the complexities of securities regulation. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market announced today that it will delist the common stock of NanoString Technologies, Inc.

The order enhances product offerings, guest experiences, and operational infrastructure over a ten-year period. The Company's strategic investments aim to boost earnings, reduce net leverage, and enhance shareholder value. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.'s extensive new build order and pier development represents a significant strategic investment in the company's future. The addition of eight new vessels and a multi-ship pier at Great Stirrup Cay could potentially increase the company's capacity and guest experience, which in turn, might drive higher revenue growth in the long term. This move indicates a bullish outlook on the cruise industry's recovery and growth prospects post-pandemic.From a market research perspective, such a capital-intensive plan could be a double-edged sword. While it may strengthen the company's market position and operational efficiency, there is also the risk of overcapacity if the expected increase in demand does not materialize. Furthermore, the focus on sustainability and decarbonization aligns with increasing consumer and regulatory demands for environmentally responsible travel options, which could enhance the company's brand and attract a segment of eco-conscious travelers. Financial Analyst Examining the financial implications, the company's disciplined de-leveraging plan, coupled with strategic investments, suggests a careful balance between growth and financial stability. The favorable terms obtained for export credit financing for 80 percent of the contract price of certain ships demonstrates confidence from financial institutions in the company's creditworthiness and business plan.However, the fact that financing for the Norwegian Cruise Line ship orders is still pending introduces a layer of uncertainty. Investors should monitor the company's ability to secure financing under favorable conditions, as this will be critical to the execution of their strategy without placing undue strain on the balance sheet. The projected Net Leverage reduction is a positive sign, showing commitment to improving financial health, which is important for long-term shareholder value. Sustainability Analyst The emphasis on sustainability and decarbonization in the new ship designs is indicative of the broader industry trend towards more environmentally friendly operations. As regulations tighten and consumer preferences shift, the cruise industry is under pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.'s approach could set a new industry benchmark for sustainable cruising and potentially reduce operational costs through improved fuel efficiency.It's essential to scrutinize the actual implementation of these sustainability measures once the ships are operational. The company's ability to meet its decarbonization goals will likely influence its reputation and regulatory compliance, impacting its long-term viability and attractiveness to environmentally conscious investors and customers. 04/08/2024 - 04:15 PM Plan includes next generation vessels for Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Regent Seven Seas Cruises to be built by Fincantieri, along with infrastructure enhancements for Great Stirrup Cay, all while continuing its disciplined multi-year de-leveraging planMIAMI, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NYSE: NCLH) (together with NCL Corporation Ltd., “Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings”, “Norwegian”, “NCLH” or the “Company”) today unveiled the most comprehensive new build order in its history—a total of eight state-of-the-art vessels, representing nearly 25,000 additional berths, with new classes of ships for each of its three award-winning brands—and the construction of a multi-ship pier at Great Stirrup Cay, the Company’s private island destination in the Bahamas and its top-rated Caribbean port of call. This unprecedented decade-long strategy enhances its product offering, guest experiences, and operational infrastructure, supporting the Company’s sustained leadership in delivering innovative cruise vacations. The new ship orders across all three brands are scheduled for delivery over a ten-year period, between 2026 and 2036. Following the delivery of four Prima-Plus class ships from 2025 through 2028, Norwegian Cruise Line is expected to take delivery of four approximately 200,000-gross-ton ships, each with a capacity of nearly 5,000 guests, in 2030, 2032, 2034 and 2036, which are subject to financing1. Building on the success of its Allura Class ships, the last one being delivered in 2025, Oceania Cruises is scheduled to take delivery of two 86,000-gross-ton ships, each with a capacity of 1,450 guests in 2027 and 2029. Lastly, following the award-winning Explorer Class ships, Regent Seven Seas Cruises is scheduled to take delivery of two 77,000-gross-ton ships, each with a capacity of 850 guests, in 2026 and 2029. Details regarding the ships’ amenities, staterooms, dining, recreational, efficiency, sustainability and other features will be announced in the coming months. ""This strategic new-ship order across all three of our award-winning brands provides for the steady introduction of cutting-edge vessels into our fleet and solidifies our long-term growth. It also allows us to significantly leverage our operating scale, strengthen our commitment to innovation and enhance our ability to offer our guests new products and experiences, all while providing opportunities to enhance the efficiency of our fleet,” said Harry Sommer, president and chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. “We are likewise excited with the addition of a new pier at Great Stirrup Cay to support our increased capacity in the Caribbean and multiple ships to call on the island, enhancing our guest experience and bringing seamless and reliable access to our private island year-round.” In partnership with the Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, each brand will design their new ship class and focus on creating the largest, most efficient, and innovative vessels of their respective fleet. Aligning with the Company’s sustainability efforts, the new ship designs are expected to advance the journey towards decarbonization. ""Over the years, our long-standing relationship with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings has been rooted in a shared vision for the future of maritime travel, consistently setting new standards for innovation, luxury, sustainability, and guest satisfaction in the cruise industry,” said Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO and Managing Director at Fincantieri. “We are thrilled to work on these new build orders and deliver emblematic cruise ships that will embody our shared legacy of excellence for generations to come.” The Company has obtained export credit financing with favorable terms to fund 80 percent of the contract price of each of the two Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises ships, subject to certain conditions. The ship orders for Norwegian Cruise Line remain subject to financing, currently underway. Mark A. Kempa, chief financial officer of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, commented, “we expect that these strategic investments will secure our growth trajectory, significantly boost our earnings profile, and enhance shareholder value well into the future. With a favorable payment structure that includes pre-delivery financing and modest initial installment payments for these ship orders, we still anticipate strong Net Leverage reduction of 1.5 turns by the end of 2024, relative to 2023, and expect the Company to continue reducing Net Leverage each year for the foreseeable future.” _______________1 Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. expects a four-ship Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL) order to replace a separate, effective, two-ship order for Oceania Cruises initially placed to secure availability with the shipyard. The four-ship order for NCL is still being finalized and is subject to financing. Delivery for the second Oceania Cruises ship is contractually scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2028, but may be delayed to 2029. All expected delivery dates are preliminary and subject to change. New Pier Development at Great Stirrup Cay The new pier development at the Company’s private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, is slated to break ground in summer 2024 and be completed by late 2025 with an investment of approximately $150 million. The new pier will be constructed to simultaneously accommodate two large vessels of the Company’s current and future ship classes. The pier development will enhance the guest experience on Great Stirrup Cay, and along with Harvest Caye, the Company’s private island in Belize, continue to provide guests with world-class destinations in the Eastern and Western Caribbean.

The company experienced stable ASPs in the fourth quarter, with the U.S utility-scale business driving revenues. Maxeon is focusing on cost reduction and liquidity management to achieve profitability. The company plans to file its annual 20-F report by April 30, 2024. Positive None. Negative Higher restructuring costs due to ramping down Maxeon 6 capacity faster than planned. Negative GAAP net loss attributable to stockholders in Q4 and FY 2023. Decrease in non-GAAP gross profit and negative Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2023. Significant restructuring expenses and charges impacting financial performance. Financial Analyst Maxeon Solar Technologies' latest financial results indicate a challenging quarter with significant restructuring costs impacting their bottom line. The decision to accelerate the ramp down of Maxeon 6 capacity, while intended to align with the distributed generation (DG) market slowdown, has led to higher restructuring expenses. This strategic pivot, aimed at improving long-term profitability, is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it may position Maxeon better for future market conditions; on the other, it imposes immediate financial strain, as evidenced by the increased GAAP operating expenses and net loss attributable to stockholders.Investors should note the decline in shipments year-over-year and the corresponding drop in revenue. This trend, alongside the reported net loss, suggests market challenges and operational headwinds. However, the company's focus on premium product differentiation and customer experience could be a strategic move to carve out a niche in the competitive solar market. The financial community will watch closely to see if these efforts can translate into improved margins and a return to profitability. Energy Market Analyst Examining Maxeon's preliminary financials, the utility-scale segment in the U.S. appears to be their revenue backbone, maintaining stable average selling prices (ASPs). This stability is a positive sign in a market that has been volatile due to policy changes and trade tensions. Maxeon's strategic emphasis on the U.S. utility-scale market could be advantageous, given the growing demand for renewable energy and supportive federal policies.However, the global solar industry is facing cost pressures from raw material price increases and supply chain disruptions. Maxeon's restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives are necessary steps, but they must be balanced against the risk of losing ground to competitors during this transition period. The upcoming annual report and future earnings calls will be critical for stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of these strategies and the company's adaptability in a rapidly evolving energy sector. Accounting Expert Maxeon's use of non-GAAP financial measures is intended to provide investors with a clearer view of the company's operational performance by excluding certain items. While these measures can be useful, it's important for stakeholders to understand the nature of the adjustments made. The exclusion of stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and remeasurement losses, among others, can significantly alter the perception of the company's financial health.For instance, the non-GAAP gross profit adjusts for restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, presenting a less negative figure compared to the GAAP gross loss. Similarly, non-GAAP operating expenses are adjusted down, primarily due to the exclusion of restructuring charges. It's important for investors to consider both GAAP and non-GAAP measures in tandem to gain a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance and to understand the impact of management's strategic decisions on the reported financial outcomes. 04/08/2024 - 04:10 PM SINGAPORE, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Maxeon Solar Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MAXN) (""Maxeon"" or ""the Company""), a global leader in solar innovation and channels, today provided preliminary selected unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as well as expected shipment and revenue numbers for the first quarter of 2024. Maxeon's CEO Bill Mulligan commented, ""In the fourth quarter, Maxeon delivered financial results largely in line with our expectations. Our U.S utility-scale business accounted for the majority of revenues in the fourth quarter, with stable ASPs."" ""As disclosed in our last earnings call, Maxeon has been executing a transformation of our IBC capacity timed to coincide with the current DG market slowdown. As part of this initiative, we made the decision to ramp down all of our Maxeon 6 capacity faster than we had originally expected, resulting in higher than initially planned restructuring costs in the fourth quarter."" ""The Maxeon team is highly focused on reducing manufacturing costs, OPEX rationalization and liquidity-management to enable a return to profitability. Our strategy continues to be to focus on designing and building premium, differentiated products and delivering a superior customer experience across a balanced portfolio of global DG and U.S. utility scale markets. The Company plans to file its annual 20-F report by April 30, 2024."" The Company will separately announce the date for its next earnings call. Preliminary Selected Q4 Unaudited Financial Summary (In millions, except shipments) Fiscal Q4 2023 Fiscal Q3 2023 Fiscal Q4 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 Shipments, in MW 653 628 734 2,862 2,348 Revenue $ 229 $ 228 $ 324 $ 1,123 $ 1,060 Gross (loss) profit (32) 3 20 80 (48) GAAP Operating expenses 142 67 38 298 152 GAAP Net loss attributable to the stockholders (184) (108) (76) (274) (267) Cash, cash equivalent, restricted cash and short-term securities 196 277 344 196 344 Other Financial Data(1) (In millions) Fiscal Q4 2023 Fiscal Q3 2023 Fiscal Q4 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 Non-GAAP Gross (loss) profit $ (7) $ 3 $ 21 $ 106 $ (31) Non-GAAP Operating expenses 36 38 34 153 134 Restructuring expenses and charges 128 24 1 152 6 Adjusted EBITDA (35) (20) (4) 6 (109) (1) The Company's use of Non-GAAP financial information, including a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, is provided under ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below For the first quarter of 2024, the Company expects the following results: Shipments, in MW 508 (approx.) Revenue, in USD millions 186 (approx.) Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We present certain non-GAAP measures such as non-GAAP gross (loss) profit, non-GAAP operating expenses and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and fees, remeasurement (loss) gain on prepaid forward and physical delivery forward and equity in losses (income) of unconsolidated investees (""Adjusted EBITDA"") to supplement our consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross (loss) profit is defined as gross (loss) profit excluding stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and fees, and loss related to settlement of price escalation dispute. Non-GAAP operating expenses is defined as operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation and restructuring charges and fees. We believe that non-GAAP gross (loss) profit, non-GAAP operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA provide greater transparency into management's view and assessment of the Company's ongoing operating performance by removing items management believes are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe these measures are useful to help enhance the comparability of our results of operations across different reporting periods on a consistent basis and with our competitors, distinct from items that are infrequent or not associated with the Company's core operations as presented above. We also use these non-GAAP measures internally to assess our business, financial performance and current and historical results, as well as for strategic decision-making and forecasting future results. Given our use of non-GAAP measures, we believe that these measures may be important to investors in understanding our operating results as seen through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP measures are neither prepared in accordance with GAAP nor are they intended to be a replacement for GAAP financial data, should be reviewed together with GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. As presented in the ""Preliminary Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" section, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items in arriving to the non-GAAP measures: Stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation relates primarily to equity incentive awards. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that is dependent on market forces that are difficult to predict and is excluded from non-GAAP gross (loss) profit, non-GAAP operating expense and Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes that this adjustment for stock-based compensation expense provides investors with a basis to measure our core performance, including the ability to compare our performance with the performance of other companies, without the period-to-period variability created by stock-based compensation.Restructuring charges and fees. We incur restructuring charges, inventory impairment and other inventory related costs associated with the re-engineering of our IBC capacity, and fees related to reorganization plans and business acquisition aimed towards realigning resources consistent with our global strategy and improving its overall operating efficiency and cost structure. Restructuring charges and fees are excluded from non-GAAP gross (loss) profit, non-GAAP operating expenses and Adjusted EBITDA because they are not considered core operating activities. Although we have engaged in restructuring activities and initiatives, past activities have been discrete events based on unique sets of business objectives. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges and fees from our non-GAAP financial measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating results nor do these charges contribute to a meaningful evaluation of our past operating performance.Remeasurement loss (gain) on prepaid forward and physical delivery forward. This relates to the mark-to-market fair value remeasurement of privately negotiated prepaid forward and physical delivery transactions. The transactions were entered into in connection with the issuance on July 17, 2020 of the 6.50% Green Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 for an aggregate principal amount of $200 million. The prepaid forward is remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value booked in earnings. The fair value of the prepaid forward is primarily affected by the Company's share price. The physical delivery forward was remeasured to fair value at the end of the Note Valuation Period on September 29, 2020, and was reclassified to equity after remeasurement, and will not be subsequently remeasured. The fair value of the physical delivery forward was primarily affected by the Company's share price. The remeasurement loss (gain) on prepaid forward and physical delivery forward is excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because it is not considered core operating activities. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude the mark-to-market adjustments from our Adjusted EBITDA as it is not reflective of ongoing operating results nor do the loss contribute to a meaningful evaluation of our past operating performance.Equity in (losses) income of unconsolidated investees. This relates to the (losses) income on our unconsolidated equity investment Huansheng JV. This is excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA financial measure as it is non-cash in nature and not reflective of our core operational performance. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude such charges as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of our performance.Loss related to settlement of price escalation dispute. This relates to loss arising from the settlement of price escalation dispute with a polysilicon supplier related to our long term, firm commitment polysilicon supply agreement. This is excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA financial measure as it is non-recurring and not reflective of ongoing operating results. As such, management believes that it is appropriate to exclude such charges as the loss does not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of our past operating performance.Preliminary Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (In millions) Fiscal Q4 2023 Fiscal Q3 2023 Fiscal Q4 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 GAAP Gross (loss) profit $ (32) $ 3 $ 20 $ 80 $ (48) Stock-based compensation — — 1 1 2 Restructuring charges and fees 25(1) — — 25(2) — Loss related to settlement of price escalation dispute — — — — 15 Non-GAAP Gross (loss) profit (7) 3 21 106 (31) GAAP Operating expenses 142 67 38 298 152 Stock-based compensation (2) (5) (3) (18) (13) Restructuring charges and fees (103)(1) (24) (1) (127)(2) (5) Others(3) (1) — — — — Non-GAAP Operating expenses 36 38 34 153 134 (In millions) Fiscal Q4 2023 Fiscal Q3 2023 Fiscal Q4 2022 Fiscal Year 2023 Fiscal Year 2022 GAAP Net loss attributable to the stockholders (184) (108) (76) (274) (267) Interest expense, net 7 8 9 33 28 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (10) (3) 28 (1) 32 Depreciation 12 14 14 56 56 Amortization — — — — — Others(3) — — 1 — — EBITDA (175) (89) (24) (186) (151) Stock-based compensation 2 5 4 19 15 Loss related to settlement of price escalation dispute — — — — 15 Restructuring charges and fees 128(1) 24 1 152(2) 6 Remeasurement loss (gain) on physical delivery forward and prepaid forward 10 37 18 18 (2) Equity in losses (income) of unconsolidated investees and related gain — 2 (2) 3 9 Others(3) — 1 (1) — (1) Adjusted EBITDA (35) (20) (4) 6 (109) (1) For fiscal Q4 2023, included in the GAAP gross loss is $24 million of inventory write-down and related charges connected to the re-engineering activities of our IBC manufacturing capacity as further described below For fiscal Q4 2023, included in the GAAP operating expenses is $104 million related to cost associated with rebalancing our global operations and re-engineering of our IBC manufacturing operations.

Despite a net loss of $12.9 million for the year, Siyata is focused on aggressive sales growth and profitability in the upcoming quarters. Positive Revenue increased by 27% to $8.2 million in 2023 compared to $6.5 million in 2022. Gross margin rose by 92% over 2022. Expansion into new verticals and geographies contributed to revenue growth. Partnerships with major U.S. cellular carriers boosted market presence. SD7 PTT handsets positioned as a direct radio replacement by leading carriers. Anticipation of strong sales momentum in 2024. Net loss amounted to $12.9 million for the year. Focus on aggressive sales growth and profitability in the near future. Negative Revenue declined to $1.9 million in Q4 2023 from $2.1 million in Q4 2022. Net loss increased to $3.9 million in Q4 2023 from $6.6 million in Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $2.3 million in Q4 2023 compared to negative $5.0 million in Q4 2022. Cash balance decreased to $0.9 million in 2023 from $1.9 million in 2022. Working capital dropped to $1.3 million in 2023 from $1.6 million in 2022. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in revenue for Siyata Mobile Inc. indicates the company's successful expansion into new verticals and geographies. The 27% year-over-year growth suggests that the company's strategic focus on the Push-to-Talk over Cellular (PoC) devices and cellular signal booster systems is meeting market demand. This is particularly noteworthy given the transition from legacy Land Mobile Radio (LMR) systems to PoC solutions, highlighting a shift in industry preferences that Siyata seems to be capitalizing on.However, despite the revenue growth, the company's profitability remains a concern with a substantial net loss reported. Investors should note that while the net loss has decreased from the previous year, it is still significant. The negative Adjusted EBITDA, although improved, suggests ongoing operational challenges. The liquidity position, with a cash balance of $0.9 million, is another area for stakeholders to monitor closely, as it may impact the company's ability to sustain operations without additional financing. Financial Analyst The financial results of Siyata Mobile Inc. show both positive and negative indicators for investor consideration. The gross margin improvement of 92% over the previous year is a strong sign of cost management and pricing power. This is a key metric that could signal improved profitability in the future if the trend continues alongside revenue growth.On the flip side, the working capital decrease from $1.6 million to $1.3 million year-over-year may raise questions about the company's short-term financial health and its ability to cover short-term liabilities. Investors should weigh the potential for sales momentum in 2024 against the current financial position to assess the risk-reward profile of the company. Telecommunications Industry Analyst From an industry perspective, Siyata's emphasis on the SD7 PTT handset as a direct radio replacement is an innovative move, positioning them at the forefront of the evolving telecommunications landscape. The mention of 'stocked status' with major U.S. carriers is a testament to the product's market acceptance and could be a harbinger of increased market penetration.The strategic shift from LMR to PTT solutions aligns with broader industry trends towards digital transformation and network modernization. Siyata's focus on expanding their accessories portfolio also suggests a comprehensive approach to addressing customer needs in the telecommunications sector, which could support sustained growth if executed effectively. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM Full-year 2023 Revenue of $8.2 Million, up 27% year-over-yearCompany to host conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday April 9, 2024VANCOUVER, BC / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Siyata Mobile Inc.

Sonoco plans to contract for 140 megawatts of electricity per year, representing a significant portion of its U.S. electricity consumption, aiming to reduce emissions by 25% by 2030. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The Virtual Power Purchase Agreement between Sonoco and ENGIE signifies a strategic move within the energy sector, particularly for companies invested in sustainability. Sonoco's commitment to a 15-year term with ENGIE's Big Sampson Wind Project aligns with a growing trend where corporations are directly sourcing renewable energy to mitigate their carbon footprint. This long-term agreement for 140 megawatts annually addresses nearly half of Sonoco's U.S. electricity needs, suggesting a significant operational shift towards green energy.From an energy production perspective, ENGIE's expansion to over seven gigawatts of renewable energy in North America enhances its portfolio and competitive edge in the renewable market. This VPPA not only supports ENGIE's project viability but also showcases the company's ability to secure major clients, which can be a positive indicator for investor confidence and ENGIE's stock performance. Moreover, the construction of the Big Sampson Wind Project, with its 60 turbines, represents a substantial investment in infrastructure and job creation, which could have a ripple effect on local economies and related industries. Sustainability Analyst Sonoco's sustainability targets are ambitious, aiming for a 25% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030. The VPPA with ENGIE is a critical component of this strategy, potentially reducing Sonoco's baseline carbon emissions by an estimated 14%. This move not only enhances Sonoco's environmental credentials but also reflects a proactive approach to the evolving regulatory landscape regarding carbon emissions and climate change.Investors are increasingly valuing companies with clear sustainability goals and the means to achieve them. Sonoco's VPPA indicates a forward-thinking approach, which could improve its appeal to socially responsible investors and potentially affect its stock valuation positively. Moreover, the focus on 'Better Packaging. Better Life.' solutions may resonate with consumers who are more inclined to support brands with clear environmental commitments, potentially impacting Sonoco's market share and revenue growth. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the VPPA for Sonoco are multifaceted. Locking in electricity prices for 15 years can provide a hedge against future energy cost volatility, likely leading to more predictable operating expenses. This price stability can be attractive to investors seeking companies with controlled long-term costs. Additionally, the renewable energy credits acquired could yield financial benefits, depending on the regulatory environment and the market for such credits.However, it's important to note that the initial costs of entering a VPPA and the operational adjustments required to integrate renewable energy sources can be substantial. Investors should monitor how these expenses impact Sonoco's short-term financials, while considering the potential long-term benefits of reduced energy costs and enhanced corporate reputation. The partnership with ENGIE also ties Sonoco's performance to the successful deployment and operation of the Big Sampson Wind Project, which introduces a degree of project execution risk that should be considered. 04/08/2024 - 04:10 PM HARTSVILLE, S.C., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sonoco Products Company (“Sonoco” or the “Company”) (NYSE:SON), one of the largest global sustainable packaging companies, and ENGIE North America (“ENGIE"") today announced that they have entered into a Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (“VPPA”) for production from ENGIE’s Big Sampson Wind Project (“Big Sampson”), a wind power project currently under construction in Crockett County, Texas. Under the VPPA and subject to certain conditions, Sonoco and ENGIE have agreed to contract for an estimated 140 megawatts of electricity per year, representing approximately 48% of Sonoco’s U.S. electricity consumption in 2025 and approximately 52% of the expected output capacity of Big Sampson, for a term of 15 years commencing upon Big Sampson’s entry into commercial operation. The VPPA represents another step in Sonoco’s integrated approach to corporate sustainability. The Company aims to reduce global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline through various corporate initiatives, including improved packaging design, installing energy-efficient equipment and procuring renewable energy sources. The VPPA is an example of these efforts, with renewable energy credits acquired under the VPPA expected to help reduce Sonoco’s baseline carbon emissions by approximately 14%. “Collaborative projects like Big Sampson have the potential to help us make progress toward our emissions targets while delivering clean, reliable power to the communities they serve,” said Elizabeth Rhue, Sonoco’s Vice President of Environmental, Sustainability, & Technical Services. “We are grateful for this long-term partnership with ENGIE as we work together to protect the environment and future generations and continue our promise of delivering ‘Better Packaging. Better Life.’ solutions,” said Rhue. Big Sampson is a project of ENGIE, a global leader in the net zero energy transition. The project is currently expected to complete in late 2025 and will be an addition to ENGIE North America’s more than seven gigawatts of renewable energy production in operation or under construction across the United States and Canada. “We are honored that Sonoco selected ENGIE to support their first VPPA, reflecting their commitment to the energy transition. ENGIE’s record of consistently and reliably delivering projects to meet our customer needs is something we are very proud of,” said Dave Carroll, Chief Renewables Officer, ENGIE North America. “The commitment of customers like Sonoco enables the acceleration of projects that underpin the pathway to a net zero future.” The Big Sampson Wind Project is designed to consist of 60 wind turbines, each expected to have a generating capacity of 4.5 megawatts. The project will employ roughly 400 skilled construction professionals and once operational, about 10 to 15 full-time professionals will support the system on-site. In addition to jobs, Big Sampson is expected to provide long-term tax revenues for both Crocket County and local school districts of more than $60 million over the 15-year life of the project. About Sonoco Products Company With net sales of approximately $6.8 billion in 2023, the Company has approximately 23,000 employees working in more than 300 operations around the world, serving some of the world’s best-known brands.

The contribution increases funds available per share by $0.032, funded as a non-interest bearing loan. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The deposit by Water On Demand Inc. into Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation's trust account represents a strategic financial move aimed at providing FRLA with additional time to secure an initial business combination. This extension underscores the company's ongoing efforts to identify a suitable merger or acquisition target, which is a critical phase for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) such as FRLA. The financial implications of such an extension are two-fold: it reassures investors of the company's commitment to finding a valuable business combination, while also marginally increasing the pro rata funds available to stockholders in the event of a successful merger or liquidation.From an investment standpoint, the increase in trust account funds, although slight, could be perceived positively by the market as it enhances the potential payout to investors. However, it's also important to note that this is a non-interest bearing loan, which will need to be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination or during liquidation, potentially impacting the overall financial structure of the deal. Investors should monitor the company's progress closely, as repeated extensions could indicate difficulties in finalizing a business combination, which may affect investor confidence and the stock's performance in the long-term. Mergers and Acquisitions Expert The additional one-month extension granted to FRLA to complete its initial business combination is a common maneuver within the SPAC landscape, designed to provide more time for due diligence and negotiation with potential target companies. The fact that this is the sixth extension out of a possible twelve signals a prolonged search for the right business combination, which can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it demonstrates prudence and selectiveness, which is beneficial for ensuring a quality merger that aligns with the company's strategic goals. On the other hand, it could raise concerns about the availability of suitable targets or the SPAC's ability to close a deal.For stakeholders, the key issue to consider is the alignment of the potential business combination with FRLA's mission to build 'the next great technology company.' The extended timeline should allow for a more thorough vetting process, potentially leading to a more synergetic and value-adding acquisition. However, stakeholders should remain aware of the risks associated with extended searches, including market changes and target company dynamics that could affect the desirability and feasibility of a future deal. Market Research Analyst The announcement by FRLA provides insight into the company's strategic direction and operational tempo. Extending the deadline for an initial business combination can have a ripple effect on investor sentiment, as it may be interpreted as both a sign of careful selection or a lack of viable candidates. The incremental increase in trust account funds per share also plays a role in shaping market expectations, as it slightly raises the economic stakes of the eventual business combination for shareholders.It is essential to evaluate the broader market context in which FRLA operates. The technology sector is rapidly evolving, with high competition for mergers and acquisitions. FRLA's commitment to generating 'significant shareholder value' will be measured against industry benchmarks and peer performance. Investors should consider the potential for innovative technology offerings that FRLA might bring to the market post-merger and the company's capacity to integrate and scale its business operations effectively. The additional time granted by this extension could be pivotal in ensuring that the chosen business combination can withstand market pressures and contribute to long-term growth. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM CLEARWATER, FL / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation (Nasdaq:FRLA) (""FRLA"" or the ""Company"") today announced that Water On Demand Inc., a privately-held subsidiary of OriginClear, Inc. (OTC Other:OCLN) (""OCLN"") and owner of its sponsor, Fortune Rise Sponsor LLC (the ""Sponsor""), has deposited the required $100,000 (representing an additional $0.032 per public share) into the Company's trust account for the benefit of its valued public stockholders which provides a one-month extension to complete the Company's initial business combination. This additional contribution extends the date by which the Company has to complete its initial business combination for an additional one-month extension from April 5, 2024 to May 5, 2024. The extension is the sixth of the twelve one-month extensions permitted under the Company's governing documents, as amended in October 2023.Such contribution effectively increases the pro rata portion of the funds available in the Company's trust account in the event of the consummation of an initial business combination, liquidation, or other redemption event, by $0.032 per share. The contribution was funded as a non-interest bearing loan that will either be paid upon earlier of consummation of an initial business combination or the Company's liquidation.Ryan Spick, CFO of FRLA, stated, ""OriginClear's subsidiary, Water On Demand, Inc., which owns the Sponsor, has made the required deposit for the benefit of the stockholders of Fortune Rise Acquisition Corporation which provides a one-month extension to complete our initial business combination. These funds provide for an additional one-month extension which gives us additional time to advance our business combination efforts.

About Opthea Opthea (ASX/NASDAQ:OPT) is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies to address the unmet need in the treatment of highly prevalent and progressive retinal diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and diabetic macular edema (DME). Opthea’s lead product candidate, sozinibercept, is being evaluated in two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials (COAST, NCT04757636, and ShORe, NCT04757610) for use in combination with standard-of-care anti-VEGF-A monotherapies to improve overall efficacy and deliver superior vision gains compared to standard-of-care anti-VEGF-A agents. To learn more, visit our website and follow us on X and LinkedIn. EYLEA® is a registered trademark of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Inherent risks of Investment in Biotechnology Companies There are a number of inherent risks associated with the development of pharmaceutical products to a marketable stage. The lengthy clinical trial process is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a drug prior to commercialization and a significant proportion of drugs fail one or both of these criteria. Other risks include uncertainty of patent protection and proprietary rights, whether patent applications and issued patents will offer adequate protection to enable product development, the obtaining of necessary drug regulatory authority approvals and difficulties caused by the rapid advancements in technology. Companies such as Opthea are dependent on the success of their research and development projects and on the ability to attract funding to support these activities. Investment in research and development projects cannot be assessed on the same fundamentals as trading and manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, investment in companies specializing in drug development must be regarded as highly speculative. Opthea strongly recommends that professional investment advice be sought prior to such investments.

The company plans phase 3 trials, seeks partnerships, and faces financial challenges. Positive Successful development of clinical programs despite tough financial environment Confirmation of BIO101's therapeutic value in severe COVID-19 cases Authorization for phase 3 SARA-31 trial in sarcopenia in the US and Belgium Initiation of phase 2 program in obesity to assess BIO101's efficacy Partnership search for phase 3 studies funding and market authorization Positive results in COVA trial for COVID-19 treatment with good safety profile Setting up industrial partnerships for commercial-scale production of BIO101 Reactivation of early access program in Brazil and Europe Presentation of MYODA program results in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Financial figures show a decrease in cash position and potential funding challenges Negative Cash position decreased by €5.5 million from 2022 to 2023 Available cash may not be sufficient to support operating plan for the next 12 months Financial Analyst The financial results of Biophytis SA reflect a challenging year with a notable decrease in cash and cash equivalents from €11.1 million to €5.6 million. The net decrease of €5.5 million is a critical factor for investors, as it indicates the rate at which the company is burning through its capital to fund operations. The cash used in operating activities, amounting to €12.6 million, despite being offset by fundraising and convertible bond issues, signals a high cash burn rate relative to the company's ability to raise new capital. This situation is commonly observed in clinical-stage biotech companies, where substantial investment is required to progress through the drug development pipeline. The uncertainty around the company's ability to support its operating plan for the next 12 months, as indicated by the report, is a red flag for potential liquidity risks, which could impact the company's stock valuation and investor confidence. Medical Research Analyst The clinical progress of Biophytis SA's lead drug candidate, BIO101, is a significant milestone for the company and the biotech industry. The positive results in the COVA programme for treating severe COVID-19 and the potential to expand its use to other viral SARI is promising, as it opens up new market opportunities. The initiation of a phase 3 trial in sarcopenia, a condition with a high unmet medical need among the elderly, could position Biophytis as a pioneer in this space. Moreover, the exploration of BIO101's efficacy in obesity represents a strategic move to tap into a fast-growing market. These developments have the potential to drive long-term value for shareholders, but they are also contingent on successful clinical outcomes, regulatory approvals and securing sufficient financial resources to complete the trials. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnerships and expansion into industrial-scale production with Seqens and Skyepharma indicate Biophytis SA's commitment to advancing BIO101 towards commercialization. The collaboration with the University of Liège to explore further applications of BIO101 in treating respiratory failure caused by influenza showcases the company's proactive approach in diversifying the drug's potential uses. These moves could significantly broaden the target market for BIO101 and enhance the company's competitive edge. However, the actual market potential will depend on the drug's clinical efficacy, safety profile and the company's ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, which includes obtaining early access authorization in various regions. The forecasted growth of the obesity market to over $100 billion by 2030 presents a lucrative opportunity, but the company's success in this domain will rely on its strategic positioning and the outcomes of the upcoming phase 2 trials. 04/08/2024 - 06:20 PM PARIS, FRANCE and CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Biophytis SA (Nasdaq CM:BPTS, Euronext Growth Paris:ALBPS), (""Biophytis"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics for age-related diseases, publishes today its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, and provides an update on the progress of its various programmes.""In 2023, despite a particularly difficult financial environment for the biotech sector, we succeeded in pursuing the development of our clinical programmes, while securing the company's financing until early 2025,"" states Stanislas Veillet, CEO of Biophytis. ""We were able to confirm the therapeutic value of BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone), our lead drug candidate, in the treatment of patients suffering from severe forms of COVID-19, opening the door to wider use in viral Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI). We have also obtained authorization to initiate a phase 3 SARA-31 trial in the United States and Belgium in sarcopenia, a disease that is still poorly understood but very common among the elderly and currently untreated. We are actively seeking global or regional pharmaceutical company partners to co-finance the phase 3 studies required to file a marketing authorization and to market BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) in these two indications.Finally, we are starting a new phase 2 clinical development programme in obesity to assess the efficacy of BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) in maintaining muscle function in obese patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists.

On this basis, Biophytis plans to start a phase 1/2 clinical trial in 2024, depending on its financial resources.Key 2023 financial figuresThe figures presented below and in appendices have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards and were approved by the Board of Directors on 8 April 2024.Cash positionConsolidated cash and cash equivalents were €5.6 million at December 31, 2023, compared with €11.1 million at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of €5.5 million. Cash used in operating activities amounted to €12.6 million, and was partially offset by new cash injections, in the form of fundraising or convertible bond issues, totalling almost €8 million.Taking into account the possibility of additional drawings on its ORNANE financing line, and on the basis of its financing plan, at the date of filing of the annual report on Form 20-F and the Annual Financial Report, the Company's available cash and cash equivalents should not be sufficient to support its operating plan for at least the next 12 months. There is therefore significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue its business activities.On the basis of its current operations and its plans and assumptions, the Company believes that it will be able to finance its activities until the first quarter of 2025.Consolidated results 2022 2023 (Amounts in thousands of euros, except share and per share data) 12 months 12 months Revenues - - Cost of sales - - Gross margin - - Research and development expenses, net (16,034) (8,845)General and administrative expenses (7,237) (5,488)Operating loss (23,272) (14,333) Financial expenses (2,564) (1,633)Financial income 983 269 Change in fair value of derivative liabilities and convertible bonds 637 (1,330)Net financial expense (944) (2,694) Loss before taxes (24,216) (17,026) Income taxes benefit - - Net loss (24,216) (17,026)Operating expenses have fallen sharply between 2022 and 2023, as a result of:A significant reduction in R&D expenditure linked to the completion of clinical trials for the COVA and SARA programmes. Residual costs relating to clinical development were booked in 2023, but the bulk of R&D expenditure concerned pre-clinical work and operations relating to the production of BIO101.The fall in staff costs was mainly due to the valuation of instruments giving access to capital, while the Company's headcount remained stable.The change in the financial result is essentially due to the revaluation of financial debts in accordance with IFRS 9.As a result of the above, the annual loss has been significantly reduced, from €24.2 million at December 31, 2022 to €17 million at December 31, 2023.****About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 05:51 PM Join L.A. Care Health Plan prior donation to become top donors to We Are LA program LOS ANGELES, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Recognizing the importance of preventing evictions in overcoming Los Angeles's homelessness crisis, The Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation has donated $1.5 million and Health Net $1.3 million to support the Mayor's Fund for Los Angeles' We Are LA program. We Are LA connects people at risk of eviction to every resource available to them to help them maintain stable housing. The two organizations join L.A. Care Health Plan, which made previous investments totaling $1.8 million, as the program's biggest donors. L.A. Care's early support was critical for getting the We Are LA program off the ground and establishing its success. ""We must bring unhoused Angelenos inside while doing all that we can to prevent people from falling into homelessness in the first place, and that means local government partnering with businesses and philanthropists across the city to confront this crisis,"" said Mayor Karen Bass. ""Earlier this year, L.A. Care Health Plan made a generous donation to the Mayor's Fund for this important effort and now I want to commend The Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation and Health Net for taking this courageous step and joining this effort. This is not a fight we will win if private philanthropy does not lock arms with us in this effort to provide the life-saving resources that Angelenos deserve. Thank you to our philanthropic partners for locking arms and partnering with us to confront the greatest challenge facing our city."" We Are LA has reached out to over 411,000 at-risk Angelenos, including targeted outreach to people who have received notices of intended eviction. We Are LA also operates a hotline and organizes tenant resource clinics to help reach anyone who fears they may lose their home. Once the team connects with a person who wants help, caseworkers assess all of the resources available to that individual and help them navigate the bureaucracy of applying for government and charitable programs. The program has served over 32,000 individuals and families to help them avoid eviction and stay housed. The Mayor's Fund has also recently formed a partnership with U.S. VETS to help service veterans in Los Angeles and is beginning new programs to directly serve vulnerable populations, like former foster youth. ""The Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation is proud to support Mayor Karen Bass' emergency homelessness plan with We Are LA and their efforts to reach out to hundreds of thousands of Angelenos facing the threat of eviction and connecting them to services and support,"" said Linda Hope, Chair and CEO of the Bob & Dolores Hope Foundation. ""In addition, the Mayor's Fund and We Are LA also help ensure that any veteran who asks for help will not end up on the streets. My mom and dad always had a heartfelt devotion and concern for those individuals who have and continue to serve our country. They believed that prevention was an intricate step in any effort to help those at risk, and their foundation was created, in part, with the hope of meeting the needs of all those individuals."" Since its creation more than eight months ago, We Are LA has engaged with more than 411,000 Angelenos wanting help stabilizing their housing situations. It has connected them to programs like Medi-Cal, CalFresh and earned income tax credits to help stretch their dollars further, in addition to recruiting more than 350 pro bono attorneys to provide legal information and defense. ""Housing is a critical key to health, with research showing that housing stability, quality, safety and affordability all affect our physical and mental health outcomes. Moreover, homelessness significantly undermines preventive health measures and exacerbates existing health issues,"" said Martha Santana-Chin, President of Medi-Cal and Medicare at Health Net. ""We are proud to support the important work of We Are LA, which is creating tangible impacts in the lives of thousands of deserving Angelenos. We will continue to invest in the communities we serve, aiming to transform the health of Californians, one person at a time."" These donations will allow the Mayor's Fund to continue and expand the important work of the We Are LA program. ""There were nearly 6,000 notices of eviction filed in March alone,"" said Conway Collis, President and CEO of the Mayor's Fund. ""These are life-saving gifts that will help us prevent thousands of Angelenos – including many families and children – from falling into homelessness. Mayor Bass and her team are doing enormously effective work in moving people into shelter and permanent housing with needed services, but to address this crisis we also have to prevent Angelenos from becoming homeless in the first place. These generous gifts will help us do exactly that."" About The Mayor's Fund for Los AngelesThe Mayor's Fund for Los Angeles is an independent 501(c)(3) which brings together business, philanthropy, the nonprofit sector, and local government to address the most urgent needs of all Angelenos. The Mayor's Fund is operating and supporting programs to help prevent Angelenos from falling into homelessness through outreach, case management and expanded legal services.

Active pipeline of acquisition opportunities in the pet health sector. Cost reduction measures in place for operational efficiency. Anticipated SG&A savings of $1 million by end of 2024. Successful acquisition of Valley Veterinary Service in Pennsylvania. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported 70% year-over-year revenue growth for Inspire Veterinary Partners, Inc. is a significant indicator of the company's expansion and market penetration, particularly in the context of the pet health sector. This sector is known for its resilience and has been growing steadily, driven by an increase in pet ownership and spending on pet health and wellness. Inspire's focus on acquisitions, as highlighted by the recent purchase of Valley Veterinary Service, demonstrates an aggressive growth strategy that can capitalize on this trend.From a financial perspective, the company's initiative to reduce SG&A expenses by at least $1 million is a proactive move to enhance profitability. Investors often scrutinize SG&A as a measure of a company's operational efficiency. The savings are expected to be fully realized by the end of 2024, which could lead to improved margins and potentially higher earnings. However, it's important to monitor whether these cost reductions will affect the quality of service or employee morale. Market Research Analyst When assessing the pet health care industry, it's clear that Inspire Veterinary Partners is positioning itself to meet the growing demand for high-quality pet care services. The company's strategy of acquiring and integrating new facilities, such as Valley Veterinary Service, can be seen as a move to expand its geographical footprint and service offerings. This could potentially increase the company's market share and brand recognition.However, the success of such acquisitions hinges on seamless integration and maintaining the high level of care that clients expect. It's also vital to consider the competitive landscape, as other players may also be pursuing similar growth strategies. The company's focus on keeping clients and pets at the center of its mission is commendable and may contribute to customer loyalty and repeat business, which are important factors for sustainable growth. Veterinary Industry Expert The pet health sector is not just growing; it's evolving with a greater emphasis on convenience and quality of care. Inspire Veterinary Partners' emphasis on these aspects, as evidenced by their mission statement and recent acquisition, suggests an understanding of the market's direction. The integration of new acquisitions, such as Valley Veterinary Service, is a critical step for Inspire to ensure that it maintains its reputation for quality care while expanding its reach.Additionally, the company's focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction initiatives could allow it to invest more in advanced medical technologies and staff training. This could enhance the overall customer experience and patient care, which is essential in an industry where trust and service quality are paramount. On the flip side, there is always the risk that cost-cutting measures could lead to understaffing or reduced service quality if not managed carefully. 04/08/2024 - 05:30 PM Full year 2023 revenue increases approximately 70% year-over-year to $16.7 millionOutlook for growth in the pet health sector remains attractive with active pipeline of acquisition opportunitiesImplemented cost reduction initiatives to maximize operational efficiency to deliver profitable growthMajor reduction of consultant fees and other discretionary expenses post IPOSG&A savings of at least $1 million expected to be fully embedded by end of 2024VIRGINIA BEACH, VA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Inspire Veterinary Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq:IVP) (""Inspire"" or the ""Company""), an owner and provider of pet health care services throughout the U.S., today reported financial results for its full year ended December 31, 2023.""We are pleased to report strong year end 2023 top-line results as a newly public company with revenue growing 70 percent year-over-year, driven by acquisitions made during the past 12 months and organic revenue growth"" said Kimball Carr, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of Inspire. ""We enter 2024 as a stronger company in a category that remains resilient and growing; and our experienced and dedicated team is executing to deliver purpose driven performance. Keeping our clients and pets at the center of everything we do is core to our mission of becoming a trusted destination for pet parents seeking high-quality and convenient pet health and wellness. Our acquisition of Valley Veterinary Service animal hospital, our first facility in the state of Pennsylvania, closed in the fourth quarter. The Valley team has done an incredible job integrating with our Inspire team while continuing to provide the highest level of care to its clients and pets. We're excited about our opportunities to fuel growth with our existing base of business and believe that the pipeline of attractive animal hospital acquisition candidates in both existing and new states remains active.""Carr, continued, ""Over the past few years, we have invested in building a talented leadership and field team, adding technology that enhances the organizations integration and capabilities, and strengthening the infrastructure required to support our expanding family of animal hospitals as we continue to execute our growth strategy. Notably in 2023, we transitioned all hospitals to unified financial reporting systems aimed at enhancing speed of monthly reporting and maintaining our compliance with audit and regulatory requirements. We also launched enterprise-wide metric measurement systems which give us granular analysis of KPIs in each of our locations. This allows our field leader teams to coach each day, celebrating wins as our hospitals grow and the creation of detailed plans for the improvement of each lever which drives our business. Also completed in 2023, was the migration of every Inspire location to one practice management system which allows cloud-based oversight of patient records, client schedules, financial data and treatment plans for each pet under our care. Moving the Inspire portfolio to one ‘PIMs' provides a unified set of behaviors at hospital level, creating a consistency for coaching by our field leaders and allows our medical teams to provide case guidance whether on site or thousands of miles away. As we continue to advance in 2024, the work completed in 2023 means much of the organizational infrastructure is in place and should allow us to scale the business while adding only a modest amount of operating expense in the years ahead. On this front, 2023 was a standout year for bringing processes in house based on several changes implemented which were both cost-favorable to the company while bringing additional efficiency. We remain committed to redefining the industry through our differentiated offering and demonstrating the attractiveness of our operational strategy powered by a very passionate team in veterinary care. Looking ahead, we are focused on what is within our control and capitalizing on the secular trends of the resilient pet category to drive long-term, profitable growth. Toward that aim, we remain committed and focused on growth, business fundamentals and taking excellent care of team and pets as a means to bring value to our shareholders.""""In fiscal year 2023, we delivered solid top line results,"" said Inspire CFO Richard Frank. ""While we are pleased with this growth, since our IPO, we have heightened our focus on execution, operational excellence, and improved efficiencies while we continue our strategy to grow revenues in existing animal hospitals and through acquisitions. We believe the implementation of numerous operational efficiency measures will improve organizational integration, accountability and efficiency, and drive meaningful margin improvement in both the near and the long term, which should set Inspire on a trajectory to achieve stronger, more predictable results and value creation for all stakeholders.""Recent Business Highlights Since IPOAdded three veteran leaders to further strengthen its medical, operational and financial expertise in support of its future growth and development: Dr. Chuck Dunn, as Director of Medical Operations; Kimberly King as Director of Field Operations; and Debbe Bastian, Finance Controller.Completed the acquisition of Valley Veterinary Service, Inc. animal hospital located in Pennsylvania, Inspire's first entry in that state. Valley Veterinary Service's 2022 gross revenues were in excess of $1.7 million.Opened newly located Family Pet Care animal hospital in Lakeside Town Center, Sugarland, Texas, designed to enhance customer service and improve staff support. Custom-built animal hospital, centered around the needs of IVP's care team and clients, represents the first of a new model of state-of-the-art companion animal hospitals Inspire expects to replicate as it expands existing and new clinics throughout the U.S.Introduced new benefit for its employees with BetterHelp.com, a provider of professional, affordable, and personalized therapy in a convenient online format. Starting April 1, 2024, all Inspire team members will have access to convenient and professional therapy online.Full Year 2023Total revenue was $16.7 million for the twelve months of 2023, an increase of 70% compared to total revenue of $9.8 million in the prior year period, driven by an increase in sales in both Service and Product revenue which were significantly positively impacted by acquisitions. Service revenue for the twelve months of 2023 increased 69% to $11.9 million primarily driven by acquisitions of animal hospitals and clinics accumulated since the prior year period and increasing the prices of our services throughout our clinics and animal hospitals that resulted in organic growth in 9 of 14 animal hospitals and clinics increasing daily service revenue from the year prior, and the addition to the Valley Veterinary Service acquisition in November 2023. Product revenue of $4.8 million increased 71% compared to the prior year period driven primarily by acquisitions of animal hospitals and clinics in 2023, price increases, and the acquisition of Valley Veterinary Service.General and administrative expenses were $9.5 million for the first twelve months of 2023 compared to $5.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to the Company's initial public offering (IPO) and Nasdaq listing in August 2023, the additional cost of being a public company, and higher wages and third-party costs due to inflationary pressures.Net loss was $14.8 million for the first twelve months of 2023 compared to a net loss of $4.9 million for the prior year period. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the additional operating expenses, the non-cash beneficial conversion feature of $4.1 million on the convertible debenture and series A preferred stock recognized upon the completion of the IPO and the costs associated with the Company's acquisition of Valley Veterinary Service. Additionally, the Company incurred costs associated with its IPO and increased costs associated with being a public company.Balance SheetAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.2 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2023, the Company announced on February 13, 2024, it had completed a public offering of shares of Class A common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million, prior to deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company.About Inspire Veterinary Partners, Inc.Inspire Veterinary Partners is an owner/operator of veterinary hospitals in the US.

(the ""Company"" or ""GSilver"") (TSXV:GSVR)(AQUIS:GSVR)(OTCQX:GSVRF) is pleased to announce selected financial information and consolidated production results for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Management's Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") thereon can be viewed under the Company's profile at www.sedarplus.com. All dollar amounts are in US dollars (US$) and prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Production results are from the Company's wholly owned El Cubo Mines Complex (""El Cubo""), Valenciana Mines Complex (VMC), and San Ignacio Mine (""San Ignacio"") located in Guanajuato, Mexico, and the Topia Mine (""Topia"") located in Durango, Mexico.Selected 2023 Highlights:Record production for 2023 of 3.5 million silver-equivalent ounces (""AgEq"") representing a 64% increase over 2022; total AgEq ounces are derived from 1,756,911 ounces of silver, 16,987 ounces of gold, 3,555,466 pounds of lead and 3,868,262 pounds of zinc. (See note to table below for assumptions regarding the Company's AgEq calculations).Silver production of over 1.7 million ounces is a 74% increase over 2022; Guanajuato Silver is a primary silver producer; approximately 52% of revenues were derived from silver production in 2023, and approximately 40% of revenue came from gold.Record lead and zinc production of 3.5M pounds and 3.8M pounds respectively; zinc production demonstrated a 100% increase over 2022, while lead production was 164% higher over the same period. All lead and zinc production comes exclusively from the Company's Topia mine located in northwest Durango.2023 saw average silver recoveries of 84.5% and average gold recoveries of 88.8%.Total tonnes mined was up 46% over 2022, reflecting the continued ramp-up of production at all four producing silver mines; total tonnes milled was up 42% over same period.Record revenue for 2023 of $66.1M representing a 79% increase over 2022; consolidated revenue for the year was generated by a realized average price of $23.41 per silver ounce, $1,947 per gold ounce, $0.97 per pound of lead, and $1.22 per pound of zinc.James Anderson, Chairman and CEO said, ""We have successfully navigated through a particularly challenging year for the junior mining industry; we emerge from this period with vastly improved assets in terms of production efficiency, scale, and economics. All four of our producing silver mines were the beneficiaries of major capex investments in 2022; these adjustments and upgrades are already positively impacting performance as we continue to build Guanajuato Silver into a mid-tier precious metals producer.""Selected 2023 Financial Highlights:Cash costs of $18.22 per AgEq ounce, and AISC(5) of $22.91 per AgEq ounce reflected higher capital expenditures during the year as the Company made significant investments designed to improve efficiencies across all operations. (See note to table below for assumptions regarding the Company's AgEq calculations).Over 45% of the 2023 net loss of $31.9M is comprised of non-cash items(8).As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,956,616 and negative working capital(5) of $18,441,913 compared with cash of $8,832,936 and negative working capital(5) of $5,972,704 as of December 31, 2021.Consolidated Annual Production Please refer to footnote 1 under the table below for the assumptions on the AqEq calculations.The following table summarizes the Company's consolidated operating and financial results for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022: Silver equivalents set out in this news release are calculated using 82.91:1 (Ag/Au), 0.04:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.05:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for YTD 2023 and an 83.22:1 (Ag/Au), 0.05:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.07:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for YTD 2022, respectively. Silver equivalents for 2021 are calculated using 80:1 (Ag/Au) for Q4 2021.Cash cost per silver equivalent ounce include mining, processing, and direct overhead.AlSC per Ag/Eq oz include mining, processing, direct overhead, corporate general and administration expenses, on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital.See Reconciliation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization on page 29 of the MD&A and below in this news release.Mine Operating Cashflow Before Taxes, Cash cost per silver equivalent, cost per tonne, AISC per Ag/Eq ounce, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and working capital are non-IFRS financial measure with no standardized meaning under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For further information and detailed reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures see ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below in this news release.Based on provisional sales before final price adjustments, before payable metal deductions, treatment, and refining charges.Mine operating cash flow before taxes is calculated by adding back depreciation, depletion, and inventory write-downs to mine operating loss.Non-cash items include depreciation, stock-based compensation, loss or gain on derivatives, change of fair value on contingent payments and unrealized FX.About Guanajuato SilverGSilver is a precious metals producer engaged in reactivating past producing silver and gold mines in central Mexico.

These assumptions include: our estimates of mineralized material at El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio and Topia and the assumptions upon which they are based, including geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results and metallurgical performance; available tonnage of mineralized material to be mined and processed; resource grades and recoveries; assumptions and discount rates being appropriately applied to production estimates; the ability of the Company to ramp up processing of mineralized material at its processing plants at the projected rates and source sufficient high grade mineralized material to fill such processing capacity; prices for silver, gold and other metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; availability of funds for the Company's projects and to satisfy current liabilities and obligations including debt repayments; capital cost estimates; decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation) and inflation rates remaining as estimated; no labour-related disruptions; no unplanned delays or interruptions in scheduled construction and production; all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals are received in a timely manner; and the ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements and information are neither promises nor guarantees, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause future results, level of activity, production levels, performance or achievements of GSilver to differ materially from those expected including, but not limited to, market conditions, availability of financing, future prices of gold, silver and other metals, currency rate fluctuations, rising inflation and interest rates, actual results of production, exploration and development activities, actual resource grades and recoveries of silver, gold and other metals, availability of third party mineralized material for processing, unanticipated geological or structural formations and characteristics, geopolitical conflicts including wars, environmental risks, operating risks, accidents, labor issues, equipment or personnel delays, delays in obtaining governmental or regulatory approvals and permits, inadequate insurance, and other risks in the mining industry. There are no assurances that GSilver will be able to successfully discover and mine sufficient quantities of high grade mineralized material at El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio and Topia for processing at its existing mills to increase production, tonnage milled and recoveries rates of gold, silver, and other metals in the amounts, grades, recoveries, costs and timetable anticipated. In addition, GSilver's decision to process mineralized material from El Cubo, VMC, San Ignacio, Topia and its other mines is not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and therefore is subject to increased uncertainty and risk of failure, both economically and technically. Mineral resources and mineralized material that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them, and may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, and other relevant issues. There are no assurances that the Company's projected production of silver, gold and other metals will be realized. In addition, there are no assurances that the Company will meet its production forecasts or generate the anticipated cash flows from operations to satisfy its scheduled debt payments or other liabilities when due or meet financial covenants to which the Company is subject or to fund its exploration programs and corporate initiatives as planned. There is also uncertainty about the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19, the ongoing war in Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflict, inflation and rising interest rates and the impact they will have on the Company's operations, supply chains, ability to access mining projects or procure equipment, supplies, contractors and other personnel on a timely basis or at all and economic activity in general. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. All forward-looking statements and information made in this news release are qualified by these cautionary statements and those in our continuous disclosure filings available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com including the Company's most recently filed annual information form. These forward-looking statements and information are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances save as required by law.NON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURESThe Company has disclosed certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios in this news release as discussed below. These non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios are widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance and are used by Management to monitor and evaluate the Company's operating performance and ability to generate cash. The Company believes that, in addition to financial measures and ratios prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios to evaluate the Company's performance. However, the measures do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other companies. Accordingly, non-IFRS financial measures and non-IFRS ratios should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures and ratios of the Company's performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.Non-IFRS financial measures are defined in National Instrument 52-112 - Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure (""NI 52-122"") as a financial measure disclosed that (a) depicts the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow of an entity, (b) with respect to its composition, excludes an amount that is included in, or includes an amount that is excluded from, the composition of the most directly comparable financial measure disclosed in the primary financial statements of the entity, (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements of the entity, and (d) is not a ration, fraction, percentage or similar representation.A non-IFRS ratio is defined by NI 52-112 as a financial measure disclosed that (a) is in the form of a ratio, fraction, percentage, or similar representation, (b) has a non-IFRS financial measure as one or more of its components, and (c) is not disclosed in the financial statements.WORKING CAPITALWorking capital is a non-IFRS measure that is a common measure of liquidity but does not have any standardized meaning. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is current assets net of current liabilities. Working capital is calculated by deducting current liabilities from current assets. Working capital should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute from measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the Company's liquidity. MINE OPERATING CASH FLOW BEFORE TAXESMine operating cash flow before taxes is a non-IFRS measure that does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Mine operating cash flow is calculated as revenue minus production costs, transportation and selling costs and inventory changes. Mine operating cash flow is used by management to assess the performance of the mine operations, excluding corporate and exploration activities, and is provided to investors as a measure of the Company's operating performance. EBITDAEBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure, which excludes the following from net earnings:Income tax expense;Finance costs;Amortization and depletion.Adjusted EBITDA excludes the following additional items from EBITDA:Share based compensation;Non-recurring impairments (reversals);Loss (gain) on derivative;Significant other non-routine finance items.Adjusted EBITDA per share is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.Management believes EBITDA is a valuable indicator of the Company's ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations, and fund capital expenditures. Management uses EBITDA for this purpose. EBITDA is also frequently used by investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby EBITDA is multiplied by a factor or ""EBITDA multiple"" based on an observed or inferred relationship between EBITDA and market values to determine the approximate total enterprise value of a Company. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results because it is consistent with the indicators management uses internally to measure the Company's performance, and is an indicator of the performance of the Company's mining operations.EBITDA is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts. It does not have any standardized definition under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of operating performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined by IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently. Cash Cost per Ag/Eq Ounce, All-In Sustaining Cost per Ag/Eq Ounce and Production Cost per TonneCash costs per silver equivalent oz and production costs per tonne are measures developed by precious metals companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard; however, there can be no assurance that the Company's reporting of these non-IFRS measures and ratios are similar to those reported by other mining companies. Cash costs per silver equivalent ounce and total production cost per tonne are non-IFRS performance measures used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance at its operating mining unit, in conjunction with the related IFRS amounts. They are widely reported in the silver mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning and are disclosed in addition to IFRS measures. Production costs include mining, milling, and direct overhead at the operation sites. Cash costs include all direct costs plus royalties and special mining duty. Total production costs include all cash costs plus amortization and depletion, changes in amortization and depletion in finished goods inventory and site share-based compensation. Cash costs per silver equivalent ounce is calculated by dividing cash costs and total production costs by the payable silver ounces produced. Production costs per tonne are calculated by dividing production costs by the number of processed tonnes. The following tables provide a detailed reconciliation of these measures to the Company's direct production costs, as reported in its consolidated financial statements.All-in Sustaining Costs (""AISC"") is a non-IFRS performance measure and was calculated based on guidance provided by the World Gold Council (""WGC""). WGC is not a regulatory industry organization and does not have the authority to develop accounting standards for disclosure requirements. Other mining companies may calculate AISC differently as a result of differences in underlying accounting principles and policies applied, as well as differences in definitions of sustaining capital expenditures. AISC is a more comprehensive measure than cash cost per ounce and is useful for investors and management to assess the Company's operating performance by providing greater visibility, comparability and representation of the total costs associated with producing silver from its current operations, in conjunction with related IFRS amounts. AISC helps investors to assess costs against peers in the industry and help management assess the performance of its mine.AISC includes total production costs (IFRS measure) incurred at the Company's mining operation, which forms the basis of the Company's total cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate general and administrative expense, operating lease payments and reclamation cost accretion. The Company believes this measure represents the total sustainable costs of producing silver and gold concentrate from current operations and provides additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. As the measure seeks to reflect the full cost of silver and gold concentrate production from current operations, new projects capital at current operation is not included. Certain other cash expenditures, including share-based payments, tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also not included.The following tables provide detailed reconciliations of these measures to cost of sales, as reported in notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. Silver equivalents are calculated using an 85.10:1 (Ag/Au), 0.04:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.05:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for Q4 2023, and an 81.35:1 (Ag/Au), 0.05:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.06:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for Q4 2022, respectivelyCash cost per silver equivalent ounce include mining, processing, and direct overhead.AlSC per oz include mining, processing, direct overhead, corporate general and administration expenses, on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital.Production costs include mining, milling, and direct overhead at the operation sites.Consolidated amount for the three months ended December 31, 2023, excludes $3,986 in relation to silver bullion transportation and selling cost from cost of sales. Silver equivalents are calculated using an 82.91:1 (Ag/Au), 0.04:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.05:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for YTD 2023 and an 82:78:1 (Ag/Au), 0.05:1 (Ag/Pb) and 0.07:1 (Ag/Zn) ratio for YTD 2022.Cash cost per silver equivalent ounce include mining, processing, and direct overhead.AlSC per oz include mining, processing, direct overhead, corporate general and administration expenses, on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital.Production costs include mining, milling, and direct overhead at the operation sites.Consolidated amount excludes $89,108 in relation to silver bullion transportation and selling cost from cost of sales.SOURCE: Guanajuato Silver Company Ltd.View the original press release on accesswire.com What was Guanajuato Silver Company 's (GSVRF) record production for 2023?

About Atlas Energy Solutions Atlas Energy Solutions Inc. is a leading proppant producer and proppant logistics provider, serving primarily the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. We operate 12 proppant production facilities across the Permian Basin with a combined annual production capacity of 28 million tons, including both large-scale in-basin facilities and smaller distributed mining units. We manage a portfolio of leading-edge logistics assets, which includes our 42-mile Dune Express conveyor system, which is currently under construction and is scheduled to come online in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition to our conveyor infrastructure, we manage a fleet of 120 trucks, which are capable of delivering expanded payloads due to our custom-manufactured trailers and patented drop-depot process. Our approach to managing both our proppant production and proppant logistics operations is intently focused on leveraging technology, automation and remote operations to drive efficiencies. We are a low-cost producer of various high-quality, locally sourced proppants used during the well completion process. We offer both dry and damp sand, and carry various mesh sizes including 100 mesh and 40/70 mesh. Proppant is a key component necessary to facilitate the recovery of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. Our logistics platform is designed to increase the efficiency, safety and sustainability of the oil and natural gas industry within the Permian Basin. Proppant logistics is increasingly a differentiating factor affecting customer choice among proppant producers. The cost of delivering sand, even short distances, can be a significant component of customer spending on their well completions given the substantial volumes that are utilized in modern well designs. We continue to invest in and pursue leading-edge technologies, including autonomous trucking, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, to support opportunities to gain efficiencies in our operations. To this end, we have recently taken delivery of next-generation dredge mining assets to drive efficiencies in our proppant production operations. These technology-focused investments aim to improve our cost structure and also combine to produce beneficial environmental and community impacts. While our core business is fundamentally aligned with a lower emissions economy, our core obligation has been, and will always be, to our stockholders. We recognize that maximizing value for our stockholders requires that we optimize the outcomes for our broader stakeholders, including our employees and the communities in which we operate. We are proud of the fact that our approach to innovation in the hydrocarbon industry while operating in an environmentally responsible manner creates immense value. Since our founding in 2017, our core mission has been to improve human beings’ access to the hydrocarbons that power our lives while also delivering differentiated social and environmental progress. Our Atlas team has driven innovation and has produced industry-leading environmental benefits by reducing energy consumption, emissions, and our aerial footprint. We call this Sustainable Environmental and Social Progress. We were founded in 2017 by Ben M. “Bud” Brigham, our Executive Chairman, and are led by an entrepreneurial team with a history of constructive disruption bringing significant and complementary experience to this enterprise, including the perspective of longtime E&P operators, which provides for an elevated understanding of the end users of our products and services. Our executive management team has a proven track record with a history of generating positive returns and value creation. Our experience as E&P operators was instrumental to our understanding of the opportunity created by in-basin sand production and supply in the Permian Basin, which we view as North America’s premier shale resource and which we believe will remain its most active through economic cycles.

Enviva Receives NYSE Notice Regarding Delayed Form 10-K Filing,2024-04-08T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Enviva Inc. received a notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance due to a delay in filing its Annual Report. The Company has six months to file the Form 10-K with the SEC to regain compliance.,"Enviva Receives NYSE Notice Regarding Delayed Form 10-K Filing Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Enviva Inc. received a notice from the NYSE regarding non-compliance due to a delay in filing its Annual Report. The Company has six months to file the Form 10-K with the SEC to regain compliance. Positive None. Negative Enviva Inc. is facing non-compliance issues with the NYSE due to a delay in filing its Annual Report, which could potentially impact its stock listing if not resolved within the specified time frame. Financial Analyst An entity's failure to comply with financial reporting requirements can signal underlying issues that potentially affect investor confidence and the company's financial health. In the case of Enviva Inc., the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K is a red flag for financial analysts and investors alike, as it may indicate more profound operational or financial challenges, especially in the context of the company's recent Chapter 11 filing.From a financial perspective, the inability to file required financial documents in a timely manner could lead to speculative pressures on the company's stock price, as market participants often react to uncertainty with volatility. Additionally, the extended period provided by the NYSE for compliance suggests that while there is an immediate safety net to prevent delisting, the company is under scrutiny and must prioritize the resolution of its reporting issues to maintain its listing status.Investors should monitor the company's progress closely, as the eventual filing will provide critical insights into the company's financial state and its ability to navigate through bankruptcy proceedings. The financial statements will also shed light on the company's operational efficiency, asset utilization and cash flow management during a turbulent period. Bankruptcy Law Expert Enviva Inc.'s Chapter 11 filing is a strategic move that allows the company to reorganize its debts and continue operations while seeking to regain financial stability. However, the requirement to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to retain auditors adds a layer of complexity to the already intricate process of financial auditing and reporting.The Bankruptcy Court's involvement is indicative of a controlled environment where the company's financial decisions and contractual engagements are subject to judicial oversight. This process is designed to protect creditors and ensure that the company's path to reorganization is viable and transparent.Stakeholders should be aware that while the company operates under Chapter 11, its financial and operational strategies will be under the magnifying glass and any deviations from the approved reorganization plan could have significant implications. It's essential to understand that the Bankruptcy Court's approval is not just a procedural formality but a critical step in ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the company's financial reporting. Market Research Analyst Enviva's situation provides a case study on the impact of corporate governance and regulatory compliance on market perception. The delay in financial reporting due to the complexities of Chapter 11 proceedings can affect the company's reputation among investors and partners. It is important for market research analysts to assess the broader industry implications of such delays, as they may affect investor sentiment not only towards Enviva but also towards other companies within the same sector.Furthermore, the company's ability to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period will be a test of its operational resilience. The outcome will provide market participants with a gauge of the company's management effectiveness during a crisis. A successful and timely filing could mitigate some concerns and potentially stabilize the stock's performance. Conversely, failure to meet the NYSE's deadline could exacerbate investor concerns and lead to further stock volatility or even delisting—a severe blow to any public company.As Enviva navigates through these challenges, the market will be watching for signals of both its operational recovery and adherence to regulatory standards, which will be pivotal in shaping the company's future market position. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM BETHESDA, Md., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Enviva Inc. (NYSE: EVA) (""Enviva"" or the ""Company"") today announced that on April 2, 2024, the Company received notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE"") that it is not in compliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual due to a delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). The NYSE Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock on the NYSE. The NYSE informed the Company that, under the NYSE's rules, the Company will have six months from April 1, 2024 to file the Form 10-K with the SEC. The Company can regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC before such date. If the Company fails to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period, the NYSE may, in its sole discretion, grant an extension of up to six additional months for the Company to regain compliance. As previously reported in the Company's Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024 (the ""Form 12b-25""), the Company was unable to file the Form 10-K within the prescribed period because on March 12, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the ""Chapter 11 Cases"") in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (the ""Bankruptcy Court""). As previously disclosed, the Company is required to obtain approval of the Bankruptcy Court to retain the services of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm in order to complete the audit of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Given the Bankruptcy Court approval requirement, as well as the considerable time and resources of the Company's management devoted to the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company was unable to prepare and timely file its Form 10-K on or before April 1, 2024, the end of the extension period provided by the Form 12b-25. The Company is working diligently to complete the necessary work to file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable and currently expects to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period granted by the NYSE Notice; however, there can be no assurance that the Form 10-K will be filed within such period.

OK-101 was developed using a membrane-anchored-peptide technology to produce a novel long-acting drug candidate for treating dry eye disease. OK-101 has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory and pain-reducing efficacy signals in mouse models of dry eye disease and corneal neuropathic pain (NCP), respectively, and is designed to combat washout through the inclusion of the lipid anchor built into the drug molecule to enhance the residence time of OK-101 within the ocular environment.

The mine is expected to become one of the world's largest open pit heap leach operations, driving cash flow growth and becoming America's largest source of domestically produced silver. Positive None. Negative None. Mining Engineer The commencement of commercial production at Coeur Mining's expanded Rochester mine is a significant milestone, indicating a successful transition from the development phase to operational status. The mine's increased capacity, now at an average throughput of nearly 70,000 tons per day, showcases the scalability of open pit heap leach operations, a method where ore is placed on a leach pad and the metal is extracted using a leaching solution.The projected ramp-up to full design capacity of 88,000 tons per day underscores the mine's potential to become a major contributor to the silver and gold markets. The operational efficiency and optimization efforts mentioned, such as the new three-stage crushing circuit, are important for maintaining cost-effectiveness and maximizing output, which in turn can influence the company's profit margins and market competitiveness. Financial Analyst The achievement of commercial production at Rochester mine represents a forward-looking catalyst for Coeur Mining's financial performance. The anticipated increase in production levels and the subsequent lower unit costs are expected to improve the company's cash flow profile. Investors may find the projection of materially higher production levels in the second half of 2024 particularly noteworthy, as this could signal a substantial increase in revenue and potentially enhance shareholder value.Furthermore, the mine's status as potentially the largest source of domestically produced and refined silver in America could have implications for the domestic silver market and Coeur's positioning within it. The company's focus on mine optimization and business improvement initiatives post-commissioning is indicative of a strategy aimed at long-term asset value maximization. Market Research Analyst The expansion of the Rochester mine and its progression towards full design capacity is a pivotal development in the silver and gold mining sector. As one of the world's largest open pit heap leach operations, Rochester's increased throughput levels are poised to contribute significantly to the global supply of these precious metals. The mine's strategic importance is further emphasized by its expected role as America's largest source of domestically produced and refined silver.This expansion could have broader implications for the industry, potentially affecting silver prices and the profitability of other mining operations. Coeur's focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction through optimization efforts can set industry benchmarks and influence competitors' strategies. The long-term asset value maximization approach taken by Coeur could become a case study for resource management and operational excellence in the mining industry. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Coeur Mining, Inc. (“Coeur” or the “Company”) (NYSE: CDE) today provided an update on its newly-expanded Rochester silver and gold mine in Nevada, including the achievement of commercial production at the operation as of March 31, 2024. Commissioning of the new three-stage crushing circuit and truck load-out facility was completed on March 7. Since then, the crushing circuit has operated at an average throughput of nearly 70,000 tons per day1 and has exceeded 88,000 tons per day, leading to the declaration of commercial production as of the end of the first quarter. Ramp-up to full design capacity of 88,000 tons per day—or approximately 32 million tons per year—remains on schedule for completion during the first half of 2024. Approximately 9.3 million tons of ore have now been placed on the new Stage 6 leach pad, which – together with the new Merrill Crowe processing facility – was commissioned late last year. Materially higher production levels are anticipated to build throughout the second half of 2024 consistent with completion of Rochester’s ramp-up. Once operating at full capacity, throughput levels are expected to be approximately 2.5 times higher than historical levels, making Rochester one of the world’s largest open pit heap leach operations and a key driver of cash flow growth for the Company. It is expected to be America’s largest source of domestically produced and refined silver. “Following its full hand-off to the operations team in early March, the expanded Rochester mine has ushered in a new growth phase for Coeur leading to higher silver and gold production levels, lower unit costs, and positive free cash flow,” said Mitchell J. Krebs, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The invaluable experience and learnings gleaned over the past three years from operating similar infrastructure that we installed at the legacy operation has contributed to an impressive ramp-up curve to date and positions the mine for a strong second half of 2024. With commissioning now behind us and the ramp-up proceeding well, the team is turning its focus to mine optimization efforts and business improvement initiatives aimed at maximizing the value of this world class, long-life asset.” About Coeur Coeur Mining, Inc. is a U.S.-based, well-diversified, growing precious metals producer with four wholly-owned operations: the Palmarejo gold-silver complex in Mexico, the Rochester silver-gold mine in Nevada, the Kensington gold mine in Alaska and the Wharf gold mine in South Dakota.

(Nasdaq: ELEV), an innovative oncology company focused on the discovery and development of selective cancer therapies to treat patients across a range of solid tumors with significant unmet medical needs, today announced new preclinical data demonstrating proof-of-concept for its differentiated HER3-ADC program. The data will be presented in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, being held April 5-10 in San Diego, California. ""We are pleased to share the first preclinical proof-of-concept data for our HER3-ADC program, reinforcing our commitment to advancing a portfolio of differentiated ADC-based therapies that may deliver better outcomes for patients,"" said David Dornan, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Elevation Oncology. ""With our HER3-ADC program, we set out to design a differentiated ADC which selectively binds to HER3 and is internalized to potentially attack HER3-expressing cancerous cells while minimizing systemic exposure. Preclinical data with our proof-of-concept HER3-ADC shows HER3-dependent cell killing and robust anti-tumor activity in vivo where HER3 is expressed at high levels. We look forward to nominating a development candidate from our HER3 program later this year and, subsequently, advancing our program closer to the clinic."" HER3 is a clinically validated oncology and antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) target, which is overexpressed in a range of solid tumors, including breast cancer, EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, and is often associated with poor clinical outcomes. Elevation Oncology's HER3-ADC program conjugated seribantumab, its anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody, with a cleavable valine-citrulline linker and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload to yield HER3-ADC1, a proof-of-concept molecule with an average drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of 4. In a poster titled, ""Therapeutic potential of a HER3 antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of HER3-expressing cancers,"" Elevation Oncology scientists presented in vitro and in vivo data of a seribantumab-based ADC for patients with HER3-expressing cancers. The data showed: HER3-ADC1 binding to cancer cells, endocytosis, MMAE release and inhibition of proliferation were dependent on HER3 expression.In cytotoxicity assays, HER3-ADC1 displayed HER3-dependent cell killing and outperformed a benchmark HER3-ADC with a deruxtecan payload, which is currently in clinical development.In a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of pancreatic cancer with high HER3 expression, HER3-ADC1 induced tumor regression, whereas an isotype-MMAE control and a benchmark HER3-ADC with a deruxtecan payload had only a modest effect.The poster presentation is now available in the ""Publications"" section of Elevation Oncology's website: https://elevationoncology.com/resources/publications/.

The Precinct aims to develop a battery energy storage system and a concentrated solar thermal power plant, with grant funding from ARENA and collaboration with Mabanaft for a green methanol demonstration plant. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The announcement of the term sheet between Vast Renewables Limited and 1414 Degrees Limited with the subsidiary of BHP Group Limited signifies a strategic move that could potentially enhance the energy infrastructure in Australia. The involvement of a major player like BHP, through its subsidiary, underscores the increasing interest of traditional energy companies in renewable energy projects.The focus on a 140MW battery energy storage system and a 30MW concentrated solar thermal power plant reflects a growing trend towards diversifying energy sources and increasing energy storage capacity to stabilize grids. The conditional grant funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the collaboration between the Australian and German Governments for the green methanol demonstration plant further indicates strong governmental support for renewable energy initiatives.This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors who are increasingly conscious of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. The potential connection to the Hill-to-Hill Transmission Line could facilitate the integration of the Aurora Energy Precinct into the national grid, enhancing the reliability of renewable energy supply and potentially reducing carbon emissions. Financial Analyst The signing of the term sheet represents a preliminary but essential step in securing the infrastructure necessary for Vast Renewables Limited's projects. The financial implications hinge on the successful negotiation of a binding agreement. The potential for up to AUD $65 million in grant funding for the solar thermal power plant and additional millions for the green methanol plant provides a substantial financial cushion that could reduce capital expenditure risks.However, investors should be mindful of the termination scenarios within the Term Sheet, which could pose a risk if the technical engineering review does not meet OZM's standards. The long-term financial benefits for Vast and its partners, including the potential for increased revenue streams from energy sales and the strengthening of their position in the renewable energy market, are contingent upon the successful execution of the agreement and subsequent project development.For the stock market, this news could lead to speculative trading based on the future potential of the projects. Yet, the actual impact on Vast's financial performance would likely not be immediate, as the development and construction of such infrastructure projects have longer lead times. 04/08/2024 - 06:30 PM SYDNEY, Australia, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vast Renewables Limited (Vast) (Nasdaq: VSTE) and 1414 Degrees Limited (ASX:14D), through their joint venture SiliconAurora Pty Ltd (SiliconAurora), today announced the signing of a term sheet (Term Sheet) with Vast Solar 1 Pty Ltd and OZ Minerals Services Pty Ltd (OZM), a subsidiary of BHP Group Limited (BHP), to enter into negotiations with OZM for a possible binding agreement (Agreement) by 30 September 2024 (which date can be extended by mutual consent) (Agreement Date) that would facilitate access for the initial stages of the Aurora Energy Precinct (the Precinct) to the ElectraNet owned Hill-to-Hill Transmission Line (H2H) near Port Augusta, South Australia. The Precinct is owned by SiliconAurora, which plans to develop a 140MW (2 hour) battery energy storage system (BESS) on the site. Additionally, Vast plans to develop Vast Solar 1 (VS1), a 30MW concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) plant with 288 MWh of thermal storage, on the Precinct site. VS1 was awarded up to AUD $65 million in conditional grant funding by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA). VS1 will be co-located with Vast’s planned Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) project, a green methanol demonstration plant led by Vast and German integrated energy giant Mabanaft, which has been awarded up to AUD $19.48 million and up to EUR 13.2 million of conditional grant funding from a collaboration between the Australian and German Governments, respectively. The BESS and VS1 are planned to connect to the H2H, providing clean, reliable energy to power Australian homes and businesses. Connection to the H2H will be subject to further negotiations and agreement with OZM and ElectraNet as contemplated under the Term Sheet. The Term Sheet also contains certain termination scenarios including if OZM, in its absolute discretion, is not satisfied with the risks associated with the proposed connections to the H2H following a technical engineering review. Vast’s CEO Craig Wood said, “Decarbonizing Australia’s electricity supply requires that dispatchable renewable energy with long duration storage like that provided by Vast’s proprietary CSP v.3.0 technology be integrated into the Australian electricity grid. Execution of this Term Sheet is an important step forward, and we are looking forward to continuing discussions with BHP to agree commercial and technical terms so we can progress the Precinct.” About Vast Vast is a renewable energy company that has CSP systems to generate, store, and dispatch carbon-free, utility-scale electricity, industrial heat, or a combination to enable the production of green fuels. Vast’s CSP v3.0 approach utilises a proprietary, modular sodium loop to efficiently capture and convert solar heat into these end products.

Skillz Receives NYSE Notice Regarding Late Form 10-K Filing,2024-04-08T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Skillz Inc.

The Company has six months to regain compliance, with a possible extension of six more months. Skillz is working to complete the audit procedures and expects no material changes in financial results. However, there is uncertainty about filing the Form 10-K within the specified period. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst When a company like Skillz Inc. fails to meet the NYSE's timely filing requirements, it raises red flags for investors and analysts alike. The delay in filing the Annual Report on Form 10-K suggests potential issues in financial reporting, internal controls, or even operational challenges. Investors should monitor the situation closely as the eventual filing will provide critical insights into the company's financial health and management's ability to resolve reporting issues. It's also important to consider the implications of any material changes that might emerge once the audit is completed. While the current statement indicates no expected material changes, the audit's outcome could sway investor confidence and stock volatility.Furthermore, the NYSE's warning about possible delisting proceedings is a serious matter. Delisting can severely impact a stock's liquidity and attractiveness to institutional investors. However, the company's assurance of filing within the six-month extension period could mitigate immediate concerns. The stock market typically reacts to uncertainty, so clarity on the company's progress towards compliance will be key in the coming months. Market Research Analyst The gaming industry, where Skillz Inc. operates, is highly competitive and sensitive to consumer trends and regulatory compliance. The company's inability to file the required financial documents on time could be indicative of deeper operational or competitive issues, which may affect their market positioning. Investors should consider the broader industry context, including the performance of peer companies and the demand for gaming platforms. Any prolonged uncertainty regarding Skillz's financials might lead competitors to capitalize on the situation, potentially eroding Skillz's market share.On the flip side, if Skillz manages to resolve its filing issues without uncovering any material financial discrepancies, the company could regain investor confidence. It's also worth noting that the gaming sector is known for its resilience and rapid growth, which could work in Skillz's favor if they navigate through this compliance challenge effectively. Legal Expert Compliance with NYSE listing standards is a legal requirement for publicly traded companies. Skillz Inc.'s failure to file its Form 10-K in a timely manner could have legal ramifications beyond the threat of delisting. It might subject the company to SEC scrutiny and potential penalties. Investors should be aware of the legal processes and timelines that the company must adhere to in order to regain compliance. The six-month period granted by the NYSE, with a possible six-month extension, provides a timeline for investors to track the company's progress towards resolving these issues.While the company has indicated that no material changes are expected in the financial results, any deviations from this expectation could lead to legal consequences and further undermine investor trust. It is essential for investors to keep abreast of any updates from the company regarding its compliance efforts and any legal developments that may arise from this situation. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Skillz Inc. (NYSE: SKLZ) (“the Company”), the leading games platform bringing fair competition to players worldwide, today announced that, on April 2, 2024, it received a notice (the “NYSE Notice”) from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria established in Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, because the Company has not timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The NYSE Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on the NYSE. The NYSE Notice informed the Company that, under NYSE rules, the Company has six months from March 15, 2024 to regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC. The NYSE further noted that, if the Company fails to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period, the NYSE may grant, at its sole discretion, an extension of up to six additional months for the Company to regain compliance, depending on the specific circumstances. The NYSE Notice also notes that the NYSE may nevertheless commence delisting proceedings at any time if it deems that the circumstances warrant. As previously reported in the Company’s Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024 (the “Form 12b-25”), the Company was unable to file the Form 10-K within the prescribed period because the Company requires more time to complete the procedures relating to its year-end process, including the completion of the audit of the Company’s financial statements by the Company’s independent auditors for inclusion in the Form 10-K. Subsequent to filing the Form 12b-25, the Company continued to dedicate significant resources to the completion of such procedures but was unable to file the Form 10-K by April 1, 2024, the end of the extension period provided by the Form 12b-25. The Company requires additional time to complete such procedures. Based on currently available information and subject to the completion of the audit procedures, the Company does not expect any material change to the financial results to be included in the Form 10-K compared to the preliminary financial information reported in the earnings release the Company furnished to the SEC on the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 14, 2024. The Company is working diligently to complete the necessary work to file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable and currently expects to file the Form 10-K within the six-month period granted by the NYSE Notice; however, there can be no assurance that the Form 10-K will be filed within such period.

Invitation Homes Agrees to Acquire Approximately 500 Additional Newly Built Homes,2024-04-08T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE: INVH) announces a $140 million investment to acquire 500 newly built homes in Charlotte, Jacksonville, and Nashville through partnerships with three top-tier homebuilders. The company aims to address housing supply issues and provide affordable housing options, emphasizing its commitment to shareholder returns and strategic growth.","Invitation Homes Agrees to Acquire Approximately 500 Additional Newly Built Homes Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE: INVH) announces a $140 million investment to acquire 500 newly built homes in Charlotte, Jacksonville, and Nashville through partnerships with three top-tier homebuilders. The company aims to address housing supply issues and provide affordable housing options, emphasizing its commitment to shareholder returns and strategic growth. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Market Analyst The announcement by Invitation Homes Inc. of its $140 million investment in acquiring approximately 500 newly built homes is a strategic move in the real estate market, particularly within the single-family home leasing sector. This investment not only indicates the company's commitment to expanding its portfolio but also reflects the broader industry trend towards institutional investment in residential real estate. The locations chosen—Charlotte, Jacksonville and Nashville—are notable for their growing populations and economic development, which could potentially lead to an increased demand for rental properties.By establishing new relationships with three top-tier homebuilders, Invitation Homes is diversifying its acquisition channels and potentially securing a pipeline for future property acquisitions. This could enhance the company's ability to maintain a consistent supply of new homes for lease, in the face of a national housing shortage that has been driving up home prices and rents. The strategy might offer attractive risk-adjusted returns for stockholders as it could lead to stable cash flows from long-term leases and appreciation in property values over time. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Invitation Homes' investment represents a significant capital allocation that could have notable implications for its balance sheet and cash flow statements. A $140 million investment in real estate assets requires careful consideration of financing methods, whether through debt, equity, or a combination of both. Investors should monitor the company's debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage metrics closely, as these will be indicators of the financial health and leverage of the company post-acquisition.The anticipated deliveries of homes in both 2023 and 2024 suggest a forward-looking growth plan that may appeal to investors seeking growth in the real estate sector. However, it is important to consider the cyclical nature of real estate and the potential impact of economic downturns on the company's performance. Additionally, the company's stock performance may be influenced by its ability to integrate these new assets and manage them efficiently, maintaining occupancy rates and rental income. Construction Industry Analyst The collaboration between Invitation Homes and top-tier homebuilders is a reflection of the evolving dynamics in the construction industry. The partnership approach allows homebuilders to mitigate the risks associated with speculative building, as they have a committed buyer in place. For Invitation Homes, this means access to a supply of homes tailored to their specifications and potentially quicker delivery times.The focus on new construction also aligns with consumer preferences for modern amenities and energy-efficient homes, which can be more attractive to potential tenants and command higher rents. However, the reliance on new construction comes with risks, such as potential delays due to supply chain disruptions or labor shortages that have been prevalent in the construction industry in recent years. These factors could affect the timeline for property deliveries and, consequently, the projected revenue growth from these investments. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Company’s investment helps address needed home supply while adding three new top-tier homebuilder relationships DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Invitation Homes Inc. (NYSE: INVH) (“Invitation Homes” or the “Company”), the nation’s premier single-family home leasing and management company, announced today that it is under contract to acquire approximately 500 additional newly built homes for a total investment of approximately $140 million. The homes will be located in Charlotte, Jacksonville, and Nashville, and are being acquired through new relationships with three top-tier homebuilders, with deliveries expected to begin later this year. “As lack of supply continues to be a primary culprit in the high cost of housing, we are proud to further broaden our strong homebuilder partnerships to create additional housing,” said Scott Eisen, the Company’s Chief Investment Officer. “At the same time, we believe our strategy of partnering with the largest and best homebuilders to grow our footprint across the country offers the best risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.” “Our homes provide a choice for individuals and families to live in a great neighborhood that might not otherwise be accessible to them and create a chance for those same households to save money toward their goals,” Mr. Eisen continued. The Company received deliveries of 648 newly built homes in 2023 and currently anticipates deliveries of approximately 1,000 new homes from its new product pipeline in 2024.

While their contributions are too many to list, it is worth noting that Jim Franklin was a founding Director of Ur-Energy when he and original management of the Company recognized in the early 2000s the impending uranium supply gap. Jim's assessments were accurate, and the timely formation of Ur-Energy positioned us to grow the Company to our current ability to capitalize on a strong market for nuclear fuel. Bill Boberg contributed throughout the years serving as a Director and an executive of the Company, but he is perhaps best known for the acquisition of the Great Divide Basin assets in Wyoming, including the property which became our flagship producing mine, Lost Creek. Jim and Bill, thank you so much for your guidance over the years.

The program aims to address muscle loss associated with obesity treatment, with BIO101 as a potential solution. The company anticipates significant market growth and positive clinical outcomes by 2025. Positive Biophytis launches OBA clinical development program for obesity treatment BIO101 shows promising preclinical results in addressing muscle loss due to obesity treatment GLP-1 receptor agonists play a significant role in weight loss but can lead to muscle loss Addressable market for obesity treatment expected to reach $100 billion by 2030 BIO101's potential in treating obesity highlighted in Nature Biotechnology OBA Phase 2 clinical study to start in mid-2024 with results expected in 2025 Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The announcement by Biophytis SA regarding its preclinical results for BIO101 in obesity treatment presents a potential advancement in addressing muscle loss associated with obesity therapies. The combination of BIO101 with GLP-1 receptor agonists could represent a significant innovation, as current obesity treatments often lead to muscle mass reduction, which can undermine metabolic health and physical function.Considering the projected market growth for anti-obesity medications, the successful development of BIO101 could position Biophytis to capture a substantial share of a market anticipated to expand dramatically by 2030. This could translate into a notable increase in the company's market valuation and investor interest. The focus on muscle preservation is a strategic differentiation, given the current gap in treatment options for obesity-related muscle wasting. Healthcare Industry Analyst The obesity treatment market is rapidly expanding and Biophytis's approach to muscle preservation in this context could address a significant unmet medical need. The commercial potential for BIO101, should it receive regulatory approval, is underscored by the impressive market size and growth rate projections.Investors should monitor the progress of the OBA Phase 2 clinical study closely, as positive outcomes could lead to increased partnership opportunities, potential licensing deals, or even buyout prospects from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their portfolios in the lucrative obesity treatment space. Pharmaceutical Market Research Analyst Biophytis's strategic move to combine BIO101 with GLP-1 receptor agonists could tap into the existing market for GLP-1 RA drugs, which have already demonstrated efficacy in weight loss. The synergistic potential of this combination therapy could offer a competitive edge over existing treatments and align with the current industry trend towards personalized medicine.From a market research perspective, the anticipation of regulatory approval and the expected start of the OBA Phase 2 clinical study in mid-2024 could influence investor sentiment and stock performance in the short term. Long-term implications hinge on the study's results and the subsequent steps towards commercialization. 04/08/2024 - 05:30 PM Promising preclinical results obtained in obesity support the OBA Phase 2 clinical study expected to start mid-2024PARIS, FRANCE AND CAMBRIDGE, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Biophytis SA (Nasdaq:BPTS)(Euronext Growth Paris: ALBPS), (""Biophytis"" or the ""Company""), a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics for age-related diseases, today announces that it is launching a new clinical development program named OBA, with BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) as a potential treatment for obesity in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists.Muscle loss due to obesity treatment: no therapy available todayObesity treatment can lead to loss of muscle mass and function, notably as a consequence of dieting when combined with the recently introduced GLP-1 receptor agonists. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) drugs are very effective drugs that lead to significant weight loss. Up to 40% of the total weight loss comes from muscle, which is a problem as muscle tissue's role is central in controlling metabolism, on top of its motor function.More than 15 million adults in the US will be treated with an anti-obesity medication by 2030, representing 13% penetration into the US adult population. With an estimated market size of $6 billion in 2023 and an estimated average annual growth rate expected around 42%, the addressable market for the treatment of obesity is set to reach $100 billion by 2030 (source: Goldman Sachs Research).Promising results already obtained in obesityBIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) is the first oral daily MAS receptor activator and has demonstrated metabolic effects on muscle and fat tissues in preclinical studies in obesity. These benefical effects of BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) may translate into improved mobility and muscle strength in obese sarcopenic patients, as suggested in the SARA-INT phase 2 study. Furthermore, the 20-hydroxyecdysone molecule was already tested in obese patients during hypocaloric dieting in the Quinolia study, showing promising effects on muscle strength and fat mass loss. BIO101's (20-hydroxyecdysone) potential in the treatment of obesity in combination with GLP-1RAs to counteract the undesirable effects on muscle wasting associated with drastic weight-loss was highlighted in Nature Biotechnology (""After obesity drugs' success, companies rush to preserve skeletal muscle"") on March 05, 2024.Stanislas Veillet, CEO of Biophytis, stated: ""We believe BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) has the potential to be the molecule of choice for preserving muscle function in patients suffering from obesity who are treated with GLP-1 RAs. Our drug candidate,subject to regulatory approvals, could contribute to meeting crucial medical challenges, while positioning Biophytis in a large market with incredibly high growth potential. We believe that our leadership in developing drugs for muscular diseases and promising results obtained in obesity will be a strong accelerator of the OBA clinical plan.""An accelerated clinical development with results expected in 2025The OBA Phase 2 clinical study is expected to start mid 2024, upon regulatory approvals, with first patients expected to be treated in the second half of 2024. BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) will be evaluated in obese patients treated with GLP-1 RAs, and following hypocaloric dieting. We expect the first results of the efficacy of our drug candidate to be available in 2025. Further information on the OBA program and the clinical study is expected to be provided through the coming weeks.****About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases.

The IPO price is expected to be between $18.00 and $21.00 per share, with plans to list on NYSE under the ticker symbol 'CTRI'. Southwest Gas will retain majority ownership post-IPO. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The initiation of Centuri's IPO represents a strategic maneuver within the utilities sector, potentially aimed at unlocking value and providing Centuri with the capital necessary to expand or enhance operations. The offering size and pricing window suggest a moderate level of confidence in investor demand, with the over-allotment option serving as a gauge for market appetite. It is important to monitor the final IPO pricing within the stated range, as it will reflect market valuation of Centuri's business model and growth prospects.Furthermore, the retention of a majority stake by Southwest Gas indicates a gradual transition rather than a complete divestiture, which could imply ongoing strategic synergies between the two entities. Investors should consider how this relationship may affect Centuri's operational independence and potential growth trajectory. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Centuri's IPO for Southwest Gas are multifaceted. A successful offering could result in a significant influx of cash, which may be used to deleverage the parent company's balance sheet or reinvested into core business areas. The market's reception to the IPO and subsequent performance of Centuri's stock will also have a direct impact on Southwest Gas's financial statements, given their substantial ownership post-IPO.On the flip side, the market must also consider the dilutive effect of the IPO on Southwest Gas's earnings per share, as well as the potential for reduced cash flows if Centuri begins to retain more capital for its own operational needs. The underwriters' pedigree and the involvement of multiple financial institutions in varying capacities could be interpreted as a positive signal of the offering's credibility and institutional support. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the reference to the registration statement's status with the SEC is a standard reminder of the regulatory processes governing public offerings. The effectiveness of the registration statement is a critical step that will greenlight the transaction. It is also notable that the press release emphasizes compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, underscoring the importance of adherence to securities laws and regulations.Investors should be aware that the legal framework ensures transparency and provides protections, but also imposes certain restrictions on the timing and manner of the sale and purchase of securities. The mention of not selling in jurisdictions where it would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification is a routine disclaimer, yet it serves as a reminder of the complex legal landscape that governs such transactions. 04/08/2024 - 04:39 PM LAS VEGAS, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Gas Holdings, Inc.

All currency references in this press release are in U.S. dollars except as otherwise indicated. First Quarter Highlights: Mandalay's quarter-end cash balance was $47.1 million, a significant increase of $20.2 million as compared to year-end 2023;Consolidated gold equivalent production of 24,936 ounces;Costerfield production increased to 14,566 gold equivalent ounces, 32% higher than Q1 2023;Björkdal production increased to 10,370 gold ounces, 16% higher than Q1 2023; andConsolidated gold equivalent sold was 25,277 ounces.Frazer Bourchier, President and CEO, commented: ""We are pleased to report Mandalay's continued operational success in the latest quarter, achieving a solid production result of nearly 25,000 gold equivalent ounces across both operations. This achievement positions the Company on a stable trajectory towards meeting our annual production target of 90,000 – 100,000 gold equivalent ounces. Of significant note, Mandalay bolstered its cash reserves substantially, increasing its cash balance by over $20 million in the quarter, culminating in a closing quarter cash balance of $47 million."" Ryan Austerberry, COO, commented: ""At Costerfield, we produced 14,566 gold equivalent ounces during Q1 2024, with an average processed head grade of 12.4 g/t and 2.2%, for gold and antimony, respectively. This is despite encountering challenges impacting operations due to two distinct adverse rain weather events, leading to temporary site access restrictions and power disruptions in January 2024. We anticipate maintaining similar metal grades as we mine comparable sections within our high-grade Youle and Shepherd deposits in the upcoming quarter. ""At Björkdal, we achieved gold production of 10,370 gold ounces. Throughout the quarter, underground mining rates remained healthy and consistent notwithstanding some geotechnical challenges causing adjustments to the mine sequencing schedule. While the processed gold grades were lower than anticipated in the quarter, this large gold system with sufficient underground capital development provides us flexibility to pivot as required when these issues might occur. Site continues to explore opportunities to even further improve planning flexibility, enabling better management of potential impacts from future sequencing changes. One notable achievement we are very pleased with was the steady ramp up in mill throughput rates during the quarter. The commissioning of the mill expansion conversion project is progressing as scheduled and is expected to be completed in Q2 2024. This step change will increase the plant's feed to a run-rate of 1.45 million tonnes per annum."" Mr. Bourchier concluded, ""With this continued solid foundation of two great assets in excellent jurisdictions coupled with the ongoing execution of Mandalay's new corporate strategy, we are poised to capitalize on future opportunities and look towards achieving our vision of building a premier mid-tier essential metal producer over the next few years.""

Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Churchill Downs Incorporated (CHDN) completes the sale of 49% of United Tote Company to NYRA Content Management Solutions, , a subsidiary of NYRA. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The divestiture of a 49% stake in United Tote by Churchill Downs Incorporated to NYRA Content Management Solutions presents a strategic realignment within the horseracing and betting industry. This move suggests a consolidation trend where entities are seeking to leverage synergies and optimize their operational efficiencies. For stakeholders of CDI, this transaction may indicate a shift in business focus or a reallocation of resources towards more profitable segments or opportunities for growth within the company's portfolio.From a market research perspective, the partial sale could be seen as a way to inject capital and possibly reduce risk by sharing the operational responsibilities with another established player in the market. It's essential to monitor how this cash inflow will be utilized, whether for debt reduction, reinvestment into core business areas, or shareholder returns, as these actions will have direct implications on the stock's performance and investor sentiment. Financial Analyst Financially, the sale of a minority stake in a subsidiary is a nuanced transaction. It does not relinquish control but does provide liquidity and potentially improves the balance sheet of CDI. The key metric to watch in the coming quarters will be the impact on CDI's earnings per share (EPS). The influx of cash might be used to bolster the EPS through share buybacks or debt paydown, both of which are favorable actions from an investor's standpoint.Moreover, the valuation of the 49% stake and the terms of the deal would be critical in assessing the financial savvy of CDI's management. If the stake was sold at a premium, this could reflect positively on the perceived value of United Tote and, by extension, CDI. Conversely, a sale at a discount could imply a need for liquidity or a less optimistic outlook on United Tote's future profitability. Legal Expert In transactions involving the sale of significant stakes in subsidiaries, regulatory and contractual intricacies often play a pivotal role. The partial sale of United Tote to a subsidiary of NYRA may involve antitrust considerations, given both entities operate within the same industry. The structure of the deal will need to ensure compliance with industry regulations and maintain competitive balance.Additionally, the minority ownership by NYRA introduces shared governance issues, which must be carefully managed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure that both parties' strategic objectives are aligned. This alignment is vital for the smooth operation of United Tote going forward and for maintaining the integrity of the transaction from a legal standpoint. 04/08/2024 - 05:30 PM LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Churchill Downs Incorporated (Nasdaq: CHDN, “CDI,” or the “Company”) announced today that the Company closed on the sale of 49% of United Tote Company (“United Tote”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CDI, to NYRA Content Management Solutions, LLC, a subsidiary of the New York Racing Association, Inc.

NVL-330 shows broad activity against HER2 oncogenic alterations and higher CNS penetration. Zidesamtinib demonstrates effectiveness against ROS1 resistance mutations and potential for deep, durable responses. Company plans Phase 1 trials for HER2 program and updates on ARROS-1 trial in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The recent preclinical findings for Nuvalent's NVL-330 and zidesamtinib (NVL-520) offer promising insights into the advancement of cancer treatment, particularly in addressing HER2 oncogenic alterations and ROS1 resistance mutations. The ability of NVL-330 to achieve higher central nervous system (CNS) penetration and deeper intracranial response positions it as a potentially valuable addition to the therapeutic arsenal against breast cancer and other HER2-positive cancers, where CNS metastasis is a significant challenge.Moreover, the preclinical mutagenesis screen results for zidesamtinib highlight its potential efficacy in overcoming on-target resistance mutations, a common hurdle in the treatment of ROS1-driven cancers. The differentiation from earlier-generation ROS1 inhibitors could lead to improved outcomes for patients. These advancements are critical as they could potentially fill treatment gaps and improve the quality of life for patients with limited options. Biotech Market Analyst The announcement by Nuvalent may have a positive impact on investor sentiment due to the potential of NVL-330 and zidesamtinib to address unmet medical needs in oncology. The emphasis on CNS penetration is particularly noteworthy, as this is a common limitation of many current cancer therapies. The market for CNS-penetrant therapies is growing and compounds with proven efficacy in this area could command significant market share.Furthermore, the development of therapies that are less likely to encounter on-target resistance, such as zidesamtinib, could lead to longer periods of disease control and potentially delay the need for subsequent lines of therapy, which is a compelling value proposition in the oncology market. The progression of these compounds into clinical trials will be closely watched by investors, as positive trial results could lead to substantial market opportunities and partnerships. Pharmaceutical Regulatory Affairs Specialist The preclinical data presented by Nuvalent for NVL-330 and zidesamtinib indicate a strategic focus on designing therapies with improved selectivity and CNS penetration, which are key considerations for regulatory approval. Regulatory agencies, like the FDA, prioritize the approval of drugs that demonstrate significant improvements over existing treatments, especially in terms of efficacy and safety profiles. Nuvalent's approach to designing molecules that address specific challenges such as CNS penetration and resistance mutations aligns with the current regulatory landscape that favors innovation in drug development.As these drug candidates progress through the clinical trial pipeline, it will be important for Nuvalent to maintain robust data collection and analysis practices to ensure that the differentiated profiles of their drug candidates are clearly demonstrated, thereby facilitating a smoother regulatory review process. The focus on precision medicine and targeted therapies is in line with current regulatory trends, potentially expediting the path to market for these candidates. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Preclinical data continue to support NVL-330's broad activity against HER2 oncogenic alterations, selectivity over wild-type EGFR, and differentiated brain-penetrant profile Zidesamtinib shown to be effective at suppressing on-target ROS1 resistance mutations in preclinical mutagenesis screens CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuvalent, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUVL), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely targeted therapies for clinically proven kinase targets in cancer, today announced the presentation of new preclinical data for its novel HER2-selective inhibitor, NVL-330, and novel ROS1-selective inhibitor, zidesamtinib (NVL-520). The two posters will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting taking place from April 5 – 10 in San Diego. The posters will also be available on the Nuvalent website at www.nuvalent.com following the presentations. ""Today's presentations continue to reinforce the differentiated profiles of our drug candidates,"" said Henry Pelish, Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Drug Discovery at Nuvalent. ""In comparative in vitro and in vivo analyses of NVL-330 with currently approved and investigational HER2-targeting agents, NVL-330 demonstrated a differentiated preclinical profile by achieving higher CNS penetration and deeper intracranial response. Importantly, in these preclinical studies, NVL-330 also demonstrated potency against a broad range of HER2 oncogenic alterations and selectivity over wild-type EGFR, in line with our goal of designing molecules that can thread the needle between multiple competing challenges."" Dr. Pelish continued, ""In our ongoing ARROS-1 clinical trial of zidesamtinib, preliminary Phase 1 data has demonstrated a differentiated profile combining activity against ROS1 resistance mutations, CNS penetrance, and TRK avoidance which we believe has the potential to translate to deep, durable responses for patients with ROS1-driven cancers. A new preclinical mutagenesis screen reinforces this potential, showing that on-target resistance is unlikely following treatment with zidesamtinib at its average observed clinical concentration."" In 2024, the company expects to initiate a Phase 1 trial for its HER2 program and to share updated data from the ARROS-1 trial at a medical meeting.

About zidesamtinib (NVL-520)Zidesamtinib is a novel brain-penetrant ROS1-selective inhibitor created with the aim to overcome limitations observed with currently available ROS1 inhibitors. Zidesamtinib is designed to remain active in tumors that have developed resistance to currently available ROS1 inhibitors, including tumors with treatment-emergent ROS1 mutations such as G2032R. In addition, zidesamtinib is designed for central nervous system (CNS) penetrance to improve treatment options for patients with brain metastases, and to avoid inhibition of the structurally related tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) family. Together, these characteristics have the potential to avoid TRK-related CNS adverse events seen with dual TRK/ROS1 inhibitors and to drive deep, durable responses for patients across all lines of therapy. Zidesamtinib has received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have been previously treated with 2 or more ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and orphan drug designation for ROS1-positive NSCLC. Zidesamtinib is currently being investigated in the ARROS-1 trial (NCT05118789), a first-in-human Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced ROS1-positive NSCLC and other solid tumors. About NuvalentNuvalent, Inc. (Nasdaq: NUVL) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely targeted therapies for patients with cancer, designed to overcome the limitations of existing therapies for clinically proven kinase targets. Leveraging deep expertise in chemistry and structure-based drug design, we develop innovative small molecules that have the potential to overcome resistance, minimize adverse events, address brain metastases, and drive more durable responses. Nuvalent is advancing a robust pipeline with investigational candidates for ROS1-positive, ALK-positive, and HER2-positive non-small cell lung cancer, and multiple discovery-stage research programs.

Windtree issued 5,500 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock to Varian's creditor investors.

Oncology Research Analyst Windtree Therapeutics' acquisition of Varian Biopharmaceuticals' assets, including the aPKCi, represents a strategic move into the oncology space, which has seen increasing interest due to the high unmet medical needs and potential for significant revenue generation. The aPKCi, targeting the Protein Kinase C iota isozyme, could offer a new approach to tackling various cancers, particularly if it shows high specificity and effectiveness in both monotherapy and combination therapy settings.From a research perspective, the pre-clinical data showing dose-dependent modulation of cell viability and pathway activity is promising. However, the clinical success of these compounds is far from guaranteed, as the transition from pre-clinical to clinical efficacy is a major hurdle for oncology therapeutics. The potential for milestone payments upon achieving regulatory and clinical milestones indicates a performance-based investment strategy but also reflects the inherent risks of drug development.The focus on both rare and prevalent tumor types could allow Windtree to tap into niche markets while also addressing larger patient populations. The topical formulation VAR-101 could be particularly interesting for skin cancers, where localized treatment is advantageous. Financial Analyst The issuance of 5,500 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and the $1.5 million convertible note bridge financing are critical elements of this transaction that could have significant implications for current and future investors. The initial conversion price set for these securities, with a floor price, offers insight into the company's valuation expectations and safeguards against excessive dilution.The 10% annual dividend on the Preferred Shares is a substantial commitment and reflects the risk profile associated with the investment. Investors will need to closely monitor the progress of the asset's development to assess whether the potential returns justify the risks and costs.Windtree's plan to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes suggests a need for capital to support ongoing operations and development programs. The stipulation to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of common stock upon conversion aligns with Nasdaq regulations and provides a measure of corporate governance. Overall, the financial structure of this deal will require careful analysis to determine its impact on the company's balance sheet and future funding requirements. Market Research Analyst Entering the oncology drug market can be transformative for a biopharmaceutical company like Windtree. Oncology is one of the most lucrative segments in the pharmaceutical industry due to the high cost of cancer drugs and the growing incidence of the disease globally. The acquisition of aPKCi, with its potential broad use in oncology, positions Windtree to potentially capture a share of this market.However, market success is contingent upon the successful development and approval of the drug, which is a lengthy and uncertain process. The company's strategy to partner its SERCA2a activator platform could provide additional financial support and risk-sharing. The mention of a stronger balance sheet and leveraging experience to grow the business indicates an awareness of the competitive landscape and the need for strategic partnerships and financial prudence in the biotech sector.Investors and analysts will be watching closely for updates on licensing activities and strategic partnerships, as these can significantly affect the company's market position and financial health. 04/08/2024 - 04:48 PM WARRINGTON, Pa., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.

(“Varian”) to acquire certain of its assets, including a proprietary atypical protein kinase C iota inhibitor (aPKCi). The Company also completed a $1.5 million convertible note bridge financing. The acquired Varian asset platform is a novel, potential high-potency, specific, aPKCi with possible broad use in oncology as well as certain rare malignant diseases. The asset platform includes two formulations: VAR-101 (topical) and VAR-102 (oral). In consideration of the purchase of the Varian assets, on April 2, 2024, the Company issued to certain of Varian’s creditor investors a total of 5,500 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Preferred Shares”), that have an initial conversion price of $0.3603, which is subject to adjustment to no lower than $0.0721. Dividends on the Preferred Shares shall accrue at 10.0% per annum, subject to limited exceptions. With successful development, the Company would pay up to $2.3 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and clinical development milestones relating to the acquired assets with the Company having the option to pay such milestone payments either in cash or the Company’s common stock. Protein kinase inhibitors are a class of anti-cancer therapeutics that have made a significant impact on the treatment of cancers. Among the kinase targets for further development are the Protein Kinase C (“PKC”) family, which are key components of many signaling pathways that drive the formation of cancer. aPKCi is a promising atypical PKC iota isozyme with defined oncogenic role in multiple signaling pathways, and in the initiation and development of multiple tumor types. GLI-1 is a transcription factor at the terminal end of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, and many other important pathways, including RAS-RAF, TGFb, and P14K-AKT-mTOR. In many tumor types, high levels of GLI-1 expression is a negative prognostic marker. Pre-clinical data of the acquired platform showed dose dependent modulation of basal cell carcinoma cell viability and GLI-1 pathway modulation in vitro, as well as dose dependent anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The protein kinase inhibitor adds to Windtree’s product candidate portfolio of novel pre-clinical and late-stage clinical product candidates and development programs, including SERCA2a activators and programs in out-licensed partnership. “Completion of the Varian asset acquisition and the bridge financing represents a potentially transformative next step for Windtree. Adding an innovative protein kinase inhibitor that has what we believe is an exciting pre-clinical data package with two formulations in development to our existing portfolio of product candidates creates an additional opportunity for value creation as we advance and look to partner our late and early-stage SERCA2a activator platform, including istaroxime,” said Craig Fraser, Chief Executive Officer of Windtree. “We see potential application in both rare and more prevalent tumor types, both in monotherapy and in combination with other agents. We believe there will be options for targeted disease selection and differentiation due to the potential for high specificity and topical formulation to treat various skin cancers. In the weeks to come, I look forward to providing updates on the use of this newly acquired capital and plans for our portfolio and programs, including licensing activity for istaroxime and our SERCA2a activators as well as our company strategy to have a stronger balance sheet and opportunities to further leverage our experience to grow the business.” In addition to the asset purchase, on April 2, 2024, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors whereby the Company agreed to sell to such investors $1.5 million in senior convertible notes (the “Notes”) for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.5 million (the “Notes Offering”). The Notes have an initial conversion price of $0.3603, which is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events to no lower than $0.0721 (subject to any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction). The Company may, at its option, redeem the Notes subject to certain conditions and terms in the securities purchase agreement. The Notes may convert in a subsequent financing or will accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum and mature on January 2, 2025, unless previously converted or redeemed. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Notes Offering for general corporate purposes. The Company agreed to seek stockholder approval for the issuance of all of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes and the Preferred Shares in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market. Additional details are available by reading the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the Varian asset acquisition and senior convertible note bridge financing, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 8, 2024. About Istaroxime Istaroxime is a first-in-class dual-mechanism therapy designed to improve both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Istaroxime is a positive inotropic agent that increases myocardial contractility through inhibition of Na+/K+- ATPase with a complimentary mechanism that facilitates myocardial relaxation through activation of the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhancing calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm. Data from multiple Phase 2 studies in patients with early cardiogenic shock or acute decompensated heart failure demonstrate that istaroxime infused intravenously significantly improves cardiac function and blood pressure without increasing heart rate or the incidence of cardiac rhythm disturbances. About Pure SERCA2a Activators These compounds activate SERCA2a and Windtree Therapeutics' research and development program is evaluating these preclinical product candidates, including oral and intravenous SERCA2a activator heart failure compounds. About Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on advancing early and late-stage innovative therapies for critical conditions and diseases.

A portion of KTF's April distribution is estimated to consist of a return of capital, signaling potential complexities in fund performance. 04/08/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The DWS closed-end funds listed below (each, a “Fund”) announced today their regular monthly distributions. Details are as follows: April Monthly Distributions Declaration – 04/08/2024 Ex-Date – 04/18/2024 Record – 04/19/2024 Payable – 04/30/2024 Fund Ticker Distribution Prior Per Share Distribution Per Share DWS Strategic Municipal Income Trust KSM $0.0273 $0.0290 DWS Municipal Income Trust KTF $0.0610 $0.0350 Each Fund intends to distribute all or substantially all of its net investment income each year through its regular monthly distributions and to distribute any realized capital gains at least annually. In addition, in any monthly period, to maintain its declared per common share distribution amount, each Fund may distribute more or less than its net investment income during the period. In the event a Fund distributes more than its net investment income during any yearly period, such distributions may also include realized gains and/or a return of capital. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce a Fund’s net asset value. It is estimated that a portion of KTF’s April distribution consists of a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder’s investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.” Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about KTF’s investment performance from the amount of its monthly distribution. As required by Federal securities laws, KTF will issue a notice to its common shareholders in connection with its monthly distribution that contains information about the amount and estimated sources of the distribution and other related information. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2024 will be made after the end of 2024 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.

The company also reports advancements in next-generation effector chemistry to improve the efficacy of approved antibody-drug conjugates. Vincerx plans to share more clinical data later this summer and at the 2024 European Hematology Association annual meeting. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The positive preliminary data for VIP236, which is showing tumor reduction in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic solid tumors, is a promising development in oncology. As an oncologist, the potential to extend treatment options for patients who have exhausted standard therapies is of high interest. The fact that VIP236 is well tolerated with no severe adverse events at this stage is noteworthy, as it could indicate a better quality of life for patients during treatment. Moreover, the absence of dose-limiting toxicity suggests that higher doses could be administered, possibly leading to better outcomes. The early efficacy of VIP236 after just two doses also suggests potential for significant clinical benefit with continued treatment.However, it's important to maintain a cautious optimism until more data is available. The long-term efficacy and safety must be evaluated in larger studies. Additionally, the impact on overall survival and quality of life, key metrics in cancer treatment efficacy, will be critical to assess. The oncology community will be keenly awaiting further results from the ongoing studies. Medical Research Analyst The pharmacokinetic (PK) data for VIP943 showing very little free payload in circulation aligns with the favorable safety profile observed in preclinical and clinical settings. From a research perspective, this data is significant as it indicates a potentially lower risk of off-target effects, which is a common challenge with antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The ability of Vincerx's VersAptx platform to enhance the efficacy of two approved ADCs, TRODELVY and ENHERTU, in preclinical models is an encouraging sign for the platform's versatility and potential impact on the future of cancer therapy.It is important to consider that preclinical success does not always translate to clinical efficacy. The next steps will involve validating these in vitro findings in vivo, which will be a determining factor for the future development of these compounds. The eventual goal is to translate these findings into clinically meaningful benefits, which would be a significant milestone for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Vincerx Pharma regarding their ADCs, VIP236 and VIP943, has the potential to impact the company's market position. The positive preliminary clinical data and the preclinical findings using their VersAptx platform to improve existing ADCs could attract investor interest and possibly lead to partnerships or collaborations. This is particularly relevant as the oncology market is highly competitive and innovation-driven.Investors will likely monitor the progress of Vincerx's pipeline closely, especially as additional data is expected to be presented later this year. While the company's stock may respond positively to these early results, the true test will be the completion of clinical trials and the potential for regulatory approval. The long-term value of Vincerx's technology will be determined by its ability to deliver marketable products that offer clear benefits over existing treatments. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM VIP236 demonstrated positive signs of clinical activity, including tumor reduction, and an improved safety profile in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic solid tumors VIP943 pharmacokinetic (PK) data shows very little free payload in circulation, consistent with the favorable safety profile observed preclinically and clinically In preclinical studies, Vincerx’s next-generation effector chemistry improves the efficacy of two approved antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), highlighting VersAptx™ platform’s potential to advance cancer therapies Management to host a virtual investor event today at 2:00 PM PDT / 5:00 PM EDT PALO ALTO, Calif., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vincerx Pharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: VINC), a biopharmaceutical company aspiring to address the unmet medical needs of patients with cancer through paradigm-shifting therapeutics, today presented positive preliminary Phase 1 data for VIP236 and updates on pipeline progress at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024. “The positive preliminary data we’ve reported for VIP236 and VIP943, coupled with preclinical findings leveraging our VersAptx platform to improve the efficacy of TRODELVY® and ENHERTU®, two marketed ADCs, underscore the power of our platform approach for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors,” said Ahmed Hamdy, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Vincerx. “The early VIP236 data demonstrated positive clinical activity, including tumor reductions. This represents significant promise for patients who have exhausted standard anticancer therapy options with many different tumor types, including tumors not usually responsive to camptothecin-derived therapies. Dose escalation continues in the VIP236 and VIP943 first-in-human studies. As we advance into higher dose levels, we look forward to sharing more clinical data for VIP236 later this summer and for VIP943 on or around the 2024 European Hematology Association annual meeting.” Raquel Izumi, Ph.D., President and Chief Operating Officer of Vincerx added, “The main objectives of a Phase 1 dose-escalation study are to assess safety and tolerability while establishing an optimal dose and schedule, so seeing dose-dependent clinical activity at this point in the development of VIP236 is exciting. We are still in dose escalation and are starting to see tumor reduction after only two doses. We expect to see responses deepen with more time on treatment and as we continue to escalate.” Vivek Subbiah, M.D., Chief of Early-Phase Drug Development at Sarah Cannon Research Institute commented, ""In the oncology landscape, ADCs have emerged as a new and encouraging treatment option for people facing cancer. With a decade of invaluable insights in ADC drug development, we are transitioning from first to second to third generations, and the imperative now is for novel mechanisms of action. Innovations like VIP236's optimized camptothecin, which can potentially circumvent some of the known camptothecin liabilities and issues with drug resistance, deliver a potent payload from a clinically validated drug class. The goal is to deliver best-in-class therapies to meet the urgent needs of patients battling advanced cancers.” VIP236 Updates Study VNC-236-101 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 dose-escalation study with monotherapy VIP236 for the treatment of patients with metastatic tumors who have exhausted all standard therapy options. The study's main objective is to determine a safe dose and schedule for VIP236 for further clinical development.Fifteen patients have been dosed to date on the once every three weeks (Q3W) schedule. Sequential dose-escalation cohorts with the Q3W schedule were 0.2 mg/kg (n=2), 0.4 mg/kg (n=5), 0.6 mg/kg (n=5), and 0.8 mg/kg (n=3). Results of the Q3W schedule (n=15) show: The patient population is typical of a Phase 1 study with heavily pretreated patients and a wide range of tumor types.The Q3W schedule is well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in any patients, and no patients have discontinued VIP236 due to an adverse event. Importantly, no severe or life-threatening diarrhea has been observed, validating the purposeful design of VIP236’s optimized camptothecin payload.First efficacy assessment was at the end of cycle 2 (i.e. after only two doses on the Q3W schedule). Seven patients have achieved objective stable disease, including tumor reduction. Four patients remain on study with the longest treated patient on study for 168 days. Dose escalation continues on the Q3W schedule. Vincerx anticipates presenting additional Phase 1 data for VIP236 later this summer. VIP943 Updates Study VNC-943-101 is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 dose-escalation study with monotherapy VIP943 for the treatment of patients with CD123+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML), B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who have exhausted standard therapeutic options. The study's main objective is to determine a safe dose and schedule for VIP943 for further clinical development.VIP943 is administered once per week. Three patients were dosed in Cohort 1 (0.2 mg/kg) and four patients were dosed in Cohort 2 (0.4 mg/kg).Despite the initial low doses in the study, all seven sequentially enrolled patients completed the 28-day DLT evaluation period. Five out of seven received a cycle 2 dose and two of these patients started cycle 3. One patient with MDS is still on study on cycle 3.No DLTs occurred in Cohort 1 and 2. Four patients have been enrolled in Cohort 3 (0.7 mg/kg) and are undergoing DLT assessment.VIP943 PK data shows very little free payload in circulation, consistent with the favorable safety profile observed preclinically and clinically.As the study progresses through the dose escalation, Vincerx will present additional Phase 1 data for VIP943 on or around the 2024 European Hematology Association Annual Meeting in June 2024. New In Vitro Solid Tumor Data Today Vincerx also reported preclinical experiments applying the next-generation effector chemistry of its VersAptx platform to the antibodies of approved ADCs, TRODELVY and ENHERTU, demonstrating the potential to improve tumor toxicity of ADCs by orders of magnitude.In in vitro tumor models, Vincerx’s sacituzumab-legumain-KSPi ADC had a 20-fold improvement in tumor toxicity compared with TRODELVY (sacituzumab-govitecan). The company’s trastuzumab-legumain-KSPi ADC demonstrated an 8-fold increase in tumor toxicity compared with ENHERTU (fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan).These findings further support the versatility of VersAptx to address multiple cancer types, including solid tumors, and increase the efficacy and safety of ADCs. Further studies will be conducted in animal models. Virtual Investor Event Vincerx will host a virtual investor event featuring company management and key opinion leaders to review preliminary clinical data from its Phase 1 dose-escalation study of VIP236 and provide an update on pipeline progress today at 2:00 PM PDT/ 5:00 PM EDT.

About VIP236 VIP236, the first-in-class small molecule drug conjugate (SMDC) from the VersAptx Platform, consists of an αvβ3 integrin binder, a neutrophil elastase linker cleaved in the tumor microenvironment, and a camptothecin payload optimized for high permeability and low active efflux. VIP236 was designed to deliver its payload to advanced/metastatic tumors that express αvβ3. Preclinical data show enhanced efficacy, independent of HER2 status, in patient-derived and cell line-derived gastric cancer models compared with ENHERTU®, an approved ADC. VIP236 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial treating patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (NTC05371054). About VIP943 VIP943, the first ADC from the VersAptx platform, consists of an anti-CD123 antibody, a unique linker cleaved intracellularly by legumain, and a novel kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi) payload enhanced with our CellTrapper® technology. The next-generation effector chemistry (linker + payload with CellTrapper) was designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload and ensure payload accumulation in cancer cells versus healthy cells. The increased therapeutic index has the potential to address challenges associated with many ADCs by improving efficacy and reducing severe toxicities. VIP943 is in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial evaluating patients with relapsed/refractory AML, B-ALL, and MDS who have exhausted standard therapeutic options (NCT06034275). About VersAptx Platform VersAptx is a versatile and adaptable next-generation bioconjugation platform. The modular nature of this innovative platform allows for the combination of different targeting, linker, and payload technologies to develop bespoke bioconjugates to address different cancer biologies. With this platform, (i) antibodies and small molecules can be used to target different tumor antigens, (ii) linkers can be designed to reduce non-specific release of the payload, cleave intracellularly or extracellularly, and conjugate to single or multiple payloads, and (iii) payloads can be designed with reduced permeability using the CellTrapper technology to ensure accumulation in cancer cells or to be permeable for release in the tumor microenvironment. The VersAptx platform allows for the optimization of these technologies to a specific target and the development of bioconjugates designed to address the safety and efficacy challenges of many ADCs and the needs of cancer patients.

The property is now 89% leased, solidifying its position as the top office building in Downtown Bismarck. The company navigated challenges to facilitate KLJ's move-in amidst Covid and monetary tightening. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The commencement of KLJ Engineering LLC's lease at Presidio Property Trust's Grand Pacific Center marks a positive development for the company's real estate portfolio. The lease agreement contributes to an increase in annualized base rent, which is a significant metric for REITs as it directly impacts their revenue streams. The occupancy rate, now at 89%, is a strong indicator of the property's desirability and competitive positioning in the local market.An uptick in occupancy levels generally leads to a more stable income for REITs, which can be attractive to investors looking for consistent returns. Furthermore, the ability of Presidio to navigate complex improvement projects and secure long-term leases during economically challenging times is indicative of robust management and operational efficiency. These factors could potentially result in increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the company's stock performance. Market Research Analyst By attracting KLJ Engineering LLC as a tenant, Presidio Property Trust not only enhances its own revenue but also contributes to the economic vitality of Downtown Bismarck. The presence of a large tenant can create a halo effect, attracting other businesses and increasing the overall demand for local services. This synergy can lead to a positive feedback loop, reinforcing the property's status as a prime office location.However, it's important to monitor the broader economic environment, including the effects of monetary tightening and past challenges due to Covid, as these factors can influence commercial real estate dynamics. Investors should consider these external variables when evaluating the long-term sustainability of such positive leasing activities. Financial Analyst The addition of $536,080 in annualized base rent to Presidio's financials is a noteworthy figure, particularly when contextualized within the REIT's overall portfolio size and revenue. This increase should be considered alongside other financial metrics such as funds from operations (FFO), debt levels and dividend payout ratios, which are critical for assessing a REIT's performance and stability.Investors often look at the occupancy rate as a proxy for asset quality and management effectiveness. An 89% occupancy rate, especially in a market like Bismarck that may not have the same demand elasticity as larger urban centers, is a testament to the property's appeal. The impact of this lease on Presidio's financials could be material if it significantly contributes to the company's FFO, a key measure used by investors to assess a REIT's operating performance. 04/08/2024 - 05:03 PM SAN DIEGO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / (NASDAQ:SQFT)(NASDAQ:SQFTP) Presidio Property Trust, Inc.

ASUR Announces Total Passenger Traffic for March 2024,2024-04-08T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASR) reports a 6.6% increase in passenger traffic for March 2024 compared to March 2023, with notable growth in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. International traffic drove Mexico's growth, while Puerto Rico saw increases in both domestic and international traffic. Colombia reported growth in both segments as well.","ASUR Announces Total Passenger Traffic for March 2024 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASR) reports a 6.6% increase in passenger traffic for March 2024 compared to March 2023, with notable growth in Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. International traffic drove Mexico's growth, while Puerto Rico saw increases in both domestic and international traffic. Colombia reported growth in both segments as well. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in passenger traffic for Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste indicates a positive trend in the aviation sector within its operating regions. The growth in international traffic, particularly in Mexico and Colombia, suggests a recovery in tourism and business travel. This uptick may be partially attributed to seasonal factors, as the Holy Week holiday period shifted from April in 2023 to March in 2024, potentially influencing travel patterns.Investors should note the mixed performance in domestic traffic, with Mexico experiencing a decline. This could signal a shift in consumer behavior or competitive dynamics within the domestic market. The robust growth in international traffic, however, may compensate for this dip, supporting revenue stability. The data points to a strategic focus on international routes, which could be a deliberate move to capitalize on higher-yielding international passenger segments. Financial Analyst An analysis of the financial implications of the traffic increase reveals potential for higher revenue streams for ASUR, especially from international traffic, which often generates more revenue per passenger due to longer distances and higher spend. The year-to-date growth figures, while modest, are indicative of an upward trajectory that could lead to improved financial performance.However, the decline in domestic traffic in Mexico, the company's largest market, warrants attention. Investors should consider the potential impact on ancillary revenues, such as parking and retail, which are typically correlated with passenger volumes. The company's ability to manage costs amid fluctuating domestic demand will be critical to maintaining profitability. Aviation Industry Analyst The detailed breakdown of traffic by airport and type (domestic vs. international) provides insight into regional market dynamics. For instance, the significant increase in international traffic at Cancun and Cozumel underscores the enduring appeal of these destinations for international tourists. Conversely, the marked decrease in domestic traffic at Cancun may reflect economic factors or increased competition from other modes of transport or destinations.It is also important to understand the airport-specific factors affecting traffic flows. For example, infrastructure constraints or improvements, route development strategies and changes in airline capacities can all influence passenger numbers. The data suggests that ASUR's diversified portfolio across multiple countries and a mix of tourist and business destinations could mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations or competitive pressures. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Passenger traffic increased year-on-year by 3.4% in Mexico and 16.0% in Puerto Rico and 9.4% in Colombia MEXICO CITY, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V.

Ben-Natan, a key figure in Harmonic's broadband business, is set to lead the company's future growth and innovation.","Harmonic Announces CEO Succession Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Harmonic (NASDAQ: HLIT) announces Patrick Harshman's retirement as President & CEO, with Nimrod Ben-Natan succeeding him effective June 11, 2024. The company concludes its Video Business Strategic Review Process and updates its Q1 2024 Revenue Guidance. Ben-Natan, a key figure in Harmonic's broadband business, is set to lead the company's future growth and innovation. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The appointment of Nimrod Ben-Natan as the new CEO of Harmonic marks a significant transition in leadership, which could have implications for investor sentiment and the company's strategic direction. Leadership changes at the top level often lead to shifts in corporate strategy, which can impact stock performance based on how well the market perceives the incoming CEO's ability to drive growth.Ben-Natan's internal promotion suggests a degree of continuity, which might be reassuring to investors. His background in pioneering Harmonic's virtualized broadband technology indicates a continued focus on innovation within the company. This is particularly relevant given the growing demand for advanced broadband solutions and cloud streaming.However, the update on the strategic review of the Video business suggests that there are challenges ahead. The conclusion that current market conditions do not support the company's value creation objectives for the Video business could be a cause for concern. Investors might interpret this as a sign that the Video segment is struggling to keep up with market trends or facing stiff competition. Financial Analyst The updated first quarter 2024 revenue guidance is a critical piece of information for investors, as it provides a snapshot of the company's financial health and expected performance. The projected revenue range of $121 million to $123 million is a concrete figure that analysts and investors will use to benchmark against previous quarters and forecasts. The segmentation of revenue expectations between the Broadband and Video segments offers insight into the relative strength of each division.While the Broadband segment seems to be expected to perform strongly, contributing the majority of the revenue, the Video segment's lower contribution could raise questions about its long-term viability and profitability. Investors will be closely monitoring the upcoming Investor Day for clarity on the long-term strategy and growth plans, which will be important for assessing the future potential of both business units. Corporate Strategy Expert The strategic review process and the decision to focus on driving profitable growth in the Video business by streamlining operations and optimizing cost structures is a move that indicates Harmonic is looking to improve efficiency and profitability. This could be a positive development for investors who are looking for the company to tighten its operations in response to challenging market conditions.However, the mention that the Board remains open to further opportunities and alternatives suggests that the Video business could still be under consideration for sale or restructuring if the right opportunity arises. This openness to strategic alternatives is a double-edged sword; it could lead to lucrative deals or partnerships, but it also adds an element of uncertainty regarding the future of this business unit. 04/08/2024 - 04:30 PM Nimrod Ben-Natan to Succeed Patrick Harshman as President & CEO, Effective June 11, 2024 Concludes Video Business Strategic Review Process Updates First Quarter 2024 Revenue Guidance SAN JOSE, Calif., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Harmonic (NASDAQ: HLIT) today announced that Patrick Harshman will retire as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective June 11, 2024. Nimrod Ben-Natan, currently Senior Vice President and General Manager of Harmonic's Broadband business, has been appointed as Mr. Harshman's successor by Harmonic's Board of Directors. Mr. Harshman will work with the Board and Mr. Ben-Natan to ensure a smooth transition. Mr. Ben-Natan joined Harmonic in 1996 as a software engineer to design and develop its first-generation video transmission platform. He has led Harmonic's Broadband business as Senior Vice President and General Manager since 2012. Mr. Ben-Natan has been a key driving force in the advancement of next-generation broadband networks, and his visionary leadership has been instrumental in pioneering the development and widespread deployment of the Company's Emmy award-winning cOS™ virtualized broadband technology. ""On behalf of the entire Board, I'd like to thank Patrick for his leadership and service to Harmonic, guiding the Company through multiple strategic transformations over the years. It has been a real pleasure to work with him all these years and we wish him success, good health and happiness in the next chapter of his life. We are pleased that his expertise will be available to support Nimrod and the Board in this transition,"" said Patrick Gallagher, Chair of the Harmonic Board of Directors. Gallagher continued, ""As part of a thoughtful succession planning process, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both internal and external candidates with the support of a leading search firm. Nimrod was the standout – his leadership has been pivotal in the rapid growth of the Company's groundbreaking and market-leading virtualized broadband access solutions. He is admired and respected by our employees and customers, and the Board is confident that his strategic vision, experience and business acumen will drive Harmonic's future success."" ""Leading Harmonic has been the privilege of a lifetime and I am proud of what we have accomplished,"" said Harshman. ""Together, we strategically re-positioned the Company as a worldwide leader in next-generation broadband solutions and video streaming and delivery solutions, successfully expanding our customer base, international presence and product portfolio. Nimrod is ideally suited to lead Harmonic and our talented global team into its next chapter of innovation and growth."" ""I am energized and excited to step into the CEO position,"" added Nimrod Ben-Natan. ""I look forward to collaborating with the Board and our Harmonic team to build on the strong foundation we have established as we continue to revolutionize broadband networks and cloud streaming."" Video Business Review UpdateAs previously announced in October 2023, Harmonic's Board of Directors initiated a formal strategic review process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the Company's Video business with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors. After carefully evaluating a range of alternatives, the Board concluded its review and determined that current market conditions do not support its value creation objectives for the Video business. The go-forward strategy for Harmonic's Video business will be centered on driving profitable growth by focusing on scalable market opportunities, streamlining operations and optimizing its cost structure. Consistent with its ongoing focus on value creation, the Board is always open to further opportunities and alternatives should they arise.

Quarterly revenue floor adjusted to $100 million until December 31, 2024, and then to $110 million. Debt reduced by $4 million, minimum liquidity covenant lowered to $18 million. Business strategy focuses on expanding sales channels to enhance profitability and cash flow. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Beachbody Company's recent amendment of its financial covenants with Blue Torch Capital is a strategic move that reflects the company's current financial health and future expectations. By reducing the loan balance from $50 million to $25.5 million and adjusting the revenue covenants, BODi is signaling confidence in its ability to meet its profitability and free cash flow targets. This debt reduction could potentially improve the company's leverage ratios, a key metric for investors when assessing financial stability.Furthermore, the reduction of the minimum liquidity covenant aligns with the lower outstanding debt, potentially easing the company's liquidity position and providing more operational flexibility. It's noteworthy that BODi has managed to decrease its revenue breakeven point significantly, which may indicate improved operational efficiency and cost management.Investors should monitor BODi's future revenue figures to ensure they align with the revised covenants. If the company fails to meet these targets, it could face penalties or renegotiation of loan terms, which may have adverse effects on the stock price. Market Research Analyst Examining BODi's strategic shift towards expanding sales channels and optimizing profitability, it is clear that the company is focusing on leveraging its existing assets to turn around its business. This pivot to a more asset-light model, with a focus on fitness content and nutritional supplements, is a trend we are seeing across the health and fitness industry as companies adapt to changing consumer preferences and a competitive digital landscape.Positive free cash flow at a lower revenue threshold suggests an effective cost containment strategy, which is essential for BODi's long-term sustainability. As the company aims to reduce its breakeven revenue, it is important for stakeholders to understand how these changes might attract new customers or retain existing ones, thereby impacting market share and competitive positioning.From a market perspective, the support from Blue Torch Capital indicates a level of confidence in BODi's turnaround plan. Investors should consider how this partnership and the execution of the new business strategy could influence the company's market valuation and investor sentiment. Debt Market Analyst The amendment of the loan terms between BODi and Blue Torch Capital is particularly relevant in the context of the debt market. When a company like BODi pays down a portion of its debt and negotiates more favorable covenants, it often leads to a reassessment of the company's creditworthiness. The decrease in the quarterly revenue floor suggests that BODi has negotiated breathing room with its lender, which could be indicative of a stronger bargaining position due to improved financials or a robust turnaround strategy.Debt investors would be interested in the implications of these revised terms on the company's interest coverage ratio and overall cost of debt. A lower cost of debt could improve net income and cash flows, which are positive indicators for both debt and equity holders. However, the reduction in the minimum liquidity covenant could also imply a tighter liquidity scenario, which debt investors will need to watch closely.It is important to consider the broader economic environment, as interest rates and credit conditions can significantly impact the ability of companies like BODi to service their debt and access new capital. The company's proactive approach to managing its debt obligations could be a positive signal to the market, provided it continues to meet its revised financial covenants. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Beachbody Company, Inc. (NYSE: BODi) (“BODi” or the “Company”), a leading health and fitness company, today announced that it has amended certain financial covenants (and other terms) of its original $50 million term loan with Blue Torch Capital. The loan balance as of this date has been reduced to $25.5 million. “To more effectively synchronize our loan agreement with our profitability and free cash flow targets, we concluded that it was more strategically aligned with our priorities to adjust the conditions of our revenue covenant with Blue Torch Capital. The modified terms decrease the quarterly revenue floor to $100 million per quarter until December 31, 2024, and then to $110 million per quarter for the subsequent periods. These revisions are possible because of our ability to generate positive free cash flow at a much lower revenue threshold,"" said Carl Daikeler, BODi's Co-Founder and CEO. As part of the amendment, BODi is paying down $4 million in debt, reducing the outstanding balance to $25.5 million. The minimum liquidity covenant will be reduced by the same amount, from $22 million to $18 million. “The cornerstone of our turnaround initiative is our updated business strategy, which focuses on expanding sales channels of our rich fitness content and nutritional supplements to optimize profitability and cash generation from our asset base. We have successfully reduced our revenue breakeven from over $900 million in 2022 to less than $500 million in 2024 through a comprehensive rearchitecting of the business. The Blue Torch team has been exceptional in acknowledging the progress we have made in executing our turnaround plan, demonstrating their support of our overall strategy by collaborating with us to modify the terms of our agreement,"" said Mark Goldston, BODi’s Executive Chairman.

The fund's annualized distribution rate is 14.0% based on market price and 13.0% based on NAV. The Board reviews distributions quarterly based on income and gains. The fund has made six monthly distributions totaling $0.36 per share for Jan-Jun 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of distributions by the CBRE Global Real Estate Income Fund (IGR) is a significant event for shareholders and potential investors. The fund's current annualized distribution rate of 14.0% based on the market price and 13.0% based on the NAV is a substantial yield, particularly in the context of broader market dividend yields. However, the high distribution rate should be approached with caution, as it may include a return of capital, which is not a yield derived from investment income but rather a partial return of the investor's original investment.Investors should consider the sustainability of these distributions, especially since the estimated allocations indicate a large portion as return of capital (62%). This could signal that the fund is not generating enough income from its investments to cover the distributions, which might lead to a depletion of capital over time. This is particularly relevant for those relying on this income for retirement or other income needs. The fund's focus on real estate securities, primarily through REITs, means that its performance is closely tied to the health of the real estate market, which can be cyclical and influenced by factors such as interest rates and economic growth. Tax Advisor From a taxation perspective, the nature of the distributions made by IGR is of interest. The fund's distributions are composed of net investment income, net realized short-term and long-term capital gains and return of capital. For tax purposes, these components are treated differently. Investment income and short-term capital gains are generally taxed at ordinary income rates, while long-term capital gains may benefit from lower tax rates. The return of capital is not taxed immediately but reduces the shareholder's cost basis, which could lead to higher capital gains taxes when the shares are sold.It is important for investors to note that the estimated allocations are not for tax reporting purposes and that the actual allocations for tax purposes will only be finalized after the fiscal year-end. Adjustments under tax regulations could lead to significant differences between what is reported for tax purposes and the estimates provided. Therefore, shareholders should be prepared for potential discrepancies and ensure they understand the tax implications of their investments in IGR. Market Analyst The closed-end fund structure of IGR allows for a fixed number of shares and can trade at a premium or discount to the NAV. The declared distributions and the fund's high yield could affect the fund's market price, potentially narrowing or widening the gap between the market price and the NAV. An investor's decision to buy, hold, or sell the fund's shares could be influenced by these factors, as well as the fund's performance relative to its peers and the broader market's real estate sector.While the fund's distribution policy aims to closely approximate its net investment income and net realized capital gains, the market's response to this policy could vary. Investors often seek funds with stable or growing distributions, but a high return of capital component could be viewed unfavorably. Additionally, the fund's performance and the real estate market outlook presented in the upcoming webinar could provide further insights into the fund's strategies and market conditions, which could impact investor sentiment and the fund's market price. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Trustees of the CBRE Global Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE: IGR) (the “Fund”) has declared three distributions of $0.06 per share for the months of April, May and June 2024 ($0.18 per share in total).

WEBINAR REGISTRATION - Zoom IGR’s current annualized distribution rate is 14.0% based on the closing market price of $5.16 on April 4, 2024, and 13.0% based on a closing NAV of $5.55 as of the same date. Future earnings of the Fund cannot be guaranteed, and the Fund’s distribution policy is subject to change. For more information on the Fund, please visit www.cbreim.com/igr. The Fund’s monthly distribution is set by its Board of Trustees. The Board reviews the Fund’s distribution on a quarterly basis in view of its net investment income, realized and unrealized gains, and other net unrealized appreciation or income expected during the remainder of the year. The Fund strives to establish a level monthly distribution that, over the course of the year, will serve to distribute an amount closely approximating the Fund’s net investment income and net realized capital gains during the year. CBRE Global Real Estate Income Fund is a closed-end fund, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and invests primarily in real estate securities. Holdings are subject to change. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. For the period from January 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024, the Fund has made or declared six (6) regular monthly distributions totaling $0.36 per share. The sources of the distribution declared for each month and the full period from January 1, 2024, to June 30, 2024, are estimated as follows: Estimated Source of Distributions: Estimated Allocations Distribution Net Investment Income Net Realized Short- Term Capital Gains Net Realized Long- Term Capital Gains Return of Capital Monthly $0.06 $0.008 (13%) $0.008 (14%) $0.007 (11%) $0.037 (62%) Period: 01/01/2024 - 06/30/2024 $0.36 $0.046 (13%) $0.050 (14%) $0.039 (11%) $0.225 (62%) The allocations reported in this notice are only estimates and are not provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual allocations will depend on the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and will not be finalized until after year-end. In addition, the allocations reported to shareholders for tax reporting purposes will also reflect adjustments required under applicable tax regulations. Some of these tax adjustments are significant, and amounts reported to you for tax reporting may be substantially different than those presented in this notice. SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE SENT A FORM 1099-DIV FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR INDICATING HOW TO REPORT FUND DISTRIBUTIONS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. The estimated allocations presented above are based on the Fund’s monthly calculation of its year-to-date net investment income, capital gains and returns of capital. The Fund’s investment income is mainly comprised of distributions received from the real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other companies in which it invests. “Net investment income” refers to the Fund’s investment income offset by its expenditures, which include the fees paid to the investment adviser and other service providers. “Net realized capital gains” represents the aggregation of the capital gains and losses realized by the Fund from its purchase and sale of investment securities during the year-to-date period. Short-term capital gains are those arising from the sale of securities held by the Fund for less than one year. Long-term capital gains are those arising from the sale of securities held by the Fund for a year or more. The amount of net realized capital gains may also be offset by capital losses realized in prior years. Adjustments to net investment income are made based on the character of distributions received by the Fund. A portion of the distributions the Fund receives from REITs will be characterized by the REITs as capital gains or returns of capital. Because REITs often reclassify the distributions they make, the Fund does not know the ultimate character of these distributions at the time they are received, so the Fund estimates the character based on historical information. The Fund’s net investment income is reduced by the amounts characterized by the REITs as capital gains and returns of capital. Amounts characterized by the REITs as capital gains are added to the Fund’s net realized capital gains. Amounts characterized by the REITs as return of capital are classified as such by the Fund. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s managed distribution policy. The performance and distribution rate information disclosed in the table below is based on the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”). The Fund’s NAV is calculated as the total market value of all the securities and other assets held by the Fund minus the total value of its liabilities. Performance figures are not meant to represent individual shareholder performance. The value of a shareholder’s investment in the Fund is determined by the market price of the Fund’s shares. The Fund’s Cumulative Total Return for fiscal year 2024 (January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Cumulative Total Return and the Fund’s Cumulative Distribution Rate for 2024, as well as its Current Annualized Distribution Rate. Moreover, the Fund’s Average Annual Total Return for the preceding five-year period (April 1, 2019 through March 31, 2024) is set forth below. Shareholders should take note of the relationship between the Fund’s Average Annual Total Return and its Average Annual Distribution Rate for the preceding five-year period.

Annual Total Return is the percentage change in the Fund’s NAV over a year including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions. 4 Average Annual Distribution Rate is the simple arithmetic average of the Annual Distribution Rates for the preceding five-year period.

NRSInsights’ March 2024 Retail Same-Store Sales Report,2024-04-08T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"NRSInsights reported a 7.2% increase in same-store sales for March 2024 compared to the previous year. The average prices rose by 0.7% year-over-year, with notable growth in beverage categories and cooking/baking items. The NRS network comprises around 29,800 active terminals serving various retail outlets nationwide.","NRSInsights’ March 2024 Retail Same-Store Sales Report Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NRSInsights reported a 7.2% increase in same-store sales for March 2024 compared to the previous year. The average prices rose by 0.7% year-over-year, with notable growth in beverage categories and cooking/baking items. The NRS network comprises around 29,800 active terminals serving various retail outlets nationwide. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 7.2% year-over-year increase in same-store sales for March 2024 is a significant indicator of consumer spending resilience, especially when compared to the 3.5% increase in February. This rise suggests a robust consumer market, which can be an attractive point for investors looking at retail sector performance. The moderate price increase of 0.7% despite inflationary concerns indicates effective cost management and possibly strong pricing power within the retail network. However, the specific decline in Energy Drinks and Candy categories could suggest a shift in consumer preferences or a reaction to price changes in raw materials like cocoa and sugar.From a market research perspective, the divergence between the NRS network's performance and the US Commerce Department's data suggests that NRS's focus on urban, independent retailers might be capturing a segment of the market that is outperforming broader retail trends. This could be due to demographic factors or shopping preferences unique to urban consumers. Investors may find opportunities in companies that cater to or operate within similar demographics. Economist The data indicating that the number of items sold and average transactions per store have increased is a positive sign of economic activity. The growth in unit sales and transaction volume by 7.8% and 4.6% respectively points to a healthy demand side in the economy, despite any inflationary pressures. It is noteworthy that the dollar-weighted average price increase is relatively low, which could be due to subdued inflation or competitive pricing strategies. The fact that this increase is lower than the previous month's suggests a potential easing of inflation or strategic price adjustments by retailers.Looking at the broader economic implications, strong retail sales figures can contribute to GDP growth and indicate consumer confidence. However, it's important to monitor if this growth is sustainable or if it's driven by short-term factors such as seasonal variations. The mention of Easter's impact on sales is a case in point. An economist would also advise examining underlying factors such as employment rates and wage growth to assess whether this retail growth aligns with overall economic trends. Financial Analyst The reported outperformance of NRS network's same-store sales over the US Commerce Department's retail data could have implications for stock valuations within the retail sector. Investors often look for companies with strong same-store sales growth as it typically indicates underlying business health and potential for revenue expansion. The reported growth, especially in a period where inflationary pressures are present, may signal operational efficiency and market adaptability, which are key factors in investment decision-making.While the report provides a positive outlook, a financial analyst would caution investors to consider the sustainability of this growth. The data lacks adjustments for inflation and seasonal buying patterns, which are important for a holistic view of performance. Additionally, the decline in certain categories like Candy in March, despite a seasonal event like Easter, raises questions about consumer discretionary spending and could be a red flag for certain sub-sectors within retail. It's essential to analyze these trends within the context of broader economic conditions and sector-specific challenges before making investment decisions. 04/08/2024 - 05:00 PM March same-store sales jumped 7.2% year-over-year, the highest rate of increase since June 2023 Inflationary pressures remained subdued - average prices increased 0.7% year-over-year NEWARK, N.J., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NRSInsights, a provider of sales data and analytics drawn from retail transactions processed through the National Retail Solutions (NRS) point-of-sale (POS) platform, today announced comparative same-store sales results for March 2024. As of March 31, 2024, the NRS retail network comprised approximately 29,800 active terminals scanning purchases at independent retailers including bodegas, convenience stores, liquor stores, grocers, tobacco, and sundries sellers nationwide, predominantly serving urban consumers. March Retail Same-Store Sales Highlights (Same-store sales, unit sales, transactions, and average price data throughout this release refer to March 2024 unless otherwise noted. All comparisons are provided on a “per calendar day” basis to remove from consideration variability in the number of days per month.) Same-store sales increased 7.2% from a year earlier (March 2023). In February 2024, average sales had increased 3.5% compared to February 2023.Same-store sales per calendar day increased 6.6% compared to February 2024. Same-store sales per calendar day in February 2024 had increased 7.4% compared to January 2024.For the three months ended March 31, 2024, same-store sales per calendar day increased 3.3% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.The number of items sold increased 7.8% compared to March 2023. In February 2024, the number of items sold increased 4.4% per calendar day compared to February 2023.The average number of transactions per store increased 4.6% compared to March 2023. In February 2024, the average number of transactions per calendar day had increased 2.0% compared to February 2023.A dollar-weighted average of prices for the top 500 items purchased increased 0.7% year-over-year, a decrease from the 1.2% year-over-year increase recorded in February 2024. Commentary from Suzy Silliman (SVP, Data Strategy and Sales at NRS) “The NRS Network’s same-store sales were again strong in March, providing further evidence of continued resilience in consumer spending. Dollars, units, and traffic all tallied solid increases versus the year ago, while prices for our most popular items over the same period increased less than one percent. Standouts included increased sales of beverage categories across most alcoholic and non-alcoholic sub-categories with the notable exception of Energy Drinks, which were flat for the second consecutive month, breaking an extended growth trend.” “Turning to select seasonal trends…while same store sales for the Candy category rebounded in February with sequential and year-over-year gains, the momentum was not sustained in March. Candy unit sales decreased ~7% and dollars declined ~2% compared to March 2023. This is notable because Easter, which typically provides Candy with a strong seasonal lift, was in March this year, as opposed to in April in 2023. More granularly, within the Candy category, the increased price of chocolate and the barrage of media coverage on the spiking prices of cocoa and sugar likely contributed to the significant decreases in Chocolate and Confectionary sales this year. Many cooking and baking categories, on the other hand, enjoyed strong March sales versus the year ago, likely reflecting Easter timing.” Retail Trade Comparative Data The table below provides historical comparative data with the U.S. Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade same-store sales data excluding food service: Over the past twelve months, the NRS network’s three-month moving average same-store sales have outpaced the US Commerce Department’s Advance Monthly Retail Trade data excluding food services by 4.5% percentage points, on average. The NRSInsights data have not been adjusted to reflect inflation, demographic distributions, seasonal buying patterns, item substitution, or other factors that may facilitate comparisons to other periods, to other same-store retail sales data, or to the U.S. Commerce Department’s retail data. NRSInsights Reports The NRSInsights monthly Same-Store Retail Sales Reports are intended to provide timely topline data reflective of sales at NRS’ network of independent, predominantly urban, retail stores. Same-store data comparisons of March 2024 with March 2023 are derived from approximately 172 million transactions processed through the 17,336 stores on the NRS network that scanned transactions in both months. Same-store data comparisons of March 2024 with February 2024 are derived from approximately 216 million transactions processed through 24,745 stores. Same-store data comparisons for the three months ended March 31, 2024 with the year-ago three months are derived from approximately 460 million scanned transactions processed through the stores that were in the NRS network in both quarters.

Hecla Announces First Quarter Production,2024-04-08T21:25:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Hecla Mining Company (HL) reported a 43% increase in silver production in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter. Gold production remained steady, with significant production increases at Greens Creek and Lucky Friday mines. Positive outlook for continued growth in production.","Hecla Announces First Quarter Production Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hecla Mining Company (HL) reported a 43% increase in silver production in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter. Gold production remained steady, with significant production increases at Greens Creek and Lucky Friday mines. Positive outlook for continued growth in production. Positive Significant 43% increase in silver production for Hecla Mining Company in Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023. Gold production remained consistent with 36,592 ounces produced in the first quarter. Greens Creek saw a 10% increase in silver production and steady gold production. Lucky Friday mine achieved full production with 1.1 million ounces of silver produced. Keno Hill experienced a 29% increase in throughput as ramp-up continues. Lead production surged by 129% and zinc production increased by 28% due to Lucky Friday's ramp-up. Positive remarks from President and CEO Phillips S. Baker, Jr. on the strong performance of the mines and overall production growth. Casa Berardi mine transitioning to a fully surface operation as planned for continued efficiency. Hecla Mining Company is on track to meet production targets for the year. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported 43% increase in silver production represents a significant operational milestone for Hecla Mining Company, which could have a positive effect on the company's financial performance. This surge in production volume, particularly from the Lucky Friday mine reaching full production and the ramp-up at Keno Hill, indicates improved operational efficiency and resource management. The increase in lead and zinc production by 129% and 28% respectively, due to the ramp-up at Lucky Friday, further diversifies the company's mineral portfolio, potentially mitigating risks associated with price volatility in the commodities market.Investors may interpret these developments as a signal of robust growth potential, which could lead to increased investor confidence and a potential uptick in stock value. However, it is essential to monitor commodity prices, as an increase in output might not translate into proportional revenue growth if prices are unfavorable. Additionally, the transition of Casa Berardi to a fully surface operation suggests a strategic pivot that could reduce operational costs and improve safety, although it may entail significant upfront capital expenditures. Financial Analyst The substantial increase in production volume for Hecla Mining could lead to an improved gross margin, assuming sales prices remain constant or increase. It's essential to consider the cost implications of the increased production; if the ramp-up led to a significant increase in costs, the net impact on profitability might be less pronounced. Investors should look for the upcoming detailed financial results to assess the cost-per-ounce metrics and the impact on the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).Furthermore, the company's ability to maintain gold production levels consistent with the previous quarter, despite the increased throughput, suggests operational stability. This consistency is vital for forecasting future performance and maintaining market expectations. The operational updates could serve as a precursor to a positive earnings surprise, which would be a bullish indicator for the stock. However, the market will also be keen on understanding the sustainability of these production levels and any guidance revisions for future quarters. Mining Sector Analyst The mining sector is highly capital-intensive and Hecla's announcement indicates a successful completion of a significant phase of capital investment, particularly in the Lucky Friday and Keno Hill mines. The transition of Casa Berardi to a fully surface operation could signal a shift towards more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable mining practices, which is increasingly important to investors who are mindful of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.It is also worth noting that the increase in lead and zinc production positions Hecla to take advantage of market dynamics where these base metals are in demand, particularly with the growth in renewable energy technologies requiring such materials. However, the mining industry is subject to strict regulatory environments and any changes in mining policies or environmental regulations could impact Hecla's operations and, consequently, its stock performance. 04/08/2024 - 05:25 PM 43% increase in silver production over Q4 2023 COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) today announced its preliminary production results for the first quarter of 2024. HIGHLIGHTS 1st Quarter 2024 compared to 4th Quarter 2023 (“prior quarter”) Silver production of 4.2 million ounces, a 43% increase. Gold production of 36,592 ounces, in line with prior quarter. Greens Creek silver production increased 10% and gold production in line with prior quarter. Lucky Friday completed ramp-up to full production with 1.1 million ounces of silver produced. Keno Hill throughput increased 29% as the ramp-up continues. Lead production increased 129%; zinc production increased 28% due to ramp-up at Lucky Friday. “The 43% increase in silver production reflects the consistent, strong performance from Greens Creek, Lucky Friday’s reaching full production in March and Keno Hill continuing its ramp-up,"" said Phillips S. Baker, Jr., President and CEO. ""Casa Berardi continues to execute on its plan as it transitions to a fully surface operation."" Baker continued, “Hecla is on track to produce about 17 million ounces in 2024, expected to increase to about 20 million ounces by 2026. Silver is necessary for the energy transition - in 2023, silver used in solar increased about 35% to 190 million ounces with more growth expected. Hecla’s increasing production in safe jurisdictions well-positions our shareholders to benefit from the continuing deficit in silver supply.” OPERATIONS Greens Creek The Greens Creek mine produced 2.5 million ounces of silver, an increase of 10% over the prior quarter. Gold production was 14,588 ounces, unchanged over the prior quarter. The mill achieved throughput of 2,552 tons per day (tpd) during the quarter. Increased silver production was primarily due to higher throughput and a 4% increase in grades. Lucky Friday The Lucky Friday mine produced 1.1 million ounces of silver as the mine completed ramp-up to full production in March. Mill throughput was 948 tpd during the quarter. The Company continues to work with the property insurer and has collected $17.4 million of insurance proceeds during the quarter and expects to receive the remaining proceeds during the year. Casa Berardi The Casa Berardi mine produced 22,004 ounces of gold in the quarter, in line with the prior quarter, as a 5% increase in throughput was offset by lower grades. The mill operated at an average of 4,194 tpd during the quarter. Keno Hill Keno Hill produced 646,312 ounces of silver, an increase of 6% over the prior quarter. The increase in production was attributable to higher throughput, which averaged 277 tpd, an increase of 29% over the prior quarter, partially offset by lower silver grades which were 26.3 ounces per ton. The mine continues to advance ramp-up to full production, which is expected during the year. The Company continues to work through safety and environmental standards at the mine; with these standards driving the pace of production.

(CNS) reported preliminary assets under management of $81.2 billion as of March 31, 2024, showing an increase of $1.6 billion from the previous month. The growth was driven by net inflows of $183 million and market appreciation of $1.7 billion, partially offset by distributions of $298 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) by Cohen & Steers reflects a positive trajectory in the company's growth, which can be an indicator of both operational success and investor confidence. The net inflows, albeit modest compared to the total AUM, suggest that the firm is attracting new capital, which is a positive sign for potential investors. The market appreciation component of the AUM increase indicates that the existing portfolio holdings have performed well, contributing to the overall growth of the firm's assets.However, the distributions do present a point of concern as they can imply a cash outflow, which may affect the firm's liquidity and future investment capacity. It's important to monitor such distributions in relation to net inflows to assess the net capital gain or loss. For stakeholders, the short-term benefits include the potential for increased dividends or reinvestment into the firm, while long-term implications could involve sustained growth if the firm continues to manage assets effectively and attract new investments. Market Research Analyst Examining the distribution of AUM across different investment vehicles provides insights into the company's strategic positioning and market demand. Institutional accounts show a net positive flow, suggesting a strong trust in Cohen & Steers' management capabilities from larger entities. The differentiation between the Japan Subadvisory and Subadvisory excluding Japan highlights the firm's international reach and the varying regional dynamics that can affect asset flows and appreciation.For open-end and closed-end funds, the figures suggest a stable demand among retail investors, which is important for diversification of the investor base. The health of these funds is often a barometer for retail investor sentiment and can signal broader market trends. Stakeholders should consider these segments' performance as a reflection of the firm's adaptability and appeal to various investor classes. Economist From an economic perspective, the AUM growth can be seen as a microcosmic reflection of the broader financial market's health. The reported market appreciation suggests a favorable economic environment, which may indicate a bullish market or a sector-specific rally that Cohen & Steers has capitalized on. Such a trend, if sustained, could lead to increased investor wealth and consumer spending, which in turn could have positive ripple effects on the economy.However, it is vital to contextualize these figures within the macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rate trends, inflation and global economic events, which can significantly influence asset values and investor behavior. The ability of Cohen & Steers to navigate these conditions and maintain asset growth will be key for long-term stability and success. 04/08/2024 - 04:44 PM NEW YORK, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cohen & Steers, Inc.

Moreover, the biopharmaceutical industry is highly collaborative and disputes can sometimes disrupt existing partnerships or deter future collaborations.Understanding the specifics of the dispute and the industry's response is key. If peers in the sector are facing similar disputes, it could indicate an industry-wide issue that may lead to regulatory changes or shifts in market practices.

(""Medicure"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV:MPH)(OTCPINK:MCUJF), a company focused on the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals and healthcare products for patients and prescribers in the United States market, today reported its results from operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2023 Highlights:Recorded total net revenue of $21.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and;Recorded total net revenue of $5.1 million during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 compared to $6.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 and;Recorded total net revenue from the sale of AGGRASTAT® of $9.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and;Recorded total net revenue from the Marley Drug business of $9.6 million ($2.6 million from sales of ZYPITAMAG® , and $7.0 million from other pharmacy revenue) during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $7.8 million ($1.5 million from sales of ZYPITAMAG and $6.3 million from other pharmacy revenue)for the year ended December 31, 2022 and;Recorded net revenue through insured business from the sale of ZYPITAMAG of $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $3.6 million through insured business for the year ended December 31, 2022 and;Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA1) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.9 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and;Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $922,000 or $0.09 per share compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.13 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022; the net loss is due in large part to non-cash expenses including $1.6 million of amortization on the purchase of ZYPITAMAG and Marley Drug, and $288,000 of share based compensation expense on stock options granted to employees and directors during the current year.Financial ResultsNet AGGRASTAT product sales for the year ended December 31, 2023, were $9.7 million compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in AGGRASTAT® revenues compared to the previous year is the result of a decrease in the volume of AGGRASTAT® sold and pricing competition from generic tirofiban.ZYPITAMAG through insured channels contributed $2.4 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue through insured channels is primarily as a result of higher wholesaler fees and coverage gap payments, and lower reimbursement from pharmacy benefit managers. This amount does not include sales of ZYPITAMAG® through the Marley Drug business.The Marley Drug business contributed $9.6 million of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Marley Drug is a US pharmacy licensed to ship medications to all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. It serves thousands of customers and provides another channel for direct-to-consumer marketing, distribution and improved profit margin for ZYPITAMAG. The increase in revenue is a result of increased sales through marketing, fulfillment partnerships, its e-commerce platform, and increased sales of ZYPITAMAG.Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $1.9 million compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Decreased adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from lower AGGRASTAT net revenue and higher cost of goods, partially offset by lower R&D expenses.Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $922,000 or $0.09 per share compared to a net income of $1.4 million or $0.13 per share for the year ended December 31, 2022. The main factors contributing to the net loss recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 were lower net revenue and higher selling expenses, partially offset by lower R&D expenses.At December 31, 2023, the Company had unrestricted cash totaling $6.4 million, up from $4.9 million of unrestricted cash held as of December 31, 2022. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $2.1 million compared to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.All amounts referenced herein are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.The Company plans to hold an investor conference call in May 2024 to present the results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 with date and dial in information to be provided. The full financial statements are available at www.sedar.com and on the Company's website at www.medicure.com.NotesThe Company defines EBITDA as ""earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other income or expense"" and Adjusted EBITDA as ""EBITDA adjusted for non‑cash and non-recurring items"". The terms ""EBITDA"" and ""Adjusted EBITDA"", as it relates to the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 results prepared using IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning according to IFRS.

The Company executed NPA Amendment and second supplemental indenture, with a cash payment of $1.00 per $1,000 in principal amount of Notes expected. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent consent solicitation by Foundry JV Holdco LLC represents a strategic maneuver within the company's capital structure. By amending terms of the indenture, the company is likely addressing covenant terms that may have been restrictive, potentially improving financial flexibility. The consent of holders of over 50% of the notes underscores a cooperative stance between the company and its creditors, which can be interpreted as a positive signal in the market.From a financial standpoint, the amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement and the execution of the second supplemental indenture could result in changes to the interest coverage ratio or other debt covenants. This may have implications for the company's credit rating and borrowing costs. The payment of the Consent Fee, albeit minimal, indicates the company's willingness to incentivize stakeholders for their consent, which could have a minor impact on cash reserves. Legal Expert Completion of the consent solicitation process is a legal step that ensures the company's compliance with the governing indenture. It is important to understand that such amendments often involve negotiating leverage and the strategic interests of the note holders. The legal implications of the amendments, while not disclosed in detail, could include alterations to security packages, covenants, or other key terms that affect the rights and obligations of both the company and the note holders.It is also important to note that the execution of the second supplemental indenture indicates that the proposed amendments are now legally binding. This expedites the process of implementing the amendments, which can be critical in timing-sensitive financial strategies. Market Research Analyst The market's reaction to such amendments can vary. If the amendments are perceived as a sign of financial strength and strategic foresight, the company's stock might benefit. However, if the market interprets this as a sign of underlying financial stress that necessitated such amendments, it could negatively impact investor sentiment. The company's ability to secure the required consents without resorting to more costly incentives is a testament to their negotiation capabilities and the current rapport with their note holders.Moreover, the market will closely watch the operational changes that follow such amendments. Any subsequent increase in operational efficiency or reduction in financial distress could further influence investor perception and the company's valuation. 04/08/2024 - 08:36 PM HOUSTON, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Foundry JV Holdco LLC (the ""Company""), a Delaware limited liability company, today announced that it has successfully completed the previously announced consent solicitation (the ""Consent Solicitation"") in connection with its outstanding 5.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2034 (the ""Notes"") for amendments (the ""Proposed Amendments"") to the indenture, dated as of May 19, 2023 (as supplemented through the date hereof, the ""Indenture""), between the Company and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee, under which the Notes are governed.

The data highlights innovative gene editing, protein engineering, and manufacturing capabilities, including a dual-targeting CAR for B cell malignancies and enhanced protection against rejection through Allo-Evasion™ technology. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent presentation by Century Therapeutics at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024 has shed light on the advancements in their iPSC-derived cell therapy platform. The focus on immune evasion through HLA-G and HLA-E expression is particularly noteworthy. This approach could significantly improve the viability of allogeneic cell therapies by minimizing immune rejection, which has been a persistent challenge in the field. The multi-dosing strategy that Century is aiming for could indeed lead to more sustained and effective treatments, potentially benefiting patients with longer-lasting responses.Furthermore, the development of a novel CD19xCD22 dual-targeting CAR for B cell malignancies suggests the company is working towards addressing antigen escape, a common issue with current CAR-T therapies. By targeting two antigens simultaneously, the risk of tumor cells evading treatment is reduced, which could lead to more durable remissions in patients.The preclinical data presented, while still early, are important indicators of the potential impact on the treatment landscape for both hematologic and solid tumors. If these findings translate into clinical success, it could lead to a significant shift in investor sentiment, as the market for cell therapies continues to grow. As these therapies progress through clinical development, the implications for Century's valuation and the broader sector could be substantial. Oncology Doctor The advancements in allogeneic cell therapy presented by Century Therapeutics represent a significant leap in the treatment of cancer. The ability to evade natural killer cell-mediated rejection through the Allo-Evasion™ platform is a promising strategy that could lead to the broader applicability of cell therapies. The dual-targeting CAR for B cell malignancies is an innovative approach that addresses a critical need for therapies that can overcome the limitations of single-antigen targeting in oncology.From a clinical perspective, the potential for these therapies to provide deeper and more durable responses is exciting. This could translate into improved survival rates and quality of life for patients. However, the transition from preclinical to clinical efficacy is fraught with challenges and the real test will be in human trials. Should the technology prove effective in humans, it could revolutionize the way we approach cancer treatment and significantly impact the prognosis for patients with cancers that are currently difficult to treat. Biotech Market Analyst Century Therapeutics' presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation in the highly competitive field of cell therapy. The preclinical data suggest that Century is addressing some of the key challenges that have historically limited the efficacy of allogeneic therapies, such as immune rejection and antigen escape. Their approach could potentially expand the addressable market for CAR-T therapies, which is currently dominated by autologous treatments.From a market perspective, successful development of these therapies could position Century as a leader in the next wave of cell therapy products. Investors should monitor the progression of these therapies into clinical trials, as positive results could lead to significant market opportunities and partnerships. The potential for these therapies to provide solutions for both hematologic and solid tumors could make Century an attractive investment or acquisition target, especially for larger pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their oncology portfolios. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM PHILADELPHIA, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Century Therapeutics (NASDAQ: IPSC), an innovative biotechnology company developing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell therapies in immuno-oncology and autoimmune and inflammatory disease, today announced that preclinical data from the Company’s iPSC-derived cell therapy platform was presented at the AACR Annual Meeting 2024. The posters highlight the Company’s end-to-end capabilities in iPSC reprogramming and differentiation, gene editing, synthetic biology, protein engineering and computational biology. “Together, the promising preclinical data showcase Century’s continued dedication to driving the field of allogeneic cell therapy through the incorporation of a suite of innovations into next generation product candidates,” said Hy Levitsky, M.D., President of Research and Development at Century Therapeutics. “We presented new data advancing our Allo-Evasion™ platform through the transgenic expression of HLA-G, which along with HLA-E can augment the protection against host natural killer cell-mediated rejection of iPSC derived cells also engineered to resist T cell recognition through the elimination of HLA-I and HLA-II expression. This enhanced protection against rejection is designed to enable Century’s multi-dosing strategy that increases the period of drug exposure, potentially leading to deeper and more durable responses for patients in need. We also presented new data describing our novel, dual-targeting CAR for B cell mediated malignancies which demonstrated promising in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity and resisting antigen loss, and which we believe expands the potential of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy beyond currently available options in oncology that only target CD19. Along with other important preclinical data presented at AACR, the findings to date highlight our unique gene editing, protein engineering, and manufacturing capabilities that are the foundations of our industry-leading allogeneic cell therapy pipeline and platform.” Details of the posters presented on Sunday, April 7th and Monday, April 8th are as follows: The Discovery of a Novel CD19xCD22 Dual-Targeting CAR For the Development of an iPSC-Derived Cell TherapyPoster Board Number: 4 Session Title: Adoptive Cell Therapies 2: CAR-T CellsSession Date & Time: Sunday, April 7, 2024, at 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PT Through its industry leading engineering capabilities, Century has developed a CD19xCD22 bispecific, CD22 biparatopic chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which was transduced into primary T cells and demonstrated cytotoxicity activity against CD19 and CD22-positive tumor cells, as well as CD19 knockout and CD22 knockout cell lines in vitro and in in vivo mouse xenograft models. This novel CAR was engineered and tested in iPSC-derived gamma-delta T cells, showing in vitro tumor cell cytotoxicity. These findings support the continued examination of a CD19xCD22 bispecific CAR for off-the-shelf allogeneic cell therapy to expand patient access beyond CD19 CAR-T cell therapies. Engineered Expression Of HLA-E And HLA-G Protects iPSC-Derived Cells from Killing by Primary NK CellsPoster Board Number: 3Session Title: CAR-K, NK Engagers, and NK ModulatorsSession Date & Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, at 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM PT In this study, the Company showed that the combination of HLA-E and HLA-G expression was the most effective in protecting allogeneic drug products from elimination of genetically dissimilar cells. Investigators assessed allo-evasion from natural killer (NK) cells by iPSC-derived cells engineered to express HLA-E and -G. NK cells across donors expressed heterogeneous combinations of HLA-E and -G ligands. K562 and iPSC-derived cells lacking HLA-I were susceptible to killing by PBMCs. Overexpression of HLA-E and -G offered protection to K562 and iPSC-derived cells against all tested donors. HLA-E offered more protection than HLA-G, and the combination of both HLA-E and -G was most potent. When a genetically dissimilar HLA Class I protein family is deleted to prevent T cell mediated graft rejection, expression of the more-conserved HLA-E and -G can effectively protect allogeneic drug products from elimination. We believe this data further reinforces the Company’s proprietary Allo-Evasion™ technology and its potential to evade identification by the host immune system, which would allow for repeat dosing without rejection, enabling increased persistence of the cells during the treatment period and potentially leading to deeper and more durable responses. Screening iPSC Lines for Optimal Characteristics of Differentiation into Immune Effector Cells for Clinical ProgramsPoster Board Number: 19Session Title: Adoptive Cellular Therapy 1Session Date & Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, at 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PT Century outlined the genomic characterization of both its clinical-grade PBMC-derived and its gamma-delta T cell-derived iPSC lines (PiPSCs and TiPSCs, respectively). The Company successfully reprogrammed these cell lines from multiple donors and analyzed them through its genomic characterization pipeline and tiered them based on potential genetic liabilities to determine those best suited for clinical development. Multiple lines were then identified and iPSC and TiPSC were successfully differentiated to immune effector cells. d35 iT cells exhibited diverse phenotypes, yields, and function. These lines can then be specialized into effector cells exhibiting heightened functionality, applicable to conditions including autoimmune disorders and oncology indications, among others. Once differentiated, Century further screened the lines for their in vitro cytotoxicity and post target-engagement persistence, thereby discovering those that were most suitable for further clinical development. Discovery of a Novel NECTIN4 iPSC-derived Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Solid TumorsPoster Board Number: 27Session Title: Antibody Drug Conjugates and Bispecific Antibodies Session Date & Time: Monday, April 8, 2024, at 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM PT Century is developing an iPSC-derived cell therapy targeting NECTIN4, an established biomarker linked to carcinogenesis, worse prognosis, and disease severity, for the treatment of NECTIN4 expressing solid tumors. In these preclinical studies, Century identified novel single-domain antibodies (VHH) that bind to multiple epitopes on the NECTIN4 extracellular domain. The VHH antibodies were engineered into CAR formats and characterized for expression, cell activation through antigen engagement, and cytotoxicity activity in primary T cells. Selected binders demonstrated efficacy in multiple CAR formats in primary T cells in a mouse xenograft model using OVCar-3 tumor cells. The lead CARs engineered into primary T cells demonstrated tumor inhibition similar to a reference CAR using the ASG-5ME antibody (Enfortumab) as the NECTIN4 binder. The CARs were engineered into Century’s iPSC-derived iNK and iT cells and demonstrated cytotoxicity activity against a panel of cell lines with a range of cell surface expression of NECTIN4. We believe these findings support the advancement of Century’s lead NECTIN4 binder for the development of an iPSC-derived cell therapy to treat NECTIN4 positive solid tumors. Century will also be sharing two additional posters at AACR on Tuesday, April 9th and Wednesday, April 10th. Details are as follows: Discovery Of Inhibitory CAR Target DSG1 for Damping NECTIN4 On-Target Off-Tumor Toxicity in iPSC-Derived CAR-T Cell TherapyPoster Board Number: Section 2, 18Session Title: Adoptive Cell Therapies 3: CAR-T CellsSession Date & Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, at 9:00 AM -12:30 PM PT Century is developing NECTIN4 targeted iPSC-derived CAR-T cell therapy. In a NECTIN4 targeted antibody drug conjugate, enfortumab vedotin, severe skin adverse events are seen in some patients, thought to be driven by on-target off-tumor toxicity against NECTIN4 displaying skin keratinocytes. In this study, Century compared the expression levels of NECTIN4 to targets associated with tissue and cell-type specific on-target off-tumor toxicity in primary CAR-T cell clinical trials. These findings support the incorporation of a DSG1-directed inhibitory CAR into NECTIN4 specific CAR-T cell therapeutic candidates to combat skin related adverse reactions. CXCR4 Transgene Improves In Vivo Migration and Efficacy of Engineered iPSC-Derived Natural Killer CellsPoster Board Number: 7Session Title: Chemokines and Cytokines in CancerSession Date & Time: Wednesday, April 10, 2024, at 9:00 AM - 12:30 PM PT In this poster, Century describes its novel engineering of iPSCs resulting in efficient migration and efficacy of iPSC-derived natural killer (iNK) cells. To ensure effective treatment of bone marrow cancers and certain hematologic malignancies, efficient migration to relevant disease sites is crucial. By engineering iPSCs with CXCR4, Century demonstrated improved migration and efficacy of iNK cells without affecting cell differentiation, phenotype or iNK yield. iNKCXCR4 cells significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, effectively eliminating bone disease in vivo. These findings suggest that the addition of the CXCR4 transgene in iPSC-derived effector cells may allow for a higher therapeutic response, especially in tumors located in axial-skeletal regions. Century's 2024 AACR posters will be available for download shortly after their scheduled presentation on the Scientific Resources page of the Company’s site. About Allo-Evasion™ Century’s proprietary Allo-Evasion™ technology is used to engineer cell therapy product candidates with the potential to evade identification by the host immune system so they can be dosed multiple times without rejection, enabling increased persistence of the cells during the treatment period and potentially leading to deeper and more durable responses.

Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Analyst The recent findings on onvansertib's efficacy in inhibiting hypoxia adaptation in RAS-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) may have significant implications for Cardiff Oncology's drug development pathway. The ability to decrease tumor vascularization could position onvansertib as a potent adjunct to existing therapies like bevacizumab. The Phase 1b/2 clinical trial data indicating higher overall response rates and progression-free survival in bev naïve patients suggests a potential for improved first-line treatment outcomes. These results may influence future clinical practice and have a positive impact on Cardiff Oncology's market valuation, subject to further validation in larger trials. Medical Research Analyst Cardiff Oncology's stratified approach, focusing on RAS-mutated mCRC, aligns with current precision medicine trends that aim to tailor treatments based on individual genetic profiles. The ability of onvansertib to act independently of RAS mutational status expands its therapeutic potential. The robust preclinical data in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and ovarian cancer further underscore the versatility of onvansertib as part of combination treatments. This could lead to an expansion of the drug's market reach, potentially impacting the company's growth trajectory and investor interest in the oncology sector. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst Cardiff Oncology's presentation of five abstracts at AACR signifies a strategic move to bolster investor confidence and position itself as a leader in PLK1 inhibition. The data presented may attract partnership opportunities, enhance licensing potential and provide leverage in negotiations with regulatory bodies. However, it is essential to monitor the transition from preclinical to clinical success rates, as this is a critical inflection point in drug development. The market response will depend on the ability of onvansertib to differentiate itself from competitors and to offer a clear value proposition in terms of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM RAS-mutated mCRC – In RAS-mutated mCRC, novel preclinical finding demonstrates onvansertib inhibits the tumor’s ability to adapt to hypoxia resulting in a significant decrease in both tumor vascularization and growth – – Enhanced clinical efficacy signal in bev naïve patients in Phase 1b/2 trial is consistent with results of randomized ONSEMBLE trial providing two independent data sets in second-line mCRC validating our strategy to evaluate onvansertib in combination with chemo/bev in RAS-mutated first-line mCRC – Therapeutic areas outside of RAS-mutated mCRC – In RAS-wild type mCRC, onvansertib demonstrates antitumor activity in preclinical models as a single agent and in combination with cetuximab, highlighting that onvansertib activity in mCRC can be independent of RAS mutational status – – In SCLC and ovarian cancer, robust preclinical data underscore onvansertib’s activity in combination treatments across multiple tumors – SAN DIEGO, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cardiff Oncology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CRDF), a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging PLK1 inhibition to develop novel therapies across a range of cancers, today announced the presentation of five abstracts at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), taking place from April 5-10, 2024, in San Diego, California. In combination, the abstracts underscore the significant potential of the company’s lead molecule onvansertib in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) and other cancers. “Overall, the totality of our preclinical and clinical data we are presenting at AACR in mCRC is promising and provides scientific validation of our ongoing first-line RAS-mutated mCRC trial, where all patients have no prior exposure to bevacizumab, meaning they are bev naïve,” said Mark Erlander, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Cardiff Oncology. “Furthermore, bev naïve patients in our Phase 1b/2 KRAS-mutated mCRC trial were approximately 4 times (73 % vs 19%) more likely to achieve a clinical response compared to bev exposed patients in the dataset presented at AACR. This is consistent with the data we later generated from our randomized ONSEMBLE trial in RAS-mutated mCRC, which serves as a second independent data set reproducing the robust efficacy signal for onvansertib plus standard of care in bev naïve patients. In addition, we are particularly encouraged by our RAS-mutated mCRC preclinical data highlighting onvansertib’s ability to inhibit activation of the hypoxia pathway via the regulation of HIF1α. We believe this mechanism acts complementary to bevacizumab, potentially providing an even greater reduction in tumor vascularization when the two agents are combined.” Key highlights from the company’s five poster presentations at AACR are below. A Phase 1b/2 Clinical Study of Onvansertib in Combination with FOLFIRI/Bev Revealed a New Role of PLK1 in regulating the Hypoxia Pathway in KRAS-mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Bev naïve patients treated with onvansertib + FOLFIRI/bev demonstrated a significantly greater overall response rate [odds ratio=13.64, p<0.001] and longer PFS [hazard ratio=0.21, p=0.003] compared to bev exposed patients.Onvansertib reduced tumor vascularization as a single agent and onvansertib + bev combination resulted in a greater decrease in tumor vascularization.In vitro, onvansertib inhibited the activation of the hypoxia pathway through the regulation of the transcription factor HIF1α and its downstream targets.Collectively the updated clinical and preclinical data further support the ongoing CRDF-004, Phase 2 trial of onvansertib + chemo/bev for the first-line treatment of RAS-mutated mCRC patients, who by definition are bev naïve. A Phase 2, Randomized, Open-label Study of Onvansertib in Combination with Standard-of-Care (SoC) Versus SoC Alone for First-line Treatment of RAS-mutated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer CRDF-004 is a Phase 2 randomized trial generating preliminary safety and efficacy data and evaluating two different doses of onvansertib to confirm an optimal dose. Onvansertib will be added to standard-of-care consisting of FOLFIRI plus bev, or FOLFOX plus bev.A total of 90 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to either 20mg of onvansertib plus standard-of-care, 30mg of onvansertib plus standard-of-care, or standard-of-care alone.The primary endpoint of the study includes objective response rate (ORR), and the key secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS) and duration of response (DoR). The PLK1 Inhibitor Onvansertib is Active as Monotherapy and in Combination with Cetuximab in RAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patient-derived Xenografts Single agent onvansertib successfully induced tumor stasis or regression in 70% (14/20) of the RAS WT mCRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models tested. This included both models sensitive to cetuximab (5/7, 71%) and resistant to cetuximab (9/13, 69%).Onvansertib in combination with cetuximab induced tumor stasis or regression in 90% (18/20) of the models tested.Overall, the antitumor activity of the combination was superior compared to monotherapy with either agent in both cetuximab sensitive and resistant models. The PLK1 Inhibitor, Onvansertib, Synergizes with Paclitaxel in Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) Onvansertib in combination with paclitaxel was well-tolerated and demonstrated superior efficacy over monotherapies in cisplatin sensitive and resistant SCLC PDX models.In cisplatin-resistant models, onvansertib plus paclitaxel led to tumor regression, with effects lasting 2 months post-treatment.Collectively, these preclinical findings in SCLC and previous data generated in breast cancer suggest that onvansertib in combination with paclitaxel has the potential to become a highly promising combination strategy across multiple cancer indications. In vivo anti-tumor activity of onvansertib, a PLK1 inhibitor, combined with gemcitabine or carboplatin in platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma patient-derived xenograft models Onvansertib was synergistic in vitro in combination with carboplatin or gemcitabine in an ovarian cancer cell line.Both combinations demonstrated antitumor activity in vivo in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer PDX models and were well tolerated.These data support the potential of onvansertib to improve SoC treatments of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients. All the abstracts are available on the AACR Online Program and will be published in the online Proceedings of the AACR. Following the presentation, the posters will be posted to the “Scientific Presentations” section of the Cardiff Oncology website. About Cardiff Oncology, Inc.

Completed enrollment of 25 patients in 1L Phase 1b dose expansion trial of CUE-101. Received FDA guidance for potential registrational trials of CUE-101 in monotherapy and combination settings. Increased collaboration revenue in 2023 due to strategic partnership with Ono Pharmaceutical. Research and development expenses slightly decreased in 2023. Deployed Immuno-STAT platform for developing therapeutic biologics candidate CUE-501. Cash reserves declined from $76.3 million in 2022 to $48.5 million in 2023. Operations expected to be funded until the first quarter of 2025. Negative Cash reserves declined significantly from 2022 to 2023. Loss from operations in 2023 increased compared to 2022. General and administrative expenses increased in 2023. Net loss per common share increased in 2023 compared to 2022. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Cue Biopharma, Inc. highlight a year-over-year increase in collaboration revenue, which is a positive indicator of the company's ability to monetize its strategic partnerships, particularly with Ono Pharmaceutical. This uptick in revenue, from approximately $1.2 million in 2022 to $5.5 million in 2023, suggests that the company's collaborative efforts are beginning to bear fruit, which could be a signal to investors about the potential for future revenue growth.However, the reported increase in both research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses indicates that the company is still heavily investing in its product pipeline and operational structure. While this is expected for a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, investors should monitor the balance between these expenses and revenue closely to assess the sustainability of the company's financial position.The cash reserves, having decreased from $76.3 million to $48.5 million year-over-year, may raise concerns about the burn rate. Despite this, the management's projection that current funds will last into the first quarter of 2025 provides a short-term cushion. This runway might offer the company time to advance its clinical programs to stages that could potentially attract additional funding or partnerships. Medical Research Analyst The presented clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 trials of CUE-101 and CUE-102 provide noteworthy insights into the efficacy of these candidates. The comparison of median overall survival (mOS) and overall response rates (ORR) with historical data from third-party trials is particularly compelling. For instance, CUE-101 monotherapy's mOS of 20.8 months, when compared to 7.5 and 8.4 months with standard care checkpoint inhibitors, suggests a significant improvement in patient outcomes. This could represent a substantial advancement in the treatment of HPV+ recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.Moreover, the favorable tolerability profile reported for CUE-101 in both monotherapy and combination trials could be a critical factor in its clinical success and eventual market adoption. The guidance received from the FDA regarding the potential paths for registrational trials further de-risks the development process and could accelerate the timeline to commercialization, which is a key consideration for stakeholders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the advancements Cue Biopharma is making in its oncology and autoimmune disease programs are strategically significant. The company's focus on selective modulation of disease-specific T cells positions it within a niche yet growing segment of the immunotherapy market. The collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical, a well-established entity in the pharmaceutical industry, not only enhances the credibility of Cue Biopharma's research but also opens doors to the Asian markets, potentially broadening the commercial reach of its candidates.The positive data from clinical trials and the progression of preclinical programs to IND candidate selection stage are likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment. These developments could lead to increased investor interest and potentially higher stock valuations, as the market often responds favorably to biopharmaceutical companies that demonstrate clinical progress and clear regulatory pathways. However, it is essential to consider the competitive landscape and the fact that successful clinical trial results do not guarantee market success, due to factors such as market saturation, pricing pressures and reimbursement challenges. 04/08/2024 - 04:05 PM BOSTON, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cue Biopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: CUE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of therapeutic biologics to selectively modulate disease-specific T cells, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. Presented additional positive data from the ongoing Phase 1 trials of CUE-101 in first line (1L) human papillomavirus positive (HPV+) recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) in combination with standard of care (SOC) checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) and as a monotherapy in second line and beyond (2L+) HPV+ R/M HNSCC, as well as CUE-102 in Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1) positive cancers at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 38th Annual Meeting in November 2023.Completed enrollment of 25 patients in the 1L Phase 1b dose expansion trial of CUE-101 in combination with SOC CPI pembrolizumab.Presented notable updates from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of CUE-101 and CUE-102 at the 2024 Oppenheimer Annual Healthcare Life Sciences Conference in February: CUE-101 monotherapy in 2L HPV+ R/M HNSCC demonstrated median overall survival (mOS) of 20.8 months vs. historical third-party mOS of 7.5 and 8.4 months with two different CPIs: OPDIVO® (nivolumab) and pembrolizumab, respectivelyCUE-101 in combination with pembrolizumab in 1L R/M HNSCC showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 46% vs. 19% with pembrolizumab alone in a third-party trial and median progression free survival (mPFS) of 8.3 months vs. 3.2 months with pembrolizumab alone in a third-party trialCUE-101 continued to demonstrate favorable tolerability in the monotherapy and combination trialsCUE-102 monotherapy in late-stage refractory metastatic cancers demonstrated tumor reductions and stable disease in multiple patients in the dose escalation Phase 1 trial Concluded Type B meeting with FDA receiving guidance for potential paths for CUE-101 registrational trials in both monotherapy and combination settings.Advanced preclinical program CUE-401 in collaboration with Ono Pharmaceutical for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Preclinical activity demonstrated in disease models supported moving toward selection of an Investigational New Drug (IND) candidate.Deployed the Immuno-STAT™ platform to develop a therapeutic biologics candidate, CUE-501, a bispecific Immuno-STAT that is designed to direct selective memory T cells to deplete B cells, to address autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. “Cue Biopharma continues to make measurable progress advancing its clinical oncology programs CUE-101 and CUE-102, as well as its lead preclinical autoimmune and inflammatory disease candidate CUE-401, partnered with Ono Pharmaceutical,” said Daniel Passeri, chief executive officer of Cue Biopharma. “We also accomplished an important milestone earlier this year with guidance received from the FDA for potential CUE-101 registrational trials both in the monotherapy and combination settings providing further risk-reduction and defined resource requirements for achieving the next phase of our strategic corporate objectives. I believe that these key milestones, including progress addressing additional therapeutic approaches for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with CUE-401 and CUE-501, bolster our competitive positioning in securing value for our shareholders and most importantly, patients suffering from these debilitating and life-threatening diseases.” Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results The Company reported collaboration revenue of approximately $1.8 million and $0.15 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was due to revenue earned from the strategic collaboration agreement entered into with Ono Pharmaceutical in the first quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses were $10.9 million and $11.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to drug substance manufacturing projects for CUE-101 and CUE-102 completed in 2022. General and administrative expenses were $4.6 million and $3.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional and consulting fees. Full Year 2023 Financial Results The Company reported collaboration revenue of approximately $5.5 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was due to revenue earned from our strategic collaboration agreement entered into with Ono Pharmaceutical in the first quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses were approximately $40.8 million and $38.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to increases in clinical development costs and research and laboratory expenses, offset by decreases in employee costs and rent expense. General and administrative expenses were approximately $16.7 million and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional and consulting fees. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $48.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with $76.3 million as of December 31, 2022. We expect our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025.

Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The six-month results from the REDUCER-I trial presented by Shockwave Medical, Inc. offer significant insights into the treatment of refractory angina, a chronic condition that affects a substantial patient population and has historically lacked effective treatment options. The data indicating that 70% of patients experienced an improvement of ≥1 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class and the reduction in symptoms persisted through longer-term follow-up, are particularly noteworthy.This persistent symptom relief could potentially translate into lower healthcare costs and improved patient quality of life, which are critical considerations for healthcare providers and payers. Moreover, the low rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) suggest a favorable safety profile, which is essential for patient acceptance and widespread clinical adoption.As the device is still investigational in the U.S., the results from the ongoing COSIRA-II trial will be pivotal in determining the regulatory pathway and future market potential. The ability to provide symptomatic relief without conventional revascularization could position Shockwave Reducer as a game-changer in the cardiovascular treatment landscape, subject to FDA approval. Cardiologist The impact of the Shockwave Reducer on patients with refractory angina, as evidenced by the REDUCER-I trial, suggests a significant advancement in the management of a condition that limits patients' daily activities and diminishes their quality of life. The observed improvements in CCS grades indicate not just statistical significance, but also clinical relevance, as a reduction in angina class correlates with better exercise tolerance and functional capacity.From a cardiological perspective, the potential redistribution of blood flow to ischemic regions, as suggested by the ORBITA-COSMIC trial, could represent a novel therapeutic mechanism that addresses the underlying pathophysiology of refractory angina. This could be an alternative for patients ineligible for conventional procedures like angioplasty or bypass surgery.However, the missed primary imaging endpoint in the ORBITA-COSMIC trial warrants a cautious interpretation of the results, emphasizing the need for further studies to fully understand the clinical implications of this therapy. Healthcare Economist From an economic standpoint, the introduction of a novel therapy such as the Shockwave Reducer has the potential to disrupt the current treatment paradigm for refractory angina. The reduction in angina symptoms and the potential decrease in the need for more invasive procedures could lead to a shift in healthcare resource allocation.With the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the associated economic burden, therapies that offer symptom management with a strong safety profile could be highly valued by both healthcare systems and insurers. However, cost-effectiveness analyses would be required to assess the long-term economic implications of adopting this technology on a wider scale.Additionally, the eventual market entry of the Shockwave Reducer, pending FDA approval, could stimulate competitive dynamics within the cardiovascular device industry, potentially affecting stock market valuations of companies in this sector. 04/08/2024 - 04:03 PM Six-Month Results from REDUCER-I Trial Add to Positive Evidence of the Coronary Sinus Reducer to Treat Refractory Angina SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shockwave Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: SWAV), a pioneer in the development and commercialization of transformational technologies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, today announced that investigators presented six-month data from the full population of the REDUCER-I study, alongside interim long-term follow-up results to three years. These findings confirm the positive, ‘real-world’ outcomes of Shockwave Reducer, a novel technology for the treatment of refractory angina. Results were presented earlier today at the 73rd Annual Scientific Sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Atlanta, GA. REDUCER-I is a post-market, multi-center, observational study designed to collect long-term outcomes on Shockwave Reducer in a large, ‘real-world’ population of 400 patients. The lead enrollers of the study were Drs. Stefan Verheye1, ZNA Middelheim Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium, Tim van de Hoef, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands, and Ranil de Silva, Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. The primary effectiveness endpoint for the study was the percentage of patients experiencing improvement in their symptoms of angina defined as a reduction in Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) grade at six months compared with baseline. The primary safety endpoints were the rate of device- and/or procedure-related periprocedural serious adverse events (SAEs) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) up to 30 days post implant. Six-month results demonstrated an improvement in ≥1 CCS class in 70% of patients, and ≥2 CCS classes in 24% of patients. The proportion of patients with CCS class III/IV declined from 72% at baseline to 18% at six months, with a mean change in CCS class of -0.9 ± 0.8 (p<0.0001). Reduction in symptoms of angina was consistent at longer-term follow-up, with CCS class III/IV symptoms experienced by only 15% of patients at two years and 11% at three years (p<0.0001). Use of Shockwave Reducer also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile, with SAE and MACE rates uniformly low at 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively. “Results from the REDUCER-I study continue to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of Shockwave Coronary Sinus Reducer as a novel therapy for refractory angina,” said Dr. Verheye. “We observed consistent reduction in symptoms of refractory angina and improvements in quality of life, results which align with those from the COSIRA study, previously published in The New England Journal of Medicine, in a challenging patient cohort characterized by high rates of cardiovascular risk factors and coexisting comorbidities for whom there have historically been no other treatment options.” COSIRA-II, a US IDE double-blind randomized sham-controlled clinical trial, is currently enrolling patients to evaluate further the safety and effectiveness of Shockwave Reducer for the treatment of patients with refractory angina and no conventional revascularization options. Results from COSIRA-II are intended to support the regulatory filing for US FDA approval of Shockwave Reducer. Shockwave Reducer is an investigational device, limited by U.S. law to investigational use. Additional Reducer Data Presented At ACCIn a separate late-breaking clinical trial session at ACC, Michael Foley, MD, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, London, UK, presented data from the ORBITA-COSMIC trial (Principal Investigator Dr. Rasha Al-Lamee, MD PhD), a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial investigating the efficacy of Shockwave Coronary Sinus Reducer. The study confirmed symptomatic relief from angina over time in patients that had received Reducer. Although the trial missed the primary imaging endpoint of myocardial blood flow assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, there was evidence of redistribution of blood flow to the subendocardial ischemic regions, supporting the putative mechanism of action of Shockwave Reducer. ORBITA-COSMIC provides additional evidence for the use of Reducer as an additional therapeutic option for patients with refractory angina, documented myocardial ischemia and no option for conventional revascularization.

Operating expenses increased to $12.2 million from $10.0 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses, offset by a decrease in selling expenses. Net loss was about $4.9 million or $(0.21) per diluted share compared to a net loss of $6.7 million or $(0.37) per diluted share, in the same period last year. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.0 million compared to $7.2 million in December 31, 2022. Management Commentary“Over the past year, our operational footprint has extended beyond Japan into the dynamic U.S. markets, marked by the strategic acquisition of Sigmaways and the partnership with Sabatini Global’s sales and marketing team,” said CEO Sumitaka Kanno Yamamoto. “These pivotal moves have significantly bolstered and diversified our enterprise software business’ revenue streams and reduced our reliance solely on sales from Japan, a trend we have carried into 2024. Nonetheless, we have sustained our dominance and have achieved top market share status for the CMS platform segment in Japan for the 8th consecutive year. Despite challenges such as the ongoing depreciation of the yen against the dollar, we have consistently experienced year-over-year top-line growth since becoming a publicly traded company. “On the Go IPO front, we have signed and engaged with 10 new clients, with additional companies in the pipeline, showcasing the robust demand among Japanese companies seeking listings on major U.S. exchanges. While macro-economic factors presented some uncontrollable hurdles for our clients, which resulted in a limited revenue influx for us this year, the recent sale of a $9 million warrant underscores the revenue-generating potential of our consulting business. As we navigate through these challenging market conditions, we remain committed to supporting our valued clients through the listing process with our white glove approach.” Full Year 2024 Strategic Priorities Maintain improved cost structure from synergies with the recently established HeartCore Luvina Vietnam, a high-quality and low-cost IT outsourcing providerCapitalize on strong organic growth opportunities within the enterprise software business through newly established Artificial Intelligence Software DivisionExpand upon the Go IPO business with the U.S. IPO markets expected to improve in 2024Sustain market share as the number one CMS provider in Japan while fueling global expansion Full Year 2024 OutlookIn anticipation of a robust 2024, HeartCore is poised to capitalize on its strong momentum within the enterprise software sector. The recently established HeartCore Luvina Vietnam joint venture and its low-cost, high-quality IT outsourcing capabilities is primed to contribute to the financial resiliency of the Company. With access to 850 talented software engineers, this joint venture is expected to significantly elevate the Company’s global sales expansion efforts. Additionally, the AI software division is positioned to unlock a fresh revenue stream within the U.S. and Japanese markets, with opportunities to upsell other HeartCore software. As part of its growth strategy, HeartCore remains vigilant for synergistic M&A opportunities that seamlessly complement the expanding software business. Successful client listings through the Go IPO business have proven to be a lucrative venture, with the first quarter of 2023 witnessing two successful listings yielding over $5 million in revenue alone. More recently, the Company sold a Go IPO client warrant totaling $9 million in revenue, scheduled to materialize in the first quarter of 2024. Despite a sluggish IPO market in 2023, market sentiment is now shifting toward a more favorable outlook for 2024. With 10 companies currently in the Go IPO pipeline, HeartCore continues to actively expand its reach in the Japanese markets to bolster its pipeline. Though projections and timing of listings remains uncertain due to lingering market uncertainties, HeartCore remains optimistic about the continued financial potential and benefits of its Go IPO business throughout 2024. “We find ourselves amidst a transformative phase,” added Yamamoto. “The outset of 2024 demonstrates significant promise, bolstered by a resilient balance sheet derived from our two-pronged business model and ongoing global expansion of the HeartCore brand. Our adept cash management strategies have led us to authorize our inaugural dividend payment, with plans for additional quarterly payments, contingent upon macro-economic factors and the financial standing of the Company. Building upon the growth momentum seen this past year, we eagerly anticipate sharing strong first-quarter results ahead.” About HeartCore Enterprises, Inc.Headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, HeartCore Enterprises is a leading enterprise software and consulting services company.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 04:00 PM Experts say it's a matter of when not if the next earthquake strikes OAKLAND, Calif., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- After 23 years of studying the science and impacts of earthquakes, Megan Stanton knows two important facts every Californian should remember - there will be strong earthquakes every year, and there are ways to prepare in advance to keep you and your family safe. ""Computer models and historical data show that we have a chance of at least a magnitude 6 earthquake every year. Those earthquakes are not always in populated areas, but they happen every year on average. The key to remember is that we can't predict when or where those earthquakes will happen, so it's important to prepare now,"" said Stanton, a Geosciences Expert for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Stanton and her colleagues monitor a variety of risks every day, from earthquakes and other ground movement to volcanic activity and tsunamis. Their work helps keep utility workers safe on the job and helps restore customers after disasters strike. It can also help coworkers keep themselves and their families safe. ""The biggest risk of injury we see from large earthquakes is from people not taking cover. Instead, they run for cover and risk being hurt by flying objects or from debris falling if they run outside. The safest thing to do when you receive an alert of feel shaking, is to take cover immediately. Taking cover will look different depending on where you're located (e.g. movie theater, car, park, bed, office),"" Stanton said. To keep you and your family safe, take these steps now: Take the Federal Emergency Management Agency Home Hazard Hunt to identify hazards in your home such as heavy furniture that may fall during a quake.Secure hazards with earthquake straps or fasteners.Create a disaster plan for your family and decide how you will communicate at the first sign of an earthquake, tsunami, or other emergency.Organize disaster supplies in convenient locations.Stanton said once you take those initial steps, it's important to practice emergency response in your home. ""Practice now, so that when an earthquake strikes, you will know what to do,"" Stanton said. Take advantage of technology to be prepared Stanton said she encourages everyone to download the MyShake App for their phone, and sign up for emergency alerts. ""While we cannot predict earthquakes, there is technology that allows you to receive early warnings when an earthquake happens. Those warnings may give you time to take cover and stay safe. When an earthquake hits, follow these tips: Drop, cover and hold on, or sit on a chair or bed and cover your head and neck with both hands, a book or even a pillow.If you use a walker, lock the wheels and then cover your head and neck.If you are in a recliner or on a bed, don't try to move. Instead, cover your head and neck until the shaking stops.To learn more about preparing for an earthquake, visit PG&E's Safety Action Center to learn how to: Prepare for an earthquakePrepare an emergency planPack an emergency kit/go bagAbout PG&E Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), is a combined natural gas and electric utility serving more than 16 million people across 70,000 square miles in Northern and Central California.

Positive findings include stable disease in monotherapy and combination cohorts, favorable safety profile, and no dose-limiting toxicities. The company is suspending new patient enrollment due to funding issues. Positive Stable disease reported in both monotherapy and combination cohorts Favorable safety and tolerability profile with no dose-limiting toxicities Clearance of dose levels in monotherapy and combination arms Positive clinical response data and durability of patient benefit Suspension of new patient enrollment due to funding issues Negative None. Oncology Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from Kineta's VISTA-101 clinical trial are indicative of the therapeutic potential of KVA12123, particularly in terms of safety and patient response. The absence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a positive sign, as these are often concerns with new immunotherapy treatments. Additionally, the observed partial response and stable disease in patients who have previously failed multiple lines of therapy, including checkpoint inhibitors, suggest that KVA12123 could offer a novel mechanism of action that may overcome some resistance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment.From a research perspective, the dose-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and activation of various immune cells supports the hypothesis that KVA12123 may be enhancing the immune response against tumors. The implications for future research are significant, as they may lead to a better understanding of how to effectively combine immunotherapies to improve patient outcomes. However, the suspension of new patient enrollment due to financial constraints raises concerns about the trial's continuation and the potential delay in bringing this treatment to market, which could impact the company's valuation and stock performance. Biotech Financial Analyst The financial implications of Kineta's announcement are multifaceted. On one hand, the promising clinical data could be a catalyst for future investment, as the combination of KVA12123 with pembrolizumab appears to show efficacy in a challenging patient population. The progression to the final monotherapy dosing cohort signals confidence in the therapeutic's safety profile and potential efficacy. On the other hand, the revelation that certain investors are not fulfilling their funding obligations is concerning and has already led to the suspension of new patient enrollment. This development may introduce uncertainty regarding Kineta's financial stability and its ability to continue funding its operations and clinical trials.Investor sentiment may be affected by these contrasting updates, which could lead to volatility in Kineta's stock price. The long-term impact on the company's market valuation will likely depend on its ability to secure alternative financing or strategic partnerships to resume full trial operations and advance KVA12123 through the clinical development pipeline. Shareholders will need to weigh the potential of the therapeutic against the risks associated with the company's current financial challenges. 04/08/2024 - 04:01 PM Partial response and stable disease reported in combination cohort, and durable stable disease observed in monotherapy cohorts Favorable clinical safety and tolerability profile observed with no dose limiting toxicities and no evidence of CRS-associated cytokines observed at any dose level Cleared fifth of six monotherapy cohorts and second of four combination cohorts SEATTLE, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kineta, Inc. (Nasdaq: KA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel immunotherapies in oncology that address cancer immune resistance, announced today at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in San Diego, CA an update on its ongoing VISTA-101 Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating KVA12123, an anti-VISTA monoclonal antibody, as monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced solid tumors. KVA12123 cleared the fifth of six monotherapy dose levels and the second of four cohorts in combination with pembrolizumab. KVA12123 was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) or cytokine related adverse events at any dose level. The poster presentation #CT068: “Interim results of the ongoing phase 1/2 clinical trial of KVA12123, an engineered IgG1 targeting VISTA, alone and in combination with pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors” was presented Monday, April 8, 2024 and reported the following findings (the data cutoff date was February 28, 2024): Monotherapy Dose Escalation (3–300 mg KVA12123 Q2W) Of 21 patients enrolled, 12 received at least one baseline and one follow-up scanBest overall response (BOR) in 9 of 12 patients with at least one follow-up scan is stable disease with a mean duration of 15 weeksOne patient with non-small cell lung cancer that failed 6 prior lines of therapy, including checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy, has experienced stable disease lasting 28 weeksNine patients remain on-treatment Combination Therapy Dose Escalation (30-100 mg KVA12123 Q2W, 400 mg pembrolizumab Q6W) Of 9 patients enrolled, 3 received at least one baseline and one follow-up scanBOR in 2 of 3 patients with at least one follow up scan is: Partial Response in 1 mucoepidermoid carcinoma patient with a 54% reduction in target lesions and a complete response in non-target lesionsStable disease in 1 renal cell carcinoma patient that had progressed on prior CPI therapy with a 24% reduction in target lesions Eight patients remain on-treatment Biomarkers Dose-dependent induction of on-target pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokinesDose-dependent increases in activated non-classical monocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and NK cells Safety No DLTs observed in any patient at any dose levelNo evidence of cytokine release syndrome in any patient at any dose level “We are pleased to present our progress on the VISTA-101 clinical trial at AACR this year, with the initial clinical response data and the durability of patient benefit emerging from the study. The safety profile of KVA12123 to date has been remarkable in the monotherapy as well as combotherapy cohorts, supporting advancement to the final monotherapy dosing cohort of KVA12123 and reaching the estimated optimal therapeutic dose,” said Thierry Guillaudeux, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Kineta. “Initial read-outs demonstrated that KVA12123 is not only safe but exhibits potential clinical benefit for some patients as either monotherapy or combotherapy and may offer patients a novel approach to address immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment and better manage solid tumor cancers.” In February 2024, the company announced that it is pursuing strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value due to certain investors indicating they will not fulfill their April 2024 funding obligation in the previously disclosed private placement financing. As a result, the company has suspended new patient enrollment into the Phase 1/2 VISTA-101 trial and will not be recruiting patients into either the sixth cohort in the monotherapy arm or the third cohort in the combination therapy arm. Patients currently enrolled in the trial will be permitted to continue to participate.

About Kineta Kineta (Nasdaq: KA) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop next-generation immunotherapies that transform patients’ lives. Kineta has leveraged its expertise in innate immunity and is focused on discovering and developing potentially differentiated immunotherapies that address the major challenges with current cancer therapy. The company’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes KVA12123, a novel VISTA blocking immunotherapy currently in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, and a preclinical monoclonal antibody targeting CD27. For more information on Kineta, please visit www.kinetabio.com, and follow Kineta on X (Twitter) and LinkedIn. KVA12123 is a VISTA blocking immunotherapy in development as a twice weekly monoclonal antibody infusion drug being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors. Competitive therapies targeting VISTA have demonstrated either poor monotherapy anti-tumor activity in preclinical models or induction of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in human clinical trials. Through the combination of unique epitope binding and an optimized IgG1 Fc region, KVA12123 demonstrates strong monotherapy tumor growth inhibition in preclinical models without evidence of CRS in clinical trial participants. KVA12123 has been shown to de-risk the VISTA target and provides a novel approach to address immune suppression in the TME with a mechanism of action that is differentiated and complementary with T cell focused therapies. KVA12123 may be an effective immunotherapy for many types of cancer including non-small cell lung (NSCLC), colorectal, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck, and ovarian cancer. VISTA (V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation) is a negative immune checkpoint that suppresses T cell function in a variety of solid tumors. High VISTA expression in tumor correlates with poor survival in cancer patients and has been associated with a lack of response to other immune checkpoint inhibitors. Blocking VISTA induces an efficient polyfunctional immune response to address immunosuppression and drives anti-tumor responses.

Roth Capital Partners acted as the Financial Advisor for the transaction. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Flora Growth Corp. is a strategic move to enhance their financial flexibility. The capital injection of approximately $3.23 million, although modest for a company with a global distribution network, signifies an intent to strengthen the company's balance sheet. This is particularly pertinent for a company operating in the volatile cannabis industry, where regulatory changes can swiftly impact market dynamics. The CEO's participation in purchasing shares is a vote of confidence in the company's direction, which can be perceived positively by investors.However, the dilutive effect of additional common shares on existing shareholders cannot be ignored. While the immediate cash boost may address short-term liquidity concerns, it's imperative to scrutinize the offering's price relative to current market conditions. A discount in the offering price might suggest a need for quick capital at the expense of shareholder value, whereas a premium could indicate strong investor interest. The long-term success of this capital raise will largely depend on the company's ability to deploy these funds effectively towards generating sustainable growth and profitability. Legal Expert Flora Growth Corp.'s reliance on Form S-3 for the registration of its common shares is a testament to its status as a company with a reporting history under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The use of Form S-3, reserved for issuers meeting specific criteria, streamlines the registration process and suggests a degree of regulatory compliance and maturity. The role of Aegis Capital as the sole book-running manager indicates a centralized effort to ensure the offering's success, while the involvement of legal counsel for both the company and Aegis Capital underscores the legal complexities inherent in such transactions.Investors should note that the transaction's closing on the same day as the announcement is fairly quick for a public offering, which could reflect efficient preparation and a strong legal framework. However, it is also essential for investors to review the Final Prospectus and other SEC filings to understand the risks and specifics of the offering fully. The legal framework surrounding public offerings is complex and the company's adherence to SEC regulations will be critical in maintaining investor trust and avoiding potential legal complications. Market Research Analyst The capital raise through a public offering for Flora Growth Corp. comes at a time when the cannabis industry is experiencing both growth and consolidation. The company's extensive distribution network and international presence position it to capitalize on emerging markets and evolving consumer preferences. Nevertheless, the relatively small size of the offering suggests a targeted approach to funding specific initiatives rather than a large-scale expansion. It will be interesting to monitor how the net proceeds are allocated towards the stated corporate and working capital needs and whether these investments will translate into competitive advantages.Market sentiment towards cannabis companies can be fickle, with investor enthusiasm often fluctuating with regulatory news and market saturation concerns. Flora Growth Corp.'s performance post-offering will serve as an indicator of the market's confidence in their strategy and execution. Investors should keep an eye on the company's operational metrics and financial statements in subsequent quarters to assess the effectiveness of the capital utilization. The company's ability to demonstrate a clear return on investment from these funds will be important for future capital market activities and investor relations. 04/08/2024 - 02:42 PM Fort Lauderdale, Florida--(Newsfile Corp. - April 8, 2024) - Flora Growth Corp.

The distribution will be paid on June 3, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 19, 2024, with an ex-dividend date of April 18, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The declaration of a distribution of $0.18 per share by Liberty All-Star Equity Fund is a reflection of its commitment to a consistent distribution policy, aimed at returning value to shareholders. The policy of distributing approximately 10 percent of the fund's net asset value per year aligns with the interests of income-focused investors, particularly those seeking regular quarterly income streams. However, it's important to note that a part of the distribution might come from capital gains or return of capital, not just net income. This could influence the fund's future growth potential, as reinvesting these gains could otherwise contribute to compounded growth over time.For investors, the tax implications of these distributions will be a point of consideration, as the final determination of the source will affect individual tax liabilities. The option for shareholders to receive distributions in newly issued shares or cash provides flexibility, but also implies a potential dilution of the value for existing shareholders not participating in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The issuance of shares at a minimum of 95% of market value is a safeguard against significant dilution.The fund's structure as a closed-end fund that does not continuously issue shares and trades in the secondary market means that its share price is subject to market fluctuations and can trade at a premium or discount to net asset value. This characteristic is important for investors to understand when considering the liquidity and valuation of their investments. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the announcement by Liberty All-Star Equity Fund can impact investor sentiment towards the fund. The distribution policy reinforces the fund's image as a stable source of income, potentially attracting investors who prioritize dividends. However, the market's reaction to distributions often depends on the overall health of the fund's portfolio and the broader economic context. For example, in an environment where interest rates are rising, fixed-income investments might become more attractive compared to dividend-paying equities, possibly affecting the demand for shares of funds like Liberty All-Star Equity Fund.The fund's performance and the secondary market support by ALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc. also play a role in maintaining investor confidence. While past performance is not indicative of future results, it is often used by investors as a benchmark. The fund's net assets of over $1.9 billion as of early April 2024 suggest a substantial size that might provide some level of stability and resilience to market volatility. However, investors should be cautious, as size does not guarantee performance and larger funds can still experience significant price swings. 04/08/2024 - 01:34 PM BOSTON, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Trustees of Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (NYSE: USA) has declared a distribution of $0.18 per share payable on June 3, 2024 to shareholders of record on April 19, 2024 (ex-dividend date of April 18, 2024). This distribution is in accordance with the Fund's current distribution policy of paying distributions on its shares totaling approximately 10 percent of its net asset value per year, payable in four quarterly installments of 2.5 percent. A portion of the distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain and return of capital. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2024 for tax reporting purposes, including the percentage of qualified dividend income, will be made after year-end. The distribution will be paid in newly issued shares to all shareholders except those who are not participating in Liberty All-Star Equity Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan and who elect to receive the distribution in cash. Shares will be issued at the lower of the May 17, 2024 net asset value per share or market value per share (but not less than 95% of market value). The market value of the Fund's shares for this purpose will be the last sales price on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fund does not continuously issue shares and trades in the secondary market, investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker.

Stennis refueling and complex overhaul, showcasing significant upgrades and maintenance work.","HII Completes Dry Dock Work for Aircraft Carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74) Refueling and Complex Overhaul Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary HII's Newport News Shipbuilding division completes dry dock phase of USS John C. Stennis refueling and complex overhaul, showcasing significant upgrades and maintenance work. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The completion of the dry dock phase for the USS John C. Stennis represents a significant milestone in the lifecycle of the vessel and underscores the importance of maintenance and modernization in the defense sector. The refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) process is vital, as it extends the operational capabilities and service life of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, which are central assets in naval power projection and national security.From a business perspective, this phase of the RCOH likely involves substantial capital expenditure, which can have a considerable impact on the financials of HII and its supply chain. The overhaul includes extensive updates and technological enhancements, which may contribute to the broader defense industry by creating demand for new systems and components. This can have a ripple effect, potentially benefiting subcontractors and suppliers specializing in naval equipment and technology.Investors should note that while the RCOH is a routine part of a carrier's lifecycle, the scale of such projects can affect HII's revenue stream and backlog. The successful transition from dry dock to outfitting berth indicates project adherence to schedule, which is critical in government contracting for maintaining trust and securing future contracts. The implications for HII's stock could be positive if this project signals the company's continued competence in managing complex defense contracts. Naval Military Strategist The RCOH of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, such as USS John C. Stennis, is not just a refurbishment but a strategic overhaul that ensures the vessel remains at the forefront of military technology and capability. The upgrades to the ship's power plant, structural integrity and combat systems are essential for the carrier to adapt to evolving threats and mission requirements.For stakeholders, the implications are two-fold. Firstly, the carrier's enhanced capabilities can deter aggression and provide a versatile tool in geopolitical strategy. Secondly, the improvements in living spaces for the crew can boost morale and effectiveness, which is often an overlooked aspect of military readiness.From a strategic standpoint, the RCOH contributes to the broader defense posture of the United States. Given the increasing tensions in various global hotspots, the timely return of the USS John C. Stennis to the fleet could serve as a significant factor in maintaining a balance of power. This, in turn, may indirectly influence defense spending and investment in sectors related to national security and defense. Market Research Analyst The defense industry is a unique market segment where government contracts play a pivotal role. HII's update on the USS John C. Stennis's RCOH progress can be seen as an indicator of the company's current project execution and future market opportunities. Market analysts typically scrutinize such updates to assess a company's operational efficiency and its ability to capitalize on government defense spending, which is often seen as a stable and predictable revenue source.Investors and market participants may interpret the successful completion of a project phase as a positive signal regarding HII's project management capabilities. This can influence investor sentiment and potentially impact the stock's performance. Additionally, the focus on upgrading and testing combat and propulsion systems highlights HII's involvement in high-tech defense markets, which could attract interest from investors seeking exposure to advanced defense technology sectors.Long-term, the successful overhaul of the USS John C. Stennis could serve as a testament to HII's ability to handle complex defense projects, potentially leading to further government contracts and partnerships. This aspect is important for investors looking at the company's future growth prospects and competitive positioning in the defense industry. 04/08/2024 - 02:00 PM NEWPORT NEWS, Va., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII’s (NYSE: HII) Newport News Shipbuilding division has completed the dry dock portion of the refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH) of Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). Following the recent flooding of more than 100 million gallons of water into the dry dock, USS John C. Stennis was successfully moved to an outfitting berth at the shipyard, where the remainder of the RCOH work and testing will be completed. “Witnessing Stennis leave the dry dock and return to the water is a testament to the hard work of our shipbuilders, the crew and our government partners,” said Rob Check, NNS vice president of in-service aircraft carrier programs. “We remain laser focused on the work ahead during this RCOH period and look forward to preparing this mighty aircraft carrier for the next half of its operational life.” Photos accompanying this release are available at: https://hii.com/news/hii-aircraft-carrier-uss-john-c-stennis-cvn-74-refueling-and-complex-overhaul-drydock/. During the dry dock phase of the RCOH, USS John C. Stennis received significant upgrades and began an extensive overhaul process, both inside and outside the ship. In addition to defueling and refueling its power plant, NNS shipbuilders preserved tanks and replaced thousands of valves, pumps and piping components. On the outside, they performed major structural updates to the island, mast and antenna tower; upgraded all aircraft launch and recovery equipment; painted the ship’s hull, including sea chests and freeboard; restored the propeller shafts; and installed refurbished propellers and rudders. During the next phase of RCOH, shipbuilders will complete the overhaul and installation of the ship’s major components and test its electronics, combat and propulsion systems. This period will also focus on improving the ship’s living areas, including crew living spaces, galleys and mess decks. “Our focus remains steadfast to get our ship back into the fight and to foster the professional and personal development of our sailors,” said Capt. J. Patrick Thompson III, the ship’s commanding officer. “We look forward to continue working with our industry partners to complete remaining production and test work and redeliver Stennis back to the fleet.” USS John C. Stennis is the seventh Nimitz-class aircraft to undergo its RCOH — the mid-life refueling overhaul and maintenance availability that produces a recapitalized carrier capable of supporting current and future Navy requirements. Once the RCOH is complete, USS John C. Stennis will be equipped to operate in the fleet for the second half of her 50-year expected service life.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 01:33 PM TORONTO, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Base Carbon Inc. (Cboe CA: BCBN) (OTCQX: BCBNF) with operations through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Base Carbon Capital Partners Corp. (“BCCPC”, together, with affiliates, “Base Carbon”, or the “Company”), is pleased to announce that it has received an initial transfer of 717,558 correspondingly adjusted carbon credits from its Rwanda cookstoves project, each designated by Verra with an article 6 authorized (“Article 6 Authorized”) label. Receipt of these carbon credits from the Rwanda cookstoves project is an important Company milestone, marking Base Carbon’s second project to transition from the development stage to active carbon credit generation, as well as an important industry milestone, being the first Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits issued by Verra. Highlights: Rwanda cookstoves project has successfully transitioned to the carbon credit generation stage, with regular future issuances expected at semi-annual intervals.717,558 Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits have been transferred to the Company. The carbon credits transferred to the Company are part of Verra’s first ever correspondingly adjusted Article 6 Authorized carbon credits.The Company believes that the correspondingly adjusted carbon credits with Verra’s Article 6 Authorized designation will expand the pool of buyers with potential pricing upside. As first announced in December 2023, the Government of Rwanda issued a letter of authorization (“LOA”) with respect to the Rwanda cookstoves project resulting in Verra announcing it had applied its Article 6 Authorized label to the project, being the first time Verra had applied such designation to a carbon project registered in its Verified Carbon Standard Program. BCCPC and the DelAgua Group (“DelAgua”), the project developer, have been engaged in discussions as to the best implementation of the LOA. According to the LOA, a copy of which may be found on Verra’s website under project ID 4150, 2% of any issued Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credit are to be immediately retired to help offset global emissions, 10% of such carbon credits are to be transferred to the Government of Rwanda to help achieve its nationally determined emission reduction targets, and 5% of net revenues generated from the sale of the remaining Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits issued will be remitted to United Nations’ global adaptation fund (“GAF”). BCCPC and DelAgua have recently executed an amended and restated project agreement to facilitate the implementation of the LOA. Under the terms of the revised agreement, BCCPC and DelAgua have agreed to split the 5% GAF remittance attributable to Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits sold based upon each party’s pro rata share of sales proceeds outlined in a revenue sharing arrangement between the parties. The Company’s GAF remittance is currently anticipated to be US$0.20 per credit for the first 1,925,000 Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits received by BCCPC. Under the revised project agreement, Article 6 Authorized labeled carbon credits issued from the Rwanda cookstoves project will be net of the 12% volume reduction outlined in the Government of Rwanda LOA. Based upon on this, and assuming all carbon credits from the Rwanda cookstoves project were issued with an Article 6 Authorized label, a new and revised aggregate minimum of 6.6 million carbon credits would now be subject to the revenue sharing arrangement between BCCPC and DelAgua. The Company is currently evaluating all sales options with respect to the initial 717,558 carbon credits and believes that the potential pricing upside of correspondingly adjusted carbon credits will significantly offset any volume reductions pursuant to the implementation of the LOA.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 12:05 PM First analysis from ASCEND-2 confirms high detection rates and specificity achieved with multi-biomarker approach in most aggressive cancers and those with no standard-of-care screening test1 MADISON, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Exact Sciences Corp. (NASDAQ: EXAS), a leading provider of cancer screening and diagnostic tests, will present late-breaking data from the first analysis of the ASCEND-2 study demonstrating the compelling performance of its investigational multi-biomarker class, multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood test. These results validate the sensitivity and specificity of the company’s multi-biomarker class approach across a broad range of cancer types, including the most aggressive cancers and cancers with no current standard of care for screening. ASCEND-2 is a large, multi-center, prospective, case-control study of over 11,000 clinically characterized participants from a racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse cohort representative of the U.S. population. These data will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research® (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024, April 5-10 in San Diego, California.1 “Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S., and while early detection is associated with longer survival, two-thirds of deaths are caused by cancers that lack standard screening tests. MCED tests have the potential to revolutionize cancer screening by enabling us to spot more cancers and intervene earlier,” said Tom Beer, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Multi-Cancer Early Detection, Exact Sciences.2-4 “This analysis from ASCEND-2 confirms that our multi-biomarker class approach to MCED test design may deliver benefits beyond what is currently achievable. The sensitivity and specificity achieved in the detection of the most aggressive cancers and those cancers with no current standard of care provide the confidence to move forward to a real-world evidence study.” Exact Sciences will also present new outcomes data from DETECT-A, the first large prospective study of an earlier multi-biomarker class MCED test that enrolled more than 10,000 participants with more than four years of follow-up.5 The abstracts featured at AACR 2024 are as follows: Title: Performance of a multi-analyte, multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood test in a prospectively collected cohort Presenter: Diehl, F Session: Monday, April 8, 9:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. PDT (Session LBPO.CL01) Poster number: LB100/11 Location: Section 51 Key findings: First analysis of the refined multi-biomarker class MCED test achieved an overall sensitivity of 50.9% with 98.5% specificity and 56.8% sensitivity when breast and prostate cancer were excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity was 54.8% for cancers without standard-of-care screening for average-risk populations and 63.7% in the most aggressive cancers with the shortest 5-year survival rate (pancreas, esophagus, liver, lung and bronchus, stomach, and ovary). Title: Case report: DETECT-A participants with pre-malignant conditions Presenter: Rego, SP Session: Monday, April 8, 9:00 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. PDT (Session PO.CL01.16) Poster number: 2449/14 Location: Section 41 Key findings: Results showed that in the rare instance when MCED testing detected pre-cancerous conditions in the DETECT-A study, surgical interventions prevented cancer development, and all patients were cancer-free at follow-up. About the ASCEND-2 study The ASCEND-2 (Ascertaining Serial Cancer patients to Enable New Diagnostic 2) study is a large, multi-center, prospective, case-control study of clinically characterized participants. Key goals of the study are to develop the algorithm and identify the biomarkers to inform the final design of the Cancerguard™ test, Exact Sciences’ investigational, multi-biomarker class blood-based MCED test. ASCEND-2 has enrolled over 11,000 participants across 151 sites within the U.S. and Europe. The study population includes male and female subjects 50 years and over with known cancer, suspicion of cancer, and controls without cancer. ASCEND-2 selected cancer types in an incidence-targeted manner, including rare and common cancers and evenly distributed stages. By enrolling racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse participants, the study enables MCED test development with a widely representative cohort. About the DETECT-A study The DETECT-A (Detecting cancers Early Through Elective mutation-based blood Collection and Testing) study was the first-ever large, prospective, interventional study to use a blood test to detect multiple types of cancer in a real-world setting. The DETECT-A study enrolled more than 10,000 women with no history of cancer to determine if a blood test in combination with standard-of-care screenings could detect cancers before signs and symptoms appeared. The CancerSEEK test, the MCED test studied in DETECT-A, was the forerunner to the Cancerguard test, the MCED test currently in development at Exact Sciences. About the Cancerguard™ test The Cancerguard test, currently in development, is designed to detect multiple cancers in their earliest stages from a single blood draw. Building upon decades of research, Exact Sciences intends to harness the additive sensitivity of multiple biomarker classes to detect more cancers in earlier stages. The Cancerguard test will utilize a streamlined and standardized imaging-based diagnostic pathway, which may result in fewer follow-up procedures. The test is being developed to provide high specificity to help minimize false positives while detecting multiple cancers, including those with the biggest toll on human health. The Cancerguard test is currently under development. These features describe current development goals. The Cancerguard test has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other national regulatory authority.

This increase, being the highest since May 2022, implies a growing confidence among Schwab clients, which could be reflective of broader retail market trends. The focus on sectors like Information Technology, Health Care and Consumer Staples indicates a strategic approach to investing, favoring sectors that are either poised for growth, such as tech, or offer stability, like consumer staples, in volatile markets.The detailed buying patterns, including favored stocks like NVIDIA and Tesla, suggest a keen interest in companies with strong innovation potential and market leadership. Conversely, the selling off of names such as Coinbase and Disney might point to a risk-off approach to companies facing sector-specific challenges or broader market headwinds. These behaviors can influence market liquidity and sector valuations, potentially leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of investor sentiment and stock performance. Financial Analyst The macroeconomic data presented, including jobless claims and nonfarm payrolls, provides a mixed picture, which typically leads to market uncertainty. However, the rally in U.S. equity markets, despite this, suggests that investors may be pricing in future growth expectations or reacting to other variables such as corporate earnings or geopolitical events. The divergence between the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index growth rates could be indicative of inflationary pressures that businesses are facing, which may not yet be fully passed on to consumers.Additionally, the Federal Reserve's stance on inflation and interest rates is a critical factor for market movements. Powell's comments on inflation decreasing gradually could be interpreted by the market as dovish, potentially delaying rate hikes and thus being a short-term positive for equities. The volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield and the stability of the U.S. Dollar Index are also important indicators of investor sentiment and risk appetite, affecting international investments and currency markets. Commodities Analyst The sharp rise in May Crude Oil Futures during the March STAX period is noteworthy, as it contrasts with the stability seen in other economic indicators like the U.S. Dollar Index and Treasury yields. An 8.7% increase in oil prices can have a significant impact on energy sector stocks and inflation expectations, potentially affecting consumer spending and corporate profit margins. This rise in oil prices could be a response to geopolitical tensions, supply constraints, or expectations of economic growth driving up demand.The implications for stakeholders are multifaceted. For businesses, higher energy costs could lead to increased operational expenses, while for consumers, it could mean higher prices at the pump, affecting disposable income. Investors may need to monitor the energy sector closely, as it could influence market dynamics and sector allocation decisions in the short to medium term. 04/08/2024 - 12:30 PM Schwab clients were net buyers in March, with the most pronounced buying within the Information Technology, Health Care, and Consumer Staples sectors WESTLAKE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Schwab Trading Activity Index™ (STAX) increased to 51.65 in March, up from its score of 47.65 in February. The only index of its kind, the STAX is a proprietary, behavior-based index that analyzes retail investor stock positions and trading activity from Schwab’s millions of client accounts to illuminate what investors were actually doing and how they were positioned in the markets each month. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240408112995/en/Schwab Trading Activity Index March 2024 (Graphic: Charles Schwab) The reading for the four-week period ending March 28, 2024 ranks “moderate” compared to historic averages and marks the highest reading since May 2022. “In the face of undeniably mixed macroeconomic data, the markets soared this month, and the STAX score continued its rise in step,” said Joe Mazzola, Director of Trading and Education at Charles Schwab. “Despite the market highs, however, Schwab clients remain in the moderate range of market exposure as measured by the STAX. They net bought equities in March, but we continue to see that retail investors are engaging in strategic, thoughtful buying. There’s palpable enthusiasm when it comes to names related to technology, for example, but clients also found areas to moderate and trim exposure.” U.S. equity markets continued to rally and reached new all-time highs during the March STAX period despite key data pushing back against the narrative that Fed rate cuts could begin as early as May. On February 29, initial jobless claims came in at 215,000, slightly higher than expected, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics’ Employment Situation Summary released on March 8 showed that nonfarm payrolls increased by 275,000 in February - significantly better than expected. However, the unemployment rate increased to 3.9%, higher than the anticipated 3.7%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose, as anticipated, by 0.4% for the month of February, bringing the 12-month increase to 3.2% before seasonal adjustment, while the Producer Price index (PPI) came in much higher than expected at 0.6% vs expectations of 0.3%. U.S. Retail Sales for February increased 0.6% from the previous month, slower than an expected increase of 0.8%. On March 20, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that despite recent readings, inflation is gradually decreasing, although confidence as to the timing of achieving the target rate may be understandably shaky. This was reflected in the month’s Consumer Confidence reading, which dipped below expectations and February’s reading in at 104.7. But traders seemed to move past any lingering worries over recession or a meaningful stock market pullback as they drove both the Nasdaq® and S&P 500® to soaring new heights. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) declined from 13.75 to 13.01, low by historical measures, as the 10-year Treasury yield exhibited a bit of its own volatility trading within a 30-basis point range before settling basically unchanged. The U.S. Dollar Index, too, was barely changed, closing at 104.55. May Crude Oil Futures, however, rose sharply by 8.7% and closed the March STAX period at $83.17. Popular names bought by Schwab clients during the period included: NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW) Names net sold by Schwab clients during the period included: Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Walt Disney Co. (DIS) PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Block Inc. (SQ) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) About the STAX The STAX value is calculated based on a complex proprietary formula. Each month, Schwab pulls a sample from its client base of millions of funded accounts, which includes accounts that completed a trade in the past month. The holdings and positions of this statistically significant sample are evaluated to calculate individual scores, and the median of those scores represents the monthly STAX.

The study showed cryopreserved samples can predict treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia with high accuracy, opening new avenues for treatment options. Positive Notable Labs presented data at AACR 2024 on using cryopreserved samples in their Precision Oncology Platform. The study demonstrated high accuracy in predicting treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia. The findings suggest cryopreserved samples can be used for assessing new treatment regimens and combination therapies. Notable's PPMP platform shows potential for developing partnerships and unlocking new treatment options for cancer patients. The study results open opportunities for applying PPMP to a broad range of archived samples and therapeutics. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The findings presented by Notable Labs regarding the use of cryopreserved samples in their Predictive Precision Medicine Platform (PPMP) signify a notable advancement in oncology research methodologies. Cryopreservation has historically been a challenge due to concerns about cell viability and recovery, which are critical for assessing treatment responses. The successful correlation between fresh and frozen samples, as indicated by the R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.92, suggests that the company's modified protocols may effectively overcome these hurdles.This development could substantially increase the utility of biobanks, which store vast amounts of cryopreserved samples, by enabling retrospective studies and validation of treatment regimens. The ability to predict clinical responses using archived samples could accelerate the pace of oncology research, potentially reducing the time and cost associated with clinical trials. However, it is essential to consider the need for further validation of these methodologies before they can be widely adopted in the research community. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The implications of Notable Labs' study extend beyond the scientific community and into the realm of business strategy and market dynamics. The ability to utilize cryopreserved samples effectively can be a game-changer for precision oncology companies, potentially leading to more strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical firms. By offering a robust, validated platform that can assess the efficacy of both existing and novel treatment regimens, Notable could position itself as a significant player in the oncology research services market.Investors should note the potential for increased revenue streams through partnerships and service agreements. However, the long-term financial impact will depend on the company's ability to maintain its innovative edge and secure a steady stream of collaborations. While the market response to this news may be positive, investors should monitor the company's progress in Phase 2 trials and subsequent validation efforts for a clearer picture of the company's growth trajectory. Clinical Trials Methodologist The adoption of cryopreserved samples in the PPMP assay could introduce efficiencies in clinical trial design and execution. Traditionally, reliance on fresh samples can limit the scope and speed of trials due to logistical constraints. By validating the use of cryopreserved samples, Notable Labs may enable broader and more diverse patient inclusion, as samples can be sourced from multiple locations and time points without the immediate pressure of sample degradation.However, it is important to acknowledge that while the PPMP's predictive capabilities appear promising, actual clinical trial outcomes will remain the gold standard for regulatory approval and treatment adoption. The real-world effectiveness of these predictions must be corroborated through rigorous clinical testing. The results from Notable's Phase 2 program will be particularly telling in this regard and should be closely watched by stakeholders interested in the clinical application of these methodologies. 04/08/2024 - 12:00 PM FOSTER CITY, Calif., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Notable Labs, Ltd. (Nasdaq: NTBL) (“Notable” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing a new class of cancer therapies identified by its Predictive Precision Medicine Platform (PPMP), today presented data related to innovations in the use of cryopreserved samples in the PPMP assay at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR 2024) being held in San Diego, CA (Poster abstract 2548). “We are very pleased to share the result of our innovative sample handling study with the cancer community at AACR 2024. The ability to derive a high-quality assessment of the response to treatment based on the results of cryopreserved samples is an important innovation. It has been previously thought that frozen samples could not be effectively thawed and used for cell viability assays. Based on the data presented at AACR, Notable now has the potential to develop partnerships to assess new treatment regimens, including combination therapies, using Notable’s PPMP platform and archived, cryopreserved samples thawed according to our protocols and proprietary media compositions,” said Thomas Bock, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Notable. “We hope this opens new opportunities to apply our PPMP to a broad range of archived samples and therapeutics to unlock value and new treatment options for patients with cancer.” Joseph Wagner, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Notable, added, “As we are ready to initiate the Phase 2 program with volasertib in Q2 2024, we are dedicated to maintaining a focus on innovation for our PPMP. The careful evaluation of sample handling protocols, presented at AACR 2024, makes our PPMP more comprehensive and enhances the opportunity to study and apply it more broadly. As we continue to execute, we look forward to further demonstrating the potential of PPMP and partner with biopharmaceutical companies and innovators to provide potential new treatment options for patients with cancer.” Summary of Data and Findings for Notable’s Sample Handling Study: Overview: The study was designed to evaluate the potential use of cryopreserved samples as an alternative to fresh samples for predicting treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using Notable’s PPMP. Cryopreserved samples are known for exhibiting low sample viability and cell recovery, rendering their practical utilization challengingNotable adapted an existing methodology to process cryopreserved patient-derived leukemia cells to investigate their use as an alternative to fresh samples in the PPMP assay Method: First, a method was established using freshly isolated white blood cells (WBCs) from AML patients (<2 days from sample collection). A fraction of these cells was cryopreserved. Both fresh and cryopreserved cells (after thawing and culturing) were assessed on the PPMP and results compared. Second, the established method was applied to cryopreserved samples (from a biobank) collected from AML patients prior to their treatment with chemotherapy (cytarabine plus idarubicin). Results obtained on the PPMP were compared to the clinical responses experienced by the patients after treatment with cytarabine and idarubicin. Results: For the method development study, ex vivo responses to 3 different compounds (venetoclax, 5-azacytidine and decitabine) were assessed after culturing of the cryopreserved cells for 24- and 48-hour post thaw using two different media (“A” and “B”). There was a strong correlation (R2 from 0.77 to 0.92) for venetoclax and 5-azacytidine between the results obtained with fresh vs. frozen samples. For the biobank samples treated with cytarabine and idarubicin, culture media A and B show a similar dose-response behavior. Importantly, the PPMP correctly predicted clinical responders (complete remission) and non-responders (refractory). While Notable will continue to evaluate and validate these sample handling methodologies, these data open the door to the use of cryopreserved samples from retrospective cohorts.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 11:00 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / FedEx CorporationAuthors: Su Song, Miaoqing Zhong, and Ding TanThis article was originally published on WRI Insights: How Mobility-as-a-Service Platforms Encourage Low-Carbon Transportation and is from the report, Mobility-as-a-Service Guideline for Chinese Cities and Cases Studies. WRI China's Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) project is part of the Mobility and Accessibility Program (MAP), a collaboration between WRI and FedEx.A new digital platform being piloted in cities around the world is making public transportation more efficient, economical, and accessible, while encouraging low-carbon travel.Mobility-as-a-Service is an on-demand service that integrates various forms of transportation services into a single platform accessible to travelers via a digital app. The smart phone platform acts as a one-stop travel planning and payment system, encouraging users to plan their trips via shared bikes, metros, buses, and other green forms of transport with support from real-time travel information.Many countries around the world are piloting Mobility-as-a-Service in their cities, including Finland, Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the United States, Sweden, the Netherlands, Australia, and Belgium. Learning from these early programs will help design a more successful platform, resulting in less carbon and congestion in cities.Beijing's pilot, for example, is a unique case that nudges travelers away from private cars toward greener travel modes (like public transport or bike sharing) by linking the Mobility-as-a-System platform with local carbon markets, which rewards travelers for choosing greener travel methods.Beijing's Green Mobility-as-a-Service JourneyBeijing has been piloting a Mobility-as-a-Service platform since 2019. By opening the app on a mobile device and typing in the destination, the platform provides many different travel planning options with different durations, modes, prices, and other information. The current platform integrates most transport services, such as bus, metro, shared bikes, ridesharing, and taxis.Since its launch, the platform has consistently adhered to the city's ""green and integrated"" transport development strategy, receiving positive public responses. As of today, more than 30 million users have used the app, providing 4.5 million daily trips that include green transport services.While this data is a very positive start to the program, more progress is needed to shift behavior from private car trips. As of 2022, the motor vehicle fleet in Beijing reached 7.1 million, including 4.9 million private cars. Total daily trips in central city totaled 33.9 million, with green transport, including walking, biking, and public transit, accounting for 73.4%.The platform's initial success is being supported in three ways:1. Strong Government PoliciesStrong policies, such as the ""14th Five-Year Plan"" and various digital transport development plans, have placed Beijing's Mobility-as-a-Service on a green and inclusive track. These policies aim to promote smart mobility services, encourage green transport, increase the share of green travel and improve the Mobility-as-a-Service platform.In June 2023, the Beijing government unveiled the ""MaaS 2.0 Work Plan,"" emphasizing green and inclusive mobility. It aims to continue expanding intelligent mobility services that seamlessly integrates bus, metro, bike sharing, ride-hailing, ridesharing, long-distance coach, and more. The goal is to provide green and inclusive service to over 6 million people daily by 2025. This will realize a large share of behavior shift from private cars to green modes, as well as over 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide reduction during the next three years.2. An Ecosystem Where Companies Work TogetherMobility-as-a-Service operates as a public-private partnership that includes governments, transport operators, financial institutions, Mobility-as-a-Service operators, technology and data providers, platform users and research institutions. The role of each organization and company may vary depending on how the platform is set up and WRI research of the existing platforms shows there's no defined business model.For example, the Beijing initiative is led by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport and functions through a collaborative public-private approach. Operators like Gaode Maps and Baidu, which offer digital mapping services, act as platform facilitators. The city's bus and metro operators and shared mobility providers are also well integrated. Other companies provide payment access, while additional businesses might be incorporated to provide discounts to online shops as incentives for using the platform. The primary users are individual travelers within Beijing.3. A Reward System that Encourages Green BehaviorThe Beijing Mobility-as-a-Service platform has been adopting a carbon market approach to encourage users to choose green transport options. Since September 2020, Beijing has introduced the ""MaaS Travel, Green Life"" Carbon-Inclusive Campaign, which is built into the app. Users who participate in the campaign automatically receive carbon reduction credits for their green travel behavior (for example, shifting from private car to shared bike, bus, or metro). Users can then exchange the credits for things like discounted public transport cards or shopping vouchers. By now, the campaign has attracted over 3.5 million registered users, contributing to a cumulative carbon reduction of nearly 400,000 metric tons.Among campaign participants, 21% of the users that primarily traveled by car each day have now engaged in green travel, which shows a significant increase in citizens' willingness to adopt green options. Carbon credits are calculated based on the ""Beijing Low-carbon Travel Carbon Emission Reduction Methodology"" developed by Beijing's transportation authority and its affiliated think tank. The approved local certified emission reductions (PCERs) credits will then be traded at Beijing's local emissions trading system.In 2021, Gaode Map, one of the platform operators, alone achieved transactions of 24,500 metric tons of PCERs, with 15,000 tonnes traded with local companies. The second phase of PCER transaction reached 97,600 metric tons. The benefits from the carbon trading returns to the app users in the form of public transport discounts, shopping coupons or users can donate their credits to charity organizations that promote green transport and other behavior changes for sustainability.Creating a Successful Mobility-as-a-Service PlatformThe value of developing Mobility-as-a-Service platforms is that it can improve efficiency and quality for travelers, encourage more people to choose green and low-carbon mobility modes, shape the public-transportation-centered mobility system, promote the digital transformation and open data system, and improve the stability and level-of service of the system.However, Mobility-as-a-Service also faces some challenges not only in Chinese cities, but in cities around the world. First, there is no single successful business model for all cities, and the operation models vary greatly in different places. Finding a suitable business model based on the local policy and investment environment, and culture to ensure commercial sustainability, will be the key to developing a successful system.Also, the coordination among different stakeholders in a Mobility-as-a-Service ecosystem needs further improvement, especially for data sharing mechanisms.Finally, establishing a proper monitoring and governance system is also an important part of the implementation process.Expanding the development of Mobility-as-a-Service is an important step in building more sustainable cities and urban mobility. However, as we've learned through the pilot programs, the platform should be built consistently with a city's existing low-carbon and sustainable strategy. Instead of public transportation companies acting as competitors with each other, Mobility-as-a-Service offers the possibility of creating a single platform that redefines the integrated transport system encompassing multiple kinds of shared and private mobility services.Beijing MaaS interface for users (Gaode App).

TotalEnergies extends LNG cooperation with SONATRACH until 2025, enhancing energy security in France and Europe. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between TotalEnergies and SONATRACH is significant for the energy sector, particularly within the context of the global gas market. The collaboration aims to appraise and develop gas resources in Algeria, which could potentially enhance gas supply stability, especially for European markets. The synergy with existing processing facilities is a strategic move to leverage infrastructure for cost efficiency and reduced emissions, aligning with broader industry trends towards more sustainable energy production.Furthermore, the extension of their LNG cooperation until 2025, with SONATRACH delivering two million tonnes of LNG to TotalEnergies, is a critical development. It underscores the importance of diversifying energy sources and securing energy supply chains in light of geopolitical tensions and the European drive for energy independence. This deal may influence LNG pricing and availability, with implications for energy companies and countries reliant on LNG imports. Environmental Policy Expert The MoU between TotalEnergies and SONATRACH underlines a growing trend in the energy industry towards reducing environmental impact. By focusing on the development of gas resources in an existing field and prioritizing the reduction of costs and emissions, this partnership reflects a strategic alignment with environmental policies and the global transition to cleaner energy sources. The commitment to lower emissions is particularly relevant given the increasing regulatory and social pressures on energy companies to adopt more sustainable practices.It is also essential to consider the broader implications of such agreements on local ecosystems and communities. The environmental footprint of gas development projects can be significant and therefore the promise of reduced emissions should be scrutinized in terms of actual implementation and adherence to best practices, as well as compliance with local and international environmental regulations. Geopolitical Risk Analyst The extension of the LNG supply agreement between TotalEnergies and SONATRACH until 2025 has implications beyond the energy market; it is also a geopolitical move. Given Europe's current energy supply concerns, this agreement is a strategic maneuver to strengthen energy security. Algeria's role as a key LNG supplier to Europe could become more prominent, affecting Europe's energy diplomacy and its relationships with other major gas suppliers.Investors should monitor the stability of the region and the bilateral relations between France and Algeria, as any political unrest or diplomatic tension could disrupt the supply chain. The assurance of LNG delivery to the port of Fos-Cavaou is a significant factor in France's energy diversification strategy and could have ripple effects on energy policy decisions within the European Union. 04/08/2024 - 11:05 AM ALGIERS, Algeria--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) and SONATRACH have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the aim of concluding a hydrocarbon contract in the north-east Timimoun region, under the aegis of Law n°19-13 governing hydrocarbon activities. This Memorandum of Understanding outlines the realization of a work program for the appraisal and development of gas resources in the North-East Timimoun region, in synergy with existing processing facilities for production from the Timimoun field, to reduce costs and emissions. ""This Memorandum of Understanding reflects our shared willingness to expand our strategic partnership with SONATRACH"", said Julien Pouget, Senior Vice President Middle East & North Africa, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies. Earlier this year, TotalEnergies and SONATRACH have extended their cooperation in the field of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by extending their contractual relationship until 2025. In 2025, SONATRACH will thus be delivering two million tonnes of LNG to TotalEnergies at the port of Fos-Cavaou, near Marseille, which will contribute directly to the security of energy supply in France and Europe. *** About TotalEnergies in Algeria TotalEnergies is a long-standing player in the Algerian energy sector.

(RVMD) announces groundbreaking research on RMC-7977, a RAS(ON) multi-selective tri-complex inhibitor with potent anti-tumor activity in RAS-mutant pancreatic cancer. The two Nature papers highlight the discovery, translational implications, and broad-spectrum potential of RMC-7977 in targeting various RAS mutations. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The findings regarding RMC-7977 and its potential to target a broad spectrum of RAS mutations, including those previously considered undruggable, represent a significant advancement in the field of oncology. The ability to inhibit both mutant and wild-type forms of RAS could address a major limitation of current KRAS-targeted therapies. These therapies are often hindered by resistance mechanisms that involve the activation of wild-type RAS, which can lead to treatment failure. The preclinical success of RMC-7977 in various cancer models, particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), suggests a promising therapeutic strategy for a disease with historically poor prognosis and limited treatment options.Furthermore, the exploration of combination treatments to counter monotherapy resistance is a important step in improving patient outcomes. In PDAC, where survival rates are low, the development of drugs like RMC-7977 could potentially extend life expectancy and improve the quality of life for patients. The ongoing clinical trials will be pivotal in determining the safety and efficacy of RMC-7977 in humans and the results could have far-reaching implications for the treatment of RAS-mutant cancers. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement of the preclinical findings and the subsequent initiation of clinical trials for RMC-6236, a compound derived from the same class as RMC-7977, is likely to have a positive impact on the stock performance of Revolution Medicines. Investors often respond favorably to advancements in drug development, particularly in areas with high unmet medical needs such as RAS-mutant cancers.The company's strategic decision to pursue combination therapies and the potential to initiate pivotal studies, may further strengthen its position in the oncology market. However, it is important for stakeholders to consider the lengthy and uncertain nature of drug development. While promising, these findings are still in the early stages and the commercial viability of RMC-6236 will depend on the outcomes of the clinical trials and subsequent FDA approvals.Competition in the targeted therapy space for oncology is fierce and the success of RMC-6236 will also depend on its ability to demonstrate superior efficacy and safety profiles compared to existing treatments. The potential for RMC-6236 to treat a wide range of RAS mutations could give Revolution Medicines a competitive edge, but the market response will hinge on clinical trial data and regulatory outcomes. Clinical Trial Expert The initiation of clinical trials for RMC-6236 represents a critical step in the translation of preclinical findings into potential treatments. The design of these trials, including the selection of appropriate endpoints and patient populations, will be instrumental in assessing the drug's efficacy and safety. The choice to investigate RMC-6236 in a first-in-human trial with a focus on advanced solid tumors harboring specific RAS mutations ensures that the study targets the patient population most likely to benefit from the therapy.The decision to plan pivotal studies in NSCLC and PDAC based on preliminary data underscores the company's confidence in the drug's potential. However, it is essential to approach such developments with cautious optimism. The complexity of cancer biology and the potential for unforeseen adverse events or resistance mechanisms mean that positive preclinical results do not always translate to clinical success. The ongoing trials will need to demonstrate not only that RMC-6236 is effective but also that it is tolerable over extended treatment periods.In addition, the exploration of combination therapies, such as the use of RMC-6236 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy, reflects a growing trend in oncology to enhance treatment efficacy. The outcome of these trials will provide valuable insights into the drug's mechanism of action and its place within the broader landscape of cancer treatment options. 04/08/2024 - 11:36 AM Two original papers in Nature highlight the discovery and translational implications of RMC-7977, a RAS(ON) multi-selective tri-complex inhibitor that exhibits unprecedented anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of RAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) First paper demonstrates RMC-7977 successfully targets signaling by both mutant and wild-type forms of RAS to drive potent and durable inhibition of RAS-mutated cancers Second paper highlights translation-focused research with RMC-7977, which drives deep and durable anti-tumor activity, at well-tolerated doses, across a wide range of RAS-mutated PDAC preclinical models REDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revolution Medicines, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVMD), a clinical-stage oncology company developing targeted therapies for patients with RAS-addicted cancers, today announced the publication of two peer-reviewed research papers in Nature. The first paper highlights the discovery and preclinical characterization of RMC-7977, a preclinical tool compound representative of a class of oral RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors, including the investigational drug candidate RMC-6236, that target multiple RAS variants. The second paper highlights the systematic evaluation of RMC-7977 in a wide range of preclinical models of PDAC. This original research was led by scientists at Revolution Medicines and conducted in collaboration with researchers from across the U.S. and Europe. Oncogenic RAS proteins drive up to 30 percent of all human cancers, most notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PDAC and colorectal cancer (CRC). RAS G12 mutations, such as G12D, G12V and G12C, predominate in human cancers. Approved KRAS-targeted cancer therapies target only one particular RAS mutation, KRAS G12C. The first Nature paper describes RMC-7977, a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor preclinical tool compound, which was designed to inhibit the full spectrum of oncogenic RAS mutations, including RAS codon 12 mutations (RAS G12X) as well as non-mutated wild-type RAS. RMC-7977 engages the intracellular chaperone cyclophilin A (CYPA) to form a binary complex that binds reversibly and with high affinity to RAS proteins that are in the active, GTP-bound or ON state. In preclinical studies, RMC-7977 demonstrated robust, durable anti-tumor activity at well-tolerated doses across a range of RAS-mutated NSCLC, PDAC and CRC models. Importantly, the preclinical study demonstrated that RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors, as represented by RMC-7977, have the potential to overcome some of the resistance mechanisms that have been shown to limit the clinical efficacy and durability of current KRAS(OFF) G12C-selective inhibitors, including adaptive signaling mechanisms mediated by activation of wild-type RAS. The second report describes research into the pharmacology and anti-tumor activity of the tool compound, RMC-7977, which was evaluated across a diverse range of preclinical PDAC models. Broad and pronounced anti-tumor activity was observed across various preclinical models following direct RAS inhibition by RMC-7977 at exposures that were well tolerated in vivo, providing a strong preclinical rationale for evaluating broad-spectrum RAS inhibition in the clinical PDAC setting. Furthermore, careful analysis of recognized clinical resistance mechanisms in a sophisticated model of PDAC treated with RMC-7977 revealed a promising combination treatment regimen that may be capable of countering monotherapy drug resistance. “This innovative research extends the impact of our tri-complex inhibitor platform to a wide range of common, oncogenic RAS mutants for which no targeted drugs are available, and supported the discovery of RMC-6236, our clinical-stage RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor. The findings reverse long-standing scientific dogma by showing that it is possible to obtain meaningful anti-tumor activity by broadly targeting the RAS class of proteins without unacceptable effects in normal tissues,” said Mark A. Goldsmith, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer and chairman of Revolution Medicines. “The preclinical findings reported in these scientific papers, combined with initial data we have disclosed from an ongoing clinical study of RMC-6236, support further evaluation of RMC-6236 in patients living with RAS-addicted cancers, for whom there remain large unmet medical needs.” The investigational oral drug candidate RMC-6236 is a RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor designed to treat patients with cancers driven by a wide range of common RAS mutations. Revolution Medicines is currently evaluating RMC-6236 as monotherapy in a first-in-human trial in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring G12X, G13X, and Q61X mutations (NCT05379985). Based on promising preliminary data in this trial, planning is underway to initiate pivotal studies of RMC-6236 as monotherapy in NSCLC and PDAC. RMC-6236 is also being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in patients with advanced RAS-mutated solid tumors (NCT06162221) and in combination with RMC-6291, the company’s investigational RAS(ON) G12C-selective inhibitor, for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors (NCT06128551).

Biotech Market Analyst Longeveron's public offering occurs within a highly competitive and capital-intensive biotech industry. The decision to price at $2.35, which is relatively low for the sector, could be interpreted as a strategy to attract investors by offering a lower entry point, which may be necessary given the current market conditions and investor sentiment towards risk in the biotech sector.The inclusion of pre-funded warrants is a noteworthy aspect, as it suggests a contingency for investors who may prefer an alternative to immediate full equity investment. This flexibility could be a response to market demand for more investment options within the volatile biotech industry. The five-year exercisability period of the warrants also gives investors a longer-term stake in the company's future success or failure.Understanding the context of Longeveron's specific therapeutic focus is important for stakeholders. HLHS and Alzheimer's disease represent areas with significant unmet medical needs, which could translate to substantial market opportunities if Longeveron's therapies prove effective. The company's progress in these areas should be closely monitored as it could signal future valuation shifts. Medical Research Analyst From a medical research perspective, Longeveron's focus on life-threatening and chronic aging-related conditions positions it within a niche yet growing segment of the biotechnology industry. The development of cellular therapies for conditions like HLHS and Alzheimer's disease is at the forefront of medical innovation. The success of these therapies could lead to paradigm shifts in treatment protocols and have a profound impact on patient outcomes.The capital raised from this public offering is likely earmarked for the continuation and expansion of clinical trials. The effectiveness of these trials and subsequent peer-reviewed publications, will be critical in determining the company's credibility and the potential impact of its therapies. It is important for investors to understand the lengthy and uncertain nature of clinical trial outcomes, as well as the regulatory hurdles that must be cleared before any therapy can be brought to market.Furthermore, the field of cellular therapy is marked by rapid technological advancements and a competitive intellectual property landscape.

The study shows an objective response rate of 34%, with a median progression-free survival of 6.9 months and median overall survival of 15.9 months. Disease control was observed in 85% of patients, highlighting the potential of adagrasib for this specific patient group. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor From an oncological perspective, the reported data on KRAZATI® combined with cetuximab presents a significant advancement in the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). Historically, CRC patients with this mutation have had limited treatment options and poor outcomes. The objective response rate of 34% and the median overall survival of 15.9 months are promising figures, particularly when compared to the historical data for this patient subgroup. The disease control rate of 85% also suggests a substantial proportion of patients are deriving benefit from this combination therapy.The concept of 'undruggable' targets in oncology, such as the KRAS mutation, has been a challenge for decades. The positive outcomes from this study may represent a paradigm shift in how these mutations are approached in drug development. However, it is important to recognize that these results need to be seen in the context of the drug's safety profile, which appears manageable but will require ongoing monitoring as the treatment is introduced into broader clinical practice. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of a supplemental new drug application by the FDA and the assignment of a PDUFA goal date indicates a regulatory milestone for Bristol Myers Squibb and its subsidiary, Mirati Therapeutics. The priority review status reflects the unmet medical need in this patient population. From a research standpoint, the progression-free survival of 6.9 months is noteworthy as it represents a benchmark for future studies in this area. Additionally, the simultaneous publication of the data in a reputable journal like Cancer Discovery underscores the scientific community's interest in these findings.It is also important to consider the implications for biomarker testing in CRC. The emphasis on the identification of KRASG12C mutations could drive increased demand for diagnostic testing, potentially influencing the strategies of companies involved in the diagnostics sector. The broader impact on the precision medicine approach in oncology could be substantial, with a move towards more personalized treatment regimens based on specific genetic profiles. Market Research Analyst For investors and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, the clinical success of KRAZATI® in combination with cetuximab represents a potential catalyst for Bristol Myers Squibb's stock performance. The specificity of the treatment for KRASG12C-mutated CRC could position the company as a leader in a niche, yet significant market segment. The market potential for this combination therapy could be further extrapolated by examining the prevalence of the KRASG12C mutation in the CRC patient population, which stands at approximately 3-4%.Moreover, the strategic implications for Bristol Myers Squibb's oncology pipeline and potential market share in the CRC therapeutics market are considerable. The company's ability to innovate and address unmet needs with targeted therapies could strengthen its competitive position. However, it is important to monitor the outcome of the PDUFA date and any subsequent market adoption and insurance coverage decisions, which will ultimately influence the commercial success of the drug. 04/08/2024 - 11:30 AM Late-breaking data to be featured in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting on Monday, April 8 and highlighted as part of the official meeting press program PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) today announced data from the cohorts of the Phase 1/ 2 KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating KRAZATI® (adagrasib) in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of patients with previously treated KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). These late breaking data (abstract #CT013) will be featured in an oral presentation at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting on Monday, April 8 at 11:10 a.m. Pacific Time and will be highlighted as part of the meeting’s official press program. The data will also be published simultaneously in Cancer Discovery. With a median follow up of 11.9 months in 94 patients, KRAZATI plus cetuximab demonstrated an objective response rate, the primary endpoint, of 34%, median progression-free survival of 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.7-7.4), and median overall survival of 15.9 months (95% CI, 11.8-18.8) in pre-treated patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic CRC. The median duration of response was 5.8 months. Disease control was observed in 85% of patients. The safety profile for KRAZATI plus cetuximab was manageable and consistent with previous reports, and with the known safety profile of each drug individually. KRASG12C mutations act as oncogenic drivers and occur in approximately 3-4% of colorectal cancers. In previous studies, treatment with cetuximab as a single agent did not offer a clinical benefit in patients with KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer. “Patients with KRASG12C-mutated colorectal cancer have historically faced poor prognoses and remain in need of additional treatment options,” said Scott Kopetz, M.D., Ph.D, FACP, associate vice president for translational research, and Professor, Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “Although KRAS had previously been considered ‘undruggable,’ these data from KRYSTAL-1 reinforce the potential benefit of adagrasib for these specific patients.” “While there has been progress in the treatment of colorectal cancer, there remain groups of patients, such as those with KRAS-mutated cancers, who continue to need new, targeted treatment options,” said Anne Kerber, senior vice president, head of late clinical development, Hematology, Oncology, Cell Therapy (HOCT) at Bristol Myers Squibb. “These data highlight the significance of testing and identification of KRASG12C mutations in patients with CRC.” The company announced in February 2024 that the FDA had accepted a supplemental new drug application for KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab as a targeted treatment option for patients with previously treated KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic CRC for priority review and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of June 21, 2024. Bristol Myers Squibb thanks the patients and investigators involved in the KRYSTAL-1 clinical trial. This study was funded by Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb company. KRAZATI is a registered trademark of Mirati Therapeutics, Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb company. ABOUT KRAZATI® (adagrasib) KRAZATI (adagrasib) is highly selective and potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of KRASG12C that is optimized to sustain target inhibition, an attribute that could be important to treat KRASG12C-mutated cancers, as the KRASG12C protein regenerates every 24-48 hours. KRASG12C mutations act as oncogenic drivers and occur in approximately 14% of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma), 3-4% of colorectal cancers, and 1-2% of several other cancers. In 2022, KRAZATI was granted accelerated approval for treatment of adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). In 2024, the European Commission (EC) granted conditional marketing authorization for KRAZATI as a targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC and disease progression after at least one prior systemic therapy. KRAZATI continues to be evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with other anti-cancer therapies in patients with advanced KRASG12C-mutated solid tumors, including NSCLC and colorectal cancer. In 2022, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for KRAZATI in combination with cetuximab in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) whose cancer has progressed following prior treatment with chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF therapy.

ABOUT KRYSTAL-1 KRYSTAL-1 is an open-label, multicenter, multiple expansion cohort Phase 1/2 trial to determine the safety and efficacy of KRAZATI in patients with advanced solid tumors that harbor a KRASG12C mutation. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study was objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival and safety. INDICATION KRAZATI is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of a clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION GASTROINTESTINAL ADVERSE REACTIONS In the pooled safety population, serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions observed were gastrointestinal obstruction in 1.6%, including 1.4% grade 3 or 4, gastrointestinal bleeding in 0.5% of patients, including 0.5% grade 3, and colitis in 0.3%, including 0.3% grade 3. In addition, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting occurred in 89% of 366 patients, including 9% grade 3. Nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting led to dosage interruption or dose reduction in 29% of patients and permanent discontinuation of KRAZATI in 0.3% Monitor and manage patients using supportive care, including antidiarrheals, antiemetics, or fluid replacement, as indicated. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI based on severity QTC INTERVAL PROLONGATION KRAZATI can cause QTc interval prolongation, which can increase the risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g., torsades de pointes) or sudden death In the pooled safety population, 6% of 366 patients with at least one post-baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment had an average QTc ≥501 ms, and 11% of patients had an increase from baseline of QTc >60 msec. KRAZATI causes concentration-dependent increases in the QTc interval Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval. Avoid use of KRAZATI in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with concurrent QTc prolongation Monitor ECGs and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, electrolyte abnormalities, and in patients who are taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval. Withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue KRAZATI, depending on severity HEPATOTOXICITY KRAZATI can cause hepatotoxicity In the pooled safety population, hepatotoxicity occurred in 37%, and 7% were grade 3 or 4. A total of 32% of patients who received KRAZATI had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 5% were grade 3 and 0.5% were grade 4. Increased ALT/AST leading to dose interruption or reduction occurred in 11% of patients. KRAZATI was discontinued due to increased ALT/AST in 0.5% of patients Monitor liver laboratory tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) prior to the start of KRAZATI, and monthly for 3 months or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase elevations.

Silence Therapeutics Announces JAMA Publication of Additional Phase 1 Data for Zerlasiran in Subjects with Elevated Lipoprotein(a),2024-04-08T15:48:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Silence Therapeutics plc, Nasdaq: SLN, announced positive results from the APOLLO phase 1 study of zerlasiran in reducing Lp(a) levels, a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The findings, published in JAMA, show sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations with well-tolerated profiles, promising advancements in addressing cardiovascular disease.","Silence Therapeutics Announces JAMA Publication of Additional Phase 1 Data for Zerlasiran in Subjects with Elevated Lipoprotein(a) Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Silence Therapeutics plc, Nasdaq: SLN, announced positive results from the APOLLO phase 1 study of zerlasiran in reducing Lp(a) levels, a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The findings, published in JAMA, show sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations with well-tolerated profiles, promising advancements in addressing cardiovascular disease. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent publication of phase 1 study results for zerlasiran, an siRNA therapeutic aimed at reducing Lp(a) levels, presents a significant development in the field of cardiovascular disease treatment. The study's findings indicate that zerlasiran has a favorable safety profile and efficacy in lowering Lp(a), a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular conditions. Given that up to 20% of the global population is affected by elevated Lp(a) levels, the potential market for such a treatment is substantial. The data showing sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations over a year for high doses and over 201 days for multiple dosing regimens in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) suggests that zerlasiran could offer a long-term management solution for patients at risk. This could lead to a paradigm shift in how cardiovascular risk is managed, particularly for patients who do not respond to traditional lipid-lowering therapies. From a medical research perspective, the use of siRNA technology in this context is noteworthy. It represents a growing area of interest in precision medicine, where treatments are designed to target specific genetic pathways. The success of zerlasiran in clinical trials could catalyze further investment and innovation in siRNA-based therapies. Financial Analyst The publication of positive phase 1 study results for zerlasiran in a prestigious journal like JAMA is likely to have favorable implications for Silence Therapeutics' stock performance. Investors often respond well to clinical milestones, especially those published in reputable medical journals, as they validate the scientific progress of a company's pipeline. Considering the potential market size, due to the prevalence of high Lp(a) levels in the population, the successful development of zerlasiran could lead to significant revenue streams for Silence Therapeutics. However, it is essential to consider the cost of ongoing clinical trials, potential regulatory hurdles and the time frame until market approval when evaluating the financial impact. Long-term implications for stakeholders include the positioning of Silence Therapeutics as a leader in precision medicine for cardiovascular diseases. Should zerlasiran reach the market, it could also impact the competitive landscape, possibly affecting the stock prices of companies with competing therapies. Market Research Analyst The positive outcome of the APOLLO phase 1 study for zerlasiran highlights a significant unmet need in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases associated with high Lp(a) levels. As the current treatment options are limited, a new and effective drug like zerlasiran could capture a considerable share of the cardiovascular disease treatment market. Market research indicates that patient-centric treatments with fewer side effects and long-term benefits are highly sought after. Zerlasiran's well-tolerated profile and sustained efficacy align with these market demands, potentially leading to strong adoption rates upon commercialization. Additionally, as a precision engineered medicine, zerlasiran could benefit from favorable reimbursement policies, especially in markets with a high focus on innovative treatment solutions. The interest in personalized medicine is growing and zerlasiran's development aligns with this trend. The market for such targeted therapies is expected to expand, providing opportunities for companies like Silence Therapeutics to establish a strong presence and potentially collaborate with larger pharmaceutical firms. 04/08/2024 - 11:48 AM Published findings demonstrate zerlasiran was well-tolerated and significantly reduced Lp(a) after single and multiple dosing LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Silence Therapeutics plc, Nasdaq: SLN (“Silence” or the “Company”), an experienced and innovative biotechnology company committed to transforming people’s lives by silencing diseases through precision engineered medicines, today announced additional results from the APOLLO phase 1 study of zerlasiran (SLN360) in subjects with baseline lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), levels at or over 150 nmol/L were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), linked here. Zerlasiran is a siRNA (short interfering RNA) designed to lower the body’s production of Lp(a), a key genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease affecting up to 20% of the world’s population. “Positive phase 1 data published in JAMA demonstrate treatment with zerlasiran produced sustained reductions in Lp(a) concentrations with a well-tolerated profile using varying dosing regimens,” said Curtis Rambaran, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Silence and senior author of the publication. “The promising findings from this study are particularly encouraging as we complete the phase 2 study for zerlasiran and underscore our commitment to address this major unmet need in cardiovascular disease.” The single ascending and multiple dose trial enrolled 32 healthy participants and 36 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and Lp(a) concentrations ≥150 nmol/L. Results from the single ascending dose portion of the trial in healthy participants were previously published in the April 2022 issue of JAMA, linked here. Today’s JAMA publication reviews findings from the extended 365 day follow up of healthy participants who received the two highest zerlasiran doses (300 or 600 mg) and 201 days of follow up for ASCVD patients administered 2 doses. Healthy participants were randomized and received a single subcutaneous dose of placebo, 300 mg or 600 mg; ASCVD patients received two doses of placebo, 200 mg at a 4-week interval or 300 mg or 450 mg at an 8-week interval. The primary outcome was safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes included the serum levels of zerlasiran and effects on Lp(a) serum concentrations. Zerlasiran was safe and well tolerated. The median change from baseline in serum Lp(a) concentrations 365 days after single doses for placebo, 300 mg, and 600 mg were +14%, −30%, and −29% respectively. The maximal median change from baseline after two doses of placebo, 200 mg, 300 mg and 450 mg were +7%, -97%, -98% and -99%, attenuating to 0.3%, -60%, 90% and 89% respectively, after 201 days. Zerlasiran is currently being evaluated in the ALPACAR-360 phase 2 study in subjects with baseline Lp(a) levels at or over 125 nmol/L at high risk of ASCVD events. About Silence Therapeutics Silence Therapeutics is developing a new generation of medicines by harnessing the body's natural mechanism of RNA interference, or RNAi, to inhibit the expression of specific target genes thought to play a role in the pathology of diseases with significant unmet need. Silence's proprietary mRNAi GOLD™ platform can be used to create siRNAs (short interfering RNAs) that precisely target and silence disease-associated genes in the liver, which represents a substantial opportunity. Silence's wholly owned product candidates include zerlasiran designed to address the high and prevalent unmet medical need in reducing cardiovascular risk in people born with high levels of lipoprotein(a) and divesiran designed to address hematological diseases, including polycythemia vera. Silence also maintains ongoing research and development collaborations with AstraZeneca and Hansoh Pharma, among others. For more information, please visit https://www.silence-therapeutics.com/.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 12:24 PM Winners were selected by a panel of more than 660 esteemed industry professionals across 128 markets at the third annual commercial real estate awards WHITELAND, Ind., April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Mohr Logistics Park (MLP) was named the 2024 ""Commercial Development of the Year"" CoStar Impact Award winner in the Indianapolis market. This year's winners of the CoStar Impact Awards — chosen for their growth, diversification, and ability to overcome unique challenges in their markets — were selected from a panel of more than 660 industry professionals drawn from each respective market. In the heart of Whiteland, IN, MLP spans 475 acres and is a testament to the innovation that has redefined the Indianapolis MSA's industrial capabilities. The initial land acquisition in June of 2020 laid the groundwork for a business park that now houses high-quality industrial tenants like Cooper Tire (Goodyear), NFI Industries, and DHL. The master plan included eleven Class A structures, with varying sizes and specifications to meet growing logistics demands. Mohr Capital embraced sustainability, environmental responsibility, and various technological initiatives in developing the park's state-of-the-art amenities, such as EV chargers, enhanced HVAC that uses less gas than a traditional Make-Up Air Unit, upgraded dock equipment, walking paths and the potential for a solar array field. On April 1, 2023, an EF-3 tornado ripped through Lot 6, a recently completed one-million square-foot warehouse—the largest building in the park at the time—and the nearby community, leaving a trail of destruction that stretched for miles. In the disaster's aftermath, Mohr Capital sent a cleaning crew of 50 helpers, dumpsters, and other equipment to the neighboring farm to help in the massive cleanup effort. Mohr also jumped into action on the cleanup and rebuild of Lot 6 — and the entire million-square-foot warehouse was rebuilt in only seven months. This resilience in the face of adversity echoed the collaborative spirit that marked MLP's inception. The public/private partnership with the Town of Whiteland also played a pivotal role in the recovery efforts. From its bold master plan to its generous community collaboration in the face of disaster, Mohr Logistics Park stands as a testament to what is possible when vision meets execution. As Mohr Capital CEO and Indiana native Bob Mohr would say, Mohr Logistics Park is ""Hoosier Owned and Hoosier Strong."" That sentiment has proved true exactly a year later, with MLP's triumphant CoStar Impact Award recognition. ""Mohr Capital's response to a natural disaster proved how valuable it is to have a professional and competent team,"" said Gary Horn, the chief development officer at Mohr Capital. ""Mark Writt with CBRE and Sam Fugate with Pepper Construction were on site and directing activities within hours of the disaster. Denney Construction brought a team to deal with the massive clean-up of Mohr's site and adjoining neighbors. Everyone involved with MLP development contributed and proved that having the right team makes all the difference. Indiana's Hoosier ""can do"" spirit turned a natural disaster into a successful development. I cannot thank the team enough.""

The therapy, presented at AACR, demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity through various mechanisms, offering hope to patients with treatment-resistant cancer. MiNK-215's collaboration potential with other immunotherapies like botensilimab and balstilimab highlights its versatility and effectiveness in enhancing the anti-tumor response. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Analyst The recent findings on MiNK-215, presented at the AACR Meeting, hold substantial significance for the field of oncology, particularly in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. CRC is notorious for its poor prognosis in advanced stages, especially when liver metastases are present. The ability of MiNK-215 to remodel the tumor stroma and activate the immune system within the liver metastatic environment represents a potential breakthrough. This could lead to a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, moving away from solely relying on immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown limited efficacy in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC.From a research perspective, the use of human organoid models is noteworthy as it provides a more accurate representation of human tumors compared to traditional cell lines or animal models. This enhances the translational potential of the preclinical data. However, the transition from organoid models to clinical efficacy in patients is non-trivial and requires extensive validation. Should MiNK-215 progress to later stages of clinical trials and demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, it may attract significant attention from both the scientific community and investors, potentially impacting MiNK Therapeutics' market valuation. Biotech Market Analyst Investor interest in MiNK Therapeutics is likely to be influenced by the progress and potential of MiNK-215. The company's focus on allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapies positions it within a highly competitive and innovative segment of the biotech industry. The ability to pair MiNK-215 with other immunotherapies could be a strategic move, potentially opening up partnership opportunities and additional revenue streams. It's important to note that the biotech sector is highly volatile, with stock prices often reacting to clinical trial outcomes and regulatory news.For stakeholders, the key factors to monitor would include the progression of MiNK-215 into clinical trials, the breadth of its applicability across different cancer types and its performance compared to existing treatments. While promising, the development stage of MiNK-215 suggests that there is still a considerable risk and time before potential FDA approval and market entry. The implications for the stock market will depend on the continuous flow of positive data and the company's ability to maintain a robust pipeline. Immunotherapy Specialist MiNK-215's reported ability to target the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and modify the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a sophisticated approach to cancer immunotherapy. FAP is a significant target in oncology due to its selective expression in the tumor stroma and association with a hostile TME. By reducing FAP expressing stellate cells and CXCL-12 expressing cells, MiNK-215 could potentially alleviate immunosuppression and facilitate a more robust anti-tumor immune response.Moreover, the synergy of MiNK-215 with other immunotherapies could amplify its anti-tumor effects. The concept of armored CAR-iNKT cells is relatively new and MiNK-215's IL-15 enhancement is designed to improve the persistence and efficacy of these cells. The data suggests that MiNK-215 not only recruits tumor-reactive T cells but also improves the overall immune landscape within the liver metastases, which is a significant challenge in CRC treatment. The long-term impact of such therapies, however, hinges on their clinical safety profile, which must be closely monitored in subsequent trials. 04/08/2024 - 12:00 PM MiNK-215 eliminated MSS colorectal cancer liver metastases in human organoid modelsMiNK-215 exhibits potent anti-tumor activity through multiple mechanisms including immune activation NEW YORK, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MiNK Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: INKT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, today announced the presentation of data from MiNK-215, an investigational IL-15 armored fibroblast activation protein (FAP) targeting CAR-iNKT cell therapy, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Meeting in San Diego, CA. “MiNK-215 represents a novel cellular therapeutic to overcome the limitations of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The data presented at AACR demonstrate MiNK-215's potential to effectively combat colorectal liver metastases, offering hope for patients who have exhausted conventional treatment options,” said Dr. Jennifer Buell, President and Chief Executive Officer at MiNK. “Furthermore, these results accentuate MiNK-215's versatility and synergistic potential when paired with immunotherapies such as Agenus’ botensilimab and balstilimab. This collaboration holds promise in bolstering the anti-tumor response, particularly in the formidable realm of microsatellite stable colorectal cancer."" Liver mets have limited the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with mismatch repair proficient/microsatellite-stable (pMMR/MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC). MiNK's innovative iNKT cell therapy, MiNK-215, has shown the ability to remodel the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment within the liver. Human organoid models of CRC with liver metastases revealed that MiNK-215 exhibits potent anti-tumor activity through multiple mechanisms that include: Tumor stroma remodeling: MiNK-215 effectively remodels the tumor stroma, the supportive tissue surrounding the tumor to create a more favorable environment for immune cell infiltration and activity.Immune activation: By reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME), MiNK-215 reduces the presence of immune-suppressive FAP expressing stellate cells and CXCL-12 expressing cells.Enhanced tumor killing: MiNK-215 recruits tumor-reactive T cells, pivotal in mounting an effective immune response against the tumor, ultimately leading to enhanced tumor eradication.

The study highlights the need for higher lymphodepletion doses in solid tumors. The company continues to innovate in allogeneic CAR-T therapies for cancer treatment. Positive Promising data on P-BCMA-ALLO1 for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients 60% clinical response rate in patients who progressed after BCMA-targeted therapy Well-tolerated investigational treatment Importance of higher lymphodepletion doses for solid tumor treatment No dose-limiting toxicities or severe adverse effects in the study Continued exploration of optimal lymphodepletion regimen for solid tumors Plans to share more data on BCMA and MUC1-C programs in the second half of 2024 Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from Poseida Therapeutics on P-BCMA-ALLO1, an allogeneic CAR-T therapy, are significant in the context of treatment for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The reported 60% overall response rate, particularly in patients who have been previously treated with BCMA-targeted therapies, suggests a potential new avenue for patients who have exhausted other options. Given the well-tolerated nature of the treatment, as indicated by the absence of severe toxicities, this could represent a substantial advancement in the safety profile of CAR-T therapies.Allogeneic CAR-T therapies, which are derived from healthy donors and can be used 'off-the-shelf', offer a logistical advantage over autologous therapies that require harvesting and modifying a patient's own T-cells. This could potentially reduce treatment times and costs, impacting the business model of CAR-T therapy providers. However, the long-term durability of responses and the potential for late-onset toxicities will be important factors in determining the commercial viability of P-BCMA-ALLO1. Oncology Doctor The clinical response of P-BCMA-ALLO1 in heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients is encouraging. The very good partial response (VGPR) observed in patients is indicative of a significant reduction in disease burden. The absence of severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is particularly noteworthy, as these are common and often serious complications associated with CAR-T therapies.Furthermore, the implications of optimizing lymphodepletion regimens for solid tumors might pave the way for broader applications of CAR-T therapies beyond hematological malignancies. The need for higher cyclophosphamide doses in solid tumors to achieve adequate lymphodepletion reflects the unique challenges posed by the tumor microenvironment in these cancers. This insight could be pivotal for the development of effective CAR-T treatments for solid tumors, which have been historically more difficult to treat with immunotherapy. Market Research Analyst The data presented by Poseida Therapeutics may influence the market's perception of the company's pipeline potential. With the CAR-T market projected to grow, the introduction of an effective allogeneic CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma could capture a significant market share, especially considering the unmet need in patients refractory to current BCMA-targeted therapies.Investors will likely monitor the upcoming datasets in the second half of 2024 to gauge the progress and potential of both BCMA and MUC1-C programs. The successful optimization of lymphodepletion regimens for solid tumors could also expand the market opportunity for Poseida's therapies. From a financial standpoint, the ability to manufacture and provide allogeneic CAR-T therapies at scale could position Poseida advantageously in terms of cost-efficiency and accessibility, potentially affecting the company's stock valuation in the long term. 04/08/2024 - 12:00 PM Promising early data suggest patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who progressed after prior BCMA-targeted therapy achieved clinical responses with P-BCMA-ALLO1, which was well toleratedFollowing efforts to optimize allogeneic CAR-T therapy, Poseida is presenting a new data analysis underscoring the need for higher lymphodepletion chemotherapy doses when treating solid tumors vs. multiple myelomaSAN DIEGO, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: PSTX), a clinical-stage cell and gene therapy company advancing a new class of treatments for patients with cancer and rare diseases, today announced new data from a subset of patients in an ongoing Phase 1 study of its lead program, P-BCMA-ALLO1. Results showed that three of the five (60%) patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who had progressed following BCMA-targeted therapy achieved clinical responses with P-BCMA-ALLO1. In addition, this investigational treatment was well-tolerated. P-BCMA-ALLO1 is a novel investigational B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted allogeneic, T stem cell memory (TSCM)-rich chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy manufactured from healthy donor T-cells and available off-the-shelf. These new Phase 1 study subgroup data and a new data analysis of different lymphodepletion regimens in patients treated with P-BCMA-ALLO1 for multiple myeloma or P-MUC1C-ALLO1 for solid tumors are being presented today in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego. ""Multiple myeloma remains incurable, and patients often relapse, despite initial high response rates with BCMA-targeted immunotherapies, including autologous CAR-T therapies,"" said Bhagirathbhai Dholaria, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology/Oncology) at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville, Tenn. ""New treatment options are urgently needed for these patients, which is why I'm encouraged by these impressive Phase 1 subgroup results, which may be the first report of an allogeneic CAR-T therapy showing clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients whose myeloma has progressed after multiple BCMA-targeted immunotherapies."" ""These new data build on the P-BCMA-ALLO1 data presented at ASH 2023, which demonstrated a 100% overall response rate in patients who had not been previously treated with a BCMA-targeted therapy. The new findings also provide additional evidence that our investigational, off-the-shelf allogeneic CAR-T therapy could be an appropriate treatment for a broader range of patients with multiple myeloma, including those with relapsed/refractory disease whose cancer progressed following prior BCMA-targeted therapy, representing the highest unmet need in this setting,"" said Syed Rizvi, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Poseida. ""In addition, we continue to explore the optimal lymphodepletion regimen for CAR-T in solid tumors and are directly applying these learnings to our P-MUC1C-ALLO1 trial with the goal of delivering the same benefits in solid tumors as we have seen in myeloma. We look forward to sharing more fulsome datasets on both our BCMA and MUC1-C programs in the second half of 2024."" New Phase 1 P-BCMA-ALLO1 Study Subgroup Data The open-label, multicenter Phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma is assessing the safety and maximum tolerated dose of P-BCMA-ALLO1 (primary objective) and its anti-myeloma activity (secondary objective). Study participants were required to have received a prior proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Five study participants who had progressed on or following prior BCMA-targeting autologous CAR-T, T-cell engagers or both, and with ninety days post-P-BCMA-ALLO1 treatment follow-up, are presented in this poster. Key findings from the subgroup analysis showed that P-BCMA-ALLO1 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities, graft vs. host disease, or Grade 3 or greater cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The overall response rate in patients receiving P-BCMA-ALLO1 was 60%, with all three patients who achieved a clinical response experiencing a very good partial response (VGPR). This included one patient who had previously received both teclistamab and an autologous CAR-T therapy and has maintained a response for more than four months. New Data on Optimizing Lymphodepletion (LD) Regimen for Patients with Solid Tumors Treated with Investigational Allogeneic CAR-T Therapy As patients with multiple myeloma receive more bone marrow suppressive treatments than those with solid tumors during their treatment journeys, this analysis evaluated the effect of increasing amounts of cyclophosphamide in LD regimens to optimize CAR-T pharmacokinetics. The analysis compared various LD regimens in two early Phase 1 trials of Poseida's investigational allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies in patients with multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Results showed that patients with solid tumors may require higher cyclophosphamide doses to achieve adequate LD, which would provide a sufficient niche to support allogeneic CAR-T expansion.

The company aims to widen the therapeutic window, enhance potency, and broaden the accessible target space for TCEs in cancer therapy. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst AbCellera's recent findings on T-cell engagers (TCEs) suggest a potential breakthrough in cancer therapy. TCEs are designed to direct the body's immune cells to attack tumor cells, a method that holds promise but has faced challenges in balancing efficacy with safety. The data presented indicates that AbCellera has developed TCEs that effectively target tumor cells while minimizing cytokine release, which can cause harmful side effects. This balance could lead to treatments that are both potent and safer for patients. From a medical research perspective, the specificity of TCEs for solid tumor targets like PSMA, B7-H4 and 5T4 and the avoidance of superagonist activity in their CD28-binding antibodies, are notable. Superagonist activity has been a concern due to its association with toxicity, so this advancement could make TCEs a more viable option for cancer treatment. Moreover, the ability to target intracellular peptides such as MAGE-A4-pMHC could significantly widen the range of addressable cancers, as many tumors express unique peptides that are not accessible with current therapies. Biotech Market Analyst AbCellera's announcement at the AACR Annual Meeting could have considerable implications for the biotech industry and investors. The company's progress in T-cell engager technology may position it favorably in the competitive landscape of cancer immunotherapy. AbCellera's approach to enhancing the therapeutic window and potency of TCEs, while broadening the target space, addresses key limitations that have hindered the widespread adoption of TCEs in solid tumors. Investors should note that the success of these preclinical developments can lead to substantial value creation, as the market for cancer immunotherapies is rapidly growing. The specificity of their molecules for targets like MAGE-A4-pMHC could open up new avenues for personalized medicine in oncology. If these TCEs progress to clinical trials and demonstrate safety and efficacy, there could be significant partnerships and licensing deals on the horizon for AbCellera, which would likely impact the company's stock performance positively. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the potential clinical applications of AbCellera's T-cell engagers are exciting. The ability to target specific solid tumor antigens while reducing the risk of cytokine release syndrome could be transformative for patient care. Current T-cell engaging therapies, like CAR-T, have shown remarkable results in hematologic malignancies but are often limited by severe toxicities in treating solid tumors. AbCellera's TCEs could represent a significant advancement in oncology, offering a new line of attack for difficult-to-treat solid tumors. The focus on costimulatory CD28-binding antibodies could enhance the immune response without the toxicity typically seen with superagonists. If these findings translate into clinical success, it could mean a new arsenal of therapies for oncologists and improved outcomes for patients with cancers that are currently hard to treat. 04/08/2024 - 12:05 PM Data show how AbCellera is expanding the reach of T-cell engagers with: CD3-binding antibodies that consistently generate T-cell engagers with potent tumor-cell killing and low cytokine release across multiple tumor targets, including PSMA, B7-H4, and 5T4 Costimulatory CD28-binding antibodies that stimulate T cells without superagonist activity Highly specific T-cell engagers for the peptide-MHC target MAGE-A4 VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AbCellera (Nasdaq: ABCL) today announced new data on its T-cell engager (TCE) programs at the American Association for Cancer ResearchⓇ (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 at the San Diego Convention Center, with three posters being presented on April 8 and one on April 9. Together, AbCellera’s data demonstrate that it is well-positioned to advance TCEs as a drug class by widening the therapeutic window, enhancing potency, and broadening the accessible target space. “TCEs are among the most promising new modalities in cancer therapy, but limitations in efficacy and safety have been barriers to realizing their potential for solid tumor indications,” said Bo Barnhart, Ph.D., VP, Translational Research at AbCellera. “Our data illustrate that we can repeatedly generate TCEs that maximize tumor-cell killing without inducing excessive cytokine release. Reducing the risk associated with CD3 engagement could improve efficacy both by widening the therapeutic window and by creating opportunities to further enhance potency through co-stimulatory modalities.” AbCellera’s poster presentations, which are available for viewing here, describe how AbCellera is: Widening the therapeutic window: AbCellera’s data describe the generation of TCEs for three solid tumor targets, PSMA, B7-H4, and 5T4, with functional profiles that are differentiated from clinical benchmarks. These molecules were engineered using a specific set of rare CD3-binding antibodies that consistently show potent tumor-cell killing and low cytokine release across multiple targets, demonstrating their potential to expand the therapeutic window across solid tumor indications. Enhancing potency: TCEs that engage the CD28 costimulatory receptor can enhance T-cell activation, proliferation, and anti-tumor activities, particularly in solid tumors. The data show that AbCellera’s IgG and heavy chain-only CD28-binding antibodies do not display superagonist activity — a property associated with toxicity. Integrating costimulatory building blocks into AbCellera’s TCE repertoire may enable development of molecules with enhanced potency for difficult-to-treat cancers. Broadening the accessible target space: The target repertoire for TCEs has been restricted to proteins expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Intracellular peptides displayed on MHC class I (pMHCs) would greatly expand the target pool for TCEs. However, development of TCEs against pMHCs has been limited due to the high degree of target specificity required. Data illustrate how AbCellera is unlocking this target class by generating molecules with high specificity for MAGE-A4-pMHC, which showed little to no binding to hundreds of off-target pMHCs. “Our platform for creating precision TCEs to address indications in cancer and autoimmunity provides a strong foundation for both internal programs and strategic partnerships,” said Murray McCutcheon, Ph.D., SVP, Partnering at AbCellera. “We look forward to advancing these programs with the aim of delivering powerful new medicines for patients.” About AbCellera’s T-Cell Engager Platform CD3 T-cell engagers have the potential to be a cornerstone of cancer treatment. They guide the immune system to find and eliminate cancer cells by binding the CD3 protein on cancer-killing T cells and tumor targets at the same time. However, development of T-cell engagers has been limited due to challenges with efficacy and safety. To address these challenges, AbCellera developed a T-cell engager platform that includes novel CD3-binding antibodies to expand the therapeutic window for this modality, costimulatory building blocks to enhance efficacy for difficult-to-treat cancers, and discovery capabilities to broaden the range of T-cell engagers to complex peptide-MHC tumor targets. AbCellera is leveraging its platform to unlock the full potential of this modality and bring powerful new cancer medicines to patients. About AbCellera Biologics Inc. AbCellera (Nasdaq: ABCL) discovers and develops antibody medicines for indications across therapeutic areas including cancer, metabolic and endocrine conditions, and autoimmune disorders. AbCellera’s engine integrates technology, data science, infrastructure, and interdisciplinary teams to solve the most challenging antibody discovery problems.

Salesforce's market share remains high in the U.S., with diverse customer bases, but growth rates have decreased from over 20% to 10-15% in 2023. Enterprises are now able to hire experts for sustainable Salesforce initiatives, leading to a market cooling effect. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The moderation in growth demand for Salesforce applications, as reported by ISG, suggests a shift in the market dynamics for CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platforms. Historically, Salesforce has enjoyed robust growth rates, but the deceleration to 10-15% indicates a maturing market or increased competition. Businesses may be reaching saturation with CRM solutions, or alternative platforms could be gaining traction. The implications for stakeholders are significant; investors might anticipate a potential plateau in revenue growth for Salesforce, which could impact the stock's valuation. Moreover, the ease of hiring experts for strategy planning may lead to more optimized and cost-effective implementations, potentially improving the ROI (Return on Investment) for Salesforce customers in the long term. IT Strategy Consultant From an IT strategy perspective, the trend towards more sustainable Salesforce initiatives is noteworthy. Enterprises are now able to fill expert positions that were previously hard to come by due to skills shortages. This development could lead to more strategic and effective use of Salesforce applications, aligning them closely with business objectives. For larger corporations, the ability to standardize core systems while allowing for regional variations is important for global operations. This balance of standardization and customization can lead to significant efficiencies and cost savings. However, the hesitance of some clients to migrate to industry-specific applications raises questions about the perceived value and cost of transitioning from current function-based tools. This reluctance could slow down the adoption of newer, potentially more beneficial Salesforce offerings. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial implications, Salesforce's high market share in the U.S. is a double-edged sword. While it provides a strong customer base, the slowdown in growth rates could signal a need for innovation or diversification in Salesforce's offerings. The emphasis on industry-specific applications is a strategic move to encourage migration and potentially increase sales, but it appears to be met with some resistance. Financially, this could mean a slower-than-anticipated uptake of new products, which may affect future revenue streams. Investors should monitor the company's ability to convert hesitancy into adoption, as this could be a key driver for Salesforce's performance in the coming years. The impact on the stock market will depend on how well Salesforce can navigate this transition and maintain its leadership in the CRM space. 04/08/2024 - 01:18 PM More enterprises in Salesforce’s home market can now hire experts to carefully plan strategies, while providers still play key roles, ISG Provider Lens™ report says STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- U.S. enterprises continue to work with service providers on implementing and operating Salesforce applications amid moderating growth in demand for the company’s applications, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Salesforce Ecosystem Partners report for the U.S. finds that Salesforce growth rates above 20 percent in recent years slowed to between 10 and 15 percent in 2023. The cooling of the market has made it easier for some enterprises to plan sustainable Salesforce initiatives, ISG says. “Until recently, a severe skills shortage prevented some companies from hiring the right experts for Salesforce strategy and optimization,” said Bill Huber, partner, digital platforms and solutions, for ISG. “Now they are filling those positions and engaging with providers on execution.” Salesforce has a particularly high market share in the U.S., its home market, the report says. Its U.S. customer base is diverse, ranging from small companies to large corporations with global operations. The biggest of these have complex IT support needs, including global rollouts of standardized core systems with region-specific variations. Small and midsize enterprises have simpler requirements and often use more standard Salesforce implementations. As in other regions, U.S. organizations that make extensive use of Salesforce across many departments are taking a harder look at the value it delivers, ISG says. In some cases, they are consolidating their Salesforce instances. Salesforce is strongly emphasizing its industry-specific applications, encouraging clients to migrate to these new platforms from current function-based tools, the report says. Some clients are hesitant to adopt the new approach, partly due to concerns about licensing costs and the potential difficulty of the transition. “Enterprise software is evolving quickly, and implementation and licensing are complex,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “In some cases, companies rely on experienced third-party service providers to keep up to date.” The report also explores other trends in the U.S. Salesforce ecosystem, including the ongoing consolidation of service providers and the importance of partnerships between providers and independent software vendors. For more insights into the Salesforce challenges enterprises face, including pressure to adopt vertical solutions and generative AI (GenAI), see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Salesforce Ecosystem Partners report for the U.S. evaluates the capabilities of 48 providers across six quadrants: Multicloud Implementation and Integration Services for Large Enterprises; Implementation Services for Core Clouds — Midmarket; Implementation Services for Marketing Automation; Managed Application Services for Large Enterprises; Managed Application Services for Midmarket, and Implementation Services for Industry Clouds.

ROWE PRICE: 401(K) ACCOUNT BALANCES SOARED IN 2023, ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNGER RETIREMENT SAVERS Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary T. Rowe Price's 2023 report on 401(k) plan design and participant behavior reveals a 14% increase in average account balances to $115,000, with gains in the financial markets. Participation declined from 66% to 63%, but plans with auto-enrollment had higher participation rates. Roth contributions hit 93%, and target date products were popular investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The uptick in average 401(k) account balances by 14% to $115,000, as reported by T. Rowe Price, is a positive indicator of both individual financial health and broader market performance. This increase, particularly among younger participants, suggests that the demographic is becoming more engaged in retirement planning at an earlier stage, which could lead to a more financially secure retirement cohort in the future. The rise in balances may also reflect a recovering economy post-pandemic, with the stock market rebounding from previous lows.The decline in 401(k) plan participation from 66% to 63%, however, raises concerns about the potential long-term effects on retirement savings adequacy. This downward trend could be attributed to economic factors such as job changes, increased cost of living, or a lack of financial literacy. It highlights the need for employers to enhance engagement and education around the benefits of 401(k) participation. The data showing higher participation rates in plans with auto-enrollment points to the effectiveness of this feature in boosting savings rates and may influence plan sponsors to adopt or enhance auto-features in their offerings.Finally, the increase in Roth contributions and the steady employee deferral rate indicate a growing awareness of the tax advantages associated with Roth accounts. This trend could have implications for future tax revenues, as more individuals opt for tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Retirement Plan Advisor The report's findings on the popularity of target date products and their correlation with lower exchange rates among participants is significant. It suggests that target date funds are effectively simplifying investment decisions for plan participants, leading to a 'set it and forget it' mentality that can reduce the likelihood of poorly timed investment decisions. This trend is also indicative of the trust placed in fund managers to navigate market volatility and underscores the importance of quality fund management.The observation that participants aged 72 and older took fewer distributions following the SECURE 2.0 legislation changes reflects the impact of policy on retirement behavior. This may indicate that individuals are willing to delay distributions when incentivized by tax policies, which could have broader implications for retirement planning strategies and the timing of tax revenue generation for the government.The increase in hardship withdrawals, particularly among participants in their 50s, could signal underlying financial stress within this demographic. This trend might be a red flag for policymakers and employers, suggesting a need for enhanced financial support structures or emergency savings solutions to prevent long-term damage to retirement savings. Economist The report's insights into 401(k) trends have macroeconomic implications. The increase in average account balances, while a positive sign, must be contextualized within the overall economic landscape. If the rise is attributed to market performance rather than increased contributions, it may not be a reliable indicator of improved financial well-being. Instead, it could reflect a temporary market condition subject to future corrections.The decrease in participation rates is concerning from an economic standpoint, as it may indicate broader issues such as income inequality or job market instability. Moreover, the trend towards Roth contributions could suggest a shift in how individuals are planning for their financial future, potentially affecting long-term savings patterns and the fiscal balance of tax-deferred retirement accounts.From a policy perspective, the reaction to SECURE 2.0 legislation changes shows the responsiveness of retirement behaviors to legislative adjustments, which policymakers could leverage to encourage better retirement preparedness. However, the rise in hardship withdrawals could be symptomatic of a larger economic distress, potentially undermining the goals of retirement savings programs. 04/08/2024 - 10:30 AM 2023 report features the latest trends in 401(k) plan design and participant behavior BALTIMORE, April 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- T. Rowe Price, a global investment management firm and a leader in retirement, today published its annual benchmarking report on 401(k) plan design and participant behavior, and found average account balances increased by 14% to $115,000, aided by strong performance in the financial markets. This is the second highest average the firm has seen in 10 years, just below the $124,000 high in 2021. Gains were especially strong among participants aged 20-29, who experienced an increase of 27%. Meanwhile, 401(k) plan participation saw a decline from 66% in 2022 to 63% in 2023. Participation remains significantly higher in plans with auto-enrollment compared to plans without it (83% versus 36%, respectively), underscoring the importance of auto-solutions like auto-enrollment and auto-increase. ""We've seen first-hand how simple 401(k) plan features like auto-solutions can significantly drive positive savings behavior,"" said Francisco Negrón, head of Retirement Plan Services at T. Rowe Price. ""T.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 10:15 AM Sustainable innovation with recycled material pays off with younger generationEastmanNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / April 8, 2024 / Stanley Black & Decker is well-known and respected in the tool market, but the 100-year-old BLACK+DECKER brand needed to build awareness with younger, sustainably minded, do-it-yourself consumers.At the same time, the company's chief executive officer was driving every area of the business to improve its sustainability credibility. By chance, a company representative connected with Eastman at a conference and learned about Tritan™ Renew copolyester, a safe, tough, durable material made with 50% certified recycled content.*Dan Fitzgerald, Stanley Black & Decker's senior director of product sustainability, knew the biggest impact on the company's carbon footprint was the materials that go into making finished products.""Historically, recycled content was looked down upon as being lower quality or having inferior performance as well as being inconsistent from lot to lot,"" Fitzgerald said. ""A power tool is a high-performance machine but made to fit into your hand. They are designed to deliver significant output torque in the case of drills and efficient, quality results in the case of a sander. These tools crank out considerable amounts of work and draw enough current to act as an ignition source for fire, which is why the materials need to be flame rated for safe use.""The company needed materials that were going to be durable in a power tool housing but also consistent in quality and color to perfectly match the brand colors.Tritan Renew could meet all those needs along with the specifications of the power tool housing, which led to the idea of a new product line aimed at a younger generation of do-it-yourselfers.That didn't make the decision to move forward easy.Creating a new conversation on sustainability""This project was initially met with some scrutiny,"" said Ed Higgins, the company's product director for power tools. ""Most of our end users are requesting products that are louder, faster, bigger and stronger. A lot of the conversation was about the need to have sustainably minded material that wouldn't compromise durability and strength.""A big help was an Eastman video showing a tumbler made with Tritan holding up after a full-size pickup truck ran over it. Another key factor was the consumer insights provided by the Eastman team to guide BLACK+DECKER's product strategy.Consumers have grown to expect sustainable products in industries like fashion, cosmetics, and food and beverage. And now those expectations have expanded to products like paint, furniture, automotive and power tools.The bottom line?""If you're in a space where there is no sustainability leader, by being first, you take a risk, but there's also a lot of reward,"" said Justin Coates, Eastman's global consumer insights & research team leader. ""You get the first-mover advantage. You position yourself as a sustainability leader and can command price premiums.""Coates also stressed that consumers across markets and regions consider materials to be the No. 1 definition of sustainability, though brands must stress their products won't compromise performance and quality. Brands also need to make waste reduction tangible to consumers. With Tritan Renew, BLACK+DECKER recognized that all these objectives were possible.The decision was made to do something truly revolutionary for the broader company and market.BLACK+DECKER reviva™In 2021, BLACK+DECKER, a Stanley Black & Decker brand, released a completely new power tool line, reviva™, rooted in the concept of designing for circularity and ushering in a new wave of product innovation. Reviva means ""new life"" in Latin. The tools are striking in black and white with green highlights, providing a fresh and vibrant new look and feel to differentiate the brand. Ten reviva products launched globally in 2022, including a 12-volt drill, jigsaw and sander. Additional products will be available in 2024 with the introduction of a reviva stick vacuum and a range of cordless drills.""We're very proud of the story we have to tell,"" Higgins said. ""With Tritan Renew, we're able to make the product sustainability aspect very tangible for consumers. For each cordless drill, we're recycling the equivalent of eight single-use plastic bottles that might otherwise end up in landfills or incinerated. The sander uses the equivalent of 11 bottles, and our jigsaw uses the equivalent of 18 bottles.""**The global pandemic resulted in a digital retailer sell-in launch for the European market in September 2021, and products started hitting store shelves in New Zealand in April 2022. While sales are still building, the buzz was immediate.""The reaction and engagement surrounding reviva was strong on social as well as with retail partners, "" Higgins said. ""Introducing a sustainable product line has been a historic moment for the BLACK+DECKER brand.""*Recycled content is certified using ISCC mass balance allocation. ** Contain an amount of recycled material equivalent to the weight of 8, 11 and 18 0.5-L (10.3-g) single-use plastic bottles, respectively View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Eastman on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: EastmanWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/eastmanEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: EastmanView the original press release on accesswire.com What is the partnership between Eastman and Stanley Black & Decker about?

Zeno, a HER2 × HER3 bispecific antibody, showed significant tumor growth inhibition in multiple tumor types, demonstrating effectiveness in high NRG1 expressing cancer models. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The preclinical data presented by Merus on zenocutuzumab (Zeno) at the AACR Annual Meeting signifies a promising advancement in the field of oncology, specifically in the treatment of tumors with high neuregulin 1 (NRG1) expression. The use of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models across multiple tumor types is a robust method for assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutics. The findings that Zeno induced significant tumor growth inhibition in seven of the 28 PDX models tested highlight the potential for this therapy to address a variety of cancers.Furthermore, the observation that Zeno can potently inhibit proliferation of specific cancer cell lines and block signaling pathways involved in cell growth and survival suggests a mechanism of action that could be leveraged for therapeutic benefit. These results may indicate a broader impact on the oncology market, as successful treatments for high NRG1 expressing tumors are currently limited. The development of multispecific antibodies like Zeno could represent a significant breakthrough, potentially leading to increased interest from investors, partnerships and eventually, if clinical trials are successful, market share growth for Merus. Biotech Market Analyst The announcement from Merus about the preclinical success of zenocutuzumab in high NRG1 expressing cancer models is a positive indicator for the company's pipeline and may influence investor sentiment. The specificity of Zeno as a HER2 × HER3 bispecific antibody targets a niche but critical area of oncology, which could translate into a competitive advantage in the biotech market. The ability to show in vitro and in vivo efficacy suggests that if these results can be replicated in clinical trials, Merus may secure a unique position in the treatment landscape.From a market perspective, these findings could lead to an uptick in Merus's stock as investors often react favorably to positive preclinical results, especially in oncology, a high-interest therapeutic area. However, it is important to note that the transition from preclinical to clinical success is not guaranteed and carries significant risk. Investors should monitor subsequent clinical trial results closely, as these will provide a more concrete basis for evaluating the potential market impact and financial implications for Merus. Pharmaceutical Strategy Consultant The strategic implications of Merus's presentation on zenocutuzumab extend beyond immediate scientific findings. In the pharmaceutical industry, early positive preclinical data can be a catalyst for strategic partnerships, licensing deals, or additional funding opportunities. Companies with promising compounds like Zeno may attract attention from larger pharmaceutical firms seeking to bolster their oncology portfolios. However, it is critical to approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the compound's intellectual property position, the competitive landscape and the regulatory pathway ahead.Merus's strategy to utilize unbiased assays in the development of their Biclonics® platform demonstrates a commitment to data-driven decision-making. This approach could enhance their credibility in the eyes of potential partners and investors. As the company progresses towards clinical trials, maintaining a strong strategic focus will be essential in navigating the complex oncology market and achieving long-term success. 04/08/2024 - 12:00 PM UTRECHT, The Netherlands and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Merus N.V. (Nasdaq: MRUS) (“Merus”, “the Company”, “we”, or “our”), a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative, full-length multispecific antibodies (Biclonics® and Triclonics®), today announced preclinical data on zenocutuzumab (Zeno) in cancer models with high neuregulin 1 (NRG1) expression were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024. “Exemplary of our approach to developing multispecific antibodies, Zeno was selected utilizing unbiased assays to allow biology to teach us which is the best potential Biclonics®. Thereafter, we continue to learn more both preclinically and mechanistically, to identify where the molecule holds potential,” said Cecile Geuijen, Chief Scientific Officer of Merus. “In this study, we examined the efficacy of Zeno in preclinical models expressing high NRG1 levels and found evidence of anti-tumor activity in multiple tumor types.” ​Zenocutuzumab, a HER2 × HER3 bispecific antibody, is effective in cancer models with high NRG1 expression​Observations in the presentation include: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models (28 PDX models total) representing 21 different tumor types were selected based on high NRG1 expression in the respective tumor typesZeno induced significant tumor growth inhibition in seven of the 28 PDX models testedZeno was also observed to: Potently inhibit proliferation of N87 gastric cancer and SKBR-3 breast cancer cell lines at high NRG1 concentrationsInhibit proliferation of HCC95, an NRG1-amplified lung cancer cell line, and block signaling through pathways involved in the regulation of cell growth and survival These data show that Zeno is effective in tumor cell killing in vitro and in vivo in high NRG1 expressing cancer models representing multiple different tumor types The full presentation is available on the Publications page of our website. About Merus N.V.Merus is a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative full-length human bispecific and trispecific antibody therapeutics, referred to as Multiclonics®.

(Nasdaq: MIST) announces new clinical data on etripamil for the conversion of recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). The study showed promising results in self-managing PSVT episodes, with a 60% conversion rate within 30 minutes of drug administration. The data support the potential of etripamil as a rapid and reliable treatment option for PSVT. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent findings from Milestone Pharmaceuticals on etripamil's efficacy for PSVT treatment reveal a potential shift in patient self-management for this cardiac condition. Notably, the drug's capacity to restore sinus rhythm with a median time of 17 minutes is a significant advancement, especially given the non-exclusion of patients with comorbid conditions like AFib. This broad applicability suggests a larger target market for the drug upon approval.Furthermore, the reduced frequency of adverse events over successive episodes indicates an improved safety profile, which is important for patient adherence and long-term treatment success. The ability to self-administer etripamil in an outpatient setting enhances patient autonomy and could reduce healthcare costs associated with hospital visits for PSVT episodes. However, the localized adverse events at the nasal administration site should be monitored for any long-term implications. Healthcare Economist From an economic perspective, the introduction of etripamil as a self-managed therapy could disrupt the current treatment paradigm for PSVT, potentially leading to cost savings for both patients and healthcare systems. The decreased need for emergency medical services and potential reduction in hospital admissions aligns with the broader trend towards outpatient care and telemedicine.The trial's data could influence insurance coverage decisions, with payers interested in cost-effective treatments that maintain or improve health outcomes. However, the pricing strategy for etripamil will be pivotal in determining its market penetration and overall impact on healthcare expenditures. If priced competitively, it may become the standard of care for PSVT management. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the positive trial results position etripamil to capture a significant share of the cardiovascular drug market upon approval. The data suggests a strong value proposition, which is likely to resonate with both clinicians and patients. The branding of CARDAMYST™ as the first rapid, reliable and at-the-ready option for acute PSVT treatment could differentiate it from existing therapies.Investors should monitor the FDA's decision on etripamil, as approval could lead to substantial revenue growth for Milestone Pharmaceuticals. However, market adoption will depend on the drug's integration into clinical guidelines and the company's ability to effectively market the product to healthcare providers. Close attention should be paid to the competitive landscape, as any emerging treatments could impact etripamil's market share. 04/08/2024 - 11:36 AM Data from this large safety-trial also published in The Journal of the American College of CardiologyMONTREAL and CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Milestone® Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative cardiovascular medicines, today announced new clinical data demonstrating real-world application of etripamil, an investigational new drug, for conversion of recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). “The promising results of this real-world design study demonstrated patients’ ability to self-manage multiple episodes of PSVT with etripamil,” said David Bharucha, MD, PhD, FACC, Chief Medical Officer of Milestone Pharmaceuticals. “These data, coupled with our prior published etripamil Phase 3 studies, completes an exceptionally large data package assessing acute treatment of PSVT in the at-home setting.” Conducted in North and South America, this open label, Phase 3 study of etripamil in PSVT today was both presented at The American College of Cardiology Scientific Sessions in Atlanta, GA and published in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. CARDAMYST™, the conditionally approved brand name for etripamil nasal spray, if approved, will be the first rapid, reliable, and at-the-ready option in the acute treatment of PSVT. NODE-303 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04072835) evaluated self-administered etripamil (70 mg, nasal spray) in an outpatient setting for up to multiple episodes of PSVT, without prior test dosing. It did not exclude patients with a history of co-morbid atrial fibrillation (AFib) or atrial flutter. The results demonstrated that symptom-prompted treatment with etripamil was effective at restoring sinus rhythm as compared to placebo with a median time-to-conversion of 17.0 minutes and was generally well tolerated. The conversion of PSVT to sinus rhythm was similar among multiple PSVT episodes and the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events at 24 hours decreased with successive episodes. Adverse events were predominantly localized to the drug’s nasal administration site, consistent with prior trial findings. The protocol was amended during the trial to allow for a repeat dose of drug if symptoms persisted 10 minutes following the first dose. Efficacy of etripamil for PSVT conversion (restoration of sinus rhythm) in NODE-303 was 60% by 30 minutes after drug self-administration, and 69.9% by 60 minutes after drug self-administration; these rates of conversion are similar to those demonstrated in double-blinded and other open-label studies. These data support a potentially significant shift in the management approach for recurrent PSVT. Both the presentation and publication will be available on the Milestone Pharmaceuticals corporate website at the conclusion of the ACC presentation. About Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia An estimated two million people in the United States are currently diagnosed with PSVT which is a type of arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm. PSVT is characterized by episodes of sudden onset rapid heartbeats often exceeding 150 to 200 beats per minute. The heart rate spike is unpredictable and may last several hours. The rapid heart rate often causes disabling severe palpitations, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, dizziness or lightheadedness, and distress, forcing patients to limit their daily activities. The uncertainty of when an episode of PSVT will strike or how long it will persist can provoke anxiety in patients and negatively impact their day-to-day life between episodes. The impact and morbidity from an attack can be especially detrimental in patients with underlying cardiovascular or medical conditions, such as heart failure, obstructive coronary disease, or dehydration. Many health care providers are dissatisfied with the lack of effective treatment options with patients often requiring prolonged, burdensome, and costly trips to the emergency department or even invasive cardiac ablation procedures. About Milestone Pharmaceuticals Milestone Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: MIST) is a biopharmaceutical company developing and commercializing innovative cardiovascular solutions to improve the lives of people living with complex and life-altering heart conditions. The Company’s focus on understanding unmet patient needs and improving the patient experience has led us to develop new treatment approaches that provide patients with an active role in self-managing their care. Milestone's lead investigational product is etripamil, a novel calcium channel blocker nasal spray that is being studied for patients to self-administer without medical supervision to treat symptomatic episodic attacks associated with PSVT and AFib-RVR.

Quadra offers higher-resolution, lifelike images with 50% greater resolution than the previous model. Users can generate up to 96 image variations at a time and easily integrate them into their content creation process. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Quadra by IZEA Worldwide, Inc. represents a significant enhancement in the field of influencer marketing technology. The emphasis on higher resolution and more lifelike images responds to the growing demand for quality in digital content. As visual appeal is paramount in social media marketing, the ability for creators to produce more refined and realistic images could potentially lead to higher user engagement rates. This, in turn, may translate to increased advertising revenues for both influencers and the platform itself.From a competitive standpoint, IZEA's move to offer Quadra for free, with the option for power users to upgrade, is a strategic one. It positions the company as a value-driven service provider in the Creator Economy. By removing generative image volume limitations and integrating with cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive, IZEA is streamlining the content creation process, which could lead to an uptick in user base and retention. However, the long-term financial impact will depend on the monetization of the upgraded services and the company's ability to convert free users into paying customers. Technology Analyst Quadra's use of AI technologies such as Stable Diffusion and OpenAI generative models is indicative of IZEA's commitment to staying at the forefront of AI-driven content creation. The 50% increase in image resolution and the improved representation of human features are technical advancements that address some of the common criticisms faced by generative AI models in the past. These improvements are likely to enhance the perceived value of IZEA's offerings among its users.However, as AI technology rapidly evolves, IZEA will need to continually invest in R&D to maintain its competitive edge. The phasing out of older models like Poseidon and Hypnos is a necessary step to avoid technological obsolescence, but it also requires ongoing adaptation by users. The company's ability to manage this transition effectively and to support users through changes will be important to customer satisfaction and loyalty. Financial Analyst Investors should note that while product launches like Quadra can generate excitement, the actual impact on IZEA's financial performance will depend on several factors. These include the adoption rate of the new model, the conversion rate of free to paid users and the scalability of the technology. Given that the enhanced features are initially offered for free, the revenue implications may not be immediately apparent in the company's financial statements.Furthermore, the technology sector is known for high burn rates, especially in R&D-intensive areas such as AI. Investors should monitor IZEA's expenditure on technology development and marketing to gauge whether the investment in Quadra is likely to provide a reasonable return. Additionally, the company's ability to secure a unique position in the market, amidst competition from other tech giants investing in AI, will be important for sustained growth and profitability. 04/08/2024 - 11:00 AM Users Can Now Generate Higher-Resolution, Lifelike Images in High VolumeORLANDO, Fla., April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IZEA Worldwide, Inc.

Investigators shared preliminary findings of the research during a presentation at the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO) annual meeting in Seattle April 5.""These early findings suggest that children who were randomized to the My Special Aflac Duck arm of the study experienced reductions in procedural and treatment related anxiety, along with overall distress,"" said James Klosky, PhD, ABPP, senior author on the study, Director of Psychology and Neuropsychology at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, and Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine. ""Current results show patients who interacted with My Special Aflac Duck experienced reductions in distress, nausea and pain as well as treatment and procedural anxiety compared to patients who did not.""My Special Aflac Duck is an animatronic, plush duck designed to incorporate elements of medical play, distraction, and social robotics to provide comfort and distraction for children. Previous research has recommended multisensory, developmentally appropriate devices that engage a child's audiovisual, kinesthetic, and tactile senses, and cognitive, motor, and visual skills, as active distraction techniques may result in the reduction of pain and anxiety. These devices are especially relevant to younger children whose ability to cope with difficult situations is limited by their level of cognitive development and varying ability to self-regulate emotions.The longitudinal clinical trial testing the effectiveness of the My Special Aflac Duck took place at eight hospital locations across the nation and included 160 patients between ages three to 10 years who were randomly assigned to receive the My Special Aflac Duck or standard care based on the hospital where they were treated. Parents, child life specialists (pediatric health care professionals who work with children and families in hospitals to help them cope with the challenges of hospitalization, illness, and disability) and older patients completed questionnaires about patient distress, quality of life and adverse events at their first appointment, after one week, one month and three months. The preliminary findings suggest patients who interacted with the My Special Aflac Duck experienced reductions in distress, nausea and pain as well as treatment and procedural anxiety compared to patients who did not. The trial follows a feasibility pilot project also led by Children's and Emory published in Pediatric Blood and Cancer in 2019 showing My Special Aflac Duck helped reduce distress while in the hospital in almost 70% of patients and that more than 90% were satisfied with My Special Aflac Duck overall.""These results suggest that inclusion of the My Special Aflac Duck in a child life specialist's toolbox as an evidence-based intervention can reduce adverse psychological outcomes among young children undergoing cancer therapy,"" said Tamara Miller, MD, first author on the study, Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist at the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine. ""The benefits of the intervention may also extend beyond patients to their families, as parents reported improvements in their own mental health.""Using feedback from pediatric cancer patients, My Special Aflac Duck was developed for young children with cancer ages three to 10 years. Children can trigger lifelike nuzzling movements, fun and playful movements, along with quacks by petting their My Special Aflac Duck. Seven different emoji accessory tokens (angry, calm, happy, sad, scared, sick and silly) allow children to communicate their feelings to caregivers and cause My Special Aflac Duck to act out feelings with different movements, dramatic and fun quacks, and colored light sequences. A port-a-cath attachment can be affixed to facilitate medical play as children pretend to administer medications.Drs. Klosky and Miller also hold positions within Emory University Winship Cancer Institute. Both the randomized clinical trial and previous feasibility study were funded by Aflac, Inc., which also helps fund the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Drs. Miller and Klosky are in the process submitting the results of the clinical trial for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.About Children's Healthcare of AtlantaAs the only freestanding pediatric healthcare system in Georgia, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is the trusted leader in caring for kids.

Negative None. 04/08/2024 - 12:13 PM AMSTERDAM, April 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Irish pub stands tall among cultural icons, revered locally and globally for their unparalleled social atmospheres. Recognised as the beating heart of Ireland's social scene, where stories and conversations resound within their walls. Heineken wants to shine a light on their importance by opening virtual “Pub Museums” across Ireland. This innovative campaign from Heineken® aims to safeguard historical Irish pubs, advocating for their transformation into museums. Heineken® has partnered with three distinguished Irish pubs to pioneer the virtual Pub Museum experience. Patrons can now embark on a digital journey through time, exploring the rich history and stories told within these beloved establishments. By scanning a QR code on historical artefacts within the pubs, visitors can unlock a trove of historical facts and stories. Beginning with Toners Pub in Dublin on 5th April, followed by the oldest pub in the world; Sean’s Bar in Athlone on 11th April and Mother Macs in Limerick on 18th April. Heineken® is exploring how these pubs can apply for official Museum accreditation via The Heritage Council in a bid to have them formally recognised as museums. This would offer more opportunities and resources for Irish pubs. By supporting pubs in a bid to become an official museum, Heineken® aims to preserve pub culture and the future of socialising. The Pub Museum campaign complements the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland bid for UNESCO to formally recognise traditional pubs as key elements of Ireland's intangible cultural heritage, highlighting the pub's role in social interaction, music, storytelling and as custodians of local traditions and history. Rachael Crawley, Heineken Ireland commented: “Pubs in Ireland play a pivotal role in Irish society and culture, and have done for generations. As a partner of pubs across the country, we’ve launched the Pub Museums initiative as a way to highlight the historical importance of Irish pubs, and act as a reminder of the importance of these establishments in the fabric of Irish society.” Speaking about the initiative, Dublin-based Historian Gerry Farrell commented: “Few buildings or businesses maintain the same function over the span of centuries. A visit to a historic public house is a connection back to our own past where generations before, people gathered to talk, drink, eat, sing and play, to flirt and romance, to discuss the great events of the day and set the world to right, to cheer sporting triumph or to drown their sorrows. Irish pubs have been the site for rebellion and betrayal, settings for great literature and places of very real drama. It’s important to protect and preserve our historic pubs so that they can continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.” Gina O’Kelly, Director, Irish Museums Association added: “One of the most interesting aspects of collections is the stories they tell. Objects found within commercial environments, such as our heritage bars and shops, often provide fascinating insights into the daily lives of those from our recent past and their environment: they can reveal information around societal norms, trade activities, the socioeconomic landscape and development of an area, as well as local rituals and cultural practices. Within the Irish Museums Association, we work with many community or volunteer-led organisations that hold collections of this nature and have a deep appreciation of the significance of the objects they hold, particularly within their communities. These serve as tangible reflections of our social history and, through them, we can ground and interconnect our everyday experiences with the layered history of our surroundings, the local communities that inhabit them, and their heritage. Efforts to enhance their preservation, interpretation and display – thereby making them more publicly accessible – acknowledge their importance and are warmly welcomed.” Editorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign images and video hereFor more information, please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.com About HEINEKEN: HEINEKEN is the world's most international brewer.
