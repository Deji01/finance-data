JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. — whose earnings are due later this week — paced declines in banks. Nvidia Corp. sank as Intel Corp. unveiled a new version of its artificial-intelligence chip. Boeing Co. slid on a news report the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating whistleblower claims about safety issues with the 787 Dreamliner.With no relevant economic data on schedule — or Fedspeak — traders positioned for the consumer price index. Markets have been tempering bets on Fed cuts as US economic data remains strong, with officials pushing back against the need for easing.“Investors are increasingly calling a June pivot into question, given the resiliency of the economy,” said Marta Norton at Morningstar Wealth. “A delay is within the range of possible outcomes, particularly if we see March inflation data surprise to the upside.”The S&P 500 hovered near 5,180. US 10-year yields fell six basis points to 4.36%. Oil dropped as traders assessed diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. Gold rose to a fresh record. The loonie underperformed ahead of the Bank of Canada decision on rates amid bets policymakers will turn more dovish.Read: Treasury 3-Year Auction Tails After Rally Into Bidding Deadline“CPI is the critical number this week,” said Andrew Brenner at NatAlliance Securities. “The fear is that CPI has continued to be a thorn in the side of the Fed. But positioning is strongly bearish, and to quote some of the old traders we worked with in the past, ‘whatever hurts the most traders, when they are strongly positioned, is what happens’.”Story continuesThe US inflation prints for March and April will play an outsized role in determining whether the Fed proceeds to cut rates in June, according to Krishna Guha at Evercore.“We think the hurdle is not crazy severe and the odds are the data will come in good enough to go ahead,” Guha noted.A survey conducted by 22V Research shows that 53% of the investors think the reaction to CPI Wednesday will be “risk-on.”“Fifty percent of our survey respondents think inflation is ‘not’ on a Fed-friendly glide path back to target,” said Dennis DeBusschere at 22V. “In February, the majority thought it was. The ‘yeses’ have been diminishing. Investors are not worried about Wednesday, but are concerned longer-term.”To Mohamed El-Erian, the Fed’s longer-run inflation expectations should be revised higher as macro conditions — like supply chains and productivity — evolve.“Inflation will be sticky,” the president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist told Bloomberg Television. “But that shouldn’t stop the Fed, because the 2% inflation target is too tight for a global economy going through a major rewiring.”Former Fed Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg Television he’s expecting three rate cuts this year as inflation moves toward the central bank’s target while the economy remains resilient.“Cut timing hinges on inflation data,” according to Meghan Swiber at Bank of America Corp. “The market will be closely watching core goods and shelter for a read on the forward inflation trajectory.”While bond yields are likely to remain volatile in the near term as markets shift views on the Fed’s path, UBS’s Chief Investment Office continues to see an attractive risk-reward outlook for quality bonds, including government and investment-grade corporate debt.“We continue to favor quality bonds in our global portfolios and recommend investors lock in currently attractive bond yields,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “We prefer those with maturities in the 1–10-year bracket and see value in sustainable bonds.”“Valuations are so stretched right now that anything less than perfection from economic data or any geopolitical noise can create substantial and quick selloffs,” said David Bahnsen at the Bahnsen Group.Following the recent reset in rate-cut expectations, the setback in stock markets should prove temporary and is a buying opportunity, according to HSBC strategists led by Max Kettner.“Risk assets certainly got a scare last week,” they wrote. “We don’t think this will last, though.”BofA clients were net sellers of US equities last week, with health-care shares logging their biggest outflow in the firm’s data going back to 2008 during the period.Clients pulled $3.4 billion from US stocks in the week ended April 5, with single stocks seeing their largest exit since July, quantitative strategists led by Jill Carey Hall wrote in a note to clients.To Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler, a more tactical approach toward equities is prudent as we move into the second quarter.“Although the market has shown some signs of broadening recently, we don’t have enough technical evidence to be convinced that a new leg higher can be sustained,” he noted. “The combination of high interest rates, sticky inflation, a short-term extended equity market, and mediocre breadth makes the S&P 500 vulnerable to a 5%-10% pullback/correction in upcoming weeks/months.”Corporate Highlights:Boeing Co. deliveries in the first quarter were the lowest since mid-2021, highlighting how far the planemaker has to go on its road to recovery from a near-catastrophic accident early in January.Pfizer Inc.’s RSV shot produced immune reactions in young adults at higher risk of severe illness just as well as in older people, spurring the company’s plans to apply for wider US approval.Cisco Systems Inc. was resumed at overweight by Morgan Stanley, which said the maker of computer networking equipment’s valuation discount is “too harsh.”Google unveiled a host of updates to its artificial intelligence offerings for cloud computing customers, emphasizing that the technology is safe and ready for use in the corporate realm, despite recent stumbles in consumer-facing tools.Best Buy Co. is tapping artificial intelligence to speed up and reduce the number of in-home visits, part of the company’s efforts to use the technology to streamline

This is a blow to buyers whose purchasing power is already severely diminished by a lack of inventory, surging prices and high interest rates.The Redfin report paints the crisis facing many of America's prospective homebuyers in sharp relief and illustrates the problem is getting worse. The 26.1% share of America's affordable housing stock that investors gobbled up is not only a record, but it also represents a 24% increase in investor's purchasing activity over the previous year. Comparing those numbers to investor's purchasing activity in other housing sectors reveals an even greater disparity.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin. Here’s How To Invest In The City’s Growth Before He Floods It With New Tech Workers.Redfin groups homes into three price categories: low-priced, mid-priced and high-priced. During the same period in 2023, investors purchased 13.1% of the mid-priced home inventory and just under 16% of the high-priced inventory. That means they are specifically targeting the homes that everyday Americans are looking for. The difference is that while John Q. Citizen is writing offers contingent on financing, big investors are making cash offers.Prospective Buyers Find Themselves OutgunnedIf you happen to be one of the millions of Americans on the wrong side of this equation, you know it's not a fair fight by any measure, and worse, there doesn't appear to be anything anyone can do to reverse the trend. For their part, sellers are doing what they've always done, which is to accept the best offer and move on to bigger and better things.Story continuesThe long-term trend points to a permanent presence of investors in the housing market. Redfin's study showed that investors purchased 20% of the homes sold in the fourth quarter, with 68% of those purchases being single-family homes. The investors are focused on the lower-priced properties for their upside potential. The point of real estate investing is to buy low and sell high.""I get tons of emails every day from investors looking for properties, but of course, they only want homes that are under market value, which are hard to come by,"" Redfin Premier Agent Carrie Carruthers of Riverside said. ""When they find those properties, they pile in.""TrendingWant To Grow Your Wealth Passively? These High-Yield Real Estate Notes Might Be Your Holy GrailAnother thing to consider is that it's not necessarily real estate investment trusts (REITs) and big Wall Street investors doing all the buying.Investors Have Always Been In The Housing Market, But This Is DifferentHome remodeling and flipping have become popular themes for dozens of popular real estate television shows, and everyday investors were making money by flipping houses decades before HGTV was even a thing. So, if the home flippers and small to medium-sized home flipping operations have always been here, what's the difference between the last 20 years and the last quarter of 2023?It's Not Just Access To Money But Big Data And Analytics That Are Changing The GameThat question has several answers. The sheer volume at which REITs and other investment entities can gobble up housing inventory is a major factor. However, it's their access to data and analytics on home sales and buying trends that may be changing the game. REITs and other investment funds can employ analytics to interpret predictive data in a way that they never could before.It allows them to spot hot markets before they get hot and make aggressive moves into those markets and buy large tranches of inventory. Their access to capital and banking connections also puts REITs in close contact with real estate developers. Now a fund can buy some, or all, the homes a developer is building before construction is done. They can buy and hold turn-key inventory until markets take an upswing.By contrast, the traditional home flipper was a wily operator, who scoured foreclosure lists or county tax auctions and did stealthy drive-by scouting on potential acquisitions. At the most, they could only purchase a few homes at a time, and they needed to turn them over relatively quickly to make a profit. Today's landscape is different, and politicians on both sides of the aisle are taking notice.Even Conservatives Are Pushing BackThe legislative pushback against REITs and investment funds making large home acquisitions is underway, and one push is raising eyebrows because it's coming from one of America's most reliably conservative states: Texas. Gov. Greg Abbott has openly called for legislative action against Wall Street's presence in the home market. It's no secret that letting the market be free and unregulated is one of the most sacrosanct principles of conservatism.Eyebrows were raised when Abbott recently posted this on X, ""I strongly support free markets. But this corporate large-scale buying of residential homes seems to be distorting the market and making it harder for the average Texan to purchase a home. This must be added to the legislative agenda to protect Texas families.""Abbott is an arch-conservative, and Texas has one of the nation's hottest housing markets, largely because of the affordability of homes in the Lone Star State. When a call for legislative action, however vague, comes from a conservative of his stature, it becomes a lot more likely that significant action will be taken. If you're on the buyers' side of this issue, now would be an opportune moment to remember that ""the squeaky wheel gets the grease"" and make your voice heard.Read Next:Miami Is Expected To Take New York's Place As The US Financial Capital.

Motley Fool,"Marvell Technology Stock Has 24% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marvell-technology-stock-24-upside-182318592.html,Investors have high expectations for this leading data center supplier.,"Share prices of Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) surged to new highs this year, as investors anticipate strong artificial intelligence (AI) demand boosting the company's data center solutions business.Earlier this week, KeyBanc analysts maintained their overweight (buy) rating on the shares but reduced their price target from $95 to $90 after noting the potential for product delays to negatively impact the company's growth this year. The new price target for the next 12 months or so still represents a nearly 24% upside over the current share price.Is Marvell stock a buy?Marvell reported improving growth last quarter, driven by strong demand for AI in the data center. Total revenue only grew 1% year over year but revenue from the data center business increased by an impressive 54% over the year-ago quarter.However, KeyBanc noted that Marvell may experience some delays in ramping up products for Amazon Web Services (AWS), where Marvell is a key supplier. Marvell is also a supplier for AI chip leader Nvidia, which is releasing a new server rack system, but the downside for Marvell is that Nvidia's GB200 rack doesn't require optical connectors.Still, Marvell sees the adoption of AI as a key growth driver in the near term. The company made investments over the last several years to prepare for the AI wave. Management's guidance calls for data center revenue to increase in the low-single-digit range in fiscal Q1 over the previous quarter, but it may need to outperform that estimate to satisfy investor's high expectations.The stock trades at an expensive forward price-to-earnings ratio of 50, which is why the analyst is dialing back its price target in light of the potential product delays. The Wall Street consensus estimate has the company's earnings per share reaching $3.33 in the next two years.Given the stock's expensive price tag, Marvell will need to beat Wall Street's expectations to deliver big returns from here.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Marvell Technology wasn’t one of them.

As part of the arrangement, the school agreed to accept $10 million in Under Armour stock, paid out over the life of the contract—a bet that the apparel company would continue its rapid growth, therefore increasing the school’s compensation.More from Sportico.comSEC, Big Ten to Cash In on New College Football Playoff PayoutsCurry Brand Inks NIL Deal With South Carolina's MiLaysia FulwileyNWSL, Amazon Expand Business Partnership With Retail DealIt hasn’t worked out. The contract was signed in Sept. 2015, less than a week after Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) hit an all-time high of $54.70. The company has struggled since, including a multiyear restructuring and a handful of leadership changes. With the stock currently trading around $6.80, that stock grant is now worth about $1.4 million, according to Sportico’s calculations.Under Armour’s stock, of course, could rebound, and Auburn won’t recognize the losses until it sells. An Auburn representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but the school hadn’t sold any of its accrued equity as of July 2020.In its Under Armour deal, Auburn agreed to accept $10 million worth of stock as of the price on Oct. 1, 2015, a number that came out to 206,016 shares after adjusting for a 2016 stock split, according to Sportico’s calculations. That stock is awarded in even increments over the course of the deal, with nine installments of 22,891 shares every July 1 from 2017 through 2025.As Under Armour stock price has fallen, so too has the value of those installments. The shares that the school has already received are now worth $1.09 million, and the outstanding shares are currently worth about $311,317. That’s a total current value of about $1.4 million.Story continuesIt's an unfortunate financial result for the SEC school. At the time, Under Armour stock had risen nearly 800% over the previous five years, and the company was receiving praise for challenging incumbents Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Adidas. If you look at the company’s stock price over the past decade, the deal was signed at the apex of a rapid rise, just before a rapid fall. (For Under Armour, the deal also likely looked enticing, because if shares went up in value, the company would probably get a larger tax deduction when they delivered the shares to Auburn each year.)It’s rare for equity to be used as compensation in athletic contracts, primarily because public, nonprofit institutions often avoid such deals. Under Armour discussed stock options with a number of different schools, Sportico previously reported, but Notre Dame was the only other university to take stock, part of the school’s 10-year deal with Under Armour back in 2014. That contract isn’t public, and the school previously declined to comment on the details. Notre Dame in 2023 extended that agreement for another 10 years.The school’s Nike deal will begin in July 2025. Auburn athletics representatives didn’t immediately respond to questions about the financial specifics of the Nike contract. Auburn spent $192 million on athletics in 2022-23, according to Sportico's college finance database. That's the 10th highest budget among public FBS schools, and fourth highest in the SEC.Best of Sportico.comA Patron's Guide to The Masters, a Tradition Unlike Any OtherHow Sports Teams, Leagues and Owners Make MoneyWhat You Need to Know About U.S. Sports TV Contracts"
