Motley Fool,1 Fintech Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-fintech-stock-buy-hand-180000433.html,"PayPal stock is a reasonable fit for growth investors, but there's another stock that should top your buy list.","PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Block (NYSE: SQ) are two of the most popular fintech stocks today. Both have market caps of about $50 billion to $60 billion. Both have strong histories of growth. And both have plenty of growth potential.One stock, however, is a much better buy today.PayPal bets $5 billion on itselfPayPal the company does not need much introduction. Spun off from parent company eBay in 2015, the company has amassed more than 400 million global users. From e-commerce transactions to paying back friends, almost everyone has either used PayPal personally or knows someone who has.PayPal the stock has a more volatile history.After its split from eBay, PayPal stock zoomed in value, from $40 per share to $300 per share in just three years. Since those all-time highs, however, the share price has cratered. PayPal shares now trade at 2017 prices.PYPL ChartPayPal stock now trades at just 2.2 times sales -- a popular valuation metric for growth stocks. That's the cheapest shares have ever been.Management has noticed the decline in valuation, opting to invest $5 billion in share repurchases. By buying back its own stock at discounted prices, the company hopes to double down on a turnaround.There's only one problem: PayPal has been here before. The company has already spent $15 billion in share repurchases since going public in 2015. These buybacks were executed at prices much higher than today, meaning they destroyed shareholder value.PayPal isn't going anywhere as a company, but don't be fooled into thinking the cheap valuation multiple is a clear buy signal. The reason the shares are cheap is that the company's best days of growth probably are behind it. In fact, its user base has been shrinking the past two years.The shares might be a worthwhile value at today's depressed prices, but there's a better choice for growth investors -- a stock with a turnaround story already in action.This is the fintech stock worth betting onBlock has faced its own struggles. The company -- traditionally a payment processor, but more recently an investor in other areas like the peer-to-peer payment service Cash App, music platform Tidal, and a host of blockchain-related ventures -- has similarly seen its stock price crater after a slowdown in growth and a drop in profitability.Story continuesOn a price-to-sales basis, Block stock is actually cheaper than PayPal, trading at 2.1 times sales. But as we'll see, the underlying business is much stronger.SQ ChartThe first advantage that Block has over PayPal is higher growth rates.Whereas PayPal's business is shrinking according to some metrics, most of Block's segments are experiencing strong growth. Block, for example, has 56 million monthly users on its Cash App. While growth has slowed significantly in recent quarters, the company continues to increase this user base.Continued user growth has allowed Block to maintain revenue gains that are much bigger than what PayPal has achieved, even during its days as a hot stock after becoming an independent company.SQ Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) ChartBlock is also better positioned for future growth.As the company's name suggests, Block has made big bets on emerging blockchain technologies like Bitcoin. Users of its Cash App can already buy, sell, and transact in Bitcoin. Its Square payment processing platform, meanwhile, is poised to bring cryptocurrency transactions to the masses. Whereas PayPal is defending a plateauing business model, Block is positioned to capitalize on growth trends like the adoption of cryptocurrencies.Why then is Block stock cheaper than PayPal?For most of PayPal's public history, the company has been profitable, racking up billions in free cash flow -- the reason it has been able to fund its historical share buyback programs.Block, meanwhile, has been unprofitable in recent years. When the shares spiked in 2020, however, the company had posted several quarters of profitability. This is what the market came to expect, until a string of quarterly losses sent the stock price tumbling.SQ EPS Diluted (Quarterly) ChartAs a whole, Block is less profitable than PayPal, but that's palatable as long as growth rates remain high. The market, after all, is willing to fund a rapidly growing company. When growth rates slow, however, the market suddenly becomes less willing to cover losses.Last September, Block co-founder Jack Dorsey rejoined Block as the chief executive officer with one mission: return the company to profitability. It didn't take long for this vision to be realized. In February, the company posted its first net profit in two years, albeit a small one.With a return to profitability, expect Block's valuation multiples to pick up, especially if this feat is repeated in subsequent quarters. A high-growth stock that's profitable, no matter how small, deserves a higher multiple than 2.1 times sales in this market.Between PayPal and Block, Block stock is the clear winner for investors right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Block right now?Before you buy stock in Block, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Block wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Walmart Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-stock-buy-sell-hold-164200464.html,Is it to late to invest in the 800-pound gorilla of the retail sector?,"Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is one of the bellwethers of the global retail sector. It operates over 10,500 stores and numerous e-commerce sites across 19 countries, and that scale helped it survive the retail apocalypse that wiped out many other big-box retailers.From its fiscal 2019 to its fiscal 2024 (which ended in January), Walmart's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 21%. It achieved that steady growth even as the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary headwinds rattled the broader retail sector.Image source: Walmart.Walmart's stock rallied by 85% over the past five years and delivered a total return of 101% after including reinvested dividends -- but does it still have room to run? Let's review the top arguments for buying, selling, or holding its stock.The reasons to buy or hold WalmartThe bulls still love Walmart because it's one of the few brick-and-mortar retailers that kept pace with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and other e-commerce leaders. It achieved that by upgrading its e-commerce and delivery capabilities, using its brick-and-mortar stores to fulfill online orders, and closely matching Amazon's prices.In its efforts to loosen Amazon Prime's grip on customers, Walmart also expanded its own Walmart+ subscription plan, which offers free deliveries, discounts, and a subscription to streaming service Paramount+. Its planned acquisition of the smart TV maker Vizio could complement that expansion and help it mount an offensive against Amazon's Fire TV set-top boxes and smart TVs.Furthermore, Walmart kept up with Costco in the warehouse club market with its Sam's Club stores, and it beefed up its overseas e-commerce presence by acquiring India's Flipkart and a stake in China's JD.com. Those bold moves set it apart from its rival Target (NYSE: TGT), which only operates in the U.S. and doesn't own a warehouse club chain.The bulls expect Walmart to continue growing. In fiscal 2024, its revenue rose 6%, driven by its 5.6% comparable-store sales growth (excluding fuel) in the U.S. and a 13.5% jump in its international sales. By comparison, Target's comps fell 3.7% in its fiscal 2023 (which ended in February), marking its first annual decline in seven years as it grappled with sluggish discretionary spending, theft and safety issues, and a boycott related to some of its Pride Month products.Story continuesFrom fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect Walmart's revenue to rise at a CAGR of 4% as its EPS grows at a CAGR of 35%. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 26 times forward earnings, its dividend offers a decent forward yield of 1.4%, and management has raised the payout annually for 51 consecutive years. It has also bought back nearly 40% of its shares over the past two decades.The reasons to sell WalmartThe bears believe Walmart's stock is historically expensive now -- it traded at less than 20 times earnings throughout most of the 2010s, and it's pricier than most of its industry peers. Target, for example, trades at just 18 times forward earnings.The bears will also point out that Walmart's insiders actually sold 86 times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months. They also sold 64 times as many shares as they bought over the past three months. That chilly insider sentiment strongly suggests its valuations are getting ahead of its growth rates.Another issue is Walmart's dependence on China. It operates nearly 400 brick-and-mortar stores and multiple e-commerce platforms in China, and its stores in the U.S. and other markets rely heavily on Chinese suppliers for cheap products. Therefore, new trade restrictions and tariffs against China could disrupt its overseas business and squeeze its gross margins.Lastly, Walmart's expansion of its e-commerce, delivery, and digital media ecosystems to counter Amazon could further squeeze its operating margins. Amazon can rely on its high-margin cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, to subsidize its low-margin retail and digital media businesses. Walmart doesn't have a comparable profit engine.Its strengths still outweigh its weaknessesWalmart might face some unpredictable challenges over the next few years, but its scale, diversification, and forward-thinking strategies should help it weather the macro and competitive headwinds. Those strengths -- along with its reputation as a safe-haven investment -- make it a great stock for long-term investors to buy, hold, and forget.Should you invest $1,000 in Walmart right now?Before you buy stock in Walmart, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walmart wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Consumer Sales in China Are Still a Trouble Spot for This Dividend King. Here's What to Watch Out for Before You Buy the Stock,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-sales-china-still-trouble-161300737.html,"Hormel's business turned for the better in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, but China is still not performing as well as hoped.","Shares of Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) rose dramatically after it reported fiscal first-quarter 2024 earnings. There were very good reasons for this, but investors still need to dig into the details before they get too upbeat about the future of this iconic food maker. China is an important and lingering trouble spot.Hormel had a strong quarterWhen Hormel reported fiscal Q1 earnings, management proudly highlighted that volume grew 4% year over year. Since volume fell 4.2% in 2023, the Q1 results suggest that the food maker is at an important inflection point. Notably, volume rose in all three of the company's divisions, which include retail, food service, and international.Image source: Getty Images.The weakest performance was in the company's retail business, basically all of its U.S. business that isn't food service. Volume in this segment rose 2%. Foodservice, which has been performing relatively well, continued its strong performance, with volume up 8%. Outdistancing even that showing was Hormel's foreign business, with volume rising 11%.This is where things start to get a bit more interesting. Per the earnings release, foreign ""Segment profit increased due to the inclusion of our investment in Indonesia and significantly higher results from our partnership in the Philippines."" So, in some ways, that 11% improvement in volume wasn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison.And more to the point here: ""...in China, foodservice results improved as we lapped COVID-related disruption last year. This benefit was more than offset by continued weakness in the retail channel."" This consumer staples maker's best-performing business on the volume front may not be quite as big a positive as it seems.Reading between the linesIf you had to summarize the foreign business' results, it would probably go something like this: Volumes grew thanks to the addition of a new business, but China is only just beginning to show signs of recovery. That's not terrible, but it certainly isn't good, either.Story continuesChina is a large and important global market, and Hormel has been investing heavily in the country. To put some numbers on that, it is the single-largest foreign market for Hormel, with 842 production facilities, 33 warehouses, and 26 corporate offices.While Hormel doesn't actually break out China as a percentage of its overall business, its presence in the country accounts for roughly two-thirds of its foreign properties. It is reasonable to assume that China is very important to Hormel's future. If you own Hormel, you need to keep an eye on the still-struggling China operations.The good news is that the Chinese market has reopened after a long closure related to the coronavirus pandemic. That's clearly resulted in a material improvement in the country's foodservice segment now that people are able to go out and about again. But they still aren't buying Hormel's products for their homes like they used to. Two things should be monitored here.First, investors need to remember that foodservice demand in China is likely coming off a very low base. So, the improvement is nice to see as an early sign of a turnaround, but the real questions are what happens through the rest of the year and what happens when these results are eventually lapped. Listen carefully to ensure China's food service business continues to grow.Second, and probably more important, Hormel needs to get people in China to buy its products again. That hasn't happened yet, and it is a worrying sign. It seems highly likely that Hormel will eventually figure out how to get this business back on track, but the longer it takes to do that, the worse it is for the company and investors. Watch what management says about Chinese customers over the next few quarters, too.Not huge, but important to the futureForeign sales make up only around 6% of Hormel's top line. China is a big part of that. While 6% isn't a massive figure, foreign expansion is expected to be an important long-term growth driver for the food maker. As such, long-term investors will want to closely monitor China's still-weak performance. If the company can't get back on track in China, it will be much harder to grow the business.Should you invest $1,000 in Hormel Foods right now?Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,2 Telehealth Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-telehealth-stocks-buy-hand-153000015.html,"At combined market caps of less than $6 billion, these are a couple of dirt-cheap stocks to buy right now.",
Motley Fool,Better EV Stock: Rivian Automotive vs. Lucid Group,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-ev-stock-rivian-automotive-153000763.html,Which of these burned-out EV stocks has a brighter future?,"Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) were two of the hottest EV stocks of 2021. Rivian, a maker of electric pickups, SUVs, and vans, went public at $78 in November of 2021, and its stock more than doubled to an all-time high of $172.01 a week after that. Lucid, a maker of luxury sedans, went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in July 2021; its stock opened at $25.24 and also more than doubled to its record high of $55.52 in November.But today, Rivian's stock trades at about $11 and Lucid is only worth $3 a share. The bulls retreated as both companies failed to meet their lofty production targets. Rising interest rates also compressed their valuations and cast a harsh light on their ugly balance sheets. So should investors buy either of these burned-out EV stocks as a turnaround play?Image source: Rivian.Rivian expects its production to flatten out this yearRivian produces three types of vehicles: the R1T pickup, the R1S full-size SUV, and a custom electric delivery van (EDV) for its leading investor, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Its next vehicle, the R2 midsize SUV, should hit the market in 2026.When Rivian went public, it claimed it could produce 50,000 vehicles in 2022. But it manufactured only 24,337 vehicles that year as it dealt with supply chain constraints, and it pushed back its target of 50,000 vehicles annually to 2023.It easily surpassed that goal by producing 57,232 vehicles -- but it expects to produce only 57,000 vehicles in 2024.Rivian predicts its production will remain stagnant this year as it deals with higher interest rates, a slower EV market, and the planned shutdown of its main plant in Normal, Illinois, for ""several weeks"" in the second quarter.The shutdown is to allow an upgrade its production rates by 30%, roll out new in-vehicle technologies for its R1 platform, and reduce its raw material costs. Analysts expect its revenue to only rise 10% to $4.9 billion in 2024 as it implements those changes.Story continuesAs sales growth slows down, it plans to boost its margins by building more vehicles with its in-house Enduro drive unit and laying off 10% of its workforce. But it only slightly narrowed its operating loss from $6.9 billion in 2022 to $5.7 billion in 2023, and analysts anticipate an operating loss of $4.8 billion in 2024.Rivian ended 2023 with $10.5 billion in liquidity, but it could quickly burn through that cash if it doesn't ramp up its production again over the next few years. On the bright side, the stock looks cheap at two times this year's sales -- and Amazon still hasn't sold its sinking shares of the EV maker.Lucid is struggling to scale up its businessLucid currently sells several versions of its Air luxury sedan, and it plans to launch its second vehicle, the Gravity SUV, in late 2024. During its pre-SPAC presentation, it claimed it could produce 20,000 vehicles in 2022 and 49,000 vehicles in 2023.In reality, it produced only 7,180 vehicles in 2022 and 8,428 in 2023. Like Rivian, Lucid struggled with supply chain constraints, high interest rates, and a weak EV market. The EV pricing war forced Lucid to slash its prices. It expects to produce only 9,000 vehicles in 2024.Yet Lucid continues to make bold claims regarding its future. In May 2022, CEO Peter Rawlinson set a goal of producing over 500,000 vehicles annually by 2025. He believes it can achieve that goal with the support of the Saudi Arabian government, which owns more than 60% of its shares through its Public Investment Fund (PIF).Unfortunately, the math doesn't add up. The planned expansion of its Arizona plant will only boost its annual production capacity to 90,000 vehicles by 2024, while its new Saudi Arabian plant -- which can only produce 5,000 vehicles this year -- might reach an annual capacity of 155,000 by the ""middle of the decade,"" management says. So even if everything goes right, the company would produce a maximum of only 245,000 vehicles annually by 2025.That fuzzy math is worrisome for a company that generated only $595 million in revenue with an operating loss of $3.1 billion in 2023. For 2024, analysts expect its revenue to rise 33% to $794 million as it slightly narrows its operating loss to $2.6 billion.That's not a bright outlook for a company with $4.6 billion in total liquidity, and its stock still doesn't seem like a screaming bargain at five times this year's sales.The better buy: RivianRivian and Lucid will probably remain out of favor this year as they both struggle to ramp up their production in a challenging market. But over the long term, Rivian still looks like a better investment than Lucid.It's producing more vehicles and losing less money on each vehicle. It isn't setting up its investors for disappointment with overly ambitious growth targets or depending heavily on overseas investors. And Rivian's stock looks a lot cheaper relative to its growth.Should you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?Before you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"A Bull Market Is Here: 3 Stocks to Buy With $1,000",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-market-3-stocks-buy-151700725.html,"From e-commerce to travel, these leading brands will prosper in a growing economy.","It's safe to say a new bull market is underway. The S&P 500 index is up 25% over the last 12 months and hit new highs to start the year. Because bull markets usually last a lot longer than bear markets, investing in the right growth stocks could pay off over the next five years.The most important thing is to invest in solid companies that are almost certain to keep growing for many years due to a competitive advantage or industry tailwind.If you have $1,000 sitting around and don't need it for more important things like paying off high-interest debt, here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU), and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE: H) are great stocks to buy.1. AmazonAmazon's business is gaining momentum. Revenue growth from its online stores improved in each quarter last year. Since bottoming out, the stock has rallied 84% over the past year, but there is much more upside in store for shareholders as management focuses on reducing costs and boosting the company's profits.Amazon spent tens of billions of dollars over the last 20 years building a massive footprint of fulfillment infrastructure for its online retail business. Management says it built a transportation network the size of UPS in just 18 months to handle the surge of orders during the pandemic. While this cost a lot of money and sent the company's profits down, it is now starting to reap the benefits of that investment.As the old saying goes, stocks follow earnings over the long term. Amazon's operating income (earnings before interest and taxes) skyrocketed 383% year over year in the fourth quarter to more than $13 billion. Head count reductions and slow hiring over the last 12 months have contributed to increased profitability, but management seems eager to trim costs in even more ways.On the latest earnings call this month, CEO Andy Jassy said executives see ""meaningful upside"" to lowering the costs to serve customers. This involves getting more efficient in how it locates inventory to speed up delivery, in addition to seeing some of the inflationary costs that hurt many companies in 2022 start to come down.Story continuesStreet consensus estimates show Amazon growing earnings per share at an annualized rate of 24%. This means if the stock is still trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41 by 2030, investors could see their investment triple in value. Even if the stock's valuation comes down closer to the market average of around 25, that would still leave enough upside to potentially double the value of the shares.2. Lululemon AthleticaLululemon's growth over the last decade has been stellar, primarily reflecting the resilience of the athletic apparel market.The company's annual revenue has more than doubled from pre-pandemic levels, and it continues to grow in line with that trend. Revenue jumped 19% year over year in the quarter ending in October. Increasing demand for athletic wear, which has been on an upward trajectory for decades, and international expansion are the biggest tailwinds supporting Lululemon's rising stock price.The athletic wear industry is valued at over $200 billion, according to Statista, and it continues to expand. Lululemon is benefiting from its premium brand positioning and sophisticated online shopping experience.Lululemon is constantly refreshing its assortment to keep demand up, but it also continues to benefit from core styles that have become perennial best-sellers, such as the men's ABC pant and the women's Align. The brand is still in the early innings of growth, as international revenue soared an impressive 49% year over year last quarter.Analysts project long-term earnings growth of 16% on an annualized basis. Assuming the company meets those expectations, which are consistent with management's goals, and the stock continues to trade at a forward P/E of 31 -- within its past trading range -- investors can expect to double their money by 2030.3. Hyatt HotelsHyatt is the leading brand in the luxury resort market that could deliver excellent returns for shareholders as travel demand continues to increase. In fact, the travel industry is expected to grow to over $1 trillion by 2027, according to Statista.The key to appreciating Hyatt as a wonderful investment lies in how it generates revenue. While the hotel-chain gets some sales from owned hotels and room rentals, it primarily makes money from fee-based revenue, licensing, and other services. Hyatt sells third-party owners and franchisees the right to use Hyatt's intellectual property. This strategy lends itself to a profitable business that, when combined with a growing industry tailwind, drives shareholder returns.Hyatt's free cash flow has more than doubled since 2017, and management continues to redirect those resources into expanding the number of rooms available in order to increase revenue. It has led the industry in net room growth over the last six years, and management sees more opportunities to enter new markets to expand further.One opportunity is the Asia-Pacific region. Revenue-generating fees in this region soared 51% year over year in the fourth quarter. Hyatt also announced an agreement with the Hangzhou Trade and Tourism Group to develop over 60 hotels in China.Analysts expect Hyatt to increase earnings by 10% on an annualized basis. Management is making moves to boost the percentage of profits coming from high-margin fees, including selling owned hotels to reinvest in more profitable areas of the company. These decisions should continue to drive attractive returns for investors.Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Will Apple Be a $3 Trillion Stock by 2025?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-3-trillion-stock-2025-151500285.html,The world's second-most valuable company faces some daunting challenges.,"Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) became the world's first $3 trillion company last June. By Dec. 14, 2023, its stock had hit its record high of $197.86, lifting its market cap to $3.08 trillion and seemingly securing its spot as the world's most valuable company.But today Apple's stock trades at about $170 per share with a market cap of $2.63 trillion. Microsoft, which surpassed that market cap this January, is now worth $2.99 trillion. Let's see why Apple lost its luster over the past three months, if it can regain its footing this year, and if it can become a $3 trillion stock again by 2025.Image source: Apple.Why did Apple lose its luster?The bulls abandoned Apple this year for four simple reasons. First, its sales of iPhones -- which accounted for 58% of its top line in its latest quarter -- are slowing down. Its iPhone sales dipped 2% in fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) and only grew 6% year over year in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as the 5G upgrade cycle ended.Competitive and macro headwinds in China exacerbated that slowdown. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple's iPhone sales in China plunged 24% year over year in the first six weeks of 2024 amid stiff competition from Huawei.Second, Apple couldn't offset that slowdown by selling its other products. Its Mac sales fell 27% in fiscal 2023 amid the broader PC market's slowdown, then rose less than 1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Its sales of iPads slumped during both periods, its Apple Watch sales were temporarily halted last December amid a patent dispute, and the Vision Pro remains a pricey niche gadget for tech enthusiasts. It also recently abandoned its decade-long plans to build an electric car. As a result, analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to only rise 1% and 7%, respectively, this year.Third, Apple's valuations were inflated by a flight toward safe-haven stocks as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds rattled the market. Even after its year-to-date decline, Apple's stock still doesn't look like a bargain at 26 times forward earnings -- and its paltry forward dividend yield of 0.6% probably won't limit its downside potential.Story continuesLastly, the European Commission recently hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.95 billion) fine for banning streaming music rivals like Spotify Technology from informing its users of cheaper payment options outside of its App Store. Apple can easily pay that fine, but it could pave the way toward a broader crackdown on its entire services segment -- which serves more than 1 billion paid subscribers and is often cited as a catalyst for its long-term growth.Will Apple lose its premium valuation?Apple's near-term future is murky. During its shareholder meeting in late February, CEO Tim Cook claimed Apple would ""break new ground"" in generative artificial intelligence (AI) this year -- but that statement sounded like an eleventh-hour attempt to hop aboard the AI bandwagon that had previously driven Microsoft's stock to its record highs. Apple reportedly plans to add new generative AI features to Spotlight, its integrated search tool for Siri and iOS, but it's unclear if those upgrades will meaningfully widen its moat against Microsoft's Copilot and Alphabet's Google Assistant.If Apple's AI plans fail to meaningfully boost its sales over the next few quarters, its stock could lose its premium valuation and be revalued relative to its near-term growth potential. From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, analysts expect its revenue to only grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% as its earnings per share (EPS) increases at a CAGR of 8%.For reference, IBM -- which is growing again as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses -- is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at CAGRs of 4% and 6%, respectively, from 2023 to 2026. Based on those expectations, IBM trades at just 22 times this year's earnings. It also pays a much higher forward yield of 3.4%.If Apple is also revalued at 22 times forward earnings, its stock would drop another 15% to the mid-$140s, reducing its market cap to $2.2 trillion. So unless Apple can pull a few rabbits out of its hat, it probably won't impress the bulls and regain its $3 trillion valuation by the beginning of 2025. But over the long term Apple could still get its act together as it rolls out new products and services -- so it's still too early to write it off as a mature tech giant that has run out of room to grow.Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Where Will Chewy Stock Be in 5 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-chewy-stock-5-years-151200230.html,The pet supply specialist has been shedding customers lately.,"It has been a volatile period for Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) stock, but most of the past five years have been negative for its shareholders. The pet supply giant was briefly a Wall Street favorite when the use of e-commerce soared during the early phases of the pandemic. Shares quickly reversed course once the growth hangover struck, though.Chewy stock is now down by more than 80% over the past five years after having jumped by 70% through early 2021.Yet, investing is all about the future, and the future seems brighter for this e-commerce specialist. Chewy has a good chance of boosting its sales footprint even as it makes its business more efficient.Mixed resultsThere's no doubt that Chewy's business is experiencing challenges right now. Sales growth has slowed to a relative crawl, with revenue rising just 8% in the most recent quarter. It wasn't long ago that it was expanding at an over 20% rate. Chewy's active user pool shrank over the past year, too, and it's hard to see it as a growth business while that key metric is falling.Yet, this has been an unusual time for the pet food industry. The pandemic clearly pulled forward some of Chewy's growth as it gave pet owners an unusual incentive to switch to its delivery model.However, there's been no fundamental shift in the wider pet supply segment's outlook. The industry is on track to grow at between 5% and 7% annually over the next several years, compared to 10% during the pandemic and 6% in the pre-pandemic days. Chewy's main challenge will be to keep winning market share through the slowdown over the next few years.Reasons for optimismGrowth over the next few years will need to come mostly from Chewy's established U.S. retail market but also from its newer pet healthcare business and its expansion into international markets, starting with Canada. The chances for better investment returns will rise if the business pairs rising average spending per customer with a steadily increasing shopper base. It's missing one-half of that formula these days, but average annual spending is at least strong at over $500 per active customer.Story continuesChewy's is also on a rock-solid financial footing, which gives management the flexibility to invest aggressively in growth initiatives. Gross profit margin is excellent and rising, cash flow is solidly positive, and the company generated a tiny net profit over the past nine months. Yet, Wall Street is unlikely to reward Chewy if it can't push its profit margins toward double-digit percentages.What to watch in late MarchInvestors will have a better idea about Chewy's short-term growth opportunities after it announces fiscal fourth-quarter results in late March. Analysts generally are expecting to hear that sales rose at a 10% pace for fiscal 2023, and they anticipate a slowdown to about 5% gains in the fiscal year that just started. The earnings outlook is just a bit brighter.The prospects don't look great, then, for shareholder returns over the next five years. That's true even though Chewy's stock is valued so cheaply, having declined 60% in the last year. Modest steps toward higher profits and faster growth might be enough to give the stock a lift.Yet, Chewy's business will have to make some fundamental shifts in its engagement trends to win its way back into Wall Street's good graces. Investors are hoping that the first step toward making that bullish scenario a reality will arrive with the company's March 20 earnings update.Should you invest $1,000 in Chewy right now?Before you buy stock in Chewy, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chewy wasn’t one of them.
