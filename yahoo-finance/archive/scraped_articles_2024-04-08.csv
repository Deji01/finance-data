Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Arm Holdings Stock Is Going to $135. Is It a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-183742242.html,Arm chips are gaining traction in the data center and PC markets.,"While chips based on Arm Holdings' (NASDAQ: ARM) technology dominate multiple markets, including smartphones, it's the company's opportunity to expand its presence in the data center and PC market that has analysts at KeyBanc excited.KeyBanc reiterated its ""overweight"" rating on Arm to kick off the week while boosting its price target from $120 to $135. From its current price, the new target suggests a 6.5% upside over the next 12 months or so. Shares of Arm have surged this year, and KeyBanc sees the rally continuing.Gunning for the data center and PCIn the data center, x86 chips from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices dominate the landscape. The situation is starting to change, though, with artificial intelligence (AI) being a key driver. GPU giant Nvidia is pushing its so-called ""superchips,"" which combine its powerful GPU cores and Arm CPU cores tuned for data center workloads. KeyBanc expects Nvidia's GB200 chip, announced in March, to boost Arm's presence in the data center market.PCs are another opportunity. Apple made the switch to custom Arm processors for its Mac computers, and now Microsoft and Qualcomm are looking to shake things up on the Windows side. Qualcomm's Arm-based Elite X PC chips are coming later this year, and early benchmarks look promising.The tricky thing about Arm PCs is that they must run most standard Windows programs without issue to convince consumers that they're a viable option. Apple uses an emulation layer for its Arm-based Macs, and it remains to be seen how well a similar setup will work on Windows. There is some traction getting developers to build applications specifically for Arm: Alphabet's Google recently launched a version of its Chrome web browser optimized for Arm-based systems.Is Arm stock a buy?While Arm will likely win market share in both the data center and PC markets, the stock has become prohibitively expensive.

Motley Fool,"GE Aerospace Stock Has 22% Upside, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ge-aerospace-stock-22-upside-182655848.html,A (sort of) new stock gets a new look from a market professional.,"GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) is the legacy business of the former General Electric, which recently completed its separation into three distinct businesses. In adjusting his take on the company now that it has ""Aerospace,"" attached to its name, one pundit following the stock reduced his price target. He still feels the shares have plenty of room to move higher, though.General Electric slims down into GE AerospaceThe analyst behind the adjustment is Deutsche Bank's Scott Deuschle, who lopped off $20 from his previous price target (back when the stock was just plain old General Electric) for a new level of $190 per share. That implies a nearly 22% upside from the current price. He also ported over his buy recommendation to GE Aerospace.The company, which is now more focused than the former General Electric, is deserving of a premium over its peers. Deuschle wrote that this is due to GE Aerospace's ""wide moat, dominant share position, strong long-term growth outlook, pricing power, high [return on total capital], high balance sheet optionality, and track record for beating and raising.""Deuschle is convinced GE Aerospace can soar. He pegged it as being one of Deutsche Bank's top stock picks in the aerospace and defense field.Good timingI feel this assessment is realistic, as GE Aerospace is coming into existence at a busy time for the commercial aviation industry, an important customer base for the company. With tourism demand strong and sustainable, those customers will need turbofan engines like the LEAPs GE Aerospace and European peer Safran Aircraft Engines produce in their joint-venture CFM International.

Yahoo Finance,Tesla robotaxis: Wall Street weighs in on Elon Musk’s latest gambit,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-robotaxis-wall-street-weighs-in-on-elon-musks-latest-gambit-181643531.html,Tesla stock jumped in Monday trading as investors bought into CEO Elon Musk’s latest proclamation that Tesla would unveil its long-awaited robotaxi on Aug. 8.,"Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped in Monday trading as investors bought into CEO Elon Musk’s latest proclamation that Tesla would debut its long-awaited robotaxi on Aug. 8.Musk’s announcement of Tesla’s Robotaxi after the bell on Friday followed a Reuters report that Tesla had canceled plans to build a long-awaited sub-$30,000 EV, which some have called the Model 2. Reuters said that Tesla would instead focus on a self-driving robotaxi, with Musk responding on X that Reuters was ""lying (again),” before returning to the platform later to announce the unveiling of the robotaxi, generally understood to have no steering wheel or pedals. It's still an open question whether Tesla will eventually unveil a low-cost EV.Despite Monday’s pop in shares, Wall Street analysts are mixed on the announcement.Deutsche Bank’s Emmanuel Rosner said the robotaxi news was “thesis-changing” on Tesla.“If the shift away from Model 2 is once again confirmed, the Tesla bull case would then presumably be that in light of solid improvement in its autonomous tech, Tesla has decided to press its unique AI and software advantage through a focus on robotaxi, which few OEMs [original equipment makers] could imitate and that would command more favorable economics,” Rosner said on the bull side of the thesis.The bear side, however, is that Tesla has given up a “key reason” why many own the stock: the Model 2 as a volume play that would “reaccelerate volume, margins, and FCF [free cash flow],” Rosner said. It would also mean the bull thesis is based on Tesla cracking the code on self-driving, which will require navigating a number of regulatory hurdles and acquiring enough data to train the software.Rosner has a Buy rating on the stock and a $189 price target.FILE PHOTO: Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk gets in a Tesla car as he leaves a hotel in Beijing, China May 31, 2023. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)On the flip side, noted Tesla bull Tasha Keeney at ARK Invest believes the long-term potential of Tesla is largely tied up with self-driving and autonomy.""They have an unparalleled data advantage compared to every other company that's solving for full autonomy,” Keeney said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live. As with AI, Keeney said data is the key to training models and getting to a working model of self-driving. She said Tesla’s full-self driving (FSD) beta is nearly there, noting that Tesla is accumulating 2.5 million miles of self-driving data from customers every day. Competitors like Waymo have only logged a little over 10 million miles since the beginning of the project, Keeney said.Story continues“We think this is going to drive the future value of Tesla. When we look out five years, we think it'll be two-thirds of the enterprise value in five years. So we're super excited about it,” Keeney said.ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood recently reiterated the firm’s $2,000 price target on Tesla, forecasting $10 trillion in revenue from robotaxi efforts.Tesla FSD beta in use. (Tesla YouTube video) (Tesla YouTube page)On the other side of the spectrum is Craig Irwin at Roth Capital, who is much more skeptical on the robotaxi. He believes today’s move in the stock is technical in nature and not rooted in fundamentals. Irwin has a Neutral rating on the stock and an $85 price target.“Professional investors follow momentum. They measure retail momentum very carefully, and the size of the uplift on this announcement will be measured by all my clients across Wall Street,” Irwin said. After the initial digestion of the news, Irwin believes Tesla’s autonomous play is still far off.""[Autonomous driving] will consume as much electricity as the drivetrain [in current EVs]. Technically it's conceivable, it's feasible, but not on the [Tesla] vehicles that have been sold, and not in the format that anyone's close to today,” Irwin said.Irwin suspects Tesla’s vehicles will need more enhanced sensors, cameras, and other equipment to truly achieve full autonomy, and the fascination of the “Cyber Taxi,” as Irwin called it, is masking the bigger fundamental problems at the company, such as lack of demand and strong competition.“I think the stock can get cut in half; I think there's more price cuts to come. I think that there's more margin compression, and this is a diversion away from the fact that the company is now shrinking,” Irwin concluded.Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Motley Fool,1 Wall Street Analyst Thinks Amazon Stock Is Going to $204. Is It a buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-181000407.html,The company also has a growing offline presence that's worth watching.,"Most consumers and investors think of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as exclusively an online retailer, but its offline operations are looking pretty good these days too.That's according to one analyst following the stock, who reiterated his bullish take on the company's stock in a recent research note. According to him, it's a buy with a 10% upside in price over the next 12 months or so.Just Walk Out is on the way outBank of America Securities's Justin Post was compelled to publish an update on Amazon following news about its Fresh brick-and-mortar chain of retail stores. In early April, the company confirmed media reports that it is phasing out its Just Walk Out system from its U.S. Fresh stores. This allows shoppers to, yes, walk out of the stores without going through the checkout process; the company's technology scans the items and charges one of the buyer's linked payment methods accordingly.Just Walk Out is to be replaced in these instances with Dash Carts, technology-enhanced shopping trolleys that allow customers to scan items, and monitor their spending on an in-cart display.Post wrote that the transition ""is part of the broader push to revamp Fresh locations with more customer-friendly features like brighter colors and coffee shops, as opposed to the possibly 'online first' design of Amazon's previous locations.""The analyst is anticipating a ""significant grocery investment cycle,"" from the company. In his view, the Dash Carts will allow it to earn incremental advertising revenue from the displays.Not a major operation yetIn his research note, Post reiterated his buy recommendation on Amazon stock, and he reaffirmed his price target at $204 per share. I feel he's right not to modify either, as the Fresh stores probably won't be a significant revenue or cost center for years.

Motley Fool,Is Ford Stock a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-stock-buy-180200249.html,"Shares have had a positive start to the year thus far, which is attracting investor attention.","Ford (NYSE: F) had a strong 2023. Its revenue was up 18.1%, as it sold 182,000 more units than the year before. The results were driven by favorable pricing trends. That helps explain why shares are up 9% this year (as of April 5).Investors who want exposure to the industry are probably looking at this auto stock as a potential buying opportunity. Let's consider the investment merits of this business right now.Recent trendsThe momentum for Ford has carried over into this year. The company reported unit sales growth of 7% during the first three months of 2024. Hybrid sales surged 42%.A bright spot was Ford's electric vehicle (EV) division, known as Model e. Impressive growth for two key models, the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, helped drive overall EV sales volume up 86% in the first quarter. Selling just over 20,000 EV units last quarter puts Ford behind only Tesla in the U.S. market.With such monster growth in the EV segment, it makes you scratch your head at why the leadership team chose to delay $12 billion in investments in this area. Investors should be asking what type of growth executives were really expecting to warrant making these cash outlays as planned. Perhaps the EV division will never grow at the desired pace.Nonetheless, Ford is in a favorable position today. With $2 billion in cost reductions identified for this year, the business expects to generate $10 billion to $12 billion of adjusted operating income in 2024. At the midpoint, that would be higher than the $10.4 billion registered last year.Why I'm not a buyerFord might be benefiting from solid sales trends right now, but investors need to consider the long-term perspective before buying any business. This places the emphasis on factors that can drive shareholder returns over many years. Viewed in this light, Ford doesn't make for a worthy investment candidate, in my opinion.The first aspect to think about is Ford's moat, or a set of traits that allow it to outperform its rivals. To be clear, I don't believe the business possesses any sustainable competitive advantages. Supporters might point to the company's brand or its scaled manufacturing capabilities. But all of its industry peers -- including General Motors, Stellantis, Honda, Toyota, and Tesla, to name a few -- have name recognition and sizable production capacity.Story continuesThis points to how intensely competitive the automotive space is. People have a large number of choices in front of them. Ford has to constantly spend massive amounts of capital on marketing efforts, research and development, and labor and production, all to engage in ongoing price wars with rivals who are focusing on all the same areas.The result is that meaningful growth and margin expansion will be extremely difficult to come by, which has been true in the past. Ford's 2023 revenue was only 20% higher compared to a decade ago. And during that 10-year stretch, the operating margin has shown zero ability to improve. Why would the future be any different? That's particularly true when talking about an extremely mature industry like this one.Ford will also always have to deal with macroeconomic trends, mainly changes in interest rates and the possibility of recessions. Owning businesses that are extremely sensitive to factors that are outside of their control for their success is not typically a smart strategy. What direction the economy is headed in is impossible to predict.If we include dividends, in the past 10 years, Ford shares have returned 35%. That gain seriously lags the total returns of the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite Index. Investors who are attempting to beat the market over the long term should avoid buying Ford stock. This poor track record speaks for itself.Should you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?Before you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.
