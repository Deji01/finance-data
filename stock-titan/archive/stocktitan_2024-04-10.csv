The collaboration aims to enhance risk management and customer service through transaction-based predictive models. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The strategic partnership between Atto and FICO is poised to bring significant advancements in credit scoring for UK lenders. By incorporating Open Banking data into credit risk assessment, lenders are likely to see a refinement in risk segmentation. This could lead to more precise lending decisions, potentially reducing default rates and improving the profitability of credit portfolios. The integration of transactional data into credit scoring is not entirely new, but the partnership promises to streamline the process, making it more accessible and actionable for lenders.As Open Banking gains traction, the financial services industry is witnessing an evolution in data management and utilization. This partnership could set a precedent for how lenders leverage consumer data, balancing the need for privacy with the benefits of enhanced data analytics. Lenders who adopt this technology early may gain a competitive edge in customer acquisition and retention by offering more tailored financial products. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the collaboration between Atto and FICO is an indicator of the growing importance of data analytics in financial services. The demand for more sophisticated credit scoring methods is likely to increase as the market becomes more competitive. This partnership may spur innovation across the sector, prompting other analytics firms to develop similar offerings. As a result, we can expect a surge in the market for credit risk solutions that prioritize real-time data analysis.Furthermore, the move towards more granular risk assessment models could influence consumer behavior, with individuals becoming more conscious of how their transaction data impacts their creditworthiness. This increased awareness could lead to more prudent financial behavior, which in turn could affect overall market risk levels. Economist In the broader economic context, the enhanced credit scoring techniques stemming from this partnership could contribute to financial stability. By enabling lenders to make more informed decisions, the risk of credit bubbles and subsequent market corrections may be mitigated. Additionally, improved risk management strategies can contribute to a healthier lending environment, which is important for economic growth.However, the shift towards data-intensive credit scoring also raises concerns about data privacy and the potential for socioeconomic bias in lending practices. It will be important for regulators to monitor these developments to ensure that they do not inadvertently lead to financial exclusion or discrimination. 04/10/2024 - 04:10 AM Risk scores based on consumer-permissioned Open Banking data can enhance lenders’ risk management and improve customer service LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Atto, a leading provider of credit risk solutions using transactional data, is thrilled to announce a strategic partnership with FICO, a global analytics software leader, for the UK market.

Positive None. Negative None. Automotive Industry Analyst The expansion of XPENG Motors into the Hong Kong market, in partnership with Sime Darby Motors, marks a significant development within the electric vehicle (EV) sector. This move is indicative of XPENG's aggressive growth strategy and its commitment to increasing its global market share. Hong Kong's position as a financial and trade hub offers XPENG a high-visibility platform to showcase its advanced Smart EV technology, potentially influencing consumer preferences and setting a precedent for future market entries.The choice of Hong Kong for expansion is strategic, considering the city's stringent environmental policies and the growing popularity of EVs among its residents. XPENG's ability to exceed 400,000 cumulative historical deliveries demonstrates its manufacturing capability and market acceptance. The introduction of new models, such as the G6 SUV and X9 MPV, is likely to cater to a diverse consumer base, from individuals to families, enhancing the brand's competitive edge in a market that values innovation and quality.Investors should monitor XPENG's market performance in Hong Kong as an indicator of the company's potential to replicate this success in other international markets. A successful launch can lead to increased investor confidence and positive stock market reactions. However, competition from established EV players and geopolitical tensions could pose challenges to XPENG's market penetration efforts. Market Research Analyst The EV market in Hong Kong has been ripe for expansion, with a noticeable shift in consumer behavior towards environmentally friendly and technologically advanced vehicles. XPENG's partnership with Sime Darby Motors, a company with a deep understanding of the local automotive landscape, provides a strong foundation for XPENG to navigate the unique market dynamics and consumer preferences in Hong Kong.XPENG's strategy to introduce a range of models, including the G6 and X9, aligns with the diverse needs of Hong Kong consumers. The emphasis on premium, innovative vehicles can attract a segment of the market that prioritizes luxury and high-tech features. This approach may also create a halo effect, enhancing the brand's image and potentially increasing demand for its other models.It will be important to observe how XPENG's sales and after-sales support are received by local consumers, as customer service excellence is a key differentiator in the premium EV market. Effective localization of services and customer engagement can further solidify XPENG's position in Hong Kong and serve as a model for expansion into other markets. Financial Analyst XPENG Motors' entry into the Hong Kong market, through its dealer partnership, is a move that investors should watch closely. The strategic partnership with Sime Darby Motors could lead to improved sales distribution and customer service, which are essential for gaining market share. The timing of the vehicle deliveries, starting in Q3, suggests that XPENG is positioning itself to capitalize on the sales momentum typically observed in the latter half of the year.The financial implications of this expansion could be significant if XPENG successfully captures a portion of the growing EV market in Hong Kong. This could lead to an increase in revenue streams outside of its domestic market, diversifying its income and potentially reducing the impact of market-specific risks. However, the costs associated with establishing a presence in a new market, including marketing and logistics expenses, will likely affect short-term profitability.Long-term, the success of this venture could influence XPENG's stock performance, especially if the company can demonstrate an effective strategy for international growth. Investors should consider the potential for increased brand recognition and consumer loyalty, which could translate into sustained sales growth and a stronger competitive position in the global EV industry. 04/10/2024 - 03:11 AM GUANGZHOU, China, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XPENG Motors (“XPENG” or the “Company,” NYSE: XPEV and HKEX: 9868), a leading Chinese smart electric vehicle (“Smart EV”) company, today expands its footprint through a dealer partnership with Sime Darby Motors in Hong Kong.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 02:05 AM ST HELIER, Jersey, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (""the Company"" or ""Caledonia"") (NYSE AMERICAN, AIM and VFEX: CMCL) announces that following the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards (“LTIPs”) on April 2, 2024, which were awarded under the Company’s 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the ""Plan""), a total of 335 common shares of no par value in the Company are being issued to members of staff within the Company's group (none of whom are ""Persons Discharging Managerial Responsibility"" (""PDMRs"") within the meaning of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014), including in the form of Zimbabwe depositary receipts in respect of such shares, on or about April 12, 2024. The Plan was established in 2015 and LTIPs have been awarded since then to increase alignment between Caledonia's management’s performance and shareholders’ expectations, and to improve employee incentivisation and retention. Application has been made by Caledonia for the admission of depositary interests representing the shares to trading on AIM and it is anticipated that trading in such securities will commence on or about April 12, 2024. Following issue of the shares pursuant to the vesting LTIPs, the Company will have a total number of shares in issue of 19,194,860 common shares of no par value each. Caledonia has no shares in treasury; therefore, this figure may be used by holders of securities in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company. Caledonia further announces that on April 8, 2024 it granted new LTIPs to 100 members of staff in the group, of which 69 are based in Zimbabwe. Of the LTIPs awarded, PDMRs are (or will be in the case of Mr Mufara) receiving the following awards: Name of PDMRPositionValueMark LearmonthDirector and Chief Executive OfficerUS$479,722.50Victor GapareExecutive DirectorUS$200,417.37Chester GoodburnChief Financial OfficerUS$138,586.50James MufaraChief Operations OfficerUS$135,218.981 The LTIPs are in the form of Performance Units (""PUs"") as defined in the Plan. The vesting date for the PUs awarded to PDMRs shall be the first business day in April 2027 (whereas LTIPs for non-executives vest in tranches of a third each year in April). The number of PUs awarded is equal to the monetary value of the award divided by the ""Fair Market Value"" (as defined in the Plan) of the Company's shares, being the greater of (i) the closing price of Caledonia's shares on the NYSE American on the trading day preceding the date of the award or (ii) the volume-weighted average closing price of Caledonia's shares on the NYSE American for the five days preceding the date of the award, which resulted in a price of US$10.91 for PUs awarded on April 8, 2024. The final number of PUs which vest on maturity of the awards (in April 2027 for PUs awarded to PDMRs, and in tranches in April 2025, 2026 and 2027 for non-executives) will be adjusted to reflect the actual performance of the Company in terms of various operating metrics including gold production at Blanket Mine, improvement in the amount of resources and reserves at Blanket Mine, success at the Company’s exploration projects and the development of the Bilboes sulphide project, subject to certain minimum and maximum thresholds. Each PU that vests entitles the PDMR to receive one Caledonia common share (or a security representing a share) on the maturity of the award. Shares that are issued to PDMRs pursuant to vesting PUs are subject to a minimum holding period of one year in case vested awards become subject to forfeiture, reduction or cancellation. LTIPs awarded to non-executives entitle the awardee to opt for the cash value of the vesting PUs rather than shares, or a combination. Further to the announcement on April 8, 2024 concerning Mr Mufara being appointed as the new Chief Operating Officer from May 1, 2024, Mr Mufara will receive, as soon as possible after his employment commences, or, if later, after the end of any current closed period during which his employment commences, a number of Restricted Share Units pursuant to the Plan (“RSUs”) with a value of 5 million South African Rands to compensate him for foregoing long term incentive plan awards granted by his previous employer. The number of RSUs awarded will be at the “Fair Market Value” at the time of grant. The RSUs have no performance requirement other than continued employment and will vest on September 30, 2024, or on the next applicable date that is not within a closed period. Dividends paid during the vesting period will be reinvested in additional RSUs. Each RSU that vests will entitle Mr Mufara to receive one Caledonia common share (or a security representing a share) on the maturity of the award. Shares that are issued are subject, similarly to PUs, to a minimum holding period of one year in case vested awards become subject to forfeiture, reduction or cancellation. 1 Note that Mr Mufara’s award will be made as soon as possible after his employment commences, or, if later, after the end of any current closed period during which his employment commences. His award of PUs is prorated to reflect that his employment is due to commence on May 1, 2024 i.e. is therefore reduced by 4 months of a total performance period of 36 months.

The product offers ESG screening criteria for socially and environmentally conscious decisions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Nasdaq futures on the OMX Sweden Small Cap 30 ESG Responsible Index represents a significant step in the evolution of financial instruments that cater to the growing demand for ESG-focused investment options. The market for ESG investments has seen a substantial increase in recent years, reflecting a broader trend of investors seeking to align their portfolios with their values. This product launch is likely to attract attention from asset managers and retail investors looking to diversify their strategies and gain exposure to the Swedish small cap market in a way that also considers ESG criteria.In the context of over 300 billion SEK in AUM tracking the Swedish small cap market, the introduction of such futures could facilitate enhanced liquidity and price discovery for these assets. It is also indicative of Nasdaq's strategy to innovate in product offerings that meet specific market needs, potentially leading to increased trading volumes and interest in the Nordic region's financial markets. For investors, the availability of a liquid and diversified product that simplifies investment in small cap stocks while adhering to ESG standards could be an attractive proposition, potentially impacting the flow of capital into ESG-compliant companies. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the launch of the OMX Sweden Small Cap 30 ESG Responsible Index futures may influence the underlying market dynamics by providing a new tool for risk management. Portfolio managers, like Marcus Plyhr from Norron Asset Management, highlight the utility of these futures for both long-only equity funds and for hedging in absolute return funds. The ability to hedge more effectively could lead to more efficient fund management and potentially better risk-adjusted returns for investors.Moreover, the product's potential to be used in the creation and trading of Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) and structured products could stimulate innovation in these areas. The focus on liquidity by Nasdaq indicates an anticipation of high trading volume, which is important for the success of any derivative product. This could also have a knock-on effect on the broader market by increasing the attractiveness of Swedish small cap stocks and potentially leading to a re-rating of these assets as they become more accessible to a wider range of investors. ESG Investment Strategist ESG considerations are increasingly at the forefront of investment decision-making processes. The Nasdaq futures on the OMX Sweden Small Cap 30 ESG Responsible Index aligns with this trend by providing a tool that screens for environmental, social and governance factors. This enables investors to incorporate ESG considerations into their investment strategies without sacrificing the traditional benefits of futures, such as leverage, liquidity and the ability to hedge.For asset managers and investors, the ESG screening criteria outlined in the Index methodology offer a transparent framework to ensure investments are contributing to positive societal and environmental outcomes. This could encourage more capital inflow into small cap companies that demonstrate strong ESG practices, potentially driving these companies to further improve their ESG performance. However, it's important to note that the ESG screening process must be rigorous and aligned with investor expectations to maintain the integrity of the ESG label and ensure that it is not merely a marketing tool. 04/10/2024 - 02:30 AM STOCKHOLM, Sweden, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced the launch of Nasdaq futures on the OMX Sweden Small Cap 30 ESG Responsible Index™ (Nasdaq: OMXSS30ESG™) (Bloomberg Ticker: OMXSMLGI).

(TSX:VLE)(OTCQX:VLERF) (""Valeura"" or the ""Company""), the upstream oil and gas company with assets in the Gulf of Thailand and the Thrace Basin of Türkiye, is pleased to provide an update on Q1 2024 operations. Highlights for Q1 2024Oil production averaged 21.9 mbbls/d, quarter exit rate of approximately 23.0 mbbls/d(1);Scheduled maintenance conducted safely and under planned time and budget on Manora and Jasmine production facilities;Price realisations of US$84.6/bbl, a US$1.5/bbl premium over Brent;Revenue of US$149.4 million while oil inventory increased 31% to 0.9 million bbls; andCash at bank of US$193.6 million, no debt;(1) Working interest share oil production, before royalties.Sean Guest, President and CEO commented:""I am pleased to share highlights of our Q1 2024 operational performance with production performance up 14% from Q4 2023 and very much in line with our plan. The increased production reflects strong performance of the new wells at the Wassana field, but was slightly offset by shutdowns for scheduled maintenance at two of our fields to ensure ongoing world class standards for integrity. We exited the quarter with aggregate production rates of approximately 23.0 mbbls/d.Our financial performance has been strong too. With price realisations at or slightly above our guidance outlook, we generated Q1 2024 revenue of US$149.4 million. After accounting for cash outflows, including spending which is tracking our guidance assumptions, the result was a further build in our cash position to US$193.6 million. Our balance sheet is going from strength to strength, and we feel it is appropriate to stay the course and to build even more resilience as we seek out value-accretive opportunities both within our portfolio and through potential mergers and acquisitions.We are in a strong position at the close of Q1 and look forward to translating that strength into value through our exploration drilling campaign, followed by our development of the Nong Yao C accumulation thereafter, and further organic projects later in the year.""Q1 2024 UpdateProduction averaged 21.9 mbbls/d during Q1 2024 (Valeura's working interest share, before royalties), an increase of 14% over Q4 2023. Q1 2024 average production rates were affected by planned downtime at the Jasmine and Manora fields for scheduled maintenance, which was conducted safely and under the planned time and budget. By the end of the quarter, maintenance work had been completed and all fields were in operation, with aggregate rates of approximately 23.0 mbbls/d. Overall production performance has been in line with management's plan, and accordingly, Valeura is pleased to re-iterate its full year 2024 production guidance outlook of 21.5 - 24.5 mbbls/d.Oil sales totalled 1.8 million bbls, during Q1 2023, slightly below the 2.0 million bbls sold during Q4 2023, due to the timing of liftings. At the end of the quarter, the Company held crude oil inventory of 0.9 million bbls, a 31% increase over the end Q4 2023 inventory. It is expected that this increased inventory will be sold in Q2 2024.Price realisations averaged US$84.6/bbl during Q1 2023, reflecting a US$1.5/bbl premium over the Brent crude oil benchmark, which averaged US$83.1/bbl.

Philips Respironics reaches agreement with US government on a consent decree creating a clear path forward,2024-04-10T06:05:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Philips' subsidiaries reach final agreement on consent decree with the DOJ and FDA, focusing on Philips Respironics' US operations. The 2023-2025 Group financial outlook remains unchanged.","Philips Respironics reaches agreement with US government on a consent decree creating a clear path forward Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Philips' subsidiaries reach final agreement on consent decree with the DOJ and FDA, focusing on Philips Respironics' US operations. The 2023-2025 Group financial outlook remains unchanged. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The finalization of the consent decree between Philips Respironics, the DOJ and the FDA marks a significant milestone in addressing the regulatory compliance issues that have been a concern since the FDA's inspection in 2021. From a legal standpoint, this agreement provides a structured framework for Philips Respironics to rectify identified deficiencies and avoid potential sanctions or further legal action. The decree likely includes provisions for monitoring and reporting, which are standard to ensure ongoing compliance with FDA regulations.For stakeholders, the clear path forward reduces legal uncertainty and potential risks associated with non-compliance. However, the financial implications of adhering to the decree, such as costs associated with the necessary remediation actions, could impact Philips' profitability in the short term. Nevertheless, the long-term benefits of restoring trust and ensuring the quality of products could outweigh these initial expenditures, potentially enhancing Philips' reputation and market position in the healthcare sector. Medical Device Industry Analyst In the context of the medical device industry, the agreement with the DOJ and FDA is a critical development for Philips Respironics. The consent decree's focus on compliance and remediation efforts is indicative of the heightened scrutiny the industry faces regarding product safety and regulatory adherence. As Philips Respironics implements the required changes, competitors may capitalize on any temporary disruptions or capacity limitations.Investors should note that the company's financial outlook remaining unchanged suggests that Philips has already accounted for the anticipated costs and operational impacts within its strategic planning. This demonstrates a proactive approach to risk management. The consent decree's impact on Philips Respironics' ability to innovate and bring new products to market while under this increased oversight will be an important aspect to monitor, as it could influence the company's competitive edge and long-term growth prospects. Healthcare Compliance Consultant The consent decree's emphasis on Philips Respironics' commitment to servicing healthcare providers and patients highlights the importance of maintaining uninterrupted supply chains and support networks, especially for critical medical devices. Compliance with such decrees typically involves extensive internal audits, process reengineering and employee training, which can be resource-intensive.From a healthcare compliance perspective, the decree serves as a cautionary tale for the industry, underscoring the need for robust quality management systems and ongoing vigilance in regulatory affairs. For Philips Respironics, successful compliance will not only align with FDA standards but also potentially serve as a differentiator in the market, showcasing their dedication to quality and patient safety. This could ultimately reinforce customer loyalty and trust in the Philips brand. 04/10/2024 - 02:05 AM April 10, 2024 Philips confirms that further to communicating the main terms of the Philips Respironics consent decree on January 29, 2024, Philips’ subsidiaries Philips Holding USA and Philips Respironics have now reached final agreement on the consent decree with the DOJ and FDA. As previously stated: The consent decree primarily focuses on Philips Respironics’ business operations in the US.It provides clarity and a roadmap to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and to restore the Philips Respironics business. Philips Respironics is committed to meeting the consent decree requirements, while continuing to service healthcare providers and their patients under agreed conditions in the US and outside the US. The 2023 – 2025 Group financial outlook takes the consent decree into account and remains unchanged. Amsterdam, the Netherlands - Following the FDA’s inspection of Philips Respironics’ facility in Murrysville in 2021 and the subsequent inspectional observations, the US Department of Justice (DOJ), representing the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), began discussions with Royal Philips (NYSE: PHG, AEX: PHIA) in July 2022 regarding the terms of a proposed consent decree. On January 29, 2024, Philips announced that it agreed with the DOJ and FDA on the terms of the proposed consent decree. Philips’ subsidiaries Philips Holding USA and Philips Respironics have now reached final agreement on the consent decree with the DOJ and FDA, that primarily focuses on Philips Respironics’ business operations in the US, including its manufacturing facilities in Murrysville and New Kensington, its service center in Mount Pleasant and its Respironics headquarters in Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The consent decree provides Philips Respironics with a roadmap of defined actions, milestones, and deliverables to meet relevant regulatory requirements, as previously communicated by Philips on January 29, 2024, including: Philips Respironics will continue to prioritize completing the remediation of the sleep and respiratory care devices under Respironics’ voluntary June 2021 recall. More than 99% of the actionable registered CPAP and BiPAP sleep therapy devices have been remediated globally, while the remediation of the ventilators is ongoing in coordination with the relevant competent authorities. Philips Respironics will retain independent experts to review various aspects of the recall remediation. Philips Respironics’ business operations must demonstrate continued compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices). Philips Respironics will retain independent experts to supervise the compliance improvement program. In the US, millions of patients are currently using Philips Respironics sleep and respiratory care devices. Philips Respironics will be permitted to continue servicing these sleep and respiratory care devices that are already with healthcare providers and patients, and to sell accessories (including masks), consumables (including patient circuits), and replacement parts (including repair kits). In 2021, Philips Respironics voluntarily stopped selling CPAP and BiPAP sleep therapy devices and other respiratory care devices in the US, as it prioritized the production for the remediation of the affected devices under the June 2021 recall. Until the relevant requirements of the consent decree are met, Philips Respironics will not resume selling new CPAP or BiPAP devices or other respiratory care devices in the US. The consent decree includes provisions to allow for exports. Outside the US, Philips Respironics will continue to provide new sleep and respiratory care devices, accessories (including masks), consumables (including patient circuits), replacement parts (including repair kits) and services, subject to certain requirements that Philips Respironics will meet. Philips Respironics’ devices with the new silicone sound abatement foam have been subject to extensive testing in accordance with the applicable industry testing standards, and Philips Respironics has not identified any safety issues. These devices may continue to be used in accordance with the instructions for use. Roy Jakobs, CEO at Philips said: “Strengthening patient safety and quality remains Philips’ highest priority and the increased scrutiny will help us to improve even more. With the agreement on a consent decree for Philips Respironics in place, we now have a clear path forward to gradually restore the business, serving patients around the world.” Philips Chief Patient Safety and Quality Officer Steve C de Baca said: “Patient safety and quality is our number one priority. We know what we must do to meet the consent decree requirements. Philips Respironics has been working with the FDA, and is already making significant changes in its organization, quality management systems and operations. This includes strengthening the quality management processes and deepening the competencies of the relevant teams. We are fully committed to meeting the terms of the consent decree and continuing to serve the millions of patients who rely on our devices every day.” Financial impact As previously stated on January 29, 2024, as a consequence of addressing this consent decree, which is a multi-year plan, Philips expects costs of around 100 basis points in 2024 that relate to remediation activities and profit disgorgement payments for Philips Respironics sales in the US. The previously stated 2023-2025 Group financial outlook of mid-single-digit comparable sales growth, low-teens Adjusted EBITA margin, and EUR 1.4-1.6 billion free cash flow now takes the consent decree into account and remains unchanged. It excludes the investigation by the US DOJ related to the Respironics field action and the impact of the ongoing litigation. General information about this consent decree can be found here.

The test aids in assessing HER2-low status, expanding treatment options for patients. Positive None. Negative None. 04/10/2024 - 01:00 AM Approximately half of all patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) express low levels of HER2.1 Patients with HER2-low status may now be eligible for HER2-targeted treatment, which could significantly improve their outcome.2The VENTANA HER2 (4B5) test is the only approved companion diagnostic indicated as an aid in the assessment of HER2-low status in metastatic breast cancer patients. TUCSON, Ariz., April 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) announced today the approval of the CE Mark for the VENTANA® HER2 (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody RxDx* to identify metastatic breast cancer patients with low HER2 expression for whom ENHERTU® (trastuzumab deruxtecan) may be considered as a targeted treatment. The test, which is branded PATHWAY in the United States, received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2022. ENHERTU is a specifically engineered HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate (ADC) being jointly developed and commercialised by Daiichi Sankyo and AstraZeneca. HER2 is a receptor protein that helps cancer cells grow quickly. To determine a patient's HER2 status, pathologists evaluate, or score, the level of HER2 protein expressed in breast cancer tissue samples. If a patient's tumour expresses high levels of HER2, the patient is identified as HER2-positive and may be considered for HER2-targeted treatment. However, half of all patients with metastatic breast cancer express low levels of HER2 which historically classified them as HER2-negative. ""We are proud to continue our innovation in breast cancer diagnostics through critical tests like this one, which helps identify patients with HER2-low status,"" said Jill German, Head of Pathology Lab at Roche Diagnostics. ""With this expanded approval of our test, we're pleased that more metastatic breast cancer patients across the world may be correctly identified and potentially eligible for this targeted therapy."" The VENTANA HER2 (4B5) test now includes a scoring algorithm that helps pathologists to identify ""low expressors"" of HER2, assigning a HER2 low status to this group of patients. With this lower cutoff, the test is able to identify patients who may benefit from ENHERTU as a treatment option. Breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases diagnosed worldwide each year. More than 685,000 people die from breast cancer every year.4,5 The CE Mark of the new HER2-low indication expands on the intended use for Roche's proven, on-market VENTANA HER2 (4B5) test, delivering timely, clear and confident results. The launch exemplifies Roche's commitment to continuing to innovate integrated, high medical value solutions that help to advance personalised healthcare. About VENTANA HER2 (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody RxDxRoche's pre-diluted VENTANA HER2 (4B5) Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody RxDx, used in combination with the fully automated BenchMark IHC/ISH slide staining instrument, standardises all immunohistochemistry (IHC) processes from baking through staining, and reduces the possibility of human error.5 It also minimises inherent variability resulting from individual reagent dilution and other processes found in manual and semi-automated IHC methods. The Roche HER2 (4B5) clone achieves consistently high proficiency assessment scores compared to other clones6 and demonstrates high concordance with HER2 FISH7,8, empowering laboratories to employ the most widely adopted and reliable HER2-IHC primary antibody. The VENTANA HER2 (4B5) test was used as part of the DESTINY-Breast04 trial to identify patients whose tumours expressed low levels of HER2 protein (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-). The trial reported a 50% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death and an overall survival gain of six months over standard of care in patients treated with ENHERTU whose tumours had low levels of HER2 expression, leading to the approval of ENHERTU in this patient population.

Production reached 17,050 ounces, a 6% rise from Q1 2023, with 18,450 ounces sold, a 17% increase. The company reiterates 2024 production guidance of 74,000 to 78,000 ounces. CEO Mark Learmonth highlights the strong start and growth potential of the mine. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in gold production and sales at Blanket Mine, operated by Caledonia Mining Corporation, indicates a positive trajectory for the company's operational efficiency, particularly given the context of reduced production days. The 6% increase in gold production and 17% increase in gold sales year-over-year are significant metrics that reflect not only on the company's internal processes but also on its market positioning. The ability to increase output in a shortened timeframe suggests improvements in mining technology or processes, which could lead to reduced costs and higher margins.Furthermore, the reiteration of the 2024 gold production guidance provides stability and confidence for stakeholders, demonstrating management's trust in the mine's consistent performance. The strategic investments in the mine over the past seven years, which have nearly doubled production, signal a long-term commitment to growth and efficiency. These factors combined could be seen as positive indicators for the company's stock performance, as operational successes often translate into financial robustness. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in gold production and sales volume is a strong indicator of potential revenue growth for Caledonia Mining Corporation. With the current high gold prices, the 17% sales increase could significantly impact the company's top-line figures. Investors should note that the sales volume includes gold work in progress classified as inventory, which suggests that the company is effectively managing its inventory levels to optimize sales timing and revenue recognition.It is also important to consider the broader economic implications of the reported figures. The gold market is often seen as a haven in times of economic uncertainty and an increase in production capacity could position Caledonia well to capitalize on any upward trends in gold prices. However, investors should remain aware of the volatility in commodity markets and the risks associated with geopolitical factors that can affect gold prices and mining operations, particularly in regions like Zimbabwe. Mining Sector Analyst The technical aspects of the increased production at Blanket Mine, such as the completion of the Central Shaft and the resumption of underground exploration, are noteworthy. These developments not only contribute to the immediate increase in production but also indicate potential for future resource expansion. The mining sector often relies on consistent exploration to replace depleted reserves and Caledonia's proactive approach in this area could bode well for its long-term sustainability and appeal to investors looking for companies with a clear path to maintaining or increasing production levels.Additionally, the adherence to standards like the National Instrument 43-101 and the U.S. Securities Act's Regulation S-K for reporting scientific and technical information provides transparency and reliability in the company's disclosures, which is critical for investor trust. This level of detail and compliance is essential for understanding the true value and potential of the company's assets. 04/10/2024 - 02:00 AM Robust production and increased gold sales at Blanket MineST HELIER, Jersey, April 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (""Caledonia"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE AMERICAN: CMCL; AIM: CMCL; VFEX: CMCL) announces gold production from the Blanket Mine in Zimbabwe (""Blanket"") for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (""Q1 2024"" or ""the Quarter""). All production numbers are expressed on a 100 per cent basis and are based on the final assay at the refiners. The increased Q1 2024 production was derived from 8 fewer production days (9.3% less) compared to quarter 1 in 2023 (“Q1 2023”). This was due to production cut-off for gold delivery set to March 21, 2024. Production Summary Q1 2024 gold production at Blanket was 17,050 ounces, a 6% increase on Q1 2023.In Q1 2024 Blanket sold 18,450 ounces. This represented a 17% increase from Q1 2023, when 15,797 ounces were sold.Ounces sold in Q1 2024 include 3,057 ounces of gold work in progress classified as inventory at the end of 2023 (Q1 2024: 1,657 ounces).Caledonia reiterates 2024 gold production guidance at Blanket of 74,000 to 78,000 ounces.1 1 Craig James Harvey, MGSSA, MAIG, Caledonia Vice President, Technical Services, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.

With the current high gold prices, it was good to see our gold sales ounces increase by 17% in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023. “Our significant investment in Blanket over the past seven years and completion of the Central Shaft has nearly doubled production, extended the mine life and allowed the restart of underground exploration in 2023.

Market Research Analyst The update on BlackRock, Inc.'s change in shareholding of Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc indicates a slightly increased stake, crossing a notification threshold. This event is a routine disclosure, yet it provides insights into investor behavior and confidence. In this case, the incremental increase in voting rights suggests a growing interest or strategic positioning by BlackRock in Caledonia Mining.From a market research perspective, such stake changes can subtly influence market sentiment. Investors often look to the actions of large institutional investors as a signal of a company's prospects. While the change is minor, it can reflect positively on Caledonia's market perception, potentially attracting more investors.However, it's important to note that the movement is not substantial enough to suggest a major shift in ownership or corporate control. It remains to be seen how this will play out in terms of stock performance or strategic decisions by Caledonia Mining. Financial Analyst BlackRock's slight increase in its stake in Caledonia Mining is a financial maneuver that warrants attention from a valuation standpoint. The shareholding now stands at 4.79%, a marginal increase from the previous 4.78%. While the percentage points seem negligible, the underlying vote of confidence could have a ripple effect.For investors, the key takeaway is the potential for this move to indicate BlackRock's analysis and expectations of Caledonia's future performance. It could be inferred that BlackRock sees long-term value or expects positive developments that could enhance shareholder value.On the flip side, a single institutional investor's actions should not be overinterpreted.

This legend has long established itself as a North American off-road icon, ready to tackle tough terrain in its way. The all-new 2025 Toyota 4Runner stays true to its original concept, as an extremely capable, dynamic, and durable off-roader and will continue to provide owners a window to bigger worlds. The new generation introduces a bold new look and adds new technology, premium materials, options, and safety. In fact, this all-new sixth generation 4Runner raises the bar in terms of go-anywhere capability and high-end refinement. The 2025 4Runner will be built in Toyota Motor Corporation's Tahara plant in Japan and will arrive in the U.S. in the fall of 2024. ""This all-new 4Runner has incredible versatility and capability that nicely rounds out our truck family story,"" said Dave Christ, Toyota group vice president and general manager. ""We've sold over 3 million in the 40 years it has been on sale, and this sixth-generation model offers a cool new look and incredible features, yet retains the rugged style and capability our customers love about this icon of adventure."" Solid Foundation 4Runner is all-new from the ground up and is built on Toyota's tough TNGA-F global truck platform that is shared with Tacoma, Land Cruiser, Tundra and Sequoia. This platform utilizes a high-strength boxed, steel-ladder frame and features a multi-link coil rear and double wishbone front suspension. The adoption of the innovative TNGA-F platform not only adds strength, but it also improves the vehicle's ride comfort and on-road manners. Passengers feel the benefits of this new platform, even when riding in the available third-row. The enhanced frame, paired with the powerful i-FORCE MAX powertrain, allows 4Runner to tow up to 6,000 pounds. Evolving the Legacy ""Designing the legendary 4Runner began with identifying its unique and memorable aspects linked to fun, outdoor recreation,"" says Calty President, Kevin Hunter. ""Inspired by Baja desert racing, the high lift, lean body, big tire, rugged athleticism defines the core of 4Runner's go anywhere purpose"". The Michigan-based CALTY design team spearheaded the design of this all-new 4Runner. Designers pulled inspiration from the past while also focusing on the future. The all-new 4Runner was designed alongside the Tacoma and shares a family resemblance but is unique in its own way. Both share inspiration from the desert racing scene and have a rugged-with-a-purpose appearance. In a nod to the first and second generations of 4Runners, designers were able to bring back the legacy ""wrap over"" quarter glass, and the popular roll-down rear window remains etched into the vehicle's DNA. The design team meticulously labored to achieve the ideal interior design. They sought to achieve a vehicle with ease of operation and a functional interface that strikes a pure balance of modern sophistication and capable authenticity. For example, second-row tumble seats help increase 4Runners interior versatility and maximizes cargo floor usage. i-FORCE Power MAXed This next chapter of 4Runner offers two powerful and efficient turbocharged 2.4 liter four-cylinder powertrains including the i-FORCE engine with 278 horsepower and 317 lb.-ft. of torque that is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Off-Road and Limited grades will come standard with the i-FORCE powertrain. 4Runner's i-FORCE MAX hybrid powertrain is available on TRD Off-Road and Limited, while standard on the TRD Pro, Trailhunter and Platinum models. This powertrain pairs the turbocharged 2.4-liter engine with a 48-hp electric motor integrated into the eight-speed transmission, feeding off a 1.87-kWh NiMH battery pack that creates a total system output of up to 326 horsepower and 465 lb.-ft. of torque, the most powerful powertrain ever offered on 4Runner. Trail Ready 4Runner is synonymous with rugged capability. In its latest form, 4Runner continues to add increased capability to an already incredible legacy. The newly available Stabilizer Bar Disconnect Mechanism increases suspension articulation at the push of a button. This feature allows the vehicle to flex while helping keep tires in contact with the trail. 4Runner raises the bar in another area with up to 32-degree approach and 24-degree departure angles. The available Multi-Terrain Monitor system aids the driver allowing them to see potential hazards on the center display. 4Runner will be offered in 2WD, part-time 4WD or Full-time 4WD. 2WD models will feature an automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD), and four-wheel-drive models have an electronically controlled two-speed transfer case with high/low range along with Active Traction Control (A-TRAC) and an automatic limited-slip differential (Auto LSD). An electronic locking rear differential is standard on TRD Off-Road, TRD Pro and Trailhunter grades. The Limited is offered with an available a full-time four-wheel-drive system with a center locking differential on i-FORCE MAX models, while this setup is standard on Platinum grades. The Multi-Terrain Select system now functions in both 4WD-High and 4WD-Low. This offers adjustable settings to help control wheel spin on a variety of terrain such as Mud, Dirt, and Sand. 4Runner also adopts the new, quieter CRAWL Control function that acts as a low-speed, off-road cruise control that allows the driver to focus on steering. When traction is extremely limited, the available electronically activated locking rear differential can help split power 50/50 to the rear wheels. Downhill Assist Control is another off-road feature available and helps the driver navigate descents by limiting the speed of the vehicle. A Grade for Everyone 4Runner expands its grade offering to provide customers with more choices than ever before. Nine grades are available including SR5, TRD Sport, TRD Sport Premium, TRD Off Road, TRD Off Road Premium, Limited, Platinum, TRD Pro, and Trailhunter. The Trailhunter grade has been added to the line up to allow owners to go further. 4Runner's capability and durability have made it a fan favorite of overlanders, and now adventure seekers have a turnkey solution with a manufacturer-developed overland rig straight from the factory. Toyota collaborated with a number of off-road component companies to make the fit and finish that much better. For example, the Trailhunter will feature ARB's Old Man Emu (OME) 2.5-inch forged shocks with rear external piggyback remote reservoirs, along with a uniquely co-designed ARB Roof Rack. The OME shocks along with the 33-inch Toyo Open Country A/T tires boost up Trailhunter an additional two inches in the front and one and a half inches in the rear. A standard low-profile high-mount air intake sources cleaner air for the standard i-FORCE MAX powertrain. Trailhunter adds protection that includes rock rails and high strength steel skid plates for serious off-the-grid-adventure capabilities. The Trailhunter is also equipped with a heritage grill with bronze ""TOYOTA"" lettering and an integrated 20-inch LED light bar that is complemented by color selectable RIGID LED fog lamps. A seriously powerful 2400W AC inverter provides juice to two locations in the cabin and the rear cargo area. Trailhunter is ready for customization with other Toyota accessory offerings using three easy to reach auxiliary switches that are pre-wired throughout the vehicle. The 2025 4Runner introduces its first-ever Platinum grade which offers customers a high-end, luxury experience with all the capability you expect in a 4Runner. Platinum slots above the Limited grade by adding unique black exterior styling elements, heated second-row seats, a standard tow tech package, Head-Up Display and automatic rain sensing wipers. Latest Tech 4Runner receives Toyota's latest technology with new screens.

A 7-inch gauge cluster is standard on lower grades and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster is standard on higher grades. Smart Key System with push-button start is standard on all grades. With an active Remote Connect trial or subscription, an available Digital Key on select grades connects with compatible smartphones to allow vehicle entry, and vehicle starting (4G network dependent). The Digital Key can also be remotely shared with others to give more control over vehicle access rather than giving someone the physical key. Rugged Choice The all-new youthful and dynamic 4Runner nicely rounds out Toyota's rugged lineup of tough body-on-frame vehicles. From the full-size Tundra to the iconic off-road legend Land Cruiser, customers now have five fresh trucks to choose from. These vehicles give customers more choice when it comes to finding a vehicle that can keep up with their dynamic lifestyles. They are designed to handle almost anything the elements throw their way, and their incredible capability gives owners the tools they need to get out and discover all the hidden wonders the world has to offer. Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 Standard All 2025 4Runner models come standard with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, Toyota's suite of active safety and convenience systems. This suite of features includes: Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise ControlLane Tracing AssistRoad Sign AssistAutomatic High BeamsProactive Driving Assist Proactive Driving Assist is now a part of Toyota Safety Sense. Proactive Driving Assist (PDA) uses the vehicle's camera and radar, when system operating conditions are met, to provide gentle braking and/or steering to support driving tasks such as distance control between your vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist. PDA can also provide gentle braking into curves. Proactive Driving Assist is not a substitute for the Pre-Collision System and operates in different circumstances. Including the addition of Proactive Driving Assist, the Toyota Safety Sense features have been enhanced for TSS 3.0: The Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection has enhanced detection capabilities thanks to new system sensors. It receives enhanced intersection support with improved detection capability in certain circumstances. In addition to pedestrian and bicyclist detection, this system now includes the capability to detect a motorcyclist. Lane Departure Alert will now provide Steering Assist as well as enhanced lane recognition that includes detection of certain 3D objects, like guardrails, that may be used to help define the lane. Dynamic Radar Cruise Control will have Full-Speed Range capability and adds a fourth following distance setting, from the previously available three. Enhanced vehicle detection allows for the ability to detect more than one preceding vehicle, as well as vehicles in adjacent lanes. This helps the system to provide smoother, more natural speed adjustments, especially when the driver changes lanes.Lane Tracing Assist requires Dynamic Radar Cruise Control to be enabled for it to function. The system requires detectable lane markings in order to function. Like Lane Departure Alert, lane recognition is enhanced over prior TSS generations. In addition to lane centering, this system also helps provide more space between vehicles being passed in adjacent lanes. It works by offsetting the vehicles' driving path with minor steering adjustments while keeping the vehicle within its lane.An Emergency Driving Stop System is a new function of Lane Tracing Assist. It's designed to monitor the driver's inputs, such as steering operation, to determine if they're inattentive or non-responsive, such as during a medical emergency. This feature is designed to bring the vehicle to a stop if the driver doesn't respond to alerts to take control.Road Sign Assist is designed to detect speed limit signs, stop signs, Do Not Enter signs, yield signs, and certain warning signs, and display an icon of the sign on the Multi-Information Display (MID). In addition to TSS 3.0, other available features include Blind Spot Monitor (BSM), which is designed to help detect and warn you of vehicles approaching or positioned in the adjacent lanes and Rear Cross-Traffic Alert (RCTA) for added peace of mind by helping to detect vehicles approaching from either side while backing out and alerting you with a visual and audible warning. Hill Start Assist Control (HAC) also comes standard. Beyond Zero Vision As part of Toyota's diverse portfolio approach toward a carbon-neutral future, 4Runner is the latest hybrid offering in the lineup to wear the Beyond Zero badge. Very soon, Toyota will offer 19 electrified vehicles for customers to choose from. With the additions of Land Cruiser and Tacoma, Toyota will offer 15 hybrid models, two plug-in hybrid models, the bZ4X battery electric vehicle (BEV), and the zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell Mirai, Toyota provides more choices than any other automaker for customers to reduce their carbon footprint. Limited Warranty Toyota's 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover the powertrain for 60,000 miles and against perforation from corrosion for 60 months with no mileage limitation. Hybrid-related components that require repairs needed to correct defects in materials or workmanship are covered for 8 years/100,000 miles, whichever comes first from original date of first use when sold as new. The hybrid battery is covered for 10 years/150,000 miles, whichever comes first, and is transferable across ownership. The 2025 4Runner also comes with ToyotaCare, a plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance, for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first, and 2 years, unlimited mileage of Roadside Assistance.

Tims China Surpasses 20 Million Loyalty Club Members,2024-04-10T02:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"TH International  (Nasdaq: THCH) achieved a significant milestone by surpassing 20 million registered loyalty club members, marking a key driver of growth.

The CEO highlighted the company's recent achievements, including store openings and city expansions, attributing the success to customer support and commitment to excellent guest experiences. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by TH International Limited, operating as Tims China, regarding their loyalty club membership reaching 20 million is a significant indicator of customer engagement and potential for increased revenue streams. Loyalty programs are known to enhance customer retention and average spend per visit, as members are often incentivized through discounts, rewards and personalized marketing. The fact that Tims China has added 7 million new members within a year suggests a robust growth trajectory and a successful marketing strategy.From a market research perspective, the key to the success of such programs lies in the data they gather. This data can be leveraged to tailor product offerings, improve customer service and optimize supply chain management. For investors, the growth in loyalty club members could signal future revenue growth, assuming Tims China can effectively convert membership engagement into increased sales. However, the cost of maintaining the loyalty program and the impact on profit margins should be considered. Companies often face the challenge of balancing the cost of rewards and discounts against the incremental revenue generated by loyal customers. Consumer Behavior Specialist Reaching a 20 million member milestone in a loyalty program reflects not just a quantitative measure, but also qualitative aspects of consumer behavior. It indicates a strong brand affinity and suggests that Tims China's market penetration strategies are resonating with the Chinese consumer base. The timing of this achievement, around the fifth anniversary and the opening of the 900th store, is also indicative of successful promotional campaigns and brand visibility efforts.For businesses like Tims China, which operate in the competitive food and beverage sector, customer loyalty is a valuable asset. It can lead to word-of-mouth marketing and organic growth through social proof. The increase in membership may also reflect broader consumer trends in China, such as a growing middle class with disposable income and a cultural shift towards Western-style coffee shops. Investors should monitor how Tims China capitalizes on this momentum to sustain growth, especially as the novelty of the brand could wear off and the loyalty program's effectiveness may plateau or decline without continuous innovation. Financial Analyst The milestone achieved by Tims China can be seen as a leading indicator for potential future financial performance. With 20 million members now part of their loyalty program, there is a large base of customers that could potentially contribute to recurring revenue. It's important to analyze the incremental revenue per member and the retention rates to understand the financial impact better. High retention and spend rates among members would be a positive sign for investors.However, investors should remain cautious and seek to understand the financial implications of loyalty programs in detail. The costs associated with acquiring and retaining loyalty club members, including marketing and promotional expenses, should not be overlooked. Investors should also consider the broader economic context in China, including consumer spending trends and competitive dynamics, as these will influence Tims China's ability to monetize its loyalty club membership effectively. 04/09/2024 - 10:05 PM SHANGHAI, China and NEW YORK, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TH International Limited (“Tims China” (Nasdaq: THCH)), the exclusive operator of Tim Hortons coffee shops and Popeyes restaurants in China, surpassed 20 million registered loyalty club members on March 31, 2024.

The Secured Notes will bear interest at 6.000% per annum, while the Unsecured Notes will bear interest at 6.875% per annum. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including refinancing outstanding debt and paying related fees and expenses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Vistra Corp. regarding its dual offering of senior secured and unsecured notes is a strategic financial move. The differentiation in security and pricing between the two offerings reflects the company's approach to capital structure optimization. The interest rates of 6.000% for the secured notes and 6.875% for the unsecured notes are indicative of the risk premium investors demand for unsecured debt. The decision to use proceeds for refinancing existing debt and general corporate purposes suggests a proactive approach to managing the company's debt profile, particularly in light of the upcoming 2024 debt maturities.Investors should note the conditional nature of the collateral release on the secured notes, which hinges on obtaining an investment grade rating. This could potentially affect the risk assessment of the secured notes. The company's ability to secure first-priority interest in collateral under the Credit Agreement provides a layer of security for investors, but it also emphasizes the need to monitor the creditworthiness of Vistra Corp. closely. Debt Market Analyst The pricing of Vistra Corp.'s notes close to their face value, especially the unsecured notes at 100%, suggests a favorable market reception to the company's credit story. The private offering nature, targeting qualified institutional buyers, aligns with the regulatory compliance under Rule 144A and Regulation S, which is standard for such transactions. However, the lack of public registration could limit the liquidity of these notes, which is a factor for investors to consider.Moreover, the guarantee by certain subsidiaries and the conditionality of the collateral securing the secured notes offer insights into the company's structural subordination risks. Investors in the unsecured notes, in particular, should be aware of their position in the capital hierarchy, as they would be secondary to secured creditors in the event of a default. Corporate Finance Expert The strategic use of proceeds from the offering by Vistra Corp. to address upcoming debt maturities in 2024 indicates a forward-looking management of the company's financial obligations. This move is likely to be viewed positively by the market as it demonstrates prudent financial planning and a commitment to maintaining a healthy balance sheet. The dual offering also provides the company with flexibility in its capital allocation, which could be beneficial for pursuing growth opportunities or other investments that could enhance shareholder value in the long term.However, it's important to consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and market conditions, which can influence the cost of capital and the demand for such debt instruments. The chosen interest rates might reflect the current market environment and investor sentiment towards the energy sector and Vistra Corp.'s specific risk profile. 04/09/2024 - 11:14 PM IRVING, Texas, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Vistra Corp.

The partnership aims to deliver exceptional gaming experiences to players across platforms and markets. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The announcement of Blizzard Entertainment's video game titles returning to mainland China represents a strategic move with significant implications for the gaming industry. The partnership between Blizzard, Microsoft Gaming and NetEase indicates a concerted effort to penetrate the Chinese market, which is one of the largest in the world for video games. The re-entry of these games could lead to a substantial increase in revenue for all companies involved, considering the previous popularity of titles like World of Warcraft and Hearthstone among Chinese players.Moreover, the collaboration to explore bringing new NetEase titles to Xbox could diversify the gaming experiences available on Microsoft's platform, potentially attracting a broader audience. This move may also be indicative of Microsoft's strategy to enhance its presence in the Chinese market, where console gaming is growing but still lags behind mobile and PC gaming. The long-term implications could include increased market share and brand loyalty within this demographic. Gaming Industry Analyst The renewal of the publishing agreement between Blizzard and NetEase, covering popular franchises such as the Warcraft, Overwatch, Diablo and StarCraft universes, highlights the enduring appeal of these intellectual properties. The strategic partnership leverages the strengths of both companies: Blizzard's strong IP and game development expertise and NetEase's local market knowledge and distribution network. The return of these games could also lead to a resurgence of esports and related industries in China.It's important to note, however, that the gaming industry in China is subject to stringent regulatory environments and the success of this partnership will depend on navigating these challenges effectively. The companies' ability to comply with local regulations and adapt to the preferences of Chinese gamers will be critical in realizing the full potential of this venture. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the partnership between Blizzard, Microsoft Gaming and NetEase is likely to have a positive impact on the earnings of all companies involved. The previous absence of Blizzard's titles in China may have created pent-up demand, which could translate into strong sales upon their return. Investors should monitor the uptake of these games post-launch as an indicator of the partnership's success.Additionally, the deal to bring new NetEase titles to Xbox consoles could open up revenue streams for Microsoft in the form of licensing fees, game sales and subscription services. This diversification is particularly beneficial for Microsoft as it seeks to expand its gaming ecosystem globally. The financial health of NetEase, as reflected in its stock performance on NASDAQ and HKEX, may also see a positive trajectory as a result of these developments. 04/09/2024 - 09:00 PM Blizzard titles to return to mainland China beginning summer 2024 Microsoft Gaming and NetEase deepen their relationship, with a strategic partnership based on their shared desire to bring new gaming experiences to players across platforms and markets IRVINE, Calif. & REDMOND, Wash. & HANGZHOU, China--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Beloved video game titles from Blizzard Entertainment that captivated millions of players in China will return to the market sequentially, beginning this summer, under a renewed publishing deal Blizzard Entertainment, Microsoft Gaming, and NetEase (NASDAQ: NTES and HKEX: 9999) announced today.

Positive Successful preliminary testing results for Aquanaut Mk2 vehicle Revenue of $6.6 million for full year 2023 Reorganization of operations and focus on revenue-producing products Reduction in G&A costs and engagement with early adopter customers Leadership updates to guide the company in commercial development Negative Net loss of $50.7 million for full year 2023 Significant increase in operating expenses Impairment charge of $25.3 million in Q4 2023 Adjusted net loss of $34.4 million for 2023 Market Research Analyst Observing the significant operational changes and strategic shifts made by Nauticus Robotics, Inc., there are several key factors that could influence the company's market positioning and investor sentiment. The reorganization to focus on four main products is a strategic move to streamline operations and potentially increase revenue efficiency. This pivot could attract attention from investors interested in companies that are actively adapting to market demands. The successful testing of the Aquanaut Mk2 vehicle is a technological milestone that may enhance the company's reputation as an innovator in autonomous underwater technology.The reduction in G&A costs projected for 2024 reflects a strong commitment to cost management, which may improve the company's financial health over time. However, the significant net loss reported for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2023, along with the impairment charge, raises concerns about the company's current profitability and the sustainability of its growth strategy. The restructuring of private warrants and additional financing indicate efforts to stabilize the balance sheet, yet the company's low cash reserves as of December 31, 2023, could be a red flag for potential liquidity issues in the near term. Financial Analyst The financial results released by Nauticus Robotics, Inc. show a concerning trend with an increased net loss year-over-year and a substantial impairment charge, which suggests that previous investments have not yielded the expected value. The revenue decline from the previous year also indicates that the company may be facing challenges in commercializing its products or facing competitive pressures. The adjusted net loss provides a more normalized view of the company's financial performance, excluding one-time charges, but even this metric shows a deterioration from the prior year.Investors should carefully consider the company's long-term financial viability, given the sharp decrease in cash and cash equivalents from 2022 to 2023. While the additional financing secured may provide a temporary cushion, the company's ability to generate positive cash flow from operations will be critical for sustained growth. The expected reduction in G&A costs could be a positive step, but it remains to be seen how these cost-saving measures will affect the company's operational capabilities and growth prospects. Legal Expert The successful completion of Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) contracts and the expectation of certificates of successful completion could be indicative of Nauticus' capabilities in meeting government contract requirements, which may open doors for future defense-related opportunities. From a legal and compliance standpoint, the addition of a seasoned legal executive as General Counsel is a strategic move that could strengthen the company's ability to navigate complex regulatory environments, especially in the defense sector where contracts can be subject to rigorous oversight.However, the impairment charge for property, plant and equipment must be scrutinized for compliance with financial reporting standards. Such a charge can significantly affect a company's reported assets and equity and it is essential for investors to understand the reasons behind this write-down. The legal team's role in ensuring transparent and accurate financial disclosures is important for maintaining investor trust and avoiding potential legal ramifications. 04/09/2024 - 08:50 PM HOUSTON, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nauticus Robotics, Inc. (""Nauticus"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: KITT) today announced preliminary testing results for its Aquanaut Mk2 vehicle and financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023.

Items excluded are those which the Company believes affect the comparability of operating results and are typically excluded from published estimates by the investment community, including items whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated or are non-recurring. Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented because management believes it provides useful additional information to investors for analysis of the Company's fundamental business on a recurring basis. In addition, management believes that adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies such as Nauticus. Adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss attributable to common stockholders or any other measure of a company's financial performance or profitability presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the differences between net loss attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders is presented below. Because adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders excludes some, but not all, items that affect net loss attributable to common stockholders and may vary among companies, our calculation of adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

(“Antibe” or the “Company”) (TSX: ATE, OTCQX: ATBPF) announced that its previously announced application for an Initial Order under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the ""CCAA""), has been granted by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the ""Court""). Pursuant to the Initial Order, the Company has obtained protection from its creditors for an initial period expiring April 18, 2024 (the ""Stay Period""), the maximum permitted under the CCAA.

While under CCAA protection, management of the Company will remain responsible for the day-to-day operation of the Company under the general oversight of the Monitor and supervision of the Court.

"Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces Month-End Assets Under Management",2024-04-10T00:32:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton) reported a rise in assets under management (AUM) to $1.64 trillion at March 31, 2024, driven by positive markets and net inflows, including funds from Great-West Lifeco. The AUM increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $6.9 billion, with notable contributions from equity and fixed income classes. However, a redemption of $2.0 billion from a fixed income institutional client partially offset the gains.","Franklin Resources, Inc. Announces Month-End Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Franklin Resources, Inc.

The AUM increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was $6.9 billion, with notable contributions from equity and fixed income classes. However, a redemption of $2.0 billion from a fixed income institutional client partially offset the gains. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) by Franklin Templeton signifies a positive trajectory for the firm, indicative of investor confidence and market growth. The month-over-month rise from $1.62 trillion to $1.64 trillion, although modest, is a reflection of the firm's ability to attract long-term net inflows and benefit from favorable market conditions. Particularly noteworthy is the inclusion of $8.1 billion from Great-West Lifeco, which suggests strategic partnerships or acquisitions that could enhance Franklin Templeton's market position.Examining the asset class breakdown, the equity class saw a significant jump compared to the previous quarter, which could imply a shift in investor sentiment towards riskier assets, possibly driven by a bullish market outlook. However, the fixed income space experienced a redemption of $2.0 billion, which might highlight a need for portfolio rebalancing or a shift in investor preference due to changing interest rates or credit conditions.For stakeholders, the short-term benefits include the potential for increased dividends and share value appreciation. In the long term, sustained growth in AUM could result in economies of scale and enhanced competitive positioning. However, the reliance on market performance and potential volatility must be noted as a risk factor. Market Research Analyst The data presented by Franklin Templeton offers insights into broader market trends. The increase in AUM, particularly in equities, aligns with a broader market recovery or a risk-on environment. This uptrend may encourage other investment firms to adjust their strategies to capitalize on market momentum. Moreover, the multi-asset class growth suggests a diversification trend, possibly as a hedge against volatility.From a competitive standpoint, Franklin Templeton's performance could exert pressure on peers to demonstrate similar growth or strategic initiatives. The integration of Great-West Lifeco's assets is a strategic move that may prompt industry consolidation or partnerships as a growth strategy. It's essential to monitor how such consolidations could affect industry competition and client offerings.Investors should consider the implications of these trends on their portfolios, particularly the potential for Franklin Templeton to leverage its increased AUM for better fund performance and innovation in product offerings. 04/09/2024 - 08:32 PM SAN MATEO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Templeton) (NYSE: BEN) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $1.64 trillion at March 31, 2024, compared to $1.62 trillion at February 29, 2024.

Gatos Silver Reports Q1 2024 Production Results at Top End of Guidance,2024-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Gatos Silver, Inc. announced strong production results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 at its Cerro Los Gatos mine in Mexico. The company achieved record mill throughput, with silver equivalent production at the top end of guidance.

Exploration efforts for life extension opportunities beyond 2030 were also underway.","Gatos Silver Reports Q1 2024 Production Results at Top End of Guidance Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Gatos Silver, Inc. announced strong production results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 at its Cerro Los Gatos mine in Mexico. The company achieved record mill throughput, with silver equivalent production at the top end of guidance. Progress was made on mine debottlenecking and productivity improvements, aiming for sustained throughput rates of 3,500 tonnes per day. Exploration efforts for life extension opportunities beyond 2030 were also underway. Positive None. Negative None. Mining Industry Analyst The disclosed production results from Gatos Silver's CLG mine indicate a positive trend in operational efficiency, with an 11% increase in mill throughput compared to the previous year. This suggests an improved capacity for ore processing which is a critical factor in mining operations. The ability of the mine to sustain and potentially exceed the throughput rate of 3,500 tonnes per day could signify enhanced revenue streams and a better position in the market for Gatos Silver.Moreover, the company's focus on debottlenecking and productivity improvements is a strategic move that can lead to reduced operational costs and increased margins. This is particularly relevant to investors as cost efficiency directly impacts profitability. The life extension opportunities mentioned could also imply a longer-term potential for revenue generation, which is a critical aspect for long-term investors. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the consistent performance near the top end of the guidance range is a strong indicator of Gatos Silver's operational reliability. This reliability can translate into greater investor confidence and potentially a more stable stock performance. The slight decrease in silver production, contrasted with increases in zinc, lead and gold production, reveals a diversification in metal output which could serve as a hedge against silver price volatility.It's important to note that the use of different price assumptions for calculating silver equivalent production year-over-year could affect comparative analysis. The increase in calculated silver equivalent production using the 2024 price assumptions for the previous year's results demonstrates how sensitive these metrics are to fluctuations in commodity prices, which is a important consideration for investors with an interest in the resources sector. Market Research Analyst The mining sector is influenced heavily by global economic trends and commodity prices. Gatos Silver's increased production and throughput rates may position the company favorably in a competitive market. However, it is essential to monitor the market's supply-demand dynamics, as an increase in production could lead to an oversupply, potentially driving prices down if demand does not keep pace.Furthermore, Gatos Silver's progress in exploration efforts is an indicator of proactive management seeking to capitalize on the mine's full potential. The updated life of mine plan, expected in the third quarter, will provide valuable insights into the company's future prospects and could significantly influence the market's perception of its growth trajectory. 04/09/2024 - 08:00 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gatos Silver, Inc. (NYSE/TSX: GATO) (“Gatos Silver” or the “Company”) today announced production results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 at its 70%-owned Cerro Los Gatos (“CLG”) mine in Mexico. Dale Andres, CEO of Gatos Silver, commented: “The CLG mine delivered another strong quarter of operational results. Mill throughput for the quarter was more than 3,200 tonnes per day, an increase of 11% from the first quarter of 2023, and another quarterly record. Silver equivalent production for the quarter was at the top end of guidance with the higher throughput offsetting lower grades for silver, lead and gold as expected in the mine plan.” “We made good progress on mine debottlenecking and productivity improvements as we continue to advance towards our medium-term target to sustain throughput rates of 3,500 tonnes per day. We are also progressing our life extension opportunities beyond 2030, with an updated life of mine plan expected in the third quarter of 2024 and increased exploration efforts on near mine targets in the Los Gatos district during the quarter.” Production Results (100% basis) CLG comparative production highlights are summarized below: Three Months Ended March 31,CLG Production (100% Basis)20242023Tonnes milled (dmt)292,114260,428Tonnes milled per day (dmt)3,2102,894Feed Grades Silver (g/t)284329Zinc (%)3.993.93Lead (%)1.771.86Gold (g/t)0.280.30Contained Metal Silver ounces (millions)2.372.43Zinc pounds - in zinc conc.

For 2023, silver equivalent production was calculated using prices of $22/oz silver, $1.20/lb zinc, $0.90/lb lead and $1,700/oz gold. For comparative purposes, the calculated silver equivalent production for the three months ended March 31, 2023 would be 3.64 million ounces using price assumptions for 2024. Mill throughput averaged 3,210 tonnes per day during the first quarter of 2024, which was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, and was 11% higher than the first quarter of 2023. In March, mill throughput averaged 3,360 tonnes per day which was the best monthly performance on record. Silver equivalent1 production for the first quarter of 2024 was 3.70 million ounces, similar to the first quarter of 2023 and tracking to the top end of the previously disclosed 2024 guidance range of 13.5 million ounces to 15.0 million ounces. Higher than anticipated silver grades, combined with the mill throughput rates noted above, contributed to the strong production level compared with guidance for the first quarter of 2024. Silver production in the first quarter of 2024 was 2.37 million ounces, 2% lower than the first quarter of 2023. Zinc, lead and gold production increased by 13%, 7% and 1% respectively, compared with the first quarter of 2023. Increased mill throughput rates were the result of continued debottlenecking and optimization efforts focused on achieving higher mining rates through increased productivity and improved mine plan flexibility. Higher milling rates were also a result of drawing down the surface stockpile during the quarter. Expectations were originally for a gradual increase in mill throughput and production through the year, but mill throughput in the first quarter was higher than anticipated. Our goal in the second quarter and remainder of the year is to sustain current mill throughput rates, although there may be potential to achieve additional increases with continued mine debottlenecking efforts.

Energy Sector Analyst The deployment of Itron's Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) by the Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB) is a forward step in enhancing the power distribution infrastructure in an emerging economy. The introduction of 500,000 smart pre-payment metering devices signifies a considerable scale of operations, which can lead to operational efficiencies and reduction in system losses. These smart meters are anticipated to provide BREB with real-time data, enabling improved billing accuracy and the facilitation of time-of-use tariffs. This can translate into financial benefits for both the utility provider and the consumers by promoting cost-effective energy consumption.From an investment perspective, the enhanced customer service and the potential for seamless integration of renewable energy sources could lead to a stronger competitive advantage for Itron in the region. The ability to optimize infrastructure investments and improve outage management through advanced data analytics is likely to be a key driver in the utility sector's evolution, potentially impacting Itron's market share and revenue growth in the long term. Sustainability Consultant With the global push towards sustainability, the project between BREB and Itron aligns with the broader trend of modernizing energy systems to support sustainable development. The emphasis on smart energy consumption and customer empowerment through detailed energy usage information accessed via a web portal is a strategic move to encourage energy conservation and efficiency. This initiative is particularly significant in a country like Bangladesh, where energy demand outpaces supply, leading to frequent load shedding.The integration of Itron's AMI solution with smart home devices and renewable energy sources is a testament to the growing intersection of technology and sustainability. This could set a precedent for other utilities in similar markets, potentially expanding the market for advanced metering solutions. The project's success could act as a case study for other developing nations looking to upgrade their energy infrastructure, which in turn could influence Itron's stock performance as the company positions itself as a leader in smart grid technology for emerging markets. Market Research Analyst The strategic partnership between Itron and BREB, facilitated by SQ Wire and Cable Co. Limited, is indicative of the increasing demand for technological solutions in the energy sector within South Asia. The implementation of a comprehensive AMI solution, including UtilityIQ headend software, suggests that Itron is not only supplying hardware but also providing a software suite for data management and analysis, which adds a layer of recurring revenue through software services.It is important to note the potential for scalability of this project. Starting with half a million units, there's a possibility for future expansion, which could significantly impact Itron's earnings. Additionally, dedicated services such as network design and deployment support could result in long-term customer relationships and service contracts, further stabilizing Itron's revenue streams. Investors should monitor the execution of this project, as its successful implementation could lead to similar contracts in other regions, potentially boosting Itron's stock value. 04/09/2024 - 08:00 PM Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board to Deploy Itron Solution to Improve Operational Efficiency and Customer Service LIBERTY LAKE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Itron, Inc.

"MGM Resorts International Announces Closing of Offering of $750,000,000 Senior Notes due 2032",2024-04-09T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"MGM Resorts International completes $750 million senior notes offering to repay existing debt, providing financial flexibility for future investments.","MGM Resorts International Announces Closing of Offering of $750,000,000 Senior Notes due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary MGM Resorts International completes $750 million senior notes offering to repay existing debt, providing financial flexibility for future investments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst MGM Resorts International's completion of a $750 million senior notes offering at a 6.500% interest rate, maturing in 2032, is a significant financial move. It's noteworthy that the company opted to issue these notes at par, which means they were sold at their face value. This could suggest confidence in the market's perception of MGM's creditworthiness, as notes issued at a discount could indicate investor skepticism regarding the issuer's ability to honor its debt obligations.From a financial strategy perspective, using the proceeds to repay higher-interest debt maturing in 2025 is a prudent approach. It effectively reduces the interest burden and extends the maturity of the debt profile. This could improve MGM's interest coverage ratio and potentially its credit ratings. The impact on the stock market could be positive, as investors often view debt refinancing at lower interest rates as a sign of financial health and strategic management.However, investors should also be aware of the leverage level post-transaction. If the company's leverage increases significantly, it could offset the benefits of lower interest payments with higher overall risk. Debt Market Analyst The issuance of 6.500% senior notes by MGM Resorts International is a tactical maneuver in the debt market. It's important to assess the yield compared to current market rates for similar maturities and credit ratings. If the yield is competitive, it suggests that MGM was able to secure financing without having to offer a premium, which is a positive signal for its creditworthiness.Moreover, the fact that these notes are senior means they have priority over other debts in case of liquidation, which could make them more attractive to conservative investors. This could have a stabilizing effect on the company's stock as it reassures shareholders about MGM's risk management practices.Investors should keep an eye on MGM's future earnings and cash flows to ensure that the company can comfortably meet its interest payments without compromising its operational capabilities or growth prospects. Risk Management Consultant The decision by MGM Resorts International to refinance its existing debt by issuing new senior notes is a classic example of proactive risk management. By locking in a lower interest rate for a longer period, the company is hedging against potential future interest rate hikes. Given the volatility in interest rates, this move could save the company millions in interest expenses over the life of the notes.For stakeholders, this is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it indicates that management is taking steps to ensure long-term financial stability. On the other hand, the new debt issuance increases the company's total debt load, which could be a concern if the company's revenue streams are not robust enough to handle the additional debt service requirements.It is also essential to monitor the use of short-term investments for the net proceeds. While these are typically low-risk, they must be managed to ensure liquidity needs are met without sacrificing potential returns. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM LAS VEGAS, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MGM Resorts International (the ""Company"") (NYSE: MGM) today announced that it has completed its previously announced issuance (the ""Offering"") of $750,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due 2032 (the ""Notes""), which were issued at par. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to repay existing indebtedness, including its outstanding 6.750% senior notes due 2025.

Announces March 31, 2024 Assets Under Management Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Invesco (IVZ) reported a 2.0% increase in assets under management (AUM) to $1,662.7 billion, with net long-term inflows of $2.8 billion. The firm saw positive market returns adding $29 billion to AUM, while FX movements and money market outflows slightly impacted AUM. Preliminary average total AUM for the quarter was $1,613.0 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) by Invesco Ltd. is a positive indicator of the firm's growth trajectory. A rise in AUM typically suggests an enhanced capability to generate fee revenue, which is a critical component of an asset management firm's profitability. The net long-term inflows indicate strong investor confidence and could be a sign of effective fund management and marketing strategies.However, it is essential to note the impact of market movements on the AUM. A significant portion of the AUM growth is attributed to favorable market returns, which are external factors beyond the company's control. This reliance on market performance introduces volatility and potential risks for future AUM stability. Additionally, the money market outflows require scrutiny as they may signal a shift in investor preference or a response to changing interest rates.The foreign exchange movements present both challenges and opportunities. While FX reduced AUM this month, companies that actively manage their currency exposure can mitigate such risks. Investors should monitor Invesco's capability in this area as it can influence AUM and profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Invesco's AUM distribution across various asset classes reflects broader industry trends. The substantial equity holdings align with a common investor preference for stocks in a bullish market. The fixed income and alternatives categories also show resilience, which may appeal to investors seeking diversification and risk management.Comparing the active versus passive AUM, Invesco's strategy appears to be balanced, catering to both active investors seeking alpha and those preferring passive index-based investments. The growth in passive AUM is consistent with the industry shift towards lower-cost, index-tracking products. Observing the changes in AUM across different categories over the recent months provides insights into investor sentiment and market trends, which are important for tailoring future product offerings and marketing strategies. Economist The data provided by Invesco offers a microcosm of the economic environment in which the asset management industry operates. Increased AUM, particularly from net inflows, can be a proxy for economic confidence, as investors are more likely to allocate capital to managed funds when they anticipate positive market conditions. Conversely, the outflows from money markets might reflect a change in liquidity preferences, possibly due to interest rate expectations or economic forecasts.The impact of foreign exchange movements on AUM also highlights the interconnectedness of global financial markets. It underscores the importance for asset managers to have robust strategies to hedge against currency risks, especially in a volatile FX environment. Long-term, the ability to manage these external factors effectively will be important for maintaining AUM growth and ensuring stable revenue streams. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM ATLANTA, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $1,662.7 billion, an increase of 2.0% versus previous month-end. The firm delivered net long-term inflows of $2.8 billion in the month. Non-management fee earning net inflows were $1.8 billion and money market net outflows were $1.5 billion. AUM was positively impacted by favorable market returns which increased AUM by $29 billion. FX movements in the month reduced AUM by $1.1 billion which was partially offset by reinvested distributions of $0.9 billion.

The company also prepaid $50 million of its Term Loan due 2025, expecting annual interest savings of $6 million. The CFO highlighted the strengthened balance sheet and improved free cash flow conversion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent repricing of Cushman & Wakefield's Term Loan is a strategic financial maneuver that indicates a proactive approach to debt management. By reducing the interest rate by 25 basis points, the company stands to benefit from a decrease in its cost of capital. This move is reflective of a favorable credit market and the company's ability to negotiate better terms, potentially due to strong financial performance or improved credit profile.For stakeholders, the immediate benefit is the annual cash interest expense savings of approximately $6 million. Over the long-term, this could lead to improved net income figures and stronger financial ratios, which are critical in evaluating a company's financial health. However, investors should also consider the broader market conditions that enabled this repricing. A shift in interest rates or credit market liquidity could impact future debt refinancing opportunities. Debt Market Analyst Examining the Term Loan repricing from a debt market perspective, the 25 basis point reduction after the initial issuance in August 2023 suggests that Cushman & Wakefield has taken advantage of the current low interest rate environment. This aligns with industry trends where companies with solid balance sheets are refinancing to lock in lower rates.The strong market demand and lender support mentioned by the CFO underscore a positive reception from the debt market, which often translates to a vote of confidence in the company's future prospects. However, it's important for investors to keep an eye on the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios post-repricing to ensure that the debt remains sustainable. Corporate Strategy Analyst From a strategic standpoint, the decision to prepay $50 million of the Term Loan due in 2025 demonstrates Cushman & Wakefield's commitment to reducing its debt burden and optimizing its capital structure. This proactive approach to debt management can be seen as part of a larger strategic initiative to improve free cash flow conversion and increase financial flexibility.By improving its balance sheet, the company may be positioning itself for future growth initiatives or to weather potential economic downturns. The CFO's comments on executing strategic priorities suggest an alignment of financial management with long-term business goals. Investors should monitor how these savings are allocated, whether toward investment in growth opportunities or further debt reduction, as this will impact the company's trajectory. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cushman & Wakefield (NYSE: CWK) today announced that it has successfully completed a repricing of $1.0 billion of its Term Loan (“Term Loan”) due 2030.

Negative None. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM UPLAND, Calif., April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nature's Miracle Holding Inc. (NASDAQ: NMHI) (""Nature's Miracle"" or the ""Company""), a leader in vertical farming technology and infrastructure, has engaged international investor relations specialists MZ Group (MZ) to lead a comprehensive strategic investor relations and financial communications program.

MZ Group will work closely with Nature's Miracle's seasoned public company management team to develop and implement a comprehensive capital markets strategy designed to increase the company's visibility throughout the investment community. The campaign will highlight Nature's Miracle as a one-stop provider of equipment and services to Controlled Environment Agriculture (""CEA"") customers in North America, which includes the vertical farming sector and the indoor cultivation of an ever-increasing range of specialty crops for a range of applications from food to health.

Shannon Devine commented: ""As the Company makes its public Company debut, we look forward to partnering with the senior leadership team during this pivotal time. We continue to see positive momentum for the CEA industry, which brings agriculture inside with a technology-based approach towards cultivating crops under optimal growing conditions. Compared to traditional farming, CEA requires 90% less water and yields up to 30x more over the same land area. Indoor approaches to agriculture are becoming increasingly important due to global water shortages, high energy costs and geopolitical conflicts. CEA is also expanding due to growing consumer demand for low-environmental-impact food, local food systems, and improved accessibility to high-quality produce with a shorter supply chain. Maximize Market Research recently reported that the global commercial greenhouse market was valued at $50 billion in 2021 and projected to reach $76 billion by 2030. Taken together, this creates an exciting opportunity, and we look forward to sharing Nature's Miracle with our network of institutional, family offices and retail investors."" Rory Rumore added: ""Nature's Miracle is addressing today's agricultural challenges with an integrated approach to products and solutions for the CEA market.

These systems significantly benefit the Company's customer base by reducing initial investment costs and are designed for efficiency through its all-in-one platforms for growers."" ""Nature's Miracle offers innovative products and technologies that deliver sustainable, high-yield farming solutions in both urban and traditional agricultural settings,"" said James Li, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nature's Miracle. ""We are strategically growing our footprint across the North American market with innovative products and solutions for indoor, greenhouse, hydroponic and vertical growers that will drive the next agricultural revolution. 2024 has been a milestone year, with our recent entrance to the public markets and growing the number of CEA customers.

(NYSE: ACA) completes the acquisition of Ameron Pole Products  for $180 million, expanding its infrastructure product offerings.

The acquisition aims to accelerate Arcosa's growth in Engineered Structures, supported by cash flow and strategic acquisitions.","Arcosa, Inc. Announces Completion of Ameron Acquisition Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Arcosa, Inc. (NYSE: ACA) completes the acquisition of Ameron Pole Products for $180 million, expanding its infrastructure product offerings. Ameron, a leading manufacturer of concrete and steel poles, had revenues of $94 million in 2023. The acquisition aims to accelerate Arcosa's growth in Engineered Structures, supported by cash flow and strategic acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Ameron Pole Products LLC by Arcosa, Inc. signifies a strategic move to diversify and expand their product line within the infrastructure sector. From a market research perspective, entering the concrete and steel pole lighting market could potentially open up new revenue streams and customer segments for Arcosa. The stated revenue of $94 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $20 million for Ameron suggests a healthy operating margin, which could be accretive to Arcosa's profitability.Moreover, the strategic locations of Ameron's manufacturing facilities could enhance Arcosa's distribution capabilities and provide a competitive advantage in terms of logistics and customer reach. The funding of the acquisition through cash and credit facilities indicates Arcosa's confidence in leveraging its balance sheet for growth. However, the increase in leverage could also raise the financial risk profile of the company if the integration does not yield the expected synergies. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the acquisition's price tag of $180 million needs to be scrutinized in relation to Ameron's financial performance. With revenues of approximately $94 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $20 million, the purchase price is roughly 1.9 times the revenue and 9 times the EBITDA. These multiples need to be compared with industry benchmarks to determine if the acquisition was made at a fair valuation.Investors should also be aware of the potential impact on Arcosa's future debt levels and interest obligations due to the $160 million borrowed from their revolving credit facility. The management's decision to update the full-year 2024 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance post-acquisition indicates a likely positive outlook, but the actual performance post-integration will be important in assessing the long-term value created by this deal. Legal Expert Legally, the involvement of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as a legal advisor to Arcosa suggests that the transaction has been thoroughly vetted for compliance with regulatory requirements. The use of non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, is a common practice to provide a clearer picture of a company's operating performance. However, it's important for stakeholders to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures to fully understand the implications of the acquisition's financial impact.It's also noteworthy that such acquisitions could be subject to post-closing adjustments and potential integration challenges that may arise. Stakeholders should monitor the integration process for any legal disputes or adjustments that could affect the final cost and benefits of the transaction. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM Expands Traffic and Telecommunication Structures Offerings Provides Entry into Complementary Concrete and Steel Pole Lighting Market Transaction Accelerates Engineered Structures Growth Profile DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Arcosa, Inc.

Trinseo Introduces Groundbreaking Flame-retardant Plastic Grades Without Using PFAS Additives During Manufacturing Process,2024-04-09T20:15:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Trinseo announces new flame-retardant resins without PFAS or halogenated additives to meet demand and regulatory pressures. The products offer high performance while reducing waste and carbon footprint, targeting consumer electronics and electrical industries.","Trinseo Introduces Groundbreaking Flame-retardant Plastic Grades Without Using PFAS Additives During Manufacturing Process Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Trinseo announces new flame-retardant resins without PFAS or halogenated additives to meet demand and regulatory pressures. The products offer high performance while reducing waste and carbon footprint, targeting consumer electronics and electrical industries. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The introduction of Trinseo's flame-retardant resins without PFAS or halogenated additives represents a significant advancement in environmental sustainability within the materials sector. By eliminating PFAS, which are environmentally persistent and pose health risks, Trinseo aligns with global efforts to phase out hazardous chemicals. The use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) substrates in these resins not only reduces reliance on virgin materials but also contributes to a circular economy model, which is increasingly demanded by both consumers and regulators.The UL94 ratings mentioned, V0 and V2, indicate the materials' resistance to flame, with V0 being the higher standard. This suggests that Trinseo's products do not compromise safety for sustainability. Moreover, the maintenance of performance characteristics such as high-temperature resistance and impact resistance ensures that these resins are likely to be adopted in the consumer electronics and electrical industries without loss of functionality. Market Research Analyst Trinseo's strategic move to introduce these innovative resins in the Asia-Pacific market is a calculated decision, considering the region's robust manufacturing base for consumer electronics and electrical products. The company is tapping into the growing demand for sustainable materials in a market that is both large and expanding. This could potentially lead to increased market share and revenue growth for Trinseo in the specialty materials segment.The emphasis on aesthetics, such as glossy and matte finishes, along with the technical features like superior impact resistance and UV resistance, positions these resins to meet diverse consumer preferences. This versatility may enhance the appeal of Trinseo's offerings to manufacturers looking for differentiated materials that can cater to a variety of product designs. Regulatory Compliance Expert Trinseo's proactive approach in developing resins devoid of PFAS and halogenated additives is a forward-thinking response to the tightening of regulatory standards globally. By anticipating and adapting to these changes, Trinseo potentially mitigates future risks associated with compliance and restrictions on hazardous substances. This strategic foresight can be a competitive advantage, as it may reduce the need for abrupt reformulations and allow for a smoother transition to safer alternatives within the industry.Furthermore, the inclusion of recycled content in these products could provide Trinseo with leverage in markets where regulations favor or mandate the use of sustainable materials. This could improve the company's standing with environmentally conscious stakeholders and regulatory bodies, potentially leading to preferential treatment or incentives. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM Facilitates waste reduction, carbon footprint reduction, and recyclability, without sacrificing performance Innovative resins address the increasing demand and regulatory pressures to reduce the use of PFASs, especially in the consumer electronics and electrical industries Trinseo will introduce flame-retardant PC and PC/ABS resins manufactured without the use of PFAS or halogenated additives (with options of recycled content) at CHINAPLAS 2024 Visit Trinseo at CHINAPLAS 2024: Booth F52, Hall 6.2, the National Exhibition and Convention Center (Shanghai) SHANGHAI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Trinseo (Trinseo, or the “Company”) (NYSE: TSE), a specialty material solutions provider, today announces its new offering of flame-retardant EMERGE™ PC 8600PV and 8600PR resins, as well as EMERGE™ PC/ABS 7360E65 resins, manufactured without the use of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or halogenated additives. Many PFAS chemicals are commonly used for their important flame-retardant properties, as well as their resistance to heat, oil, stain, grease, and water. These new products maintain those critical performance attributes while addressing the growing demand and regulatory pressures to reduce the use of PFASs, especially in the consumer electronics and electrical industries. These products will first be launched in the Asia-Pacific market, suitable for applications in a variety of fields such as IT equipment, electronic and electrical products, battery chargers, and voltage stabilizers. “Sustainable products are at the core of everything we do at Trinseo. By leveraging our extensive knowledge and technical expertise with PCR products, along with our deep insights into the consumer electronics and electrical industries, we are accelerating the development of products without the use of PFAS or halogenated additives. This is done in response to the market's required shift towards sustainably advantaged solutions,” said Han Hendriks, Trinseo’s Senior Vice President, Chief Technology Officer. Both EMERGE™ 8600PR and EMERGE™ 7360E65 use post-consumer recycled (PCR) substrates, while maintaining performance similar to that of virgin materials.

The offering consists of two tranches with different interest rates and maturity dates. The proceeds will be used for debt repayment and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Public Storage regarding the pricing of a public offering of $1.0 billion in senior notes is a strategic financial move. The dual-tranche structure, with one part being floating rate notes and the other fixed rate, gives the company flexibility in managing interest rate risk. The floating rate notes, pegged to Compounded SOFR plus 70 basis points, suggest a keen awareness of the current interest rate environment and a strategy to minimize interest expenses in the short term. On the other hand, the fixed rate tranche provides long-term capital at a predetermined cost, which is beneficial for budgeting and financial planning. The decision to use the proceeds to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, indicates a proactive approach to capital management and growth. This offering could signal to investors that management is confident about the company's financial health and its ability to service debt while continuing to expand its operations. However, investors should be mindful of the potential dilution of equity and the impact of increased debt levels on the company's balance sheet and credit ratings. Debt Market Analyst From a debt market perspective, the issuance of senior notes by Public Storage Operating Company, guaranteed by Public Storage, represents a significant move in the REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) sector. The issuance at par value for the floating rate notes and slightly below par for the fixed rate notes could be indicative of market confidence in the company's creditworthiness. The choice of Compounded SOFR as a benchmark for the floating rate notes aligns with the broader market transition away from LIBOR. Investors in the debt market should consider the long duration of the fixed rate notes, maturing in 2053, which carry duration risk in a changing interest rate environment. The offering's closing date, set for April 16, 2024, provides a clear timeline for the market to absorb this new debt. The involvement of major financial institutions such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley as joint book-running managers could enhance investor confidence in the offering. Real Estate Investment Analyst Public Storage's move to issue senior notes is noteworthy within the self-storage real estate sector, which has seen growing demand due to urbanization and downsizing trends. The company's intention to use the proceeds for acquisitions is indicative of an aggressive growth strategy, leveraging the current market conditions to expand its already substantial footprint in the self-storage industry. With interests in over 3,000 facilities in the US and a significant stake in Shurgard Self Storage in Europe, Public Storage is a major player with a diversified geographic presence. Investors should consider the potential for increased market share and revenue growth from these acquisitions. However, it is also important to monitor the company's debt levels and the performance of newly acquired assets to ensure that the growth strategy does not adversely affect the company's long-term profitability and financial stability. 04/09/2024 - 05:47 PM GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Public Storage (NYSE:PSA, the “Company”) announced today that the Company’s subsidiary, Public Storage Operating Company (“PSOC”), has priced a public offering of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the “Notes”). The Notes will be guaranteed by the Company. The Notes will be issued in two tranches with an initial weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.8%. The first tranche of $700 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due 2027 will bear interest at a rate equal to Compounded SOFR (as defined in the prospectus supplement relating to the offering), reset quarterly, plus 70 basis points, will be issued at 100.000% of par value and will mature on April 16, 2027 (the “floating rate notes”). We will pay interest on the floating rate notes quarterly on April 16, July 16, October 16 and January 16 of each year, commencing July 16, 2024. The second tranche of $300 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes due 2053 will bear interest at an annual rate of 5.350%, will be issued at 98.249% of par value and will mature on August 1, 2053 (the “2053 notes”). We will pay interest on the 2053 notes semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 2024. The 2053 notes constitute a further issuance of, and form a single series with, PSOC’s previously issued 5.350% Senior Notes due 2053, $600 million of which are currently outstanding. The offering is expected to close on April 16, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Company expects to use the net proceeds to repay our outstanding $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due 2024 and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of self-storage facilities and repayment of other debt.

Prices Public Offering of $30,000,000 of 8.50% Notes Due 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Great Elm Capital Corp. (GECC) announces the pricing of $30 million worth of 8.50% notes due 2029, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $28.6 million. The Notes can be redeemed from April 30, 2026, onwards, with additional over-allotment options. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Great Elm Capital Corp. regarding the pricing of its $30 million public offering of 8.50% notes due 2029 is a significant financial move that merits a closer examination. The interest rate of 8.50% is notably higher than the current average for corporate bonds, suggesting a premium to attract investors, potentially due to perceived risk or a higher than average market yield at the time of issuance.The net proceeds of approximately $28.6 million, after accounting for underwriting discounts and commissions, indicate a relatively standard cost of capital for such transactions. However, the true cost for the company will also include the ongoing interest payments until maturity, which investors should weigh against the intended use of proceeds for assessing the potential impact on the company's financial health and growth prospects.Moreover, the option for underwriters to purchase an additional $4.5 million in notes to cover over-allotments provides a cushion for the company, potentially reducing the risk of under-subscription. The flexibility for early redemption after 2026 also offers GECC the ability to refinance the debt should market conditions become more favorable, which is a common strategic move to manage long-term debt obligations and interest expenses. Market Research Analyst The fixed income market, where such notes are traded, is sensitive to interest rate trends and economic outlooks. An 8.50% yield could be attractive in a high-interest-rate environment, or it could signal investor skepticism about the company's prospects or the broader market's stability.For stakeholders, the key is to understand the demand for such a high-yield offering. If the offering is oversubscribed, it could indicate investor confidence in GECC's ability to manage its debt and generate sufficient returns. On the other hand, if the company struggles to attract investors, it might suggest market concerns about the company's future performance or creditworthiness.It's also important to consider the broader market implications of GECC's offering. If other companies follow suit with similar high-yield offerings, it could signal a shift in the market's risk tolerance or a search for higher returns amidst a potential rise in interest rates. This could have a ripple effect across the corporate bond market, influencing yields and the cost of capital for other issuers. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the structuring of the notes offering by GECC is fairly standard, with underwriting discounts and commissions as well as an over-allotment option being common features. The legal intricacies of such offerings include ensuring compliance with securities laws, which dictate the disclosure requirements and registration processes.The maturity date and the redemption options provided to GECC are also standard, yet they carry legal implications for both the company and the note holders. For instance, early redemption rights allow the company to manage its debt more actively, but also impose certain notice and procedural requirements that must be adhered to, failing which might lead to legal disputes.Investors should be aware of the covenants and conditions tied to the notes, as these will define their rights and the company's obligations. Such terms are important in assessing the legal protections afforded to investors, which can influence the perceived risk and, consequently, the demand for the notes. 04/09/2024 - 05:48 PM PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Elm Capital Corp.

The company aims to predict responders using their PPMP and develop a companion diagnostic test. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent announcement from Notable Labs regarding their Phase 2 trial of volasertib, in combination with decitabine, for relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, represents a significant step in precision oncology. The development of a flow-cytometry-based Predictive Precision Medicine Platform (PPMP) as a companion diagnostic tool is particularly intriguing. This platform has the potential to revolutionize how we approach treatment for AML by identifying which patients are more likely to respond to volasertib.From a clinical perspective, the ability to predict responders could lead to more personalized and effective treatment plans, potentially improving outcomes and reducing unnecessary exposure to ineffective treatments. This is particularly important in AML, a disease with a generally poor prognosis and a high need for more targeted therapies. The incorporation of a dose optimization strategy further emphasizes the commitment to patient tolerability and response, which is a critical consideration in oncology. The success of this trial could set a precedent for similar approaches in other cancer treatments, which is a promising prospect for the future of oncology. Medical Research Analyst The implications of Notable Labs' PPMP for the stock market and investors are multifaceted. Firstly, the development of a companion diagnostic test could create a new revenue stream for the company if the trial proves successful and the test is commercialized. Moreover, the positive outcomes from the proof-of-concept study using 41 primary AML samples suggest that the PPMP could have a high predictive value, which is encouraging for the ongoing Phase 2 trial.Investors should note, however, that the success of clinical trials is never guaranteed and the path from trial to treatment can be long and fraught with regulatory hurdles. Yet, if the PPMP-enabled Phase 2 trial demonstrates significant efficacy, it could lead to an increase in Notable Labs' market value, given the current demand for personalized medicine in oncology. Stakeholders should also consider the long-term potential of this technology to be applied to other cancers, which could further expand the company's market opportunities. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Notable Labs' presentation at AACR 2024 could have a positive impact on the perception of the company within the investment community. Showcasing their work at a prestigious conference like AACR enhances the company's visibility and credibility. This is important for maintaining investor confidence and can lead to increased interest from potential collaborators or acquirers in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries.It is essential for investors to monitor the progress of the trial and the subsequent adoption of the companion diagnostic test in clinical practice. The market for precision oncology is growing and Notable Labs is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend. The success of their PPMP could attract partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies looking to enhance their precision medicine portfolios, which would be a bullish sign for Notable's business prospects. 04/09/2024 - 05:15 PM Poster outlines the parameters for developing a flow-cytometry-based PPMP as a companion diagnostic to predict volasertib responders, based on a proof-of-concept study using 41 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples Plans to incorporate a dose optimization prelude to enhance patient response and tolerability also outlined in the poster FOSTER CITY, Calif., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Notable Labs, Ltd. (Nasdaq: NTBL) (“Notable” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing a new class of cancer therapies identified by its Predictive Precision Medicine Platform (PPMP), today presented the design for the PPMP-enabled Phase 2 trial with volasertib, in combination with decitabine, in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR 2024) being held in San Diego, CA (Poster abstract 5178). “We are very pleased to share more data regarding our clinical program and proprietary platform with the oncology community at AACR 2024. Presenting a summary of the Phase 2 volasertib study design in AML provides us with an opportunity to highlight the potential for the PPMP to effectively predict responders, and enroll an responder-enriched patient population, in our upcoming clinical program. Our clinical program will incorporate the co-development of a companion diagnostic test,” said Thomas Bock, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Notable. Joseph Wagner, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Notable, commented, “The abstract highlights technical features of volasertib on Notable’s PPMP, including our method to develop a companion diagnostic test and define a cut-off value to predict responders. Based on the robust results of a 41-sample proof-of-concept study summarized in the poster, we are optimistic about the potential for PPMP to improve patient selection and lead to a strong Phase 2 study. In addition, we look forward to implementing a dosing optimization plan, including standardized use of best supportive care and introduction of body surface area-based dosing, to enhance patient responses and tolerability.” Poster Highlights: Guided by a predictive ex vivo test: Bringing the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib back into the clinic for venetoclax-HMA relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients Overview: While prior studies of volasertib demonstrated an approximately 30% complete response/complete response with incomplete count recovery (CR/CRi) rate in de novo AML patients in combination with cytarabine, development was halted in part due to toxicity potentially related to the use of a flat dose, rather than patient-specific, body-surface area (BSA) dosing. Notable Labs provided an updated plan for the design of an open label Phase 2 study, including a dose optimization plan aimed at reducing toxicity while maintaining efficacy and an overview of study objectives and endpoints. As part of the study, a companion diagnostic assay to predict responders will be co-developed utilizing the Company’s proprietary flow-cytometry-based PPMP. Method: Ex vivo flow cytometry experiments evaluated the treatment of volasertib on 41 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples collected from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Dose-response profiles consistent with volasertib’s role as a cell cycle inhibitor were observed. To obtain a preliminary concentration of volasertib for patient stratification, Notable compared the ex vivo resistant blast fractions (leukemic cells surviving ex vivo treatment with volasertib) at several concentrations with the areas under the volasertib dose-response curves (AUCs), assuming that AUCs would correspond most accurately with the clinical responses. Results: The results suggest a strong correlation between volasertib resistant fractions treated with 31.6 and 100 nM of volasertib and AUCs, which could represent a suitable metric to stratify patients into responders and non-responders. These preliminary metrics predict that 32-33% of de novo patients and 25% of R/R AML patients would be predicted to be responders if they were treated with volasertib.

About VolasertibVolasertib is a PLK-1 inhibitor with demonstrated activity in AML and other tumor types, including solid tumors, with significant unmet medical need. Building on the performance of volasertib on PPMP, an important and proprietary step during Notable’s targeted in-licensing strategy and decision making, Notable will utilize PPMP to predict volasertib-responsive patients prior to their treatment, with the goal of selectively enrolling and treating those predicted responders, increasing volasertib’s response rates and overall patient outcomes, and fast-tracking volasertib’s remaining clinical development in this patient population. Volasertib was originally developed and manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim and previously granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA. Notable in-licensed volasertib and obtained exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights, except for certain rare pediatric cancers. About Notable Labs, Ltd. Notable Labs, Ltd.

(MPW) completed the sale of five facilities to Prime Healthcare for $350 million, with $250 million in cash and a $100 million mortgage note. The companies agreed on a 20-year master lease for four hospitals with a $260 million purchase option. Prime has until August 26, 2028, to exercise the purchase option at $238 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The transaction between Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and Prime Healthcare involves a significant exchange of assets and financial instruments that can influence the liquidity and earnings profile of MPT. The immediate cash inflow of $250 million enhances MPT's cash position, which could be directed toward debt reduction, new property acquisitions, or other strategic investments. The structured deal with a $100 million mortgage note due in nine months offers MPT a future cash inflow, albeit with credit risk exposure to Prime Healthcare's ability to fulfill this obligation.The new 20-year master lease agreement for the four hospitals carries implications for long-term revenue stability. The lease terms, including the early purchase option at a reduced price, indicate a strategic move by MPT to incentivize asset divestiture. This could potentially streamline MPT's portfolio and reduce operational complexities associated with property management. However, the reliance on a single tenant, Prime Healthcare, introduces concentration risk, which could be a concern for investors if Prime faces financial difficulties in the future. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst Medical Properties Trust operates as a REIT, which means its ability to generate stable rental income is important for maintaining its dividend payouts—a key metric for REIT investors. The sale of the five facilities and the revised lease agreement with Prime Healthcare must be evaluated in the context of MPT's overall portfolio performance and strategy. The sale proceeds and the lease restructure could signal a strategic shift in MPT's asset allocation or a response to market-specific conditions in California and New Jersey.Investors should note the $260 million purchase option in the lease, which offers insight into the valuation of the properties. The pre-agreed purchase price creates a predictable exit strategy for MPT, but also caps the potential upside from property appreciation. Additionally, the lease's annual escalations are a safeguard against inflationary pressures, ensuring that MPT's income stream maintains its purchasing power over time. Healthcare Industry Analyst The healthcare real estate market is highly sensitive to regulatory changes, demographic shifts and technological advancements. MPT's sale and leaseback transaction with Prime Healthcare reflects broader industry trends where healthcare providers are seeking to unlock capital tied up in real estate assets. This capital can then be redeployed into core operational areas such as patient care, technology upgrades and expansion of services.The long-term lease agreement suggests confidence in the healthcare sector's stability and growth, especially considering the 20-year term. However, the specific terms of the lease and the sale indicate that both MPT and Prime are hedging against future uncertainties by setting an early purchase option date. This strategic flexibility allows Prime to potentially reduce long-term leasing costs while providing MPT with a clear timeline for asset disposition, aligning with industry practices of maintaining operational agility. 04/09/2024 - 05:29 PM BIRMINGHAM, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (the “Company” or “MPT”) (NYSE: MPW) today announced that it completed its previously announced sale of five facilities in California and New Jersey to Prime Healthcare (“Prime”) for aggregate consideration of $350 million.

To encourage Prime to exercise its purchase option early in the new lease term, the parties have agreed that the properties may be purchased at the $238 million lease base on or prior to August 26, 2028. After August 26, 2028 the option price reverts to $260 million (subject to annual escalations). About Medical Properties Trust, Inc.

The Audit Committee approved the omission to seek shareholder approval due to financial viability concerns. The NYSE has approved the company's reliance on an exception under its Listed Company Manual. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst NeueHealth's decision to increase its term loan commitment by $30 million signals an aggressive move to bolster its financial position. This strategic maneuver allows the company to allocate funds towards its 2024 strategic priorities, which could indicate planned expansions, acquisitions, or investments in technology. The issuance of penny warrants is a noteworthy event, as it dilutes existing shareholders but also provides a potential upside to lenders if the company's stock price appreciates. This could be a double-edged sword; it may attract investment by offering additional leverage to lenders, but it also raises concerns about shareholder value and corporate governance.The bypassing of shareholder approval, justified by the potential risk to financial viability, is a red flag that might unsettle investors. While the NYSE's approval of this exception underlines the urgency and necessity of the action, it also suggests that the company's financial situation requires immediate attention. Investors should monitor subsequent disclosures closely for the impact of these warrants on earnings per share and the company's overall equity structure. Legal Expert The issuance of penny warrants without shareholder approval is a significant legal maneuver that hinges on the company's interpretation of its financial health. The board's decision to forego shareholder approval, based on the Audit Committee's recommendation, is legally permissible under NYSE rules in exceptional circumstances. However, this move could attract scrutiny from shareholders and regulators alike, ensuring that the company's actions align with the best interests of all stakeholders.The reliance on Section 312.05 of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual is a critical aspect of this transaction and it underscores the importance of the corporate governance framework that protects shareholders. While the immediate legal implications for NeueHealth may be mitigated by the NYSE's approval, the long-term trust of shareholders could be impacted if they feel their rights are being circumvented. Market Research Analyst The healthcare industry is capital-intensive and NeueHealth's proactive approach to strengthen its financial resources could be a response to increasing competition and the need for innovation. The use of proceeds for 'general corporate purposes' is broad, but it typically implies strategic initiatives that could enhance the company's market position. The market's reaction to such financial maneuvers will depend on the perceived effectiveness of these initiatives and the company's ability to execute its strategic priorities.Additionally, the market will likely assess the potential dilutive effect of the penny warrants against the benefit of the additional capital. If the strategic initiatives funded by this capital are successful, the company's valuation could increase, offsetting the dilution. However, the market will be looking for clear signs of prudent financial management and strategic direction to maintain confidence in NeueHealth's long-term growth prospects. 04/09/2024 - 05:29 PM DORAL, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NeueHealth, Inc. (“NeueHealth” or the “Company”) (NYSE: NEUE), the value-driven healthcare company, today announced that it entered into an incremental amendment to its credit facility with New Enterprise Associates (“NEA”) that increases the term loan commitment by $30 million on April 8, 2024. The proceeds of the incremental commitment are intended to be used for general corporate purposes, including to support the Company’s 2024 strategic priorities. In connection with the incremental credit facility, NeueHealth also announced that it will issue penny warrants to purchase up to 1,113,563 shares of the Company’s common stock to the lenders under such incremental credit facility. The warrant issuance would typically require approval of shareholders, however NeueHealth’s Audit Committee of the Board of Directors determined that delaying the debt financing transaction (which includes the issuance of warrants) until shareholder approval would jeopardize the financial viability of the Company. Therefore, the Audit Committee approved the Company’s omission to receive shareholder approval. NeueHealth expects to formally notify stockholders as soon as practicable after the date hereof that it intends to issue penny warrants in connection with the funding of loans under the incremental credit facility without seeking their approval. The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) has approved the Company’s reliance on the exception provided under Section 312.05 of the NYSE’s Listed Company Manual.

The samples were dried and crushed to 2 mm, split using a riffle splitter and pulverised to 105 µm. Pulverised sub-samples were homogenised in a stainless-steel riffle splitter and a 15 g sample and duplicate were drawn for analysis. The pulverised sample aliquots were shipped to the ISO/IEC 17025 accredited Actlabs analytical facility in Ancaster, Ontario, Canada. The samples were assayed using lithium metaborate-tetraborate fusion and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Actlab's analytical code ""8-REE"" includes 45 trace elements, 10 major oxides, Loss on Ignition, and mass balance.The samples were subjected to a quality assurance and quality control (QAQC) program consisting of the insertion of blank samples, field duplicates and certified reference materials at Lofdal and the preparation of a laboratory duplicate at the sample preparation facility in Windhoek.The Qualified Person, Dr Scott Swinden, is satisfied that the assay results are of sufficient accuracy and precision for use in the future update of the Mineral Resource Estimation.Mineral Resource StatementThe Mineral Resource was estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Best Practice Guidelines and is reported in accordance with the 2014 CIM Definition Standards, which have been incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).

Section 19(a) Notice Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The press release announces the distribution sources and amounts for March 2024, with a distribution amount per share of $0.065. The distribution includes net investment income, net realized capital gains, and return of capital. The cumulative distributions paid YTD are detailed. The Fund's annual total return for the past 5 years is 5.88%, with a current distribution rate of 10.23% of NAV. The cumulative total return YTD is 6.37%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The distribution announcement from the fund is a reflection of the fund's investment strategy and operational efficiency. The distribution is comprised of net investment income, net realized long-term capital gains and a return of capital. The allocation of 26% from net investment income suggests a steady stream of income, potentially from interest or dividends, which is a positive indicator for the fund's income-generating assets.However, investors should note the 38% return of capital component. This could imply that a portion of the distribution is not from income or capital gains but from the principal amount invested. While this can offer immediate liquidity, it may not be sustainable in the long run as it could erode the fund's capital base.The annualized current distribution rate of 10.23% compared to the average annual total return of 5.88% over five years raises questions about the sustainability of such high payouts. Investors might be concerned if the fund is reaching for yield at the expense of capital preservation. Tax Advisor From a tax perspective, the different components of the distribution have varied implications for shareholders. The net investment income and net realized long-term capital gains are typically subject to different tax rates. It's important for shareholders to understand that the return of capital is not taxed immediately; instead, it reduces the cost basis of the investment, potentially resulting in higher capital gains upon sale of the shares.Given the discrepancies between GAAP accounting and federal income tax regulations, shareholders should consult with a tax professional to understand the specific tax treatment of these distributions and plan accordingly. The notice also highlights the importance of the separate 19(a) notice, which will provide necessary details for tax reporting purposes. Market Research Analyst Looking at the distribution in the context of market performance, the cumulative total return on NAV for the fiscal year-to-date of 6.37% alongside cumulative fiscal YTD distributions of 3.41% as a percentage of NAV provides a snapshot of the fund's performance relative to the broader market. If the market has been volatile or bearish, these figures could be seen as robust.However, it's essential to benchmark these returns against peer funds and the relevant market indices. If the fund's returns are lagging behind comparable investments, it may indicate underlying issues with the fund's management or investment strategy, potentially affecting investor confidence and the fund's attractiveness. 04/09/2024 - 05:00 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Notification of Sources of Distribution Distribution Period March 2024 Distribution Amount Per Share of Common Stock $0.065 The following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the current distribution, payable April 10, 2024 to shareholders of record March 28, 2024, together with the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year-to-date (YTD) from the following sources.

Positive None. Negative None. 04/09/2024 - 05:00 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eldorado Gold Corporation (“Eldorado” or the “Company”) today provides the following updates on the tax impacts in Turkiye related to the weakening of the Turkish Lira in Q1 2024. Tax Impacts in Turkiye for Q1 2024 Related to the Weakening Turkish Lira The Company’s profits from mining operations in Turkiye are taxed at the enacted rate and the resulting current income tax expense can be further increased or reduced by other items. For the first quarter, the Company expects the Turkish current income tax expense on mining profits, at an enacted rate of 25%, to be further decreased by $9 to $12 million. The estimated decrease is primarily attributable to investment tax credits relating to Kisladag and Efemcukuru, and the effects of inflation accounting, partly offset by taxable unrealized foreign exchange gains due to the weakening of the Lira, against the US dollar, in the quarter. Q1 2024 Financial and Operational Results Call Details Eldorado will release its 2024 First Quarter Financial and Operational Results after the market closes on Thursday, April 25, 2024, and will host a conference call on Friday, April 26, 2024, at 11:30 AM ET (8:30 AM PT).

Velo3D Announces Proposed Public Offering,2024-04-09T21:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE: VLD) announces a public offering of common stock and warrants to fund working capital and repay debts. The offering is subject to market conditions and aims to support general corporate purposes.","Velo3D Announces Proposed Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE: VLD) announces a public offering of common stock and warrants to fund working capital and repay debts. The offering is subject to market conditions and aims to support general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative The offering is subject to market conditions, which may impact its completion or terms. Financial Analyst The announcement by Velo3D, Inc. regarding its public offering of common stock and warrants is a strategic move aimed at raising capital. The funds are earmarked for purposes that could potentially strengthen the company's financial position. Specifically, the allocation for working capital, capital expenditures and the repayment of senior secured notes due 2026 indicates a focus on maintaining liquidity, investing in growth and reducing debt levels.Investors should note that the offering's success hinges on market conditions, which are influenced by investor sentiment and broader economic factors. A 'reasonable best efforts' offering suggests that while the placement agent will work to ensure the offering's success, there is no guarantee of the sale of all the securities. This type of offering may be perceived as riskier, potentially impacting investor confidence and the stock's market price.For stakeholders, the short-term implications include potential dilution of existing shares due to the increase in the number of outstanding shares. In the long term, however, if the capital raised is effectively utilized for growth and debt reduction, it could lead to an enhanced financial profile and potentially higher stock valuations. The involvement of A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners provides a layer of credibility to the offering, although investors are advised to review the prospectus supplement for a detailed understanding of the offering's terms and risks. Market Research Analyst The additive manufacturing industry, where Velo3D operates, is characterized by high research and development costs and a competitive landscape. The decision to raise capital through a public offering can be viewed as a response to the industry's capital-intensive nature. By directing funds towards working capital and capital expenditures, Velo3D may be aiming to accelerate product development and expand its market presence.From a market perspective, the offering's timing and size are crucial. If the offering coincides with a bullish market sentiment towards the tech sector, it may lead to a favorable outcome. Conversely, a bearish outlook or increased market volatility could hinder the offering's success.Moreover, the repayment of debt is a positive signal to the market, as it may improve the company's debt-to-equity ratio and overall financial health. Investors often view companies with lower leverage as less risky, which could be beneficial for Velo3D's stock performance in the long run. 04/09/2024 - 05:00 PM FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Velo3D, Inc. (NYSE: VLD) (the “Company”), a leading additive manufacturing technology company for mission-critical metal parts, today announced that it intends to offer and sell shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase shares of its common stock in a “reasonable best efforts” public offering. All of the securities to be sold in the offering are to be offered by Velo3D, Inc. The offering is subject to market conditions, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed, or as to the actual size or terms of the offering. The Company shall use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities primarily for funding working capital and capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Company’s senior secured notes due 2026 and other permitted indebtedness. A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners is acting as sole placement agent for the offering on a reasonable best-efforts basis. This offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-268346) previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which was declared effective by the SEC on November 21, 2022. The offering will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus. The preliminary prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus describing the terms of the proposed offering will be filed with the SEC and will be available on the SEC’s website located at http://www.sec.gov. Electronic copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement may be obtained, when available, from A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, 590 Madison Avenue, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022, or by telephone at (212) 624-2060, or by email at prospectus@allianceg.com. Before investing in this offering, interested parties should read in their entirety the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the other documents that the Company has filed with the SEC that are incorporated by reference in such prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, which provide more information about the Company and such offering. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. About Velo3D: Velo3D is a metal 3D printing technology company. 3D printing—also known as additive manufacturing (AM)—has a unique ability to improve the way high-value metal parts are built. However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago. This has prevented the technology from being used to create the most valuable and impactful parts, restricting its use to specific niches where the limitations were acceptable. Velo3D has overcome these limitations so engineers can design and print the parts they want. The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The fully integrated solution includes the Flow print preparation software, the Sapphire family of printers, and the Assure quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion manufacturing process. The company delivered its first Sapphire system in 2018 and has been a strategic partner to innovators such as SpaceX, Honeywell, Honda, Chromalloy, and Lam Research.

Forward-Looking Statements: This press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1996. The Company’s actual results may differ from its expectations, estimates and projections and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect”, “estimate”, “project”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “believes”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue”, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements regarding the timing, size and expected gross proceeds of the offering, the satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the offering and sale of securities, the Company’s ability to complete the offering, the use of proceeds from the offering and the Company’s other expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions, or strategies for the future. These forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results.

These filings identify and address other important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Most of these factors are outside the Company’s control and are difficult to predict. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to: (1) the inability of the Company to execute its business plan, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability of the company to grow and manage growth profitably, maintain relationships with customers and suppliers and retain its key employees; (2) the period over which the company anticipates its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern; (3) the Company’s ability to service and comply with its indebtedness; (4) the Company’s ability to satisfy New York Stock Exchange Listing rules; (5) changes in the applicable laws or regulations; (6) the possibility that the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (7) the lingering effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic; and (8) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time described in the FY 2023 10-K, including those under “Risk Factors” therein, and in the company’s other filings with the SEC.

High grade gold intersections from drilling last year, such as drill hole MLHL 22-06 which intersected 24.96 grams per tonne of gold over 14.9 meters and drill hole MLHL 22-17 which intersected 148.27 gram per tonne over 1.3 meters helped generate a very high compliant gold resource grade (Table 3). This year drilling in hole MLHL-23-50 intersected 13.96 grams per tonne of gold over 1.17 meters while hole MLHL-24-53 intersected 4.04 grams per tonne of gold over 2.25 meters. Figure 1 highlights the area of new gold mineralization. Hole MLHL-23-50 has extended the gold mineralization to the east of the Purdex zone while hole MLHL-25-53 has extended the gold mineralization at depth.""The results from the recent drilling at High Lake are very encouraging. Having extended the gold mineralization to the east and at depth at Purdex Zone is positive to our overall development of the property. It is management's view that further drilling will help delineate more gold and add to our resource base"" says CEO Mark Trevisiol. ""Of the five kilometers of strike length within the High Lake property only 500 meters has been explored thus far. This property has numerous historic high grade gold intercepts (Figure 2 below) which have yet to be properly followed up with a concentrated drill program. The potential for this site to add to its resource base is still very much untapped"" added Mark Trevisiol.Within this winter's drilling program, McFarlane has also started to explore parts of the western area of the High Lake property. Figure 2 illustrates some historical intercepts in the western area of the High Lake property. Drilling in the western area of the property is shown on Figure 3. Specifically, McFarlane explored historical prospective areas of the R zone, B zone, A zone, A-D extension and the Porphyry Zones. Assays are still pending on this part of the program. Specific to the Porphyry Zone, historical exploration has indicated a presence of both gold and copper in mineralized samples assayed.Figure 1 - Purdex Zone Resource Area - Longitudinal Section Figure 2 - Historical Intercepts - High Lake Property Figure 3 - High Lake Western Drilling - Assays Pending Table 1: Drilling Intersections High Lake PropertyHole IDFrommetresTometresLengthmetresGoldgrams/tonneMLHL-23-50296.7297.871.1713.96MLHL-24-53416.5418.752.254.04Reported as core length as insufficient drilling to ascertain true width.Table 2: Collar Location DetailsHole IDEasting(mE)Northing(mN)AzimuthDeg.DipDeg.LengthmMLHL-23-493502365508992200.5-44.8299.0MLHL-23-503502365508992200.5-54.8341.0MLHL-23-513502365508993198.8-64.6404.0MLHL-23-52A3502365508993199.6-75.0497.0MLHL-24-533502025509069199.9-70.2530.0MLHL-24-543502025509069204.9-77.8650.0MLHL-24-553502935508859202.2-44.6200.0MLHL-24-563503915508810202.2-43.8200.0MLHL-24-573504585508784200.8-44.5200.0MLHL-24-583502025509069187.51-74.2614.0MLHL-24-593502025509070196.2-74.5587.0MLHL-24-60A3498555509050197.2-45.3188.0MLHL-24-613499255509020198.7-45.2200.0MLHL-24-62A3502025509069182.8-77.7644.0MLHL-24-633498555509050195.0-68.4245.0MLHL-24-643498555509050230.4-55.3221.0MLHL-24-653498825509109187.7-50.0259.0MLHL-24-663504245508908201.6-44.5200.0MLHL-24-673498385509120217.8-48.5277.0MLHL-24-683504255508909200.2-61.8224.0MLHL-24-693504255508909199.0-71.9332.0Results from the remaining holes of the drill program will be released when they are available.The current program at the Purdex Zone at High Lake is a follow up to the filing of an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource Estimate in July 2023 that identified 96,200 Inferred ounces and 45,800 Indicated ounces of gold at a grade of 10.43 grams per tonne of gold and 9.38 grams per tonne of gold, respectively (Table 3).Table 3: Current Purdex Zone Mineral Resource at 2.6 g/t Au cut-offClassificationTonnes(k)Au(g/t)Au (k Oz)Indicated1529.3845.8Inferred28710.4396.2A technical report prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (""NI 43-101"") with respect to the High Lake and West Hawk Lake properties is available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company's website at https://mcfarlanelakemining.com.QA/QC Control ProceduresMcFarlane Lake has implemented a Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (QA/QC) program consistent with industry best practices.

ALX Oncology Reports Encouraging Clinical Data of Evorpacept in Combination with Standard-of-Care in an Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“R/R B-NHL”),2024-04-09T21:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,ALX Oncology Reports Positive Clinical Data on Evorpacept in Combination with R2 for R/R B-NHL Patients,"ALX Oncology Reports Encouraging Clinical Data of Evorpacept in Combination with Standard-of-Care in an Ongoing Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (“R/R B-NHL”) Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary ALX Oncology Reports Positive Clinical Data on Evorpacept in Combination with R2 for R/R B-NHL Patients Positive ALX Oncology reported encouraging clinical data from a Phase 1/2 trial of evorpacept in combination with R2 for indolent and aggressive R/R B-NHL patients. The combination of evorpacept plus R2 showed promising initial activity with a 94% overall response rate and an 83% complete response rate in patients with indolent R/R B-NHL. The safety profile of evorpacept plus R2 was similar to historical R2 data, with no dose-limiting toxicities reported. Patients with indolent R/R B-NHL had significantly higher response rates compared to the benchmark study with R2 alone. The data were presented at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting, demonstrating the potential of evorpacept in combination therapies for B-NHL patients. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent clinical trial outcomes for evorpacept, an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting CD47, combined with R2 (rituximab and lenalidomide) in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (R/R B-NHL), are noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, the observed complete response rate (CRR) of 83% in indolent R/R B-NHL patients represents a significant improvement over the historical benchmark CRR of 34% from the AUGMENT Phase 3 clinical trial. This suggests a potential paradigm shift in the treatment efficacy for this patient group.From a medical research perspective, the safety profile of evorpacept in combination with R2 aligns with historical data, which is important in oncology treatments where the therapeutic window is often narrow. The absence of dose-limiting toxicities and treatment-related deaths provides a positive signal regarding the tolerability of the regimen. Moreover, the involvement of innate immune response as a mechanism of anti-tumor activity could indicate a broader applicability of evorpacept across various oncology indications, beyond B-NHL.While these results are preliminary, they could lead to changes in clinical practice if substantiated by further trials. It is also important to note that the sample size is relatively small and the aggressive R/R B-NHL subgroup only included two patients, limiting the generalizability of the findings to this population. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the clinical data presented for evorpacept in combination with R2 is encouraging, particularly because it addresses a patient population with limited treatment options after first-line therapy. The high best overall response rate (ORR) and CRR observed in the trial could translate to improved patient outcomes, including longer progression-free survival and potentially overall survival, though long-term data are needed to confirm this.The management of adverse events is a critical aspect of cancer therapy. The most common side effects reported were fatigue and liver enzyme increases, which are manageable in a clinical setting. This favorable safety profile may improve patients' quality of life during treatment, which is a key consideration in chronic conditions such as indolent B-NHL.It is also worth discussing the role of immunomodulatory drugs like lenalidomide in enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapies. The synergy between evorpacept and lenalidomide could represent an important avenue for future research, potentially leading to the development of more effective combination regimens. Financial Analyst From an investment standpoint, the promising results of ALX Oncology's evorpacept in combination with R2 could have significant implications for the company's financial health and market position. The superior efficacy data compared to the historical benchmark could position evorpacept as a competitive player in the B-NHL treatment landscape, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue for ALX Oncology.Investors will likely monitor the ongoing Phase 2 trials closely, as further positive results could drive regulatory approval and commercialization prospects. Additionally, the drug's safety profile and efficacy in a niche yet significant market segment can attract partnership opportunities, boosting upfront payments and milestone revenues.However, the market response will also depend on the drug's pricing strategy, reimbursement scenarios and the competitive landscape, including the entry of biosimilars and other novel therapies. Investors should consider these factors alongside the clinical data when evaluating the potential impact on ALX Oncology's stock performance. 04/09/2024 - 05:30 PM – Twenty patients with indolent (n=18) and aggressive (n=2) R/R B-NHL received evorpacept plus standard rituximab and lenalidomide (“R2”)– Evorpacept plus R2 was well tolerated with a safety profile similar to historical R2– The combination achieved promising initial activity with a best overall response rate (“ORR”) of 94% and a complete response rate (“CRR”) of 83% in patients with indolent R/R B-NHL (R2 historical CRR benchmark is 34%) SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ALX Oncology Holdings Inc., (“ALX Oncology” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: ALXO), an immuno-oncology company developing therapies that block the CD47 immune checkpoint pathway, today reported encouraging clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 investigator-sponsored trial (“IST”) of evorpacept in combination with R2 in patients with indolent and aggressive R/R B-NHL. The new data were presented in an oral presentation at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting. The clinical trial enrolled a total of 20 patients with indolent (n=18) and aggressive (n=2) R/R B-NHL where all patients had received prior rituximab and 72% had received prior chemoimmunotherapy. Patients received evorpacept 30 mg/kg Q2W (n=3) or 60 mg/kg Q4W (n=17) in combination with standard R2 treatment. The regimen was well tolerated, and there were no dose-limiting toxicities. The maximum administered dose for evorpacept was 60 mg/kg Q4W. The most common adverse events due to any cause were fatigue, ALT increase, anemia, and AST increase, all of which were mostly low grade. There were no reported treatment-related deaths on study. Patients with indolent R/R B-NHL (n=18) had a best ORR of 94% and a CRR of 83%. The median duration of response was not reached. The AUGMENT Phase 3 clinical trial1, a benchmark study in a similar patient population, reported an ORR of 78% and a CRR of 34% with R2 alone. “While standard frontline treatments have shown benefit in the indolent B-NHL setting, many patients are likely to see their disease progress after initial treatment,” said Paolo Strati, M.D., the trial’s lead investigator and Assistant Professor of Lymphoma-Myeloma at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. “We are pleased evorpacept in combination with R2 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and encouraging response in this patient population. These data further illustrate the importance of exploring novel combinations with evorpacept to elicit anti-tumor activity by way of the innate immune response. We are excited to build upon these preliminary results as we evaluate the evorpacept-R2 combination in the ongoing Phase 2 portion of this clinical trial in patients with previously untreated indolent B-NHL.” “These initial results reinforce evorpacept’s differentiated drug design that has resulted in anti-cancer activity while minimizing hematologic toxicities inherent to other CD47 blocking agents,” said Sophia Randolph, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer, ALX Oncology. “Furthermore, the findings presented today build upon the promising data reported from the ASPEN-01 Phase 1 clinical trial of evorpacept in combination with rituximab in R/R NHL2. We look forward to applying these and other clinical trial data to inform new evorpacept combinations in our expanding pipeline. We would like to thank the patients and research team for conducting this important clinical trial.” Details of the Oral Presentation at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting are as follows: A Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial of evorpacept (ALX148), lenalidomide and rituximab for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomaSession Title: Clinical Trials Minisymposium / Novel Agents and Emerging Therapeutic StrategiesPresentation Date and Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, 2:50 PM – 3:00 PM PTAbstract: CT037 (full abstract is available online here) The presentation is available on the publications page of the ALX Oncology website here. About the Phase 1/2 IST Investigating Evorpacept Combination to R2 in NHL The Phase 1/2 IST is an ongoing, open-label, single arm clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of evorpacept, otherwise known as ALX148, in combination with R2 in patients with R/R B-cell NHL (both indolent and aggressive) histology. Patient enrollment is currently open to the Phase 2 portion of the study evaluating patients with previously untreated indolent B-NHL (NCT05025800). The study is sponsored and conducted by MD Anderson Cancer Center. About Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Approximately 500,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with NHL each year. In the U.S., NHL is the seventh most common type of cancer, and over 80,000 newly cases of NHL were estimated in 20233. NHL can be divided into two groups according to how the disease progresses: indolent and aggressive lymphomas. The most prevalent form of NHL, accounting for about 32% of newly diagnosed NHL cases, is an aggressive form called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is the most common subtype of indolent NHL and accounts for about 17% of newly diagnosed NHL cases. Indolent B-cell lymphomas tend to grow more slowly and may have fewer signs and symptoms than aggressive lymphomas when first diagnosed. For patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma, current first-line treatments include radiotherapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, and chemoimmunotherapy. Despite advances in treatment, follicular lymphoma remains a significant cause of death. About ALX Oncology ALX Oncology is a publicly traded, clinical-stage immuno-oncology company focused on helping patients fight cancer by developing therapies that block the CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitor and bridge the innate and adaptive immune system. ALX Oncology’s lead product candidate, evorpacept, is a next generation CD47 blocking therapeutic that combines a high-affinity CD47 binding domain with an inactivated, proprietary Fc domain. To date, evorpacept has been dosed in over 500 subjects and has demonstrated promising activity and favorable tolerability profile across a range of hematologic and solid malignancies in combination with various leading anti-cancer antibodies. ALX Oncology is currently focusing on combining evorpacept with anti-cancer antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (“ADCs”), and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors. Evorpacept’s Unique Profile: Anchored by a Rational Design and Dual Development Pillars Rationally engineered with an inactive Fc effector function, evorpacept’s clinical data to date has demonstrated a substantially improved safety profile over other anti-CD47 molecules in the clinic with an active Fc (i.e., binding the Fc gamma receptor on macrophages). This best-in-class safety profile allows for higher dosage with minimal overlapping toxicity in the combination treatment setting. CD47 expressed on cancer cells binds to its receptor SIRP alpha, which is predominantly expressed on two cell types: macrophages and dendritic cells. The Company’s pipeline of therapeutic candidates with standard-of-care agents include: Anti-cancer antibodies (the “don’t eat me” signal): evorpacept enables Fc-mediated antibody-dependent phagocytosis by macrophages in combination with anti-cancer antibodies (e.g., Herceptin®) with an active Fc domain, which is otherwise impaired by CD47 expression on cancer cells binding to SIRP alpha on macrophages. This same mechanism of action applies to ADCs.PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (the “don’t activate T-cells” signal): evorpacept enables T-cell activation by dendritic cells that are constitutively inhibited by CD47 expression on cancer cells binding to SIRP alpha on dendritic cells. Activated dendritic cells present neoantigens to T-cells that once activated will kill cancer cells when the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory interaction is blocked by T-cell checkpoint inhibitors.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by VIA optronics AG to delist from the NYSE and terminate its SEC registration represents a significant shift in its capital markets strategy. From a financial perspective, the move to delist due to low liquidity and high maintenance costs suggests a strategic pivot towards cost efficiency. This could potentially reduce the company's financial burden, freeing up capital for reinvestment into core business areas. However, it's important to note that delisting may also lead to a narrower investor base, as U.S. investors may find it more challenging to invest in the company. This could impact the company's share price and valuation, as the pool of potential investors shrinks.Moreover, the cessation of SEC reporting obligations might raise concerns about transparency and corporate governance standards among the remaining investors. While this move could streamline operations and reduce regulatory overhead, it also means that investors will have less regular and detailed information about the company's financial health and strategic direction. This could affect investor confidence and potentially influence the company's cost of capital in the long run. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, VIA optronics AG's decision to delist could be indicative of broader trends in the market, particularly for international companies listed on U.S. exchanges. The cost-benefit analysis of maintaining a U.S. listing versus the actual trading volume and investor interest is a important consideration for foreign companies. VIA's move might prompt other firms in similar situations to evaluate the value of their U.S. listings.Additionally, the company's intention to focus more on managing its businesses and strengthening customer relationships after delisting suggests a strategic refocusing. This could be a response to competitive pressures in the interactive display solutions market or a shift in customer demand. The potential benefits of this reallocation of resources might not be immediate but could lead to improved product offerings or market positioning in the long term. Legal Expert The legal implications of VIA optronics AG's delisting and deregistration are multifaceted. The process of delisting involves specific legal steps, such as filing a Form 25 with the SEC and must comply with both SEC regulations and NYSE rules. The company's management must ensure that all legal requirements are met to avoid any potential issues or delays.Furthermore, by deregistering, VIA optronics AG will no longer be subject to the same level of U.S. regulatory oversight, which includes periodic filings, disclosures and compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. While this reduces regulatory burden, it also means that the company will operate with more flexibility regarding financial reporting and corporate governance. Investors should be aware of these changes, as they may affect the way they assess the company's legal and regulatory risk profile. 04/09/2024 - 05:00 PM NUREMBERG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VIA optronics AG (NYSE: VIAO) (“VIA” or the “Company”), a leading supplier of interactive display solutions, today announced its intention to voluntarily delist its American Depository Shares (“ADSs”) from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and terminate its registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company today notified the NYSE of its intent to voluntarily delist its ADSs from the NYSE, pursuant to a resolution adopted by its Supervisory Board today. The Company believes that delisting and deregistration of the ADSs from the U.S. public markets will be more economical for the Company, taking into account the low liquidity of its ADSs and the high costs of maintaining the NYSE listing and SEC registration on an annual basis. The Company further believes that delisting and deregistration, and consequently the suspension of its SEC reporting obligations, will allow the Company to allocate resources more efficiently to execute its current business strategy by enabling its management and employees to focus more on managing the Company’s businesses and strengthening relationships with customers and business partners. The Company currently anticipates that it will file with the SEC a Form 25 relating to the delisting and deregistration of its ADSs on or around April 19, 2024. Unless the Form 25 is earlier withdrawn by VIA, the delisting of the ADSs will be effective 10 days after the filing of the Form 25. Accordingly, VIA anticipates that the last day of trading of the ADSs on the NYSE will be on or about April 29, 2024. Following the delisting of its ADSs from NYSE and after the Company has made all necessary SEC filings, including its delayed annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, and is otherwise able to do so, the Company plans to file with the SEC a Form 15 to deregister its ADSs, and suspend its reporting obligations, under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The process for delisting from the NYSE, suspending SEC reporting obligations and terminating the ADS program is expected to take time, require filings and notifications, and compliance with certain requirements. VIA cannot provide assurances at this time as to whether or when these actions will be consummated. As previously disclosed, the Company received notice from the NYSE that it is not currently in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE.

Breaks Ground on Battery Materials Plant in Texas Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Orion S.A. (NYSE: OEC) breaks ground on a plant in Texas to produce acetylene-based conductive additives for lithium-ion batteries, supporting the global shift to electrification. The facility in La Porte will create high-skilled jobs, reduce carbon footprint, and strengthen the U.S. battery market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The groundbreaking of Orion S.A.'s new plant in Texas represents a strategic move within the specialty chemicals and battery additive market, particularly given the current global push towards electrification. This development is significant for investors as it taps into the burgeoning demand for lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for electric vehicles and renewable energy infrastructure.Orion's position as the sole producer of acetylene-based conductive additives in Europe and its expansion into the U.S. market could potentially strengthen supply chains and reduce dependency on international imports, which have been a concern for the industry. The emphasis on a 'super clean' product with a lower carbon footprint aligns with increasing regulatory and consumer demand for sustainable practices, which could provide Orion with a competitive edge in the market.Furthermore, the creation of high-skilled jobs indicates a long-term investment in the local economy and the technical sector, which may foster innovation and attract further investment. The collaboration with LyondellBasell for acetylene supply suggests a synergistic partnership that could enhance efficiency and stability in production. Environmental Analyst The environmental implications of Orion's new plant are noteworthy, particularly in the context of the global climate agenda. The production of conductive additives with a significantly reduced carbon footprint is a forward-thinking approach that aligns with broader sustainability goals.By leveraging a production process that results in exceptional purity and reduced carbon emissions, Orion is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable manufacturing within the chemical industry. This move not only addresses the growing demand for environmentally friendly products but also anticipates future regulatory trends that may favor low-carbon technologies and penalize high-emission processes.The partnership with LyondellBasell for the supply of acetylene further underscores the importance of integrated supply chains in reducing carbon emissions. The proximity of the supply source could minimize transportation-related emissions, contributing to the overall sustainability of the operation. Energy Sector Analyst The impact of Orion's new facility extends into the energy sector, particularly in its support of the electrification movement. As electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions like wind and solar farms gain traction, the need for high-quality battery components becomes increasingly critical.Orion's focus on producing conductive additives that improve electricity flow and extend battery life is a direct response to the technical challenges faced by the battery industry. Improvements in battery efficiency and longevity are key factors in the adoption of electric vehicles and the reliability of renewable energy systems, which are central to the transition away from fossil fuels.Investors should note that the expected facility start-up in 2025 positions Orion in a timeframe that coincides with projected spikes in electric vehicle sales and renewable energy deployment, potentially allowing the company to capture significant market share as these trends continue to rise. 04/09/2024 - 04:35 PM HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Orion S.A. (NYSE: OEC), a global specialty chemicals company, on Tuesday broke ground on a plant in Texas that will be the only facility in the U.S. producing acetylene-based conductive additives for lithium-ion batteries and other applications vital for the global shift to electrification. The site in the city of La Porte, southeast of Houston, will create many high-skilled jobs – both in construction and technical fields – and bring innovative technology to the American economy. The battery additives produced by Orion’s plant will be super clean, with only one-tenth of the carbon footprint of other commonly used materials. “Orion is already the sole producer of acetylene-based conductive additives in Europe,” Orion CEO Corning Painter said at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Our plant in La Porte will be a pivotal step toward strengthening the regional supply of conductive additives in the rapidly growing U.S. battery market.” Every battery requires conductive additives. They enable a more efficient flow of electricity and extend the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries – the most valuable components of electric vehicles. The material also plays an essential role in high-voltage cables used for wind and solar farms. The additives produced at the La Porte plant will be made from acetylene, a colorless gas that Orion’s production process turns into powder with exceptional purity demanded by leading battery manufacturers. The acetylene will be supplied by a neighboring site owned by Equistar Chemicals LP, a subsidiary of LyondellBasell. At Tuesday’s groundbreaking ceremony, Kim Foley, LyondellBasell executive vice president of Global Olefins and Polyolefins, Refining and Supply Chain, said “At LYB, we see electrification as a crucial part of our plan to reduce carbon emissions across our industries. By supporting the production of key battery components, we're contributing to solutions for a better tomorrow.” Orion’s plant in La Porte is similar to one the company has in the city of Berre-l'Étang in southern France. The facility also uses acetylene from LyondellBasell. With the LaPorte project, key equipment procurement and off-site fabrication are already at an advanced stage. Field construction activities are ramping up, with the facility start-up expected in the second quarter of 2025. About Orion S.A. Orion S.A.

This suggests a proactive approach to resolving the filing delay. The eventual filing of the 2023 Form 10-K will be a critical moment for the company, as it will provide investors with much-needed clarity on its financial position and performance. Moreover, the market will closely monitor the outcomes of the restatement of financial statements and the pre-clearance process with the SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant, as these factors could have material implications on the company's financial health. Legal Expert The receipt of a non-compliance letter from NASDAQ is a procedural step that carries legal implications for Primis Financial Corp. As a Legal Expert, it is clear that while the letter does not immediately affect the listing of the company's common stock, it does place the company under scrutiny. The legal process involves the company submitting a compliance plan, which will be assessed by NASDAQ for its feasibility and timeliness. Failure to submit an adequate plan or to file the annual report within the stipulated timeframe could lead to further regulatory actions, including possible delisting.Moreover, the restatement of financial statements mentioned by the company is a serious matter that often relates to errors or misstatements in previously issued financial information. This process must be handled with utmost diligence to ensure that the revised statements accurately represent the company's financial status, as inaccuracies can result in legal consequences, including sanctions from the SEC and potential investor lawsuits. The company's engagement in an ongoing pre-clearance process with the SEC indicates a level of complexity in the issues being addressed, which may require careful navigation to avoid further legal entanglements. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the delay in filing an annual report by Primis Financial Corp. and the subsequent NASDAQ notification can influence market perception and investor sentiment. As a Market Research Analyst, it is essential to evaluate market reactions to similar situations historically. Typically, delayed filings and financial restatements can lead to a loss of investor trust, which might result in a decline in stock value. Market participants often view such delays as red flags, prompting a reassessment of the company's investment risk profile.However, if the company manages to address the concerns raised and files its annual report within the 60-day window while also providing a satisfactory explanation for the delays, it could mitigate some of the negative market impact. The company's ability to quickly regain compliance and reassure the market will play a important role in stabilizing its stock price. The market will also look for transparency in the restatement process and clarity on any financial adjustments made, as these will inform the market's understanding of the company's true financial health and future prospects. 04/09/2024 - 05:00 PM MCLEAN, Va., April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- On April 4, 2024, Primis Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: FRST) (""Primis"" or the ""Company"") received a letter (the ""Letter"") from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (""NASDAQ"") indicating that, as a result of not having timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""2023 Form 10-K"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. As previously disclosed in the Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed on March 18, 2024 and Amendment No. 1 filed April 1, 2024, the Company expected to receive the Letter because it had not timely filed the 2023 Form 10-K with the SEC and the Company had determined that it required additional time in connection with the restatement of certain financial statements and ongoing ""pre-clearance"" process with the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Letter has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Pursuant to the Letter, the Company has 60 days following the receipt of the Notice within which to submit a plan to NASDAQ showing how it intends to regain compliance. The Company intends to file the 2023 Form 10-K as soon as possible, and in any case before the 60 days conclude, and thereafter, believes the Company will be in compliance with all of the NASDAQ continued listing requirements.

The arrearage payments will be made to holders of specific preferred units, with amounts detailed for each class. The total distribution amount will be $98,089,360, financed through recent asset sales and a draw on the ABL. CEO Mike Krimbill highlighted the company's progress and increased flexibility due to this development. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by NGL Energy Partners LP to clear the distribution arrearage on their preferred units represents a significant step towards strengthening their financial standing. This move not only eliminates the accrued liabilities associated with the preferred units but also sends a positive signal to the market regarding the company's liquidity and ability to manage debt. The fact that this payment is financed through asset sale proceeds and credit facilities highlights NGL's strategic financial management in addressing short-term obligations without diluting shareholder equity.However, the reliance on asset sales and debt to cover these payments may raise questions about the company's long-term financial strategy and operational cash flow sufficiency. Investors should monitor NGL's future cash flow statements and balance sheets to assess the sustainability of their financial practices and the potential impact on the company's leverage ratios. Energy Sector Analyst Clearing arrearages on preferred units indicates that NGL Energy Partners is actively managing its capital structure to optimize its financial profile within the energy sector. Such actions can improve the company's appeal to investors by showcasing a commitment to honoring its financial obligations. Additionally, the preference for asset sales over equity financing to manage these payments suggests a tactical approach to preserve shareholder value and avoid dilution.Given the volatile nature of the energy market, this decision may also reflect an underlying strategy to maintain financial flexibility against future market uncertainties. Stakeholders should consider the potential impact of these financial decisions on NGL's operational capabilities and whether the divestiture of assets could affect the company's long-term growth prospects within the energy industry. 04/09/2024 - 05:15 PM TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NGL Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NGL) announced today that the Board of Directors of its general partner approved distributions to fully pay the remaining distribution arrearage on the Class B, Class C and Class D Preferred Units.

Details on the poster presentations: Presentation Title: Single cell and cell-free nucleic acid analyses of liquid biopsy specimens from a blood collection tube using a new droplet digital PCR system Abstract Number: 3706 Session Date and Time: Monday Apr 8, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PT Session Title: Circulating Tumor Cells 1 Presenter: Leisa Jackson Presentation Title: Real-world assessment of turn-around time for actionable variant testing in NSCLC in the community setting Abstract Number: 6474 Session Date and Time: Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 1:30 PM - 5:00 PM PT Session Title: Profiling Cancer with Real-World Evidence Presenter: Gary Pestano, PhD An independent presentation of an exploratory analysis from the FLAURA2 clinical study, sponsored by AstraZeneca, was also presented as a plenary session: Presentation Title: FLAURA2: exploratory analysis of baseline (BL) and on-treatment plasma EGFRm dynamics in patients (pts) with EGFRm advanced NSCLC treated with first-line (1L) osimertinib (osi) ± platinum-pemetrexed Session Date and Time: Tuesday Apr 9, 2024 10:45 – 11:00 AM PT Session Title: Biomarkers: Quantifying Pharmacodynamic Modulation Presenter: Pasi Jänne, MD, PhD The analysis evaluated the prognostic and predictive nature of EGFR mutations (EGFRm) detected in plasma in patients with locally advanced/metastatic EGFRm non-small cell lung cancer receiving first-line osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy versus osimertinib monotherapy. Biodesix supported this research by providing the EGFRm testing using Droplet Digital™ PCR* (ddPCR™) on plasma samples collected prior to treatment and three and six weeks after treatment initiation. EGFRm testing is offered in a clinical setting by Biodesix as part of the GeneStrat® ddPCR targeted mutation test. Results suggest that baseline detection of plasma EGFRm may identify a subgroup of patients who would derive most benefit from the addition of platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy to osimertinib as first-line treatment for EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC. *Droplet Digital and ddPCR are trademarks of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

The SMARCA2 degrader, PRT7732, exhibits high potency and selectivity, with plans for Phase 1 trials in 2024.

The CDK4/6 inhibitor, PRT3645, displays synergies in breast cancer, CRC, and NSCLC models, hinting at improved patient outcomes. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Analyst The presentation of preclinical data for Prelude Therapeutics' compounds is a significant milestone in the development of new cancer treatments. The SMARCA2 degrader, PRT7732, appears to have a high degree of selectivity and potency, which could translate into fewer off-target effects and improved safety profiles for patients. The transition from preclinical to Phase 1 trials is a critical step that often leads to increased investor interest as it moves the compound closer to potential commercialization.The CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527, has shown promise in hematological malignancies. Its progression into Phase 1 trials, especially in combination with other inhibitors like BTK and BCL2, indicates a strategic approach to tackling drug resistance and improving treatment efficacy. This could potentially address a substantial unmet need in the treatment of relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies.Moreover, the next-generation CDK4/6 inhibitor, PRT3645, exhibits potential for brain penetration, which is particularly notable given the challenge of treating central nervous system-involved malignancies. Its effectiveness in preclinical models when used in combination with other targeted therapies suggests a possible role in overcoming resistance mechanisms, a common hurdle in treating cancers like breast cancer, CRC and NSCLC. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst From a market perspective, the development of these compounds by Prelude Therapeutics could position the company as a leader in the precision oncology space. The mention of PRT7732's potential as a first-in-class oral therapy for patients with SMARCA4 mutations indicates a strategic focus on niche markets with high barriers to entry. This could result in a strong competitive advantage and pricing power if the drug reaches the market.Furthermore, the combination strategies outlined for PRT2527 and PRT3645 align with current industry trends towards personalized medicine and could lead to higher adoption rates among oncologists if clinical efficacy is confirmed. The emphasis on brain penetration for PRT3645 may also open up new markets, as there are limited options for patients with brain metastases from primary tumors like breast cancer.Investors should monitor the progress of these trials closely, as positive results could lead to significant stock price appreciation for Prelude Therapeutics. Conversely, any setbacks in the development process could have a negative impact on investor sentiment and the company's valuation. Clinical Trial Strategist The strategic planning behind Prelude Therapeutics' clinical development is noteworthy. The company's approach to advancing a second SMARCA2 degrader, alongside an IV formulation already in trials, suggests a dual-pathway strategy to maximize patient reach and cater to different administration preferences. This could improve patient adherence and outcomes, which is a key consideration in oncology trials.Moreover, the initiation of IND-enabling studies for PRT7732 indicates a well-structured regulatory strategy, which is essential for timely market entry. The careful selection of combination therapies for PRT2527 and PRT3645 in the preclinical models also suggests a deliberate effort to address the complexity of cancer treatment regimens and to position these compounds as integral components of combination therapies, which could lead to strategic partnerships or collaborations in the future.Overall, the progression of these compounds through the clinical development pipeline will be a critical factor to watch, as it will influence not only the company's trajectory but also the broader oncology treatment landscape. 04/09/2024 - 04:35 PM Highly selective oral SMARCA2 degrader, PRT7732, shows robust anti-tumor activity in vivo as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, at well-tolerated doses Potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor, PRT2527, in Phase 1 development, is highly effective in preclinical hematological models as monotherapy and provides improved depth and duration of response in combination with BTK/BCL2 inhibition Next Generation CDK4/6 Inhibitor, PRT3645, is highly effective in combination with other targeted therapies in preclinical models of breast cancer, CRC and NSCLC WILMINGTON, Del., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prelude Therapeutics Incorporated (Nasdaq: PRLD), a clinical-stage precision oncology company, today announced the presentation of new preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting for its highly selective oral SMARCA2 degrader, its potentially best-in-class CDK9 inhibitor and its next-generation oral CDK4/6 inhibitor. “These presentations demonstrate our core competencies in medicinal chemistry and cancer biology to optimize and deliver compounds to the clinic with the potential to succeed as differentiated first- and/or best-in-class new therapies,” said Andrew Combs, Ph.D., Chief Chemistry Officer at Prelude Therapeutics.

However, the added debt load must be balanced against the potential for increased cash flow from the acquisition. The pricing of the notes at slightly below par value also reflects the market's view on the risk-return profile of the offering. Market Research Analyst Investing in Diamondback Energy's notes offering requires an understanding of the energy sector's dynamics and the company's position within it. The energy market, particularly in oil and gas, is subject to volatility due to geopolitical tensions, supply-demand shifts and transitions to renewable energy sources. Diamondback's focus on the Permian Basin, a prolific oil-producing area, provides it with a competitive edge in terms of production costs and operational efficiencies.However, the long-term notes, maturing in 2054 and 2064, carry additional risks related to the sector's long-term outlook, including potential regulatory changes and the shift towards sustainable energy sources. Investors should weigh these factors against the higher yields offered by these longer maturities. The company's ability to manage its expanded asset base post-acquisition will be important in maintaining its credit profile and ensuring the success of this offering. Debt Capital Markets Expert The structure of Diamondback Energy's notes offering reflects a comprehensive approach to capital management. By offering a range of maturities, Diamondback is appealing to a broad investor base with varying risk appetites and investment horizons. The staggered maturities also provide flexibility for the company to refinance or retire portions of the debt without facing a significant burden at any single point in time.Furthermore, the use of a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR indicates an efficient use of regulatory mechanisms to expedite the offering process. It's important for stakeholders to monitor the closing conditions and subsequent use of proceeds, as these will impact the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. The involvement of major financial institutions as joint book-running managers lends credibility to the offering and ensures a wide distribution of the notes. 04/09/2024 - 04:25 PM MIDLAND, Texas, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diamondback Energy, Inc.

The deal includes three classes of offered bonds and marks the largest-ever rated residential transition loan securitization. Goldman Sachs led the offering, enabling institutional investors to enter the RTL market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a $500 million rated securitization by Genesis Capital LLC is a significant event for both the company and the broader residential real estate market. By packaging residential transition loans into securities, Genesis is tapping into a new source of capital, which could potentially lower their cost of funding and increase their lending capacity. The involvement of high-profile financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank as initial purchasers indicates a strong market confidence in the quality of the underlying assets and the structure of the deal.For investors, the introduction of bonds with ratings from A (low) to BB (low) provides a range of risk-reward profiles, potentially attracting a diverse group of institutional investors. The success of this securitization, especially being the largest of its kind, suggests a healthy appetite for such financial instruments. This could lead to more liquidity in the market and possibly drive further innovation in the financing of residential real estate development. Real Estate Market Analyst This landmark securitization indicates an expanding origination capacity for Genesis Capital within the residential sector, which could have ripple effects throughout the housing market. With additional capital, Genesis is poised to fund more construction and renovation projects, potentially addressing some of the demand for new housing. However, the impact on the housing market will depend on how effectively this capital is deployed and whether it translates into an increase in affordable housing stock.Moreover, the focus on ground-up construction is particularly noteworthy as it reflects a strategic move to support a segment of the market that often faces significant barriers to entry due to the high capital requirements. By providing tailored capital solutions to developers, Genesis could play a pivotal role in shaping residential real estate trends and fostering growth in underserved areas. Credit Risk Analyst The emphasis on maintaining strong credit quality across Genesis' portfolio is crucial, especially in the context of a securitization of this magnitude. Investors will closely monitor the performance of these loans and any sign of deteriorating credit quality could affect investor confidence and the pricing of future securitizations. Given the current economic climate, with concerns over interest rates and housing market stability, the ability of Genesis to uphold stringent underwriting standards will be a key factor in sustaining investor trust and ensuring the long-term success of their securitization program. 04/09/2024 - 04:47 PM Offering Received Broad Participation From 46 Investors NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Genesis Capital LLC (“Genesis”), a leading business purpose lender that provides innovative debt solutions to professional real estate developers for new acquisition, renovation, ground-up construction, and long-term rental hold projects across the residential spectrum, today announced it has completed a $500 million rated securitization backed by residential transition loans (“RTL”).

NUC-7738 was found to reprogram lipid metabolism in tumors, making them less aggressive and promoting cancer cell death. The drug alters genes critical for cancer growth and survival, potentially offering a novel approach to inhibit ribosome biogenesis in cancer cells. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Research Scientist The findings from NuCana plc's research on NUC-7738, particularly its effects on lipid metabolism within the tumor microenvironment (TME), represent a noteworthy advancement in cancer treatment strategies. Lipids are important components that contribute to the structural and signaling aspects of cells and their dysregulation is often implicated in cancer progression. The shift towards increased polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased monounsaturated fatty acids could indicate a less aggressive cancer phenotype, potentially leading to better patient outcomes. Moreover, the ability of NUC-7738 to reduce lipids that shield cancer cells from apoptosis and increase pro-apoptotic lipids may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.From a research perspective, the application of imaging mass spectrometry to visualize the spatial relationship between the lipidome and TME is a significant technical achievement. This approach could pave the way for more personalized cancer treatments by allowing for the assessment of how individual tumors may respond to NUC-7738 therapy. If these preliminary findings are validated in larger clinical trials, it could lead to significant shifts in how oncologists approach treatment for cutaneous melanoma and potentially other cancers with similar metabolic profiles. Pharmaceutical Development Expert Targeting ribosome biogenesis is a relatively new but promising area in cancer therapy. The ability of NUC-7738 to interfere with RNA regulatory mechanisms and inhibit the production of proteins essential for cancer cell growth and survival could be a game-changer. This mechanism of action is distinct from traditional chemotherapy and could potentially reduce side effects associated with off-target protein synthesis inhibition.As the pharmaceutical industry continues to explore targeted therapies, the development of drugs like NUC-7738 that can modulate specific metabolic pathways offers a more precise approach to cancer treatment. The reported synergy between NUC-7738 and pembrolizumab, especially in patients previously unresponsive to PD-1 inhibitor-based therapy, is particularly promising. This could represent a new line of therapy for patients who have limited options, potentially leading to an extension of life or even remission.The ongoing NuTide:701 study's results will be important in determining the viability of NUC-7738's commercial development. Should the outcomes be positive, this could impact NuCana plc's market value and investor interest, as the company could be positioned at the forefront of a novel therapeutic class. However, the transition from promising clinical data to a marketable product involves rigorous testing, regulatory approvals and significant financial investment. Stakeholders should monitor the progression of these studies closely, as they will provide a clearer indication of the drug's potential impact on the market. Biotech Market Analyst The announcement of NuCana plc's research findings at the AACR Annual Meeting has potential implications for the company's valuation and investor sentiment. In the biotechnology sector, the presentation of positive preclinical and early clinical data can lead to increased interest from investors, as it may signal future revenue streams from new therapies. The dual mechanisms of action of NUC-7738, affecting both lipid metabolism and ribosome biogenesis, suggest a multifaceted approach to cancer treatment that could differentiate it from existing therapies.Investors should consider the long development timelines and the risk associated with biotech investments. While the data presented is promising, the success of NUC-7738 is not guaranteed and further clinical trials will be necessary to confirm efficacy and safety. Nevertheless, the partnership with pembrolizumab and the potential to treat PD-1 inhibitor-refractory patients could position NuCana plc in a niche but significant market segment.Monitoring competitor developments and the overall oncology pipeline is also important, as the introduction of new treatments could affect the commercial potential of NUC-7738. Additionally, regulatory hurdles and market access challenges must be navigated successfully before the drug can reach patients. Investors should weigh these factors alongside the scientific promise of NUC-7738 when considering their investment strategies. 04/09/2024 - 04:30 PM NUC-7738 Reprograms Cancer Cell Lipid Metabolism to Make Tumors Less Aggressive and Promote Cancer Cell Death NUC-7738 Alters Ribosome Biogenesis and the Regulation of Genes Critical for Cancer Growth and Survival SAN DIEGO, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NuCana plc (NASDAQ: NCNA) announced two posters being presented today at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Title: Exposing the Heterogeneity of the Lipidome in the TME of Cutaneous Melanoma Following Treatment with NUC-7738 in Combination with anti-PD-1 Therapy Presentation date and time: April 9, 2024 from 1:30pm-5:00pm PDTAbstract number: 6222 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex interplay of various cell types, extracellular matrix, signalling molecules and physical factors that collectively influence tumor growth. Lipids play an important role in the TME, contributing to various aspects of cancer progression and therapy resistance. A novel methodology, including imaging mass spectrometry, was developed to investigate the spatial relationship between the lipidome and TME using paired biopsies from patients treated with NUC-7738. NUC-7738 was found to increase polyunsaturated fatty acids within the TME, which is indicative of a shift to a less aggressive cancer type and to decrease monounsaturated fatty acids which are associated with malignant behavior and chemotherapy resistance. In addition, NUC-7738 was shown to reduce lipids associated with protection against cancer cell death and to increase lipids associated with cancer cell death. Multi-modal imaging indicated that this lipid reprogramming is a result of the alteration in enzymes associated with lipid metabolism. Title: RNA Regulatory Disruption by 3’-dATP: A Novel Approach to Inhibit Ribosome Biogenesis in CancerPresentation date and time: April 9, 2024 from 1:30pm-5:00pm PDTAbstract number: 5650 Ribosome biogenesis is a complex process that plays a pivotal role in protein translation which can become dysregulated in cancer. Thus, ribosome targeting therapies are an attractive treatment modality for anti-cancer medicines. This study investigates the impact of NUC-7738, which generates high intracellular levels of the active anti-cancer metabolite 3’-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3’-dATP), on the generation of mRNAs and proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis. Data from cancer cell lines, confirmed using paired biopsies of patients treated with NUC-7738, demonstrated that NUC-7738 significantly modulated the levels of RNAs which are important for translational control of protein synthesis. Furthermore, data also highlight NUC-7738’s potential to influence the regulation of genes critical for cancer cell growth and survival. Hugh S. Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer said: “We are excited to present these results as we believe they demonstrate NUC-7738’s multi-faceted mechanisms of action. They also further explain the compelling clinical data we have generated with NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab. We recently presented clinical data from the ongoing NuTide:701 study of NUC-7738 in combination with pembrolizumab which demonstrated that NUC-7738 may potentiate the activity of pembrolizumab in patients who were refractory to PD-1 inhibitor-based therapy. Our translational data help us to understand these clinical observations and guide the optimal development pathway for NUC-7738. We look forward to sharing additional data for NUC-7738 in 2024.” About NuCanaNuCana is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for patients with cancer by applying our ProTide technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid and hematological tumors, they have significant shortcomings that limit their efficacy and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome the key limitations of nucleoside analogs and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells. NuCana’s pipeline includes NUC-3373 and NUC-7738. NUC-3373 is a new chemical entity derived from the nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil, a widely used chemotherapy agent. NUC-3373 is currently being evaluated in three ongoing clinical studies: a Phase 1b/2 study (NuTide:302) in combination with leucovorin, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer; a randomized Phase 2 study (NuTide:323) in combination with leucovorin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer; and a Phase 1b/2 modular study (NuTide:303) of NUC-3373 in combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab for patients with advanced solid tumors and in combination with docetaxel for patients with lung cancer. NUC-7738 is a transformation of 3’-deoxyadenosine, a novel anti-cancer nucleoside analog. NUC-7738 is in the Phase 2 part of a Phase 1/2 study in patients with advanced solid tumors which is evaluating NUC-7738 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab.

Results presented at AACR 2024 revealed enhanced tumor killing capabilities without significant harm to healthy cells, indicating a 5.5x increase in selectivity. IN8bio plans to optimize the platform further for safer and more effective cancer treatments. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings from IN8bio regarding their non-signaling gamma-delta T cell based Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell (nsCAR) platform, specifically INB-300, signify a promising advancement in cancer immunotherapy. Gamma-delta T cells are a subset of T cells that possess innate-like properties, enabling them to recognize and eliminate cancerous cells while sparing healthy cells. This inherent property is leveraged in IN8bio's nsCAR technology to potentially address one of the significant limitations of current CAR-T therapies: the on-target off-tumor toxicity.The ability of INB-300 to selectively target leukemia cells and not healthy tissue could be a game-changer, especially for conditions like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), where traditional treatments have been less effective. The data suggesting a 1.8x increase in tumor killing capability without significant damage to healthy cells could translate into a more effective and safer treatment option for patients. This could lead to a wider therapeutic window, meaning higher doses could be administered with potentially fewer side effects.However, it's important to note that these are preclinical findings and the real test will be how these results translate into human clinical trials. The safety profile, as well as the efficacy demonstrated in a controlled environment, will be critical to the success of INB-300 as it progresses towards Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies. Medical Research Analyst IN8bio's preclinical data on their nsCAR platform has significant implications for the field of adoptive cell therapies. The integration of membrane-bound IL-15 co-expression could potentially enhance not only the efficacy but also the persistence and overall survival of these modified T cells within the patient's body. IL-15 is known for its role in the survival and proliferation of T cells and its membrane-bound form may provide a more localized and sustained stimulation to the nsCAR T cells.What stands out is the reported average 5.5x increase in selectivity, which is a measure of the technology's ability to discriminate between cancerous and healthy cells. This high degree of selectivity could lead to a reduction in the adverse events commonly associated with CAR-T therapies, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, which are often the result of indiscriminate T cell activation.From a research perspective, the proprietary constructs targeting CD33 and/or CD123 are also noteworthy. These antigens are commonly overexpressed in myeloid leukemias, making them ideal targets for such therapies. The nsCAR's ability to target these antigens without the signaling domain that typically leads to T cell activation upon antigen recognition could be the key to reducing the aforementioned toxicities. Biotech Financial Analyst The biotechnology sector is highly driven by innovation and IN8bio's new preclinical data could have significant financial implications if the therapy proves successful in later stages of development. The nsCAR platform's potential to mitigate on-target off-tumor toxicity could position IN8bio favorably in the competitive landscape of CAR-T therapies, especially for treating myeloid malignancies and solid tumors, which have been challenging targets for existing therapies.Investors should consider the long development timelines and the capital required to bring such therapies from preclinical to commercial stages. While the preclinical results are promising, the transition to clinical efficacy, regulatory approval and market acceptance is fraught with risk. However, the unique approach of IN8bio in enhancing the selectivity and safety profile of CAR-T therapies could attract partnership opportunities, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to bolster their oncology pipelines.It's also worth noting that the market for CAR-T therapies is rapidly growing, with increasing incidence rates of hematologic cancers and a growing demand for innovative treatments. A successful nsCAR therapy could capture a significant market share and provide substantial returns on investment. Nonetheless, the biotech sector's volatility and the high risk associated with drug development should be carefully weighed by stakeholders. 04/09/2024 - 04:30 PM - Preclinical data supports potential for proprietary nsCAR platform to selectively eliminate cancer cells while preserving healthy tissue - Gamma-delta nsCAR platform emerging as an advanced technology for targeting hematologic and solid tumor cancers NEW YORK, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IN8bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: INAB) a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative gamma-delta T cell therapies, today announced new preclinical data from its non-signaling gamma-delta T cell based Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell (nsCAR) platform, known as INB-300, that demonstrated improved selectivity to target leukemia cells while preserving healthy ones. The data support the potential for nsCAR to have a wider therapeutic window and to be used to prevent on-target off-tumor killing of healthy tissue that may express the CAR-T target. The data was presented in a poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 on April 9, 2024. IN8bio's nsCAR platform is based on the natural ability of gamma-delta T cells to distinguish between healthy and malignant tissue. By using a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) that lacks a signaling domain, IN8bio believes it has created a technology that enables these cells to differentiate between tumor and healthy tissue, even when both express the CAR-targeted antigen. Approved CAR-T therapies have shown remarkable efficacy against B cell malignancies, offering hope to patients with limited treatment options. However, extending this therapy to myeloid malignancies and solid tumors has proven challenging since the antigens they target are also often found on the surface of healthy blood cells and tissues. This unintended targeting of healthy cells and tissues has led to many of the toxicities, including patient deaths, observed in prior CAR-T therapies and has limited their utility. Unlike traditional CAR-T therapy, IN8Bio’s nsCAR is designed to direct the gamma delta T cell to its target while maintaining their unique gamma-delta T cell receptors, allowing them to identify and specifically eliminate heterogeneous tumor cells through recognition of tumor-associated stress antigens. The new data presented at AACR included results from proprietary constructs targeting CD33 and/or CD123 for in vitro evaluation against various types of leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The study results demonstrated notable differences between cells expressing traditional signaling CARs and those expressing the nsCAR constructs, which include a reduction in activation-induced cell death with nsCAR constructs. The nsIL3-33mb15 CAR (CD123+CD33+IL-15) enhancement of the gamma delta T cells against leukemia cells demonstrated an average 1.8x increase in tumor killing capability across three AML cell lines (HL-60, KG-1a and MOLM-13), compared to unmodified gamma-delta T cells as measured by a 24-hour cytotoxicity assay. Importantly, the nsCAR cells did not lead to significant killing of healthy cells expressing the CD33 or CD123 target, demonstrating the selectivity of the nsCAR platform. Results were run in triplicate and on average the selectivity was increased by 5.5x. Across all runs, killing by the nsIL3-33mb15 construct against healthy CD34+ HPCs was below that of un-transduced control gamma-delta T cells. “INB-300 can selectively target leukemia cells while preserving healthy tissue. We are now conducting further optimization to improve the integration of membrane-bound IL-15 co-expression to potentially enhance both the efficacy and safety of next-generation adoptive cell therapies against a wider spectrum of cancers,” said Lawrence Lamb, Ph.D., co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer of IN8bio. “These results can potentially improve INB-300, as we advance towards IND enabling studies of our next-generation gamma-delta T cell therapies to treat cancers.” About INB-300 INB-300 is an nsCAR gamma-delta T cell platform with several preclinical product candidates, including the INB-330 program against AML targets, that combine our expertise in gamma-delta T cells and genetic engineering. These nsCAR constructs lack signaling domains in order to take advantage of the unique properties of gamma-delta T cells to differentiate between healthy and tumor tissues. IN8bio is advancing new nsCAR constructs against multiple targets to treat both solid and liquid tumors.

Conference call scheduled for further pipeline updates.","Foghorn Therapeutics Presents New Preclinical Data on Potential First-in-Class BRM Selective Inhibitor FHD-909 and Selective CBP and Selective EP300 Degrader Oncology Programs Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Foghorn Therapeutics Inc. announces positive preclinical data for potential first-in-class medicines, including FHD-909, at the 2024 AACR Annual Meeting. IND filing for FHD-909 on track for Q2 2024. Conference call scheduled for further pipeline updates. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The development of FHD-909 as a BRM (SMARCA2) selective inhibitor by Foghorn Therapeutics represents a significant advancement in targeted cancer therapy. The emphasis on BRG1 mutated cancers, particularly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is notable since these mutations can be difficult to treat with conventional therapies. The preclinical data suggesting favorable tolerability and dose-dependent activity indicates that FHD-909 could potentially fill a treatment gap for patients with these specific mutations.From a medical research perspective, FHD-909's progress is a promising sign that Foghorn’s drug discovery engine is capable of producing viable candidates for difficult-to-target oncogenic drivers. The potential impact on patient outcomes could be substantial, especially if the drug's efficacy translates from preclinical models to human trials. The specificity of FHD-909 in targeting BRM mutations could also lead to a more personalized approach in cancer treatment, aligning with the broader industry trend towards precision medicine. Oncology Doctor As an oncologist, the prospect of introducing a first-in-class BRM selective inhibitor into the treatment landscape is exciting. The BRG1 mutation in NSCLC is associated with a poor prognosis and the development of a drug like FHD-909 could potentially improve survival rates. The fact that this drug has shown preclinical efficacy raises hope for a new therapeutic option that might offer benefits over existing treatments, such as reduced side effects or improved targeting of cancer cells.However, it is important to approach these results with cautious optimism. The transition from preclinical success to clinical efficacy is not guaranteed and the safety profile observed in preclinical studies may differ in human subjects. Additionally, the long-term effects and potential resistance mechanisms are unknown at this stage and will require extensive investigation. Financial Analyst In terms of financial implications, the announcement of positive preclinical data for FHD-909 and related programs could have a positive impact on Foghorn Therapeutics' stock valuation. Investors often respond favorably to advancements in a company's pipeline, especially when it concerns a potential first-in-class therapy with a broad application like NSCLC. The market for cancer treatments is highly competitive, but also very lucrative and an effective new drug can lead to significant revenue.However, it is important to consider the regulatory risks and the high costs associated with bringing a new drug to market. The IND filing is projected for Q2 2024, which means there is still a considerable amount of time before potential FDA approval and commercialization. Investors should weigh the potential of FHD-909 against the inherent risks of drug development, including the possibility of failure in clinical trials or delays in regulatory approval. 04/09/2024 - 04:30 PM First-in class BRM (SMARCA2) selective inhibitor FHD-909 demonstrated favorable tolerability and dose-dependent single agent activity in BRG1 mutated cancers preclinically; IND filing on track for Q2 2024 Robust preclinical monotherapy anti-tumor activity for both selective CBP and selective EP300 degrader programs Progress with FHD-909, selective CBP, and selective EP300 degrader programs further validates Foghorn’s drug discovery engine Conference call and webcast today at 5 pm ET / 2 pm PT CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Foghorn® Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: FHTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a new class of medicines that treat serious diseases by correcting abnormal gene expression, today announced new preclinical data for potential first-in-class medicines including FHD-909, a BRM (SMARCA2) selective inhibitor, selective CBP degrader, and selective EP300 degrader programs at the 2024 American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. Foghorn management will hold a conference call and webcast today at 5 p.m. ET to review important pipeline updates. “We are pleased with the encouraging data for our highly selective and potent drug candidates, which address historically very challenging cancer targets,"" said Adrian Gottschalk, President and Chief Executive Officer of Foghorn. “Notably, our first-in-class BRM selective inhibitor FHD-909 has demonstrated favorable tolerability and encouraging dose-dependent single agent activity in preclinical models of BRG1 mutated tumors. We believe FHD-909 offers a potential new approach for the treatment of cancer. The primary target patient population is BRG1 mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for about 10% of NSCLC. We look forward to continued progress with Lilly with an IND filing for FHD-909 on track for the second quarter of the year.” Steve Bellon Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Foghorn Therapeutics added, “CBP and EP300 are nearly identical proteins which has made targeted specific approaches challenging. Our selective CBP program demonstrates significant tumor growth inhibition in solid tumors without thrombocytopenia or anemia that have been observed with dual CBP/EP300 inhibition. Our selective EP300 program, which is earlier in development, also demonstrates promising preclinical efficacy with no thrombocytopenia or negative effects on megakaryocyte viability, which are often seen in dual approaches. Additionally, we are applying our long-acting formulation capabilities to our degrader programs, which further enhances the clinical potential of these drug candidates. These are exciting achievements in the development of protein degraders for major cancer types, and we look forward to further progress across these important targets.” Presentation Highlights FHD-909 Program BRM and BRG1 are highly homologous and mutually exclusive subunits of the BAF complex. BRG1 mutations occur in a variety of tumor types, including approximately 10% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and result in tumors being dependent on BRM activity for their survival. Selectively blocking BRM activity is a promising synthetic lethal strategy to induce tumor death while sparing healthy cells. However, the ATPase domains of BRM and BRG1are 92% identical which has made identifying a selective BRM inhibitor challenging. Poster 3230 / 14: Discovery of selective BRM (SMARCA2) ATPase inhibitors for the treatment of BRG1 (SMARCA4) mutant cancersPreclinical data presented at AACR support FHD-909 as an oral, novel, potent and selective BRM inhibitor with robust anti-tumor monotherapy activity: ~ 30-fold selectivity for BRM inhibition over BRG1 in cell-based assaysDose-dependent and robust tumor growth inhibition and regression as a monotherapy in multiple BRG1 mutant xenograft modelsFavorable tolerability with dose dependent modulation of BRM target genes in vivoLilly plans to file an IND application for potential first-in-class orally bioavailable, selective BRM inhibitor, FHD-909, with initial focus in BRG1 mutated NSCLC in Q2 2024 Selective CBP and Selective EP300 Degrader ProgramsCBP and EP300 are paralog histone acetyltransferases involved in many cellular processes. Dysregulation of one or both is implicated in various cancer types, and functional genomic screens have suggested a synthetic lethal relationship in tumor cells. Attempts to selectively inhibit CBP or EP300 individually have been challenging due to the high homology between the two proteins. Additionally, dual inhibition of CBP/EP300 has led to hematopoietic toxicity. Selective CBP ProgramPoster 6067 / 26: Identification of selective CBP degraders with robust preclinical PK, PD, efficacy, and safety across solid tumor indicationsPreclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data presented at AACR support the identification of potent and selective CBP degraders with anti-tumor activity across various EP300 mutant cell lines from multiple indications: Deep and sustained CBP degradation leading to significant tumor growth inhibition in mouse xenograft solid tumor modelsRobust monotherapy anti-tumor activity that was not associated with significant body weight lossIn vivo, no evidence of thrombocytopenia, which is attributed to the sparing of megakaryocytes, nor evidence of anemiaLong-acting CBP-selective protein degrader formulations with first-in-class potential for patients with tumors harboring EP300 mutations Selective EP300 Program Poster 6064 / 23: Discovery of potent and selective EP300 degraders with anti-cancer activityPreclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data presented at AACR support the identification of potent and selective EP300 degraders with anti-tumor activity in prostate and hematological malignancies: Reduced growth of androgen receptor positive prostate cells and attenuated androgen signalingReduced the growth of prostate cancer xenograft tumors in miceBroad anti-tumor activity across a panel of multiple myeloma and DLBCL cell linesIn vivo efficacy demonstrated in a DLBCL modelWell tolerated in vivo with no observed decrease in platelet levels, additionally mechanistic studies ex vivo show no effects on megakaryocyte viability at pharmacologically relevant concentrations Conference Call and Webcast InformationFoghorn management will hold a conference call and webcast today at 5 p.m. ET to review pipeline updates.

(VCTR) reported Total Assets Under Management (AUM) of $170.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, with Total Client Assets reaching $175.5 billion. The company experienced long-term AUM net outflows of -$1.0 billion for the first quarter. Victory Capital will announce its first-quarter 2024 financial results on May 9, 2024, followed by a conference call on May 10, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported figures by Victory Capital Holdings, including Total Assets Under Management (AUM) and net flows, are pivotal metrics for evaluating the company's performance and potential growth trajectory. The slight increase in AUM from February to March 2024 suggests a positive market reception or effective asset accumulation strategies. However, the reported long-term AUM net outflows of $1.0 billion could indicate challenges in retaining long-term investment or a shift in investor sentiment. This outflow needs to be contextualized against industry benchmarks to assess its severity. Furthermore, the distribution of assets across different classes and vehicles provides insight into the company's diversification and risk exposure. The growth in U.S. Mid Cap Equity and Global/Non-U.S. Equity could reflect a strategic allocation that resonates with current market trends. Investors should monitor the performance of these segments closely, as they could significantly influence the company's overall financial health. Market Research Analyst Victory Capital's announcement includes details that help in understanding the company's market positioning and investor behavior. The increase in Solutions and Fixed Income assets suggests a possible trend towards more conservative investment strategies, likely influenced by the broader economic environment. It's important to consider how macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates and geopolitical tensions, might be affecting investor decisions and, consequently, Victory Capital's asset composition. The shift in Other Assets and the slight decrease in Money Market/Short Term Assets could reflect a change in institutional investor strategies or a response to market liquidity conditions. These shifts are worth noting as they can have implications for the company's revenue streams, given the different fee structures associated with various asset types and investment vehicles. Economist The report from Victory Capital Holdings provides a snapshot of the company's financial health within the broader context of the financial services industry. The data on AUM and client assets are indicators of the company's market share and competitive standing. While the company shows a modest AUM increase, the negative net flows raise questions about the sustainability of growth and the potential impact on future earnings. In a macroeconomic perspective, these figures could be reflecting broader market trends, such as shifts in risk tolerance among investors, or specific to the company's performance. It's important to analyze these results in light of current economic conditions, including inflation rates, fiscal policies and market volatility, to forecast their potential impact on Victory Capital's operations. The company's ability to navigate these conditions and adjust its investment strategies accordingly will be essential for maintaining and growing its AUM. 04/09/2024 - 04:29 PM Schedules First-Quarter Financial Results Conference Call for May 10 SAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.

The delay was caused by changes in executive finance leadership and internal control weaknesses. The Company must submit a plan to regain compliance within 60 days to avoid delisting. Positive None. Negative The delay in filing the Annual Report may impact investor confidence and raise concerns about the Company's financial management and internal control processes. Financial Analyst The notification of delinquency received by WM Technology from Nasdaq due to the late filing of their Annual Report underscores the importance of adherence to regulatory requirements for listed companies. This development is a red flag for investors and can have implications for the stock's liquidity and investor confidence. The delay, attributed to changes in executive finance leadership and additional financial-closing procedures, suggests potential instability in the company's financial department.Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the company's ability to submit a satisfactory compliance plan within the stipulated timeframe will be critical to maintaining its listing status. The mention of 'material weaknesses' should also be noted, as it could indicate more profound issues with financial controls, potentially affecting future financial statements' reliability. Corporate Governance Expert WM Technology's delay in filing its Annual Report due to executive turnover and material weaknesses in internal controls is indicative of governance issues that may concern stakeholders. Effective internal controls are essential for accurate financial reporting and risk management. Material weaknesses can lead to errors in financial statements and undermine the company's ability to safeguard assets.The company's proactive communication and commitment to regaining compliance is positive, but the underlying issues that led to the non-compliance must be addressed thoroughly. Stakeholders should seek transparency regarding the steps being taken to rectify the control deficiencies and prevent future occurrences. Market Research Analyst The situation at WM Technology may affect investor perceptions across the tech sector, especially for companies with similar operational structures or those who have recently undergone executive changes. Market sentiment can be significantly influenced by such compliance issues, as they often lead to broader concerns about the sector's regulatory adherence and financial transparency.While the immediate impact on WM Technology's stock price may be limited, the long-term implications could be more substantial if the company fails to address the root causes.

(“WM Technology” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: MAPS), announced it received an expected delinquency notification letter from Nasdaq’s Listing Qualifications Department on April 2, 2024 which indicated that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of the Company’s failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“Annual Report”). The Nasdaq listing rules require listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"").

As described in the Company’s Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing filed on March 18, 2024, and subsequent Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2024, the delay in filing the Company’s Annual Report is due to a recent change in the Company’s executive finance leadership and corresponding delay in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements to be included in the Annual Report and the Company’s need to complete additional financial-closing procedures associated with one or more material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Nasdaq informed the Company that it must submit a plan to regain compliance (the “Plan”) within 60 calendar days, or by June 3, 2024, to address how it intends to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules.

abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Fund VCC Announces Monthly Distribution,2024-04-09T20:27:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Investment Fund VCC (TSX:FAP) announces a monthly distribution of CAD 1.75 cents per share, maintaining a stable monthly distribution policy.

The Company has paid total distributions of CAD 21.0 cents per share for the past 12 months.","abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Fund VCC Announces Monthly Distribution Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Investment Fund VCC (TSX:FAP) announces a monthly distribution of CAD 1.75 cents per share, maintaining a stable monthly distribution policy. Shareholders in Canada will receive distributions in Canadian dollars, treated as foreign income for tax purposes. The Company has paid total distributions of CAD 21.0 cents per share for the past 12 months. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Investment Fund VCC regarding its monthly distribution is a noteworthy event for current and potential investors. This distribution is indicative of the fund's operational performance and its ability to generate cash flow to return to shareholders. A stable monthly distribution is often seen as a sign of financial health and predictability, which can be appealing to investors seeking regular income from their investments.From a financial analysis standpoint, the total distributions paid over the past 12 months suggest that the fund has maintained a consistent payout, which can be an important factor in assessing the sustainability of future distributions. Furthermore, the fact that all distributions are treated as foreign income for Canadian income tax purposes may influence the net return for Canadian investors, depending on their individual tax situations.It is also important to note the breakdown of the distributions. The estimated components show that distributions are being fully covered by earnings, with no part of the distribution coming from net investment income in excess of earnings. This implies that the fund is not eroding capital to maintain its distributions, a practice that can be concerning if it were occurring. Instead, it appears to be operating within its means, which is a positive sign for long-term viability. Tax Expert For investors, understanding the tax implications of foreign income distributions is essential. The classification of the fund's distributions as foreign income for Canadian tax purposes means that Canadian investors might be subject to different tax treatment compared to domestic income. This could potentially affect the after-tax return on their investment, depending on the tax treaty between Canada and Singapore and the individual's tax bracket.Investors should be aware that foreign income can sometimes be taxed at a higher rate and may not be eligible for certain credits or deductions that domestic income might enjoy. Additionally, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the currency in which the fund operates could impact the value of the distributions once converted and received by the shareholders. Market Research Analyst When assessing the impact of such announcements on the stock market, it's important to consider investor sentiment and market trends. Regular and stable distributions can make a closed-end fund like abrdn Asia-Pacific Income Investment Fund VCC attractive to income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where alternative income sources may be limited.However, the market's reaction to distribution announcements can also be influenced by broader economic conditions and the performance of the Asia-Pacific markets, given the fund's investment focus. Investors typically look for funds that not only provide steady income but also demonstrate capital appreciation potential.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent report by Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc. regarding their preliminary assets under management (AUM) presents a snapshot of the company's current scale and scope of operations. The figure of $160.4 billion in AUM is a key indicator of the firm's market presence and can influence investor sentiment. When assessing the distribution of AUM across various funds and strategies, it's evident that International Value and Global Value teams hold significant portions, which may reflect the firm's strategic focus and expertise in these areas.An upward or downward trend in AUM can signal the firm's performance trajectory to investors and market analysts. It's also a measure of the trust that clients place in the firm's capabilities. The details provided about separate accounts and other AUM components offer transparency into the diversity of Artisan's offerings, potentially affecting the firm's attractiveness to both retail and institutional investors. Financial Analyst Artisan Partners Asset Management's AUM announcement is a critical piece of information for evaluating the company's financial health. AUM is directly linked to management fee revenue, which is a primary income source for asset management firms. The breakdown of AUM by strategy enables us to infer which segments are driving growth or may be underperforming. For instance, the substantial AUM allocated to the International Value strategy suggests robust client interest and could indicate a competitive advantage in international markets.Moreover, the separation of the International Small-Mid team into an autonomous investment franchise could be seen as a strategic move to enhance focus and agility in this segment. This kind of structural change could potentially lead to improved performance and efficiency, as well as a differentiated offering that might appeal to niche investors. Economist From an economic perspective, the distribution of Artisan Partners' AUM across various geographical regions and investment strategies reflects broader market trends and investor preferences. For instance, the allocation towards emerging markets and specific international strategies might suggest a response to global economic shifts or the pursuit of diversification to mitigate risks associated with market volatility.The AUM in credit strategies also provides insight into the current credit market conditions and investor risk appetite. The firm's ability to manage a diverse range of assets, from equities to credit, indicates a comprehensive approach to asset management that can adapt to different economic cycles, which is vital for long-term sustainability in the financial services industry. 04/09/2024 - 04:16 PM MILWAUKEE, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc.

Despite a challenging year, the company reported a net revenue of RMB440.5 million, a gross profit of RMB16.2 million, and a net loss of RMB382.8 million. The company's strategic adjustments led to an improvement in profitability, with a focus on IT system design services. Looking ahead to 2024, Jianzhi plans to enhance profitability through strategic expansions in 5G messaging, digital workforce solutions, and education industry partnerships. Positive Improved gross profit margin from negative 1.1% to 3.7% in 2023. Net revenue decreased by 12.9% to RMB440.5 million in 2023. Net loss increased to RMB382.8 million in 2023 compared to RMB196.6 million in 2022. Strategic shift towards IT system design services contributed to improved profitability. Plans for 2024 include expanding operations in 5G messaging, digital solutions, and education industry partnerships. Negative Significant decrease in revenue from educational content services. Impairment of assets led to a negative impact on profitability. Operating expenses increased to RMB399.0 million in 2023. Net loss almost doubled in 2023 compared to 2022. Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets affected financial performance. Financial Analyst Reviewing Jianzhi Education Technology Group's financial results reveals a company navigating through a turbulent period. The 12.9% decline in net revenues year-over-year signifies a contraction in their core business, particularly within educational content services. This contraction could raise concerns among investors regarding the company's ability to maintain market share and revenue streams in a competitive digital education sector. However, the shift towards IT-related solution services, which saw a 22.6% increase in net revenue, indicates a strategic pivot that may offer a new growth avenue. This diversification could be perceived positively if the market views it as a sustainable and profitable segment.Notably, there was a significant improvement in gross profit, turning a gross loss into a profit year-over-year. This suggests that Jianzhi's cost optimization strategies, possibly through reduced investment in less profitable segments and a focus on higher-margin IT services, are bearing fruit. However, the stark 94.7% increase in net loss is alarming and could overshadow the gross profit achievement, pointing to substantial operational challenges. The losses were compounded by asset impairments, which while described as non-recurring, may still prompt investors to scrutinize the company's asset management and future risk of similar write-downs.Furthermore, the ADS Ratio Change effectively functions as a reverse stock split, which companies often use to shore up stock prices and maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements. This may indicate underlying concerns about the company's valuation and could be a red flag for investors. Overall, while Jianzhi is taking steps to adapt to market conditions, the financial performance suggests a period of uncertainty and potential volatility for the company's stock. Market Research Analyst The digital education industry in China is highly dynamic, influenced by government policies and technological advancements. Jianzhi's decision to reduce investment in educational content services is reflective of the broader industry trend where companies are seeking to align with national policies and new market demands post-Covid. The pivot towards customized IT system design and development services aligns with the growing digitalization of education and the workforce. The company's ability to secure new cloud-based customers and expand operations in areas such as 5G messaging and digital workforce solutions could position it well within the technology integration space.However, the termination of the partnership with China Telecom and the subsequent revenue decline from mobile video packages signal potential challenges in the B2C segment. This may suggest difficulties in sustaining consumer-based revenue streams or adapting to changes in consumer preferences. The reported decline in subscriptions on the 'Fish Learning' platform further underscores the importance of continuously updating and improving content to retain and attract customers.The company's strategic partnerships with telecom operators could be a critical move to leverage infrastructure and broaden its service offerings. As Jianzhi seeks to capitalize on emerging opportunities, its success will likely depend on its ability to execute its revised strategy effectively and differentiate itself in a crowded market. Stakeholders should monitor the company's progress in enhancing its IT solutions portfolio and its impact on revenue diversification and long-term profitability. 04/09/2024 - 04:30 PM BEIJING, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jianzhi Education Technology Group Company Limited (the “Company” or “Jianzhi”) (NASDAQ: JZ), a leading provider of digital educational content in China, today announced its financial results for fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Net revenues were 440.5 million (US$62.0 million) for fiscal year 2023, compared to RMB505.7 million during the same period in 2022.Gross profit was RMB16.2 million (US$2.3 million) for fiscal year 2023, and a gross loss of RMB5.5 million for the same period in 2022.Net loss for 2023 was RMB382.8 million (US$53.9 million), compared to net loss of RMB196.6 million during the same period in 2022. The following table sets forth a summary of the consolidated results of operations for the years indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, 20222023 RMB RMB US$ % Change (in million, except for percentages) Net revenues 505.7 440.5 62.0 (12.9%)Gross (loss) profit (5.5)16.2 2.3 394.5%Loss from operations (207.4)(382.8)(53.9) 84.6%Net loss (196.6)(382.8)(53.9) 94.7% Mr. Yong Hu, CEO of the Company, commented: “In 2023, the Company faced a challenging year marked by policy headwinds and the evolving landscape of the vocational education industry following the Covid pandemic. To effectively respond to these changes, the Company proactively adjusted its strategy. It pursued a two-pronged approach by reducing investment in the educational content services segment while cementing efforts to expand its highly profitable customized IT system design and development services.” “As a result of these strategic actions, the Company recorded a top line of RMB440.5 million, with a gross profit of RMB16.2 million for the fiscal year 2023. This represents a significant improvement compared to the previous year’s corresponding period, which recorded a gross loss of RMB5.5 million. It is important to note that the Company’s overall profitability was temporarily affected by the impairment of assets resulting from the reduced procurement of courses and subscriptions to course content in the educational content services division. However, it is our firm belief that this impairment of customized courseware assets is non-recurring and we anticipate this will not have a sustained impact on the Company’s future profitability.” “Looking ahead to 2024, the Company has undertaken a comprehensive reassessment of its business strategy with the primary objective of restoring and enhancing its profitability. To achieve this, the Company will vigorously expand its operations in critical business areas that align with national policies, such as 5G messaging, digital workforce solutions, and the education industry. Furthermore, the Company will establish strategic partnerships with telecom operators in China, across multiple provinces to facilitate the successful implementation of these strategic plans.” “In addition to these initiatives, the Company remains dedicated to collaborating with vocational institutions to design and develop cutting-edge courses. Through comprehensive teaching and training, our ultimate goal is to provide students with a distinguished 1+X certification. Here, the ‘1’ signifies specialized proficiency in a specific field or industry, while ‘X’ represents a series of certificates within the same professional domain.” Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results: Net revenues For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue decreased by 12.9% from RMB505.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to RMB440.5 million (US$62 million). This decrease was primarily driven by the net effects of a decrease of RMB133.2 million (US$18.8 million) in revenue generated from educational content services and other services, partially offset by an increase of RMB68.0 million in net revenues from the provision of IT related solution services. Educational content service and other services. Net revenue from the educational content service and other services decreased by RMB133.2 million (US$18.8 million) to RMB71.7 million (US$10.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, from RMB204.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to: (i) a decrease of RMB112.3 million (US$15.8 million), or 100% in revenue from offering selected mobile video package to end mobile users under a B2C model through our cooperation with a subsidiary of China Telecom, primarily because the Company terminated corporation with China Telecom, and (ii) a decrease of revenues by RMB23.3 million (US$3.3 million) in “Fish Learning” platform. Such decrease in revenues were primarily because we did not provide new and attractive contents on the platform leading to decreased subscriptions form end customers. IT related solution services. Net revenue from IT related solution services increased by RMB68.0 million (US$9.6 million), or 22.6% to RMB368.8 million (US$51.9 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023 from RMB300.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to acquisition of new cloud-based customers in the year of 2023 in design and development of customized IT system. The following table sets forth a breakdown of the revenue by business segments for the years indicated: 2022 2023 RMB RMB US$ (in million)Educational content service and other services – Educational content service – B2B2C 51.5 28.6 4.0 – B2C 149.7 4.5 0.6 – Other services 3.7 38.7 5.4 Subtotal 204.9 71.7 10.1 IT related solution services – Design and development of customized IT system 71.4 243.3 34.3 – Procurement and assembling of equipment 228.4 125.4 17.7 – Technological support and maintenance 1.0 - - Subtotal 300.8 368.8 51.9 Total revenues 505.7 440.5 62.0 Cost of revenues Cost of revenues decreased by 17.0% to RMB424.3 million (US$59.8 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, from RMB511.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of cost of revenues was primarily attributable to the decrease of RMB32.0 million (US$4.5 million) in amortization of educational contents as we impaired educational contents in the year of 2023 and 2022, and decrease of RMB132.9 million (US$18.7 million) in material costs used for educational content service and other services with decreased subscriptions from end customers and decreased orders from high schools, partially offset by an increase of RMB65.4 million (US$9.2 million) in purchase of IT equipment for IT related solution services. Compared with the decrease in revenues growth, the higher percentage of decrease in cost of revenues was mainly attributable to the higher gross profit we earned from IT solution services in the year of 2023 as compared with that in the year of 2022. Gross profit As a result of the foregoing, the Company reported a gross profit of RMB16.2 million (US$2.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a gross loss of RMB5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company’s gross profit margin improved to 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 from negative 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The improvement was mainly due to an increase in the gross profits margin for IT related solution services for the year ended December 31, 2023, because we were primarily engaged in IT design and development services for customers in the year of 2023, as compared with procurement and assembling equipment projects in the year of 2022. The profit margin was higher in IT design and development services than procurement and assembling equipment projects. Operating expenses The total operating expenses increased to RMB399.0 million (US$56.2 million) for the year ended December 31, 2023, from RMB202.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Sales and Marketing Expenses: The sales and marketing expenses was RMB7.6 million (US$1.1 million) and RMB7.1 million for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. This increase was mainly driven by an increase of RMB0.3 million in salary and welfare expenses because we incurred compensation expense, and an increase of $0.3 million in travel and entertainment expenses.General and Administrative Expenses: The general and administrative expenses decreased to RMB22.2 million (US$3.1 million) for the fiscal year 2023 from RMB53.2 million for the fiscal year 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of RMB34.5 million in allowance of doubtful accounts from a provision of doubtful allowance of RMB36.0 million for the year of 2022 to a provision of RMB1.5 million for the same period of 2023, partially offset by an increase of RMB2.1 million in professional expenses associated with our IPO in August 2022.Research and Development Expenses: The research and development expenses decreased to RMB11.8 million (US$1.7 million) for 2023 from RMB15.6 million for 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by a decrease of RMB3.2 million in outsourced labor costs, because the Company further reduced its expenditures on development of new educational contents.Impairment of goodwill: The Company did not provide impairment of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2023. It provided full impairment of RMB7.7 million against goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was caused by termination of business partnership with a major customer and it was assessed that the fair value of the reporting unit would exceed its carrying amount.Impairment of other non-current assets: For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company provided impairment of non-current assets, including long-term prepayment, educational contents and intangible assets. The details were as the following: Impairment of long-term prepayments: As of December 31, 2023, the Company reviewed the long-term prepayments for educational content. It expected that these educational contents would be outdated when they are delivered to the Company. The cash flows generated from subscription for these educational contents may not cover the purchase price. Accordingly, the Company charged impairment of RMB155.3 million (US$21.9 million) against long-term prepayments for the year ended December 31, 2023.Impairment of intangible assets: For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company assessed that its current software and technology would not support newly purchased educational contents. The Company charged impairment of RMB4.6 million (US$0.6 million) and RMB12.1 million against software and technology, respectively.Impairment of educational contents: For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, because certain contents were obsolete, the Company assessed that it is not likely that end customers would subscribe for related educational contents. The Company charged impairment of RMB197.5 million (US$27.8 million) and RMB106.1 million against purchased educational contents, respectively. Income Tax benefit (expenses) The Company reported income tax expenses of RMB0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared with income tax benefits of RMB11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, this was because the Company utilized net operating loss carried forwards in the year of 2023. Net loss As a result of the foregoing, the Company reported net loss of RMB382.8 million (US$53.9 million), compared with RMB196.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

CENTENE SUBSIDIARY MERIDIAN IN MICHIGAN AWARDED MICHIGAN MEDICAID CONTRACTS,2024-04-09T20:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Centene 's subsidiary, Meridian in Michigan, secures a Medicaid health plan contract to serve nearly 2 million Michiganders until 2029, emphasizing quality care and community partnerships.","CENTENE SUBSIDIARY MERIDIAN IN MICHIGAN AWARDED MICHIGAN MEDICAID CONTRACTS Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Centene 's subsidiary, Meridian in Michigan, secures a Medicaid health plan contract to serve nearly 2 million Michiganders until 2029, emphasizing quality care and community partnerships. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Policy Analyst The continuation of Centene's subsidiary Meridian to serve as a Medicaid health plan under the new contract with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services represents a significant reaffirmation of the company's foothold in the state's healthcare system. The contract's duration, extending potentially until 2032 with optional extensions, ensures long-term stability for Centene in the Michigan market. This stability is important for forecasting financial performance and managing operational logistics.Medicaid contracts are often substantial revenue sources for managed care organizations. The renewal of such contracts typically indicates a provider's compliance with state health standards and a positive track record in managing Medicaid plans. This can be seen as a vote of confidence from the MDHHS, potentially leading to an enhanced reputation among investors and within the healthcare industry. However, the financial implications will depend on the terms of the contract and the company's efficiency in managing the allocated resources.From a policy perspective, the emphasis on creating a more equitable and person-centered system of care aligns with broader national healthcare trends. This focus on equity and patient-centered care may lead to increased member satisfaction and retention, which can translate into more stable revenue streams for Centene. Healthcare Financial Analyst Centene Corporation's announcement regarding Meridian's selection for the Medicaid contract in Michigan has direct implications for the company's financial health. The contract, covering a substantial portion of the state's Medicaid population, is likely to contribute significantly to Centene's revenue. Given the company's extensive experience in managing Medicaid contracts across multiple states, Centene is likely well-positioned to capitalize on economies of scale and operational efficiencies.The impact on the stock market will hinge on investors' perceptions of the contract's profitability and the company's ability to meet or exceed service delivery expectations. Investors typically look for growth opportunities and a five-year contract with possible extensions provides a predictable income stream that can be factored into the company's valuation. However, it's important to monitor how the contract affects the company's margins, especially considering potential investments required to meet the state's healthcare pillars.Furthermore, the healthcare sector is sensitive to regulatory changes and any shifts in Medicaid funding or policy at the federal or state level could affect the contract's terms and Centene's obligations. Investors should keep a close eye on such developments. Healthcare Market Analyst The renewal of Meridian's contract to manage Medicaid plans in Michigan reflects the company's competitive positioning within the healthcare market. With a focus on innovation and equitable care solutions, Meridian appears to be aligning with current market trends that prioritize value-based care and social determinants of health. This could enhance the company's market share and strengthen its relationship with state healthcare systems.Market analysts would assess the broader implications of this contract on Centene's market position. The selection of Meridian to serve 44 counties indicates a robust geographic footprint, which is often associated with increased market influence and bargaining power with healthcare providers. The company's long-term experience in the region and the commitment to invest in key areas identified by stakeholders may also lead to improved health outcomes, which can be a differentiator in a competitive market.It is essential to consider the competitive landscape, as being one of nine Medicaid managed care organizations in the state means Meridian must maintain high standards of service to retain its contract in future bidding processes. The company's performance in Michigan could serve as a case study for other states evaluating their Medicaid managed care options. 04/09/2024 - 04:30 PM ST. LOUIS, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Centene Corporation (NYSE: CNC), a leading healthcare enterprise committed to helping people live healthier lives, announced today that its subsidiary, Meridian in Michigan (Meridian), has been selected by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) to continue to serve as a Medicaid health plan for the Comprehensive Health Care Program, which serves nearly 2 million Michiganders statewide. The proposed Medicaid contracts are expected to begin on October 1, 2024, and run through September 30, 2029, with three, one-year optional extensions. ""It's an honor to continue Meridian's decades of serving the people of Michigan,"" said Centene Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Sarah London. ""We are grateful to MDHHS for putting our communities and Medicaid members at the center of this process. We look forward to working with our local partners to continue to deliver access to high-quality care while keeping the perspective of our members at the forefront."" Founded in 1997, Meridian has 27 years of experience developing and maintaining a Medicaid network in Michigan. Centene manages Medicaid contracts across 31 states. Meridian was selected to serve 44 counties in the Lower Peninsula and will be one of nine Medicaid managed care organizations providing physical, dental, pharmacy, prescription and transportation services. ""We are excited to have the opportunity to continue supporting the healthcare needs of Medicaid members across the state,"" said Meridian CEO, Chris Priest. ""For 27 years, Meridian has been a leader in Michigan pioneering innovative, equitable care solutions that help our members live better, healthier lives. We look forward to building on our existing efforts and community partnerships to increase access, improve health outcomes and address social needs for members statewide."" The rebidding process and priorities for the Medicaid contract in Michigan were driven by feedback from nearly 10,000 stakeholders across the state, including enrollees and family members, healthcare providers, health plans and other community partners, as part of the MIHealthyLife initiative to provide quality, comprehensive healthcare. As a result of feedback from Michiganders, MDHHS required health plans to commit to and invest in key pillars to ""create a more equitable, coordinated, and person-centered system of care."" Meridian's contract bid highlighted its past and ongoing commitments in the areas Michiganders said they care about most, including child and whole-person health, health equity, innovation, community impact and operational excellence.

Turtle Beach Announces Update on Its Return of Capital Strategy to Shareholders,2024-04-09T20:18:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Turtle Beach  (HEAR) increases share repurchase authorization to $55 million in response to positive market reaction and strong share price performance. The Board of Directors cancels previously announced tender offer due to shares trading above proposed range, opting for increased share repurchase program to return capital to shareholders.","Turtle Beach Announces Update on Its Return of Capital Strategy to Shareholders Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Turtle Beach (HEAR) increases share repurchase authorization to $55 million in response to positive market reaction and strong share price performance. The Board of Directors cancels previously announced tender offer due to shares trading above proposed range, opting for increased share repurchase program to return capital to shareholders. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in Turtle Beach Corporation's share repurchase authorization from an initial plan of a tender offer to a larger repurchase program reflects a strategic shift in capital allocation. This decision likely comes after evaluating the company's stock performance post-PDP acquisition, which has seen a significant rise in share price. By opting for a share repurchase program, the company is signaling confidence in its current valuation and future prospects. For shareholders, this could be seen as a positive move, as repurchases can often lead to earnings per share accretion and can be a signal of undervaluation. However, it's important to monitor how this aligns with the company's long-term growth strategy and whether it will affect its ability to invest in future opportunities. Market Research Analyst The gaming accessory industry, where Turtle Beach operates, is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes. The company's decision to cancel the tender offer and instead increase its share repurchase authorization indicates a shift in how it perceives its market position and capital needs. With the acquisition of PDP, Turtle Beach has expanded its market reach and product portfolio. The market's reaction to this acquisition and the subsequent increase in share price suggests investor confidence. However, it is essential to consider the impact of this repurchase strategy on the company's liquidity and whether it will constrain its ability to respond to market changes or invest in R&D, which is critical in this industry. Economist From an economic perspective, the alteration in Turtle Beach's capital return strategy can be seen as a reaction to market conditions and investor sentiment. The company's shares trading above the proposed tender offer range indicates a higher market valuation than anticipated. This scenario might reflect broader economic trends, such as investor optimism in the tech and gaming sectors, or firm-specific factors such as successful integration of PDP. The repurchase program could be a more flexible and cost-effective method of returning capital to shareholders compared to a tender offer, especially if the latter is expected to have limited participation. It's important to consider the broader economic context, including interest rates and market liquidity, as these factors will influence the effectiveness and timing of the share repurchases. 04/09/2024 - 04:18 PM Increases Share Repurchase Authorization to $55 Million to Honor Continued Commitment to Return Capital to Shareholders Share Repurchase Authorization Replaces Previously Announced Tender Offer Given Underlying Shares Are Now Trading 11% Above Previously Communicated Top End of Proposed Tender Offer Range Board of Directors Will Continue to Aggressively Assess Mechanisms to Create Shareholder Value WHITE PLAINS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Leading gaming accessory maker Turtle Beach Corporation (Nasdaq: HEAR) (“Turtle Beach” or the “Company”) announced today its Board of Directors has modified its previously communicated near-term return of capital plan to shareholders, given the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Company’s recent transformational acquisition of Performance Designed Products (“PDP”) and the strong underlying trading price of the Company’s shares. With today’s announcement, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) no longer intends to launch the previously announced modified “Dutch auction” Tender Offer (the “Tender Offer”) to purchase up to $30 million of its common stock (the “Common Stock”) at a price per share not less than $13.75 per share and not greater than $15.00 per share. Since the acquisition of PDP and the intent to launch the Tender Offer was announced on March 13, 2024, the average trading price of the Company’s shares has surpassed the highest end of the Tender Offer range indicated, with the most recent closing price of the shares 11-21% above the range, and the Board believes the proposed Tender Offer would only receive limited participation. The Board has determined that launching a tender offer estimated to receive only limited participation would not achieve the Company’s objectives while at the same time creating significant and unneeded costs for the Company that are not in the best interests of investors. In its continued effort to evaluate capital allocation priorities, the Board has determined that the best course of action to continue to return capital to shareholders is to increase the Company’s share repurchase program by $30 million. Under the revised share repurchase authorization, the Company is authorized to acquire up to a total of $55 million of shares of its common stock, including the $8.4 million already acquired under the program, at its discretion from time to time in the open market, or in block purchases or privately negotiated transactions, subject to compliance with the applicable restrictions in the Company’s debt agreements. The current balance remaining for the repurchase program, including today’s increased authorization, is $46.6 million. Terry Jimenez, Chairman of the Board, states: “The Board of Directors is excited about the future of the Company and we are encouraged by the positive response of our investors to the significant changes underway at Turtle Beach. On behalf of the Board, we look forward to meaningful value creation opportunities for the Company and its shareholders. Increasing our share repurchase program is confirmation of the confidence the Board has in the Company’s cash generation outlook, expanded earnings power, and continued operational excellence.” The Company expects to announce further details regarding the stock repurchase authorization in connection with the issuance of its first quarter 2024 earnings in May. The amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. Turtle Beach intends to fund the share repurchases using cash from operations or short-term borrowings and may suspend or discontinue repurchases at any time.

The company will not implement a reverse split at this time. Top line results for the Phase 3 OnTarget trial of crofelemer for cancer therapy-related diarrhea are expected soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Jaguar Health's announcement regarding the absence of a reverse stock split and the extension of the grace period to meet Nasdaq's $1.00 bid price requirement indicates a strategic decision by the company's management to avoid immediate dilution of shareholder value. This decision suggests a level of confidence in the company's ability to organically improve stock price, possibly linked to the anticipated success of the Phase 3 OnTarget trial of crofelemer.Investors should note that the company's ability to maintain its Nasdaq listing without a reverse split could be a positive sign, as it implies management's belief in potential value-driving events in the near term. However, the risk of non-compliance remains if the stock price does not recover, which could lead to volatility and speculative trading behavior. Medical Research Analyst The upcoming top line results from the Phase 3 OnTarget trial of crofelemer are significant for Jaguar Health. The trial's success could not only validate the efficacy of crofelemer as a preventative treatment for cancer therapy-related diarrhea but also potentially open up a new market segment for the company. This indication addresses a common and distressing side effect of cancer treatment, which currently has limited options for prophylaxis.Investors should consider the implications of the trial's outcome on the company's future revenue streams and market positioning. A successful trial could lead to increased interest from healthcare providers and patients, while failure might result in a setback for the company's growth strategy. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market dynamics for cancer supportive care products is important for evaluating Jaguar's potential growth. The demand for treatments that can prevent side effects of cancer therapy, such as diarrhea, is growing as the global cancer incidence rises. Should crofelemer prove effective, Jaguar may capture a significant share of this niche market, which is currently underserved.Market adoption will depend on factors such as the drug's cost-effectiveness, reimbursement policies and competition from other treatments. Investors should monitor the market's response to the trial results, as it will influence Jaguar's commercial strategy and partnership opportunities. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM Company not implementing a reverse split at this timeTop line results forthcoming for company's phase 3 OnTarget trial of crofelemer for preventative treatment of cancer therapy-related diarrheaSAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 9, 2024 / Jaguar Health, Inc.

(“Medicenna” or the “Company”) (TSX: MDNA), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on the development of Superkines, presented updated clinical results from the monotherapy dose escalation and ongoing expansion portions of the Phase 1/2 ABILITY-1 (A Beta-only IL-2 ImmunoTherapY) study evaluating MDNA11, a long-acting ‘beta-enhanced not-alpha’ interleukin-2 (IL-2) super-agonist, in patients with advanced solid tumors, at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) held in San Diego, CA, on April 9th, 2024. “Although early, we have been impressed with MDNA11’s single agent activity demonstrating a response rate of 29% and clinical benefit rate of 50% in patients with advanced solid tumors who have all failed prior immunotherapies,” said Fahar Merchant, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Medicenna. “We are very encouraged by a new partial response in a 85 year-old MSI-High patient with small bowel cancer and are particularly pleased with 100% reduction of all baseline target lesions in two of the four partial responders which includes a pancreatic cancer and a melanoma patient. MDNA11 continues to demonstrate its best-in-class potential. To further expedite the study, new sites in the US and Korea have started enrolment in the ongoing monotherapy expansion and combination escalation arms of the ABILITY-1 study as we look forward to reporting additional data at a medical conference in the first half of 2024.” Key findings from the monotherapy dose escalation and ongoing expansion portions of the ABILITY-1 study at the time of data cut-off (i.e. March 22, 2024) include: Acceptable safety profile: No dose limiting toxicity (DLT) reported and no evidence of vascular leak syndrome (VLS). The vast majority (95%) of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were of grade 1-2 and resolved within 48 hours; grade 3 TRAEs mainly constituted asymptomatic transient LFT elevations; no grade 4 or 5 events were reported. Encouraging single-agent anti-tumor activity at doses of ≥ 60 µg/kg in phase 2 eligible patients (N=14) who were all resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors: Partial response reported for four patients with aggressive tumor types who had progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitors: A pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (MSI-H) patient with primary resistance to pembrolizumab who was treated with MDNA11 (60 µg/kg) showed 100% resolution of all baseline lesions at week 66. A new lymph node lesion developed during a 8-week MDNA11 treatment break (vacation) was treated with a single course of radiotherapy prior to resumption of MDNA11. All baseline lesions remained completely resolved and the new lymph node lesion was <10 mm (considered physiological per RECIST v1.1), and MDNA11 treatment ended at week 90 while follow-up continues.A patient with cutaneous melanoma progressed on dual checkpoint inhibitors, was treated with MDNA11 (90 µg/kg), and showed 100% resolution of the target lesion at weeks 28 and 36 with continuing reduction of the non-target lesions. Patient remains on MDNA11 treatment.A second checkpoint-resistant cutaneous melanoma patient (nivolumab & rechallenge) showed partial response on MDNA11 (90 µg/kg) with a 31.25% reduction of target lesion at week 12 following pseudo-progression at week 8. A new lymph node lesion developed at week 16 while baseline target and non-target lesions remained stable or decreased. Patient remains on MDNA11 treatment.An 85-year-old small bowel cancer (MSI-H) patient with secondary resistance to pembrolizumab showed partial response on MDNA11 (90 µg/kg) at week 20 with 37% reduction in target lesions. Patient remains on MDNA11 treatment. Durable stable disease (SD) for ≥ 24 weeks with shrinkage of target lesions observed in three metastatic melanoma patients: Two patients (acral and cutaneous) with SD for >24 weeks on MDNA11 (120 µg/kg).A third patient (cutaneous) with SD for > 1.5 years started on MDNA11 at 10 µg/kg dose and was subsequently dose escalated to 30, 60 and 90 µg/kg. MDNA11 continues to exhibit potent effector immune profile with sustained peripheral expansion of cytotoxic CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells with minimal impact on immunosuppressive Tregs. CD8/Treg ratio and activation markers (CD25+ and OX40+) showed peak increase in CD8+ T cells at the Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE, 90 µg/kg Q2W IV). OX40 on Tregs also peaked at the RDE but in contrast to CD8+ T cells, it leads to impairment of their immune suppressive function. Monotherapy expansion is continuing to enroll patients with metastatic melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers (cSCC, MCC, and BCC) and MSI-H/dMMR tumors. Combination dose escalation has also commenced. A copy of the poster and a related slide deck have been posted to the “Scientific Presentations” page of Medicenna’s website. About MDNA11 MDNA11 is a long-acting ‘beta-enhanced not-alpha’ interleukin-2 (IL-2) Superkine specifically engineered to overcome the shortcomings of aldesleukin and other next generation IL-2 variants by preferentially activating immune effector cells (CD4+ T, CD8+ T and NK cells) responsible for killing cancer cells, with minimal or no stimulation of immunosuppressive Tregs. These unique proprietary features of the IL-2 Superkine have been achieved by incorporating seven specific mutations and genetically fusing it to a recombinant human albumin scaffold to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and pharmacological activity of MDNA11 due to albumin’s natural propensity to accumulate in highly vascularized sites, in particular tumor and tumor draining lymph nodes. MDNA11 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1/2 ABILITY-1 study as both a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). About Medicenna Medicenna is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on developing novel, highly selective versions of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 Superkines and first-in-class Empowered Superkines. Medicenna’s long-acting IL-2 Superkine, MDNA11, is a next-generation IL-2 with superior affinity toward CD122 (IL-2 receptor beta) and no CD25 (IL-2 receptor alpha) binding, thereby preferentially stimulating cancer-killing effector T cells and NK cells. Medicenna’s IL-4 Empowered Superkine, bizaxofusp (formerly MDNA55), has been studied in 5 clinical trials enrolling over 130 patients, including a Phase 2b trial for recurrent GBM, the most common and uniformly fatal form of brain cancer. Bizaxofusp has obtained FastTrack and Orphan Drug status from the FDA and FDA/EMA, respectively. Medicenna’s early-stage BiSKITs™ (Bifunctional SuperKine ImmunoTherapies) and the T-MASK™ (Targeted Metalloprotease Activated SuperKine) programs are designed to enhance the ability of Superkines to treat immunologically “cold” tumors.

Citigroup Announces $2.75 Billion Redemption of 3.352% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Notes due 2025,2024-04-09T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Citigroup Inc. announces the redemption of $2.75 billion of its 3.352% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Notes due 2025, reflecting its liability management strategy and commitment to optimizing funding and capital structure.","Citigroup Announces $2.75 Billion Redemption of 3.352% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Notes due 2025 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Citigroup Inc. announces the redemption of $2.75 billion of its 3.352% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Notes due 2025, reflecting its liability management strategy and commitment to optimizing funding and capital structure. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision by Citigroup to redeem the $2.75 billion in fixed/floating rate notes ahead of their 2025 maturity date is a strategic move to optimize its capital structure. This action suggests that Citigroup is proactively managing its debt portfolio to reduce interest expenses, which can positively affect its net interest margin (NIM). By redeeming these notes, Citigroup could potentially lower its cost of capital, which is beneficial for shareholders as it may lead to an improved return on equity (ROE).Furthermore, this redemption indicates that Citigroup is taking advantage of the current market conditions, possibly implying that they perceive the redemption costs to be lower than the carrying costs of the notes until maturity. This is a common practice among financial institutions looking to streamline their funding strategies and it often reflects a strong liquidity position. Investors should note that such redemptions can also lead to a temporary increase in cash outflows, which Citigroup deems manageable within its current financial framework. Market Research Analyst The announcement by Citigroup may signal to the market that the company is confident in its liquidity and financial health. By redeeming these notes, Citigroup is effectively communicating that it has sufficient cash reserves to manage pre-maturity redemptions without compromising operational funding. This can be interpreted as a positive indicator by investors, potentially leading to a favorable impact on Citigroup's stock price.From a broader market perspective, such redemptions can influence the dynamics of the debt market, especially if followed by other financial institutions. It can affect the supply and demand for similar financial instruments, possibly leading to tighter credit spreads for Citigroup's future debt issuances. In the long term, this could result in more favorable borrowing conditions for the bank. Economist Looking at the macroeconomic context, Citigroup's redemption of debt notes can be seen as a response to the prevailing interest rate environment. With the anticipation of fluctuating interest rates, financial institutions like Citigroup may aim to lock in lower rates by retiring higher-cost debt and potentially refinancing at more favorable terms. This is a prudent approach in an uncertain rate environment and can help Citigroup better manage interest rate risk.Additionally, the action taken by Citigroup may reflect its assessment of regulatory changes and their potential impact on capital requirements. Efficient capital management is important for banks to meet regulatory standards and optimize their financial performance. By adjusting its debt portfolio, Citigroup is likely aligning its capital structure with expected regulatory frameworks, which is essential for maintaining its competitive edge in the global banking sector. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Citigroup Inc. is announcing the redemption, in whole, constituting $2,750,000,000 of its 3.352% Fixed Rate / Floating Rate Notes due 2025 (the “notes”) (ISIN: US172967MF56). The redemption date for the notes is April 24, 2024 (the “redemption date”). The cash redemption price for the notes payable on the redemption date will equal par plus accrued and unpaid interest, to but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption announced today is consistent with Citigroup's liability management strategy, and reflects its ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency of its funding and capital structure. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to redeem or repurchase securities, based on several factors, including without limitation, the economic value, regulatory changes, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs, the overall remaining tenor of Citigroup's debt portfolio, capital impact, as well as overall market conditions. Beginning on the redemption date, interest will no longer accrue on the notes. Citibank, N.A. is the paying agent for the notes.

Cal Water Secures $83 Million in Additional State Funding to Relieve Customers of Past-Due Balances Accumulated During Pandemic,2024-04-09T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Positive,California Water Service (CWT) receives over $83.0 million through California Extended Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program to assist customers with past-due balances from COVID-19.,"Cal Water Secures $83 Million in Additional State Funding to Relieve Customers of Past-Due Balances Accumulated During Pandemic Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary California Water Service (CWT) receives over $83.0 million through California Extended Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program to assist customers with past-due balances from COVID-19. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The infusion of $83 million into California Water Service through the Extended Program is a significant liquidity event for the company. This funding directly addresses the receivables on their balance sheet, particularly the past-due balances. From a financial perspective, this improves Cal Water's cash flow situation and reduces the credit risk associated with uncollected receivables.For investors, the immediate effect would likely be positive, as the company's financial health appears bolstered. However, it's essential to evaluate the sustainability of this improvement. Investors should consider whether this is a one-time benefit or if there will be ongoing support mechanisms. Additionally, the impact on the company's revenue recognition should be assessed, as the forgiveness of these arrears could lead to adjustments in reported revenues. Economist The allocation of funds from the Extended Program reflects a broader economic support strategy to mitigate the financial aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This has implications for both the utility sector and the overall economic health of California. By relieving customers of their past-due balances, Cal Water is likely to see a decrease in payment defaults, which could have had a ripple effect on the local economy.Furthermore, this program may serve as a model for other states dealing with similar issues, potentially influencing utility regulation and customer support across the nation. The long-term economic benefits include bolstered consumer confidence and spending power, as customers are not burdened with water debt. However, it is also important to monitor the source of these funds and any long-term fiscal responsibilities that may fall upon taxpayers or other stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Understanding the market response to such financial support programs is crucial. Typically, the market views the reduction of debt positively, especially in the utility sector, where consistent revenue streams are paramount. For Cal Water, this could improve their competitive position in the market by potentially allowing for more flexibility in future pricing strategies or infrastructure investments.It's also worth noting customer satisfaction and retention could be positively impacted, as financial relief often translates into improved customer relations. Over time, this could lead to a stronger brand reputation and increased loyalty, which are important intangible assets that can contribute to a company's market value. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM SAN JOSE, Calif., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- With financial impacts of COVID-19 felt by California Water Service (Cal Water) customers well past the height of the pandemic, Cal Water applied for and has received more than $83.0 million through the California Extended Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program (Extended Program) to relieve residential and commercial customers of past-due balances incurred during the pandemic. The Extended Program, administered by the State Water Resources Control Board, enables water suppliers to apply for financial support on behalf of customers. Cal Water first secured more than $20.8 million about two years ago through the original Water & Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program (Original Program) for past-due balances incurred by residential and commercial customers between March 4, 2020, and June 15, 2021. Through the Extended Program, past-due debt incurred between June 16, 2021, and December 31, 2022, became eligible. Cal Water will apply credits to affected customers’ accounts in the second quarter of 2024. Customers across all of Cal Water’s service areas will be notified directly if a credit will be applied to their accounts.

Matt, and Right Coast Spirits. The partnership aims to offer a unique drinking experience with Lemon Vodka Freeze and Cherry Vodka Chill hitting shelves in April. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of Right Coast Spirits Italian Ice as the first brand to be packed in Drinktainer™ through the collaboration between O-I Glass, F.X. Matt and Right Coast Spirits represents a strategic move to differentiate in the competitive RTD market. The decision to utilize the Drinktainer™ packaging could potentially influence consumer preference due to its unique design and sensory appeal. The 375ml Straightwall Drinktainer™ four packs are likely positioned to target a segment of consumers looking for convenience and novelty in their alcoholic beverage choices.From a market perspective, the collaboration leverages existing relationships and contract packing capabilities, which could streamline the process of bringing a product to market. This agility in production and distribution may provide Right Coast Spirits with a first-mover advantage in a niche segment, potentially capturing market share before competitors can respond. The timing of the release, coinciding with warmer weather, is also strategic as it aligns with increased consumer demand for refreshing beverages. Packaging Innovation Expert Drinktainer™ represents an innovation in the beverage packaging industry with its wide mouth opening and RipCap® closure. These features are designed to enhance the consumer's drinking experience by maximizing aroma and flavor, which can be a differentiating factor on retail shelves. The choice of a recyclable glass container resonates with growing consumer trends favoring sustainable and eco-friendly packaging solutions.However, the success of this new packaging form will depend on consumer adoption and the perceived value it brings. While the design is modern and may attract attention, it is essential to consider the implications of cost, both to the manufacturer and consumer and whether the market is ready to embrace this new format over traditional RTD packaging options. Financial Analyst The announcement of this product launch could have implications for the stock market performance of O-I Glass and its partners. Investors will be looking at the potential revenue growth from this new offering and its impact on the bottom line. The partnership and contract packing arrangement with F.X. Matt, leveraging a long-standing relationship, could imply cost-efficiencies and a strong distribution strategy.It's important to monitor the consumer reception of the Drinktainer™ packed Italian Ice RTD beverages as it will directly affect sales volume and, consequently, financial outcomes. Additionally, the scalability of the Drinktainer™ line and its adoption by other brands under the F.X. Matt contract packing services will be critical in determining the long-term financial impact of this innovation. 04/09/2024 - 04:15 PM Right Coast Spirits Italian Ice to be first brand packed in DrinktainerTM via O-I and FX Matt contract packing collaboration Release pairs the sleek, modern design of Drinktainer™ with refreshing, vodka based RTD (Ready-to-Drink) beverage Perrysburg, Ohio, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- O-I Glass, Inc.

"Nasdaq Announces End of Month Open Short Interest Positions in Nasdaq Stocks as of Settlement Date March 28, 2024",2024-04-09T20:11:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Short interest in Nasdaq securities increased slightly at the end of March 2024 compared to the previous reporting period.

The total short interest for Nasdaq securities was 13,182,823,216 shares, with an average daily volume of 2.40 days. Short interest in Nasdaq Global Market securities was 11,297,406,980 shares, while short interest in Nasdaq Capital Market securities was 1,885,416,236 shares. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in short interest across Nasdaq-listed securities may signal a collective market sentiment of cautiousness or pessimism among investors. Short selling, the practice of selling securities that traders do not own, is often used as a hedge against anticipated price declines or as a speculative position. The slight uptick in short interest, from 11,183,649,858 to 11,297,406,980 shares, suggests that more investors are expecting prices to fall in the near future.However, it's important to note that short interest is just one indicator and doesn't always predict market movements accurately. The data shows a marginal increase in the average days to cover short positions, from 2.75 to 2.78 days for the Global Market and 1.18 to 1.32 days for the Capital Market. This indicates that while there may be a growing bearish sentiment, it is not a drastic change. Stakeholders should consider this information in the context of broader market trends and other economic indicators. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the reported short interest figures can impact individual stock prices and can sometimes be a precursor to volatility. As short sellers eventually need to buy back shares to cover their positions, high short interest can lead to a short squeeze, where the price of a stock rises sharply as short sellers rush to cover their positions. This is a scenario that traders and investors may watch closely.It's also worth mentioning that short interest can serve as a contrarian indicator; extreme levels of short interest may imply that a price bottom is near as everyone who wanted to sell has already done so. The current levels, however, do not suggest extreme bearishness but rather a moderate increase in short positions. Investors should analyze company fundamentals and market conditions in tandem with short interest data to make informed decisions. Economist The slight increase in short interest across Nasdaq securities could reflect broader economic concerns. For instance, investors might be reacting to macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates, inflation, or geopolitical tensions. Short interest can sometimes be an early warning system for economic downturns, as it may indicate that investors are hedging against potential declines in stock prices due to anticipated economic slowdowns.On the flip side, an increase in short interest can also result in additional liquidity in the market, as short selling involves borrowing and selling shares. It's essential for stakeholders to monitor economic news and policy changes that could affect investor sentiment and, subsequently, short interest levels. This data should be part of a larger toolkit used to gauge the economic outlook. 04/09/2024 - 04:11 PM NEW YORK, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the end of the settlement date of March 28, 2024, short interest in 3,102 Nasdaq Global MarketSM securities totaled 11,297,406,980 shares compared with 11,183,649,858 shares in 3,114 Global Market issues reported for the prior settlement date of March 15, 2024.

Positive Aehr Test Systems reported a decrease in net revenue for Q3 fiscal 2024 compared to the same period last year. The company experienced a shift from net income to a net loss in both GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Bookings for the quarter were $24.5 million with a backlog of $20 million, indicating ongoing business activity. Total cash and equivalents decreased slightly from the previous quarter but remained at a healthy level of $47.6 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 2024, Aehr Test Systems saw an increase in net revenue and net income compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. The company provided $0.5 million in cash from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, showcasing financial stability. Aehr Test Systems revised its guidance for fiscal 2024, aiming for total revenue greater than $65 million and net income of at least $11 million. The company secured a new customer for its FOX-NP solution, expanding its reach in the silicon carbide market beyond electric vehicles. Aehr Test Systems is engaging with multiple silicon carbide suppliers for wafer level test and burn-in solutions, indicating potential growth opportunities. The semiconductor industry is projected to grow significantly, presenting favorable market conditions for Aehr Test Systems. Negative Net revenue decreased significantly in Q3 fiscal 2024 compared to the same period last year. The company reported a net loss in both GAAP and non-GAAP measures for the quarter. Total cash and equivalents decreased slightly from the previous quarter, potentially impacting financial liquidity. Aehr Test Systems faces delays in wafer level burn-in system orders for silicon carbide semiconductor devices, affecting revenue. Despite positive customer engagements, the company is yet to convert all potential customers for its FOX wafer level test and burn-in solution. Market Research Analyst The financial results reported by Aehr Test Systems reveal a significant downturn in quarterly revenue year-over-year, from $17.2 million to $7.6 million. This is a noteworthy contraction that suggests a challenging quarter for the company. However, the bookings value of $24.5 million indicates a potential rebound, as it represents future recognized revenue once the products and services are delivered. The backlog of $20 million further supports this, as it reflects orders that have been placed but not yet fulfilled or recognized as revenue.Investors may find the company's liquidity position, with $47.6 million in cash and equivalents, reassuring in the short term. However, the decrease from $50.5 million in the previous quarter could raise concerns about cash burn rate and the sustainability of operations without additional capital influx or improved sales performance. The forecasted annual revenue and net income figures provided by the CEO suggest optimism for the fiscal year's end, but these projections should be approached with caution given the current quarter's performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, particularly the net loss on a GAAP basis versus the smaller non-GAAP net loss, highlights the impact of stock-based compensation on the company's profitability. Investors should consider this difference when evaluating the company's performance, as non-GAAP measures can sometimes provide a clearer picture of operational efficiency by excluding non-cash expenses.The company's mention of delays in wafer level burn-in system orders for silicon carbide semiconductor devices points to specific industry challenges. The reliance on the automotive industry, particularly electric vehicles, is both an opportunity and a risk, as evidenced by the current order delays. Diversification into other silicon carbide applications could mitigate this risk, as suggested by the CEO's comments on new customer engagements. Semiconductor Industry Expert The semiconductor industry's projected growth, as referenced by the Semiconductor Industry Association, is a positive sign for companies like Aehr Test Systems. The company's focus on wafer level test and burn-in solutions positions it well to capitalize on the expected industry expansion driven by AI, green energy and digital transformation. However, the current financial performance indicates that Aehr may be experiencing difficulty in capturing this market potential in the short term.It's important to note the strategic significance of the initial order from a new, large semiconductor company entering the silicon carbide market. This could represent a diversification of Aehr's customer base and a reduction of dependency on the electric vehicle market. The CEO's comments on the qualification process and the company's track record of converting evaluations into sales provide a positive outlook on future growth, assuming these engagements translate into actual sales. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM FREMONT, CA / ACCESSWIRE / April 9, 2024 / Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR), a worldwide supplier of semiconductor test and burn-in equipment, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024 ended February 29, 2024.Fiscal Third Quarter Financial Results:Net revenue was $7.6 million, compared to $17.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.GAAP net loss was $(1.5) million, or $(0.05) per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $4.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Non-GAAP net loss, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, was $(0.9) million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $4.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Bookings were $24.5 million for the quarter.Backlog as of February 29, 2024 was $20 million.Total cash and cash equivalents as of February 29, 2024 were $47.6 million, compared to $50.5 million at November 30, 2023.Fiscal First Nine Months Financial Results:Net revenue was $49.6 million, compared to $42.7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.GAAP net income was $9.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to GAAP net income of $8.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Non-GAAP net income was $11.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, compared to $10.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.Cash provided by operations was $0.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024.An explanation of the use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of Aehr's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the accompanying tables.Gayn Erickson, President and CEO of Aehr Test Systems, commented:""As we noted in our preliminary earnings release in March, our third quarter results reflect delays in wafer level burn-in system orders for silicon carbide semiconductor devices used in electric vehicles. Due to this, we had revised our guidance for our fiscal 2024 full year ending May 31, 2024 to be greater than $65 million in total revenue and net income of at least $11 million, which we are reiterating today. We still expect to finish this fiscal year with annual revenue that is near or above our full year record.""Last week we announced an initial order for our FOX-NP solution from a new customer that is a multi-billion dollar per year global semiconductor company, and is entering the silicon carbide market to address several applications that include automotive, industrial, and electrification infrastructure. This is our third straight new customer for silicon carbide that is primarily focused on applications other than electric vehicles, expanding our opportunity within silicon carbide beyond electric vehicles.""We are still in continued engagements up to and including on-wafer evaluations with well over a dozen silicon carbide suppliers that are focusing on both electric vehicles and other applications and are forecasting production needs for wafer level test and burn-in of their devices with decision timelines that spread out over the next year. We are focused on the qualification process with as many new customers as possible, as once we have demonstrated our FOX wafer level test and burn-in solution using their own wafers, we have not yet lost a potential customer.""Our discussions with customers indicate that the key markets Aehr is addressing for semiconductor wafer level test and burn-in have significant growth opportunities that will expand this year and throughout this decade, and we are seeing increased customer engagement in each of these markets. We have also seen a recent strengthening in the silicon carbide market for electric vehicles outside the US in what appears to be a shift in the market share of electric vehicle suppliers. This includes Asia where we recently had extensive and very productive and positive visits with a significant number of silicon carbide suppliers and electric vehicle suppliers that we will provide additional details on during our earnings call.""According to many market forecasts, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the semiconductor industry is expected to grow from $600 million in 2022 to over $1 trillion at or around 2030. This acceleration is coming from mega market drivers including artificial intelligence (AI), green energy and decarbonization, and IoT-based digital transformation. Increased reliability concerns about semiconductors, a growing number of mission critical applications, and more multi-chip modules or heterogeneous integration with multiple devices being assembled in a single package are driving the need for wafer level burn-in. At semiconductor industry conferences around the world, we are seeing an increased focus on test and burn-in moving to wafer level before these devices are put into multi-chip packages and modules.""These favorable macro trends are driving the business that drives Aehr Test and include:silicon carbide power devices going into high-density modules for power conversion in electric vehicles;gallium nitride power semiconductors going into automotive, solar, and other mission critical industrial applications;silicon photonics integrated circuits being put into transceivers for data center infrastructure and optical chip-to-chip communication of CPU, GPU, and AI processors;memory devices for solid state disk drives used in enterprise and data storage or for AI processors.""Our continued investments in the FOX platform like the new 3.5 kW per wafer FOX-XP multi-wafer production system we began shipping last month also position us well to address the requirements of other new market segments that we believe we will be able to discuss over the next several months.""As we head toward fiscal 2025, we are encouraged by our increasing engagements with current and potential customers and the long-term growth opportunities of all these markets.""Fiscal 2024 Financial Guidance:For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024, Aehr is reiterating its previously provided guidance for total revenue of greater than $65 million and GAAP net income of approximately $11 million or more, or $0.38 per diluted share.Management Conference Call and Webcast:Aehr Test Systems will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2024 operating results.

These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies.We believe these measures enhance investors' ability to review the Company's business from the same perspective as the Company's management and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods.AEHR TEST SYSTEMSCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Unaudited) February 29, May 31, (In thousands, except par value) 2024 2023 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $47,581 $30,054 Short-term investments - 17,853 Accounts receivable, net 5,468 16,594 Inventories 38,085 23,908 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,215 621 Total current assets 92,349 89,030 Property and equipment, net 3,150 2,759 Operating lease right-of-use assets, net 5,863 6,123 Other non-current assets 234 231 Total assets $101,596 $98,143 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $4,979 $9,206 Accrued expenses 3,287 4,143 Operating lease liabilities, short-term 428 137 Deferred revenue, short-term 486 2,822 Total current liabilities 9,180 16,308 Operating lease liabilities, long-term 5,878 6,163 Deferred revenue, long-term - 31 Other long-term liabilities 41 41 Total liabilities 15,099 22,543 Shareholders' equity: Preferred stock, $0.01 par value: Authorized: 10,000 shares; Issued and outstanding: none - - Common stock, $0.01 par value: Authorized: 75,000 shares; Issued and outstanding: 28,906 shares and 28,539 shares at February 29, 2024 and May 31, 2023, respectively 289 285 Additional paid-in-capital 129,366 127,776 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (144) (155) Accumulated deficit (43,014) (52,306) Total shareholders' equity 86,497 75,600 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $101,596 $98,143 The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements.AEHR TEST SYSTEMSCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows(Unaudited) Nine Months Ended November 30 February 29, February 28, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Cash flows from operating activities: Net income $9,292 $8,446 Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Stock-based compensation expense 1,744 2,095 Depreciation and amortization 469 337 Accretion of investment discount (130) (305)Amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets 522 479 Provision for doubtful accounts - 24 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable 11,130 1,414 Inventories (14,182) (6,783)Prepaid expenses and other current assets (600) (167)Accounts payable (4,232) 822 Accrued expenses (874) (126)Deferred revenue (2,368) (1,633)Operating lease liabilities (257) (469)Income taxes payable 18 9 Net cash provided by operating activities 532 4,143 Cash flows from investing activities: Purchases of property and equipment (703) (178)Proceeds from maturities of investments 18,000 8,000 Purchases of investments - (33,294)Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 17,297 (25,472) Cash flows from financing activities: Proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee plans 1,270 1,965 Shares repurchased for tax withholdings on vesting of restricted stock units (1,480) (1,680)Issuance proceeds (cost) of common stock offering (72) 6,853 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (282) 7,138 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (20) (35) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 17,527 (14,226) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of period (1) 30,204 31,564 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of period (1) $47,731 $17,338 Includes restricted cash in other assets.SOURCE: Aehr Test SystemsView the original press release on accesswire.com What was Aehr Test Systems' net revenue for Q3 fiscal 2024?

Market Research Analyst The recent financial results from WD-40 Company show a positive trend in net sales growth, with a 7% increase in the second quarter and a 10% increase year-to-date compared to the prior fiscal periods. This growth is significant as it indicates the company's ability to expand its revenue streams despite potential market challenges. The expansion of gross margins from 50.8% to 52.4% for the quarter and from 51.1% to 53.1% year-to-date, suggests improved profitability and efficient cost management.However, the rise in selling, general and administrative expenses by 19% for the quarter and 15% year-to-date, along with a 12% and 21% increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses respectively, could indicate a strategic investment in market expansion or potentially strain net income margins if not balanced with revenue growth. The decline in net income by 6% for the quarter is a point of concern, although the year-to-date increase of 8% tempers immediate worries.The company's strategic decision to sell its U.S. and U.K. Homecare and Cleaning Products portfolio to focus on higher-margin maintenance products aligns with the observed growth in this segment. This move could streamline operations and potentially boost future profitability. Investors might view the updated fiscal guidance positively, as it reflects management's confidence in the company's performance trajectory. Financial Analyst WD-40 Company's updated fiscal year 2024 guidance, including the increased net income and diluted earnings per share projections, is a strong signal to investors about the company's financial health and management's confidence in continued growth. The narrowing of the gross margin range and the reduction in the provision for income tax point to optimized financial management strategies that are likely to enhance shareholder value.Notably, the dividend declaration of $0.88 per share indicates a stable return for investors, which could be attractive for income-focused portfolios. The share repurchase plan, with $5.3 million already spent, demonstrates a commitment to shareholder returns and confidence in the intrinsic value of the company's stock. However, the repurchase strategy should be monitored for its impact on the company's cash reserves and long-term investment capacity.The constant currency basis analysis is important for investors to understand the true performance of the company, excluding the effects of currency fluctuations. This provides a clearer picture of the company's operational success and can influence investment decisions. Economist The financial results of WD-40 Company reflect broader economic trends, such as the impact of foreign exchange rates on international sales. The favorable translation impact in the current quarter and year-to-date indicates a currency tailwind that has contributed to the reported sales figures. This factor is an external variable that can reverse and thus requires careful monitoring.Moreover, the company's performance in different geographical segments, with notable growth in the EIMEA region, suggests a diversified market presence which can be a hedge against region-specific economic downturns. The increase in sales in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific distributor markets, attributed to pricing strategies and promotional activities, shows the company's adaptability in different economic climates.The decision to divest the Homecare and Cleaning Products portfolio in the U.S. and U.K. markets could be seen as a strategic move to mitigate risks associated with slower growth segments and concentrate on core areas with higher growth potential. This aligns with a broader economic principle of focusing on competitive advantages to maximize returns. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM ~ Global net sales grew 7 percent in the second quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter ~ ~ Management increasing fiscal year 2024 net income and diluted earnings per share guidance ~ SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WD-40 Company (NASDAQ:WDFC), a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products that solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world, today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended February 29, 2024.

Net sales in the Americas increased 1 percent in the second quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily due to net sales growth of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of $0.6 million, or 1 percent, primarily due to increases in Latin America and the U.S. of $1.1 million and $0.7 million, or 12 percent and 2 percent, respectively. The increased sales in Latin America were primarily due to higher volumes in Mexico as a result of the timing of customer orders and favorable impacts of changes in foreign exchange rates. EIMEA The EIMEA segment represented 39 percent of total net sales in the second quarter. Net sales in EIMEA increased 16 percent in the second quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to an increase in net sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of 17 percent.

WD-40 Specialist® and other maintenance product sales increased 23 percent and 17 percent, respectively, primarily due to the combined impact of higher sales volume and the favorable impact of price increases across the regions. Translation of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had a favorable impact on sales in EIMEA for the current quarter. On a non-GAAP constant currency basis, net sales in EIMEA would have been $51.9 million for the second quarter. Asia-Pacific The Asia-Pacific segment represented 15 percent of total net sales in the second quarter. Net sales in Asia-Pacific increased 4 percent in the second quarter compared to the prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to higher sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product of 3 percent. Sales in the Asia distributor markets increased 7 percent, primarily due to price increases in these markets and successful promotional programs in certain regions, as well as the timing of customer orders. WD-40 Specialist® and other maintenance product sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Homecare and cleaning product sales increased 23 percent due to higher sales volume in Australia attributable to successful promotional activities and improved packaging. Translation of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ results from their functional currencies to U.S. dollars had an unfavorable impact on sales in Asia-Pacific for the current quarter. On a non-GAAP constant currency basis, net sales in Asia-Pacific would have been $21.6 million for the second quarter.

Net sales of maintenance products increased 7 percent in the second quarter when compared to the prior year fiscal quarter primarily due to higher sales of WD-40® Multi-Use Product in EIMEA.

Narrowing the gross margin range to now be between 51.5 and 53 percent, compared to prior guidance of between 51 and 53 percent. Advertising and promotion investments are still expected to be between 5 and 6 percent of net sales. Lowering the provision for income tax to now be in the range of 23 and 24 percent, compared to prior guidance of between 24 and 25 percent. Increasing net income to now be in the range of $67.7 million and $71.8 million, compared to prior guidance of between $65 million and $70 million. Increasing diluted earnings per share to now be in the range of $5.00 and $5.30, compared to prior guidance of between $4.78 and $5.15. Diluted earnings per share guidance is based on an estimated 13.6 million weighted average shares outstanding, which is unchanged from prior guidance. This guidance is expressed in good faith and is based on management’s current view of anticipated results. Unanticipated inflationary headwinds and other unforeseen events may further affect the Company’s financial results. Net sales presented on a non-GAAP constant currency basis use weighted average fiscal year 2023 foreign currency exchange rates.

Completion of divestiture of SMART Brazil operations, classified as discontinued operations. Earnings conference call and webcast scheduled for April 9, 2024. Negative Decrease in GAAP gross margin from 30.2% to 28.8%. Decrease in Non-GAAP gross margin from 33.3% to 31.5%. GAAP EPS decline from $(0.23) to $(0.26). Net loss attributable to SGH increased from $(11,773) to $(13,620). Financial Analyst SMART Global Holdings' recent financial results indicate a significant sequential growth in net sales, up 3.9% from the previous quarter. Despite this growth, there was a noticeable contraction in GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins. This contraction could suggest increased costs or pricing pressure in the marketplace. The decrease in earnings per share (EPS) on a GAAP basis, moving further into negative territory, raises concerns about the company's profitability. However, the improvement in non-GAAP EPS points to underlying operational strength when excluding certain non-recurring or non-cash expenses.From a business perspective, the divestiture of a majority interest in SMART Brazil operations reflects a strategic pivot towards their core competencies in high-performance computing and specialty memory solutions. This realignment could streamline operations and focus resources on areas with higher growth potential, especially in AI and HPC markets. The appointment of Pete Manca, with his extensive experience at Dell Technologies, suggests a strategic move to strengthen the Intelligent Platform Solutions (IPS) segment, which could be a growth driver moving forward.The provided business outlook for the upcoming quarter, with a forecasted increase in net sales and a slight improvement in gross margin, suggests optimism about the company's future performance. However, investors should monitor the operating expenses and the impact of share-based compensation on the company's profitability. Market Research Analyst The 19% increase in IPS revenue is a testament to the burgeoning demand for AI and HPC solutions. This sector is rapidly expanding and SMART Global Holdings' positioning in this market is a strategic advantage. The company's focus on enterprise solutions and the recent leadership appointment signals an aggressive pursuit of market share in this high-value segment.However, the LED Solutions segment's decline in revenue compared to the previous quarter could be indicative of market saturation or competitive pressures. It's essential to analyze industry trends to understand whether this is a company-specific issue or a broader market trend. Investors should also consider the potential long-term benefits and risks associated with the company's transformation into a high-value enterprise solutions provider.Understanding the company's performance in the context of the broader semiconductor and memory solutions industry is crucial. Factors such as global supply chain challenges, fluctuating demand for electronics and competition from other players in the AI and HPC space will influence SGH's performance. The market's reception to their strategic initiatives, including the divestiture and leadership changes, will be key to their success. Economist The financial results of SMART Global Holdings reflect broader economic trends, such as technological adoption rates and enterprise investment in AI and HPC. The company's pivot towards these areas may be in anticipation of or in response to these macroeconomic factors. The divestiture of the SMART Brazil operations could be seen as a move to optimize capital allocation towards more profitable ventures, aligning with broader economic efficiency principles.Additionally, the appointment of a new President for the IPS business unit could indicate a strategic refocusing, which is necessary for companies to stay competitive in a fast-paced technological landscape. Given the current economic climate, where innovation is a key driver of growth, SGH's emphasis on AI and HPC could position it well for future economic cycles.Investors should consider the potential impact of economic policies, such as trade agreements and intellectual property regulations, on SGH's operations, especially given its international presence. The company's ability to navigate these policies will be important for its long-term success. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM IPS revenue up 19 percent sequentially; total SGH revenue of $285 million MILPITAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SMART Global Holdings, Inc.

These and other risks, uncertainties and factors are described in greater detail under the sections titled “Risk Factors,” “Critical Accounting Estimates,” “Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, such risks, uncertainties and factors as outlined above and in such filings do not constitute all risks, uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results of SGH to be materially different from such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that the Company makes in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. Except as required by law, SGH does not undertake to update the forward-looking statements contained in this press release to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that may arise after the date that the forward-looking statements were made. Statement Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures SGH management uses non-GAAP measures to supplement SGH’s financial results under GAAP. Management uses these measures to analyze its operations and make decisions as to future operational plans and believes that this supplemental non-GAAP information is useful to investors in analyzing and assessing the Company’s past and future operating performance. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items, such as share-based compensation expense; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (consisting of amortization of developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks/trade names and backlog acquired in connection with business combinations); acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gains (losses) from changes in currency exchange rates; amortization of debt discount and other costs; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt; other infrequent or unusual items and related tax effects and other tax adjustments. While amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets is excluded, the revenues from acquired companies is reflected in the Company’s non-GAAP measures and these intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Management believes the presentation of operating results that exclude certain items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company’s core operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses adjusted EBITDA, which represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted for net interest expense; income tax expense; depreciation and amortization expense; share-based compensation expense; acquisition-related inventory adjustments; diligence, acquisition and integration expense; restructure charges; impairment of goodwill; changes in the fair value of contingent consideration; gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt and other infrequent or unusual items. Beginning in 2024, for our non-GAAP reporting, we are utilizing a long-term projected non-GAAP effective tax rate of 28%, which includes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and reflects currently available information as well as other factors and assumptions. While we expect to use this normalized non-GAAP effective tax rate through 2024, this long-term non-GAAP effective tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. Our GAAP effective tax can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, discrete items which are recorded in the period they occur, the tax effects of certain items of income or expense, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or changes to our strategy or business operations. We are unable to predict the timing and amounts of these items, which could significantly impact our GAAP effective tax rate, and therefore we are unable to reconcile our forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate measure to our GAAP effective tax rate. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, as they exclude important information about SGH’s financial results, as noted above. The presentation of these adjusted amounts varies from amounts presented in accordance with GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies. In addition, adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by, or used for, operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be used as a measure of liquidity. Investors are encouraged to review the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures” tables below.

(NYSE: VRTS) reported preliminary assets under management of $179.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, showing an increase primarily due to market performance and net inflows in retail separate accounts.

(NYSE: VRTS) reported preliminary assets under management of $179.3 billion as of March 31, 2024, showing an increase primarily due to market performance and net inflows in retail separate accounts. The company also provided services to $2.7 billion of other fee-earning assets. Assets under management by product type and asset class also saw positive growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported preliminary assets under management (AUM) by Virtus Investment Partners show a positive trajectory, which is indicative of the company's current growth momentum. A detailed examination of the AUM distribution across product types and asset classes reveals a strategic positioning that may appeal to diverse investor preferences. The uptick in retail separate accounts suggests a growing retail client base, which is often associated with higher margin products due to individualized management and potential for bespoke solutions.While net outflows in institutional accounts and open-end funds might raise questions, it's important to consider the broader industry context. Institutional investors often rebalance portfolios at year-end, which can lead to temporary outflows. However, the overall AUM increase points towards successful market performance and asset appreciation. The presence of multi-asset and alternative investments in the portfolio mix indicates a response to investor demand for diversified risk management solutions, a trend that has been gaining traction in the face of volatile markets. Market Research Analyst An analysis of the asset class distribution within Virtus Investment Partners' AUM highlights a significant allocation towards equities. This concentration reflects investor confidence in the stock market's potential for higher returns despite inherent volatility. The equity allocation's growth could signal a bullish market sentiment or effective stock selection strategies by the firm.In contrast, the fixed income segment has shown modest changes, suggesting stability in this traditionally defensive asset class. However, the slight decrease could also point to a shift in investor risk appetite, moving away from bonds in search of higher yields elsewhere. The alternatives category, including managed futures and real estate securities, demonstrates an innovative approach to asset management, catering to sophisticated investors seeking uncorrelated returns and portfolio diversification. Economist The data provided by Virtus Investment Partners serves as a microcosmic indicator of broader economic trends. AUM growth can be partially attributed to the market's recovery or expansion, reflecting economic stability or growth. The net inflows into retail separate accounts may suggest consumer confidence and disposable income levels conducive to investment. Conversely, the net outflows from institutional accounts could be a sign of strategic reallocations in response to economic forecasts or a pursuit of efficiency through cost management.Additionally, the diversification across asset classes, especially with a substantial equity component, implies an optimistic economic outlook among investors. This optimism, however, must be tempered with caution as overexposure to equities could pose risks should market conditions deteriorate. The inclusion of multi-asset strategies and alternatives in the AUM composition is a prudent approach to hedge against such uncertainties. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM HARTFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (NYSE: VRTS) today reported preliminary assets under management of $179.3 billion as of March 31, 2024.

Financial Analyst The recent transaction involving Franklin BSP Realty Trust's provision of a $125 million floating-rate senior loan for the refinancing of an industrial portfolio signifies a strategic move in the real estate investment trust (REIT) sector. This move is indicative of FBRT's active engagement in loan origination, which is a core part of their business model. The fact that FBRT has committed to $716 million in loan originations year-to-date reflects a robust investment activity level within the industrial real estate segment, which has been increasingly attractive due to e-commerce growth and supply chain reconfiguration.Investors should note the positive occupancy rate of 94.9% across the portfolio, showcasing strong leasing activity and potentially stable cash flows. The geographical diversification across key Southwestern markets like Dallas, Las Vegas and the Phoenix/Mesa/Scottsdale MSAs may also mitigate risks associated with regional economic fluctuations.The loan's structure, with a two-year initial term and two one-year extension options, provides FBRT with potential interest income continuity while offering the borrower flexibility. However, the floating-rate nature of the loan could expose FBRT to interest rate risk, which is particularly relevant in an environment where interest rates are subject to change by the Federal Reserve's monetary policies. Real Estate Market Analyst FBRT's engagement with Fundrise, a platform that democratizes real estate investments for retail investors, is a noteworthy development. Fundrise's recent track record in industrial acquisitions and its substantial assets under management position it as a significant player in the market. This relationship could open up new opportunities for FBRT, potentially increasing its exposure to a diverse investor base.Industrial real estate is a sector that has experienced a surge in demand, partly due to the rise of e-commerce and changes in supply chain logistics. The properties' high lease rates within the portfolio suggest a strong demand in the regions of Dallas, Las Vegas and Phoenix/Mesa/Scottsdale, which are key logistics hubs. This could translate into a competitive advantage for FBRT as it capitalizes on market trends.It's important to consider the broader market implications of such a deal. If FBRT's loan origination strategy proves successful, it may prompt similar moves by other REITs, potentially increasing competition for quality industrial assets and influencing market valuations. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Franklin BSP Realty Trust, Inc.

Positive Promising interim data from Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. on FPI-2265 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer PSA50 response rate of 50% in heavily pretreated patients Improvement in secondary endpoints and good tolerability of FPI-2265 Plans for Phase 2/3 trials in 2024 for further development Negative None. Oncology Doctor The interim data from the TATCIST trial concerning FPI-2265's efficacy in treating mCRPC is a noteworthy development in oncology, particularly for patients who have undergone extensive prior treatments, including lutetium-based radioconjugates. The reported PSA50 response rates are promising, especially considering the high percentage of patients with prior chemotherapy and radioconjugate treatments, which typically indicate a more challenging patient population to treat.Furthermore, the exploratory subset analysis showing a 69% PSA50 response in patients with higher PSMA SUVmean suggests that FPI-2265 could be particularly effective in a subset of mCRPC patients. However, it is important to note that these are interim results and long-term outcomes, including overall survival and quality of life, are critical for evaluating the true benefit of this treatment. The safety profile, predominantly featuring low-grade adverse events, is encouraging, although the treatment-related death and discontinuations warrant careful monitoring in future studies. Medical Research Analyst From a research perspective, the interim results of FPI-2265 are significant as they contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of targeted alpha therapies in mCRPC. The differentiation of FPI-2265 in the post-PLUVICTO™ setting is of particular interest, as it may address resistance mechanisms to prior 177Lu-based therapies. The PSA50 response rates, along with secondary endpoint improvements, provide a strong rationale for the continued development of FPI-2265.However, the small patient sample and the exclusion of superscan patients from efficacy analyses are limitations that could affect the generalizability of the findings. The upcoming Phase 2/3 trials will be pivotal in confirming these results and determining the optimal dosing regimen. The long-term follow-up data will be important for understanding the durability of the response and the potential impact on progression-free survival and overall survival. Market Research Analyst As Fusion Pharmaceuticals advances FPI-2265 through clinical development, the implications for the company's market position in oncology therapeutics are substantial. The mCRPC treatment landscape is competitive, with a need for therapies that can demonstrate efficacy in heavily pretreated populations. If the Phase 2/3 trials of FPI-2265 produce robust results, Fusion could capture a significant share of the mCRPC market, especially among patients who have exhausted other treatment options.The potential market expansion in the post-PLUVICTO™ setting highlights an opportunity for strategic positioning. Fusion's focus on long-term follow-up and commitment to Phase 2/3 trials may enhance investor confidence, provided that subsequent results validate these interim findings. It is essential for investors to monitor the progress of these trials, as positive outcomes could lead to increased valuation of Fusion Pharmaceuticals, while any setbacks could pose risks to the investment thesis. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM Preliminary data demonstrate FPI-2265 is active in heavily pretreated patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including those who received prior lutetium-based radioconjugates HAMILTON, ON and BOSTON, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: FUSN), a clinical-stage oncology company focused on developing next-generation radioconjugates (RCs) as precision medicines, today announced the presentation of interim efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 TATCIST open-label clinical trial evaluating FPI-2265, at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 being held April 5-10 in San Diego, California. Results demonstrate that FPI-2265 is active in heavily pretreated patients with progressive metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), including patients who received prior lutetium-based RCs. Safety, tolerability and clinical activity data were generally consistent with other published studies of small molecule-based 225Ac-PSMA RCs. ""The interim results from the TATCIST trial underscore the potential of FPI-2265, the most advanced actinium-based prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted radiotherapy in development, to improve treatment options for patients with mCRPC,"" said Fusion Chief Executive Officer John Valliant, Ph.D. ""We believe the interim results represent compelling early clinical activity and tolerability data, validating the path to develop FPI-2265 in patients who progress on or after lutetium-based RCs. With our Phase 2 portion of the registrational program for FPI-2265 expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2024, and the expanding market for patients in the post-PLUVICTO™ setting, we believe FPI-2265 has the potential to meet the critical unmet needs of mCRPC patients."" The TATCIST trial is designed to evaluate patients with progressive mCRPC, including patients who are naïve to PSMA-targeted RCs and those who have been pre-treated with 177Lu-based PSMA RCs such as PLUVICTO™. Phase 2 TATCIST Clinical Trial Interim Results The results are being presented at the AACR 2024 Annual Meeting in a poster presentation titled, ""Preliminary efficacy and safety results from the TATCIST trial: A PSMA-directed targeted alpha therapy with FPI-2265 (225Ac-PSMA-I&T) for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)."" As of the March 1, 2024 data cutoff, 35 patients received at least one dose of FPI-2265, with 25 patients having at least 12 weeks of follow-up. The analysis included 25 patients for safety evaluation and 20 patients for assessing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response. Four participants were identified as superscan patients and were excluded from the efficacy analyses and reported separately in the safety analysis. One participant was not included in the efficacy analysis due to uninterpretable PSA response. Patients in the study were pretreated with a median of four prior lines of anticancer therapy, with 20 out of 25 (80%) receiving prior chemotherapy, including 10 patients who received at least two prior lines of taxanes. Nine out of 25 patients received a prior 177Lu-based PSMA RC. From the efficacy-evaluable patient population, PSA50 (≥50% decline in prostate-specific antigen by 12 weeks after first treatment) response was achieved in 10 out of 20 patients (50%) regardless of prior lutetium treatment. PSA50 was achieved in 61% of lutetium-naïve participants and 42% of lutetium-treated participants. In an exploratory subset analysis of 13 patients, including six patients who received prior 177Lu-based PSMA RC treatment, with baseline PSMA Mean Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmean) >6, PSA50 response was observed in nine patients (69%). FPI-2265 demonstrated meaningful improvement in secondary endpoints which include maximum % PSA decline, and independent reviewer-assessed response rates based on RECIST v1.1 criteria, and the rate of disease progression in bone per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. FPI-2265 was generally well tolerated and in line with prior published data, with predominantly Grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) observed, including xerostomia (dry mouth), thrombocytopenia, anemia, fatigue and dry eye. Xerostomia, the most common TRAE, was primarily Grade 1 with all incidences being Grade 1-2 (62% Grade 1 and 24% Grade 2). One treatment-related death due to cerebral hemorrhage was reported in a superscan patient. Three out of 25 participants discontinued treatment due to TRAEs, including two participants in the superscan group, however there were no discontinuations due to xerostomia. These findings underscore the potential of FPI-2265 to provide a viable therapeutic option for patients with progressive mCRPC, including those who have previously undergone prior treatment with lutetium-based RCs. Fusion will continue long term follow up in patients evaluated in the TATCIST trial and now intends to prioritize enrollment in the FPI-2265 Phase 2 portion of the registrational program. FPI-2265 Phase 2/3 Development Program in mCRPC Fusion is advancing a Phase 2/3 trial for FPI-2265 in patients with mCRPC with progressive disease who have previously been treated with a 177Lu-based PSMA radiotherapy. The Phase 2 portion is expected to be initiated in the second quarter of 2024. A Phase 3 global registrational trial is expected to begin in 2025 following analysis of the Phase 2 data and an end of Phase 2 meeting to align with FDA on the recommended Phase 3 dosing regimen. A copy of the poster presentation can be found at: https://fusionpharma.com/fusion-scientific-presentations/ following the conclusion of the AACR Annual Meeting.

(Nasdaq: RICK) reported sales for Nightclubs and Bombshells restaurants for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2024, totaling $71.7 million, a 1.3% increase year-over-year. Nightclubs saw a 4.2% increase in sales, while Bombshells experienced a 10.4% decline. The company is focused on improving same-store sales, development schedule, acquisitions, capital management, and share buybacks. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in total sales by RCI Hospitality Holdings is modest, reflecting a 1.3% growth compared to the same period last year. This growth is primarily attributed to new acquisitions and locations, which suggests that the company's expansion strategy is contributing positively to top-line revenue. However, the concerning aspect here is the decline in same-store sales (SSS), which is often seen as a key indicator of a retail company's health. A 5.7% decline in SSS for Nightclubs and a significant 20.5% drop for Bombshells indicate potential underlying issues in customer retention or market competition.The company's focus on development and acquisitions, such as the new BYOB clubs and the intent to purchase another club, appears to be a strategic move to diversify and increase revenue streams. However, the performance of newly opened locations and the effectiveness of the management and marketing changes at Bombshells will be critical to observe in upcoming quarters. The planned entry into the casino market could also represent a significant new revenue channel, pending the approval of gaming licenses. Financial Analyst RCI's capital management strategy, as indicated by the new bank loan and share buybacks, suggests a proactive approach to leveraging its assets and returning value to shareholders. The $20.0 million loan at an 8.25% fixed rate is a notable development, given that it is secured by properties appraised at $31.6 million, which could indicate a strong balance sheet position. The share buyback activity, with 27,265 shares repurchased in the second quarter, reflects confidence in the company's valuation and a commitment to shareholder value.However, investors should be cautious about the debt level and interest rate, as they could impact future cash flows. Additionally, the share repurchase program, while positive in the short term, should be weighed against the potential need for capital for ongoing expansion and possible downturns in the hospitality industry. Hospitality Industry Analyst The hospitality sector, particularly the niche market of nightclubs and themed restaurants like Bombshells, is highly sensitive to consumer discretionary spending. RCI's reported decline in SSS could be reflective of broader economic trends or specific operational challenges. The company's decision to delay implementing management and marketing changes at Bombshells until mid-February could have contributed to the decline in sales. It will be important to monitor the effectiveness of these changes in the coming quarters.The extension of liquor licenses and the development of new concepts such as the hybrid nightclub/adult entertainment venue in Dallas suggest an innovative approach to driving growth. However, the success of these initiatives hinges on execution and the ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM HOUSTON, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: RICK) reported sales for its Nightclubs and Bombshells restaurants for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2024 of $71.7 million, an increase of 1.3% or $0.9 million compared to the year-ago period.

Eric Langan, President & CEO of RCI, said: ""During 2Q24, increases in sales from last year's acquisitions and new locations more than offset year-over-year declines in same-store sales and from clubs in transition. While we continue to work at improving SSS, we have made noticeable progress with our development schedule, acquisitions, capital management, and share buybacks."" Sales Nightclubs: Sales totaled $59.0 million, an increase of 4.2% or $2.4 million year-over-year. 2Q24 reflected increases of $7.4 million from acquisitions not in SSS. 2Q24 also reflected declines of 5.7% or $2.9 million in SSS and of $2.1 million from clubs reopened, reformatted or closed during or prior to the quarter.Bombshells: Sales totaled $12.8 million, a decline of 10.4% or $1.5 million year-over-year. 2Q24 reflected increases of $1.2 million from locations not in SSS: Cherry Creek Food Hall in Greenwood Village (CO) with its Bombshells Kitchen, Bombshells San Antonio (TX), and Bombshells Stafford (TX). 2Q24 also reflected declines of 20.5% or $2.7 million in SSS. Bombshells didn't start implementing previously announced management and marketing changes and cost cutting until mid-February 2024.Development Schedule & Acquisitions Nightclubs: PT's Centerfold Gentlemen's Club in Lubbock (TX), a new BYOB club, opened the third week of March 2024.

Excluding a $3.0 billion redemption, firm-wide net flows were positive for the month, with positive flows in all channels. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in assets under management (AUM) for AllianceBernstein L.P. reflects a modest yet positive trend in the company's financial growth. A 2% rise in AUM, particularly in a single month, is indicative of market confidence and can be attributed to the firm's asset performance. The net outflows, however, are a point of concern. While the firm experienced overall growth, the outflows suggest some investors are moving their capital elsewhere, which could signal underlying issues with investment strategies or investor sentiment.It is also worth noting the impact of a $3.0 billion low-fee passive institutional redemption. This type of redemption can affect profit margins, as passive funds typically generate lower fees than active funds. Investors should consider how such redemptions might influence the firm's revenue mix and future profitability. Additionally, the positive net flows in each channel are a strong indicator of diversified growth across the firm's offerings, which is a healthy sign for risk management and stability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the distribution of AUM across different asset classes such as equity, fixed income and alternatives provides insights into AllianceBernstein's market positioning. The increase in actively managed equity suggests a robust demand for AB's expertise in this area, likely due to investor confidence in their ability to outperform the market. On the other hand, a slight decline in passive equity could reflect a shift in investor preference or a response to market conditions.The firm's ability to maintain and grow AUM in the fixed income category, despite a challenging interest rate environment, may indicate a strong fixed income product offering or a defensive move by investors seeking stability. The growth in alternatives/multi-asset solutions highlights a trend towards diversification and the search for non-correlated returns, which can be appealing in volatile markets. Economist Asset management firms like AllianceBernstein serve as economic indicators, with AUM growth often reflecting broader economic trends. The reported AUM increase might be a microcosm of the economic environment, suggesting a period of market appreciation. However, the presence of net outflows alongside market appreciation points to a more nuanced economic narrative, where individual investor decisions do not always align with broader market performance.Understanding the economic context is essential, as it shapes investor behavior and asset valuations. For instance, if the market appreciation is driven by cyclical sectors benefitting from economic expansion, this could indicate a bullish outlook for those sectors. Conversely, if the appreciation is due to defensive sectors, it might suggest investor caution amidst economic uncertainty. The details of the asset mix and the sectors driving growth would provide a clearer picture of the economic underpinnings of this AUM increase. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn., April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AllianceBernstein L.P.

The Beachbody Company Launches New Initiative Enabling Customers to Buy and Download Fitness Programs Like P90X and 21 DAY FIX Without a Subscription,2024-04-09T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Positive,"The Beachbody Company, Inc.

(NYSE: BODI) introduces a new initiative allowing customers to purchase popular fitness and nutrition programs individually without a subscription. This move aims to meet the growing demand for access to programs like P90X and 21 DAY FIX. The company offers over 134 digital programs for individual purchase, enhancing flexibility and choice for consumers in the digital fitness industry. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by The Beachbody Company to sell its fitness and nutrition programs without a subscription represents a strategic shift in their business model. This decision is likely a response to changing consumer preferences, where flexibility in content consumption is increasingly valued. By offering individual purchases, Beachbody is diversifying its revenue streams and potentially widening its customer base.The digital fitness industry is characterized by high competition and low switching costs, making customer retention challenging. Beachbody's move to replicate the success of its legacy DVD sales in the digital space could be a way to leverage its extensive catalog and capitalize on brand recognition. However, it remains to be seen how this will affect the subscription side of the business, as the ease of individual purchases might deter some users from committing to a recurring payment model.From a market perspective, this initiative could serve as a competitive differentiator, particularly if it attracts customers who are hesitant to commit to subscriptions. By addressing latent demand, Beachbody could see an increase in sales volume, although the impact on average revenue per user (ARPU) will depend on the pricing strategy for individual programs relative to the subscription offering. Financial Analyst Beachbody's introduction of a non-subscription purchase option for its fitness and nutrition programs could have significant financial implications. This model has the potential to attract a new segment of price-sensitive customers or those with a preference for one-time purchases, which could lead to an uptick in short-term revenue.It is important to monitor how this change will influence the company's customer lifetime value (CLTV). While single purchases may lead to increased initial sales, they might not provide the same long-term revenue stability as subscriptions. Additionally, the cost structure associated with delivering individual digital programs versus a subscription service could alter the company's margins.Investors should look for changes in the company's quarterly financial reports, particularly in the revenue generated from individual sales versus subscriptions. The balance between these two revenue sources will be critical in assessing the long-term viability of this strategy. If the company can successfully upsell customers from individual purchases to subscriptions, it could lead to a healthy growth trajectory. Consumer Behavior Expert Beachbody's strategy to offer its fitness and nutrition programs a la carte taps into the current consumer trend towards personalization and control over purchases. In the digital content market, consumers often show a preference for tailored choices that align with their specific needs and interests.This move acknowledges the diverse motivations and commitment levels among consumers when it comes to health and fitness. Some individuals may be more inclined to invest in a single program that they perceive as a better fit for their goals, rather than a broader subscription that includes content they may never use.However, the success of this strategy will largely depend on the company's ability to market these individual programs effectively and create a seamless purchasing experience. It will also be important to consider how this offering might influence the community aspect of Beachbody's brand, as subscriptions often come with a sense of belonging and ongoing engagement that single purchases may not provide. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Beachbody Company, Inc.

They commenced two developments and completed a stock offering for gross proceeds of $392.2 million.","Terreno Realty Corporation Announces Quarterly Operating, Investment and Capital Markets Activity Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Terreno Realty (TRNO) reported a 96.2% quarter-end occupancy, a 47.2% increase in cash rents, and $18.5 million in acquisitions for the first quarter of 2024. They commenced two developments and completed a stock offering for gross proceeds of $392.2 million. Positive Strong quarter-end occupancy rate of 96.2% Significant increase of 47.2% in cash rents on new and renewed leases $18.5 million worth of acquisitions completed Commencement of two developments with expected investments totaling $79.1 million Completion of a stock offering with gross proceeds of $392.2 million Negative None. Market Research Analyst An observed decline in occupancy rates from 98.5% to 96.2% could signal a softening in demand for industrial real estate within Terreno's portfolio, potentially impacting rental income. However, the substantial 47.2% increase in cash rents on new and renewed leases may offset this impact, suggesting strong pricing power or a shift towards higher-quality tenants. The tenant retention ratio, particularly in the improved land portfolio (82.5%), indicates a stable tenant base, which is essential for predictable cash flows.The completion of the equity offering and ATM issuance, totaling over $540 million in gross proceeds, strengthens the company's capital position. This capital infusion is earmarked for acquisitions and development projects, which could drive future growth. It's important to monitor how effectively this capital is deployed and the returns generated from these investments. Real Estate Investment Analyst The reported estimated stabilized cap rates for both acquired and developed properties hover around 5.7% to 5.8%, which are in line with current market conditions for industrial assets in prime locations. These rates are indicative of the potential return on investment and are critical for evaluating the profitability of the acquisitions and developments. The 16.5% IRR on the sale of the Seattle property is notably high, reflecting successful asset management and timing of the sale.With $448.8 million of acquisitions under contract, the company's growth trajectory seems aggressive. However, the caveat that these acquisitions are subject to due diligence highlights the uncertainty that not all deals may close. The substantial pre-leasing percentage (58%) of development properties suggests effective pre-construction marketing strategies and demand for the company's properties. Financial Analyst The absence of debt maturing in 2025 and no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of March 31, 2024, reflects a conservative debt profile which is favorable for financial stability. The strategic use of equity financing over debt amidst a potentially rising interest rate environment could be a prudent move to manage the cost of capital and avoid refinancing risks.The company's capital allocation towards acquisitions and developments must be scrutinized against the backdrop of the current economic climate. Investors should consider the alignment of these investments with long-term industrial real estate trends, such as e-commerce growth, which could sustain demand for distribution centers.

Global Partners LP Completes Acquisition of Four Liquid Energy Terminals from Gulf Oil,2024-04-09T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Global Partners LP (GLP) successfully acquires four liquid energy terminals from Gulf Oil, enhancing its presence in the Northeast energy market. With a combined shell capacity of 3.0 million barrels, these terminals will boost Global's storage and distribution capabilities for gasoline, distillates, and ethanol. The strategic acquisition aligns with Global's growth strategy, allowing the company to capitalize on high-demand markets and expand its network.","Global Partners LP Completes Acquisition of Four Liquid Energy Terminals from Gulf Oil Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Global Partners LP (GLP) successfully acquires four liquid energy terminals from Gulf Oil, enhancing its presence in the Northeast energy market. With a combined shell capacity of 3.0 million barrels, these terminals will boost Global's storage and distribution capabilities for gasoline, distillates, and ethanol. The strategic acquisition aligns with Global's growth strategy, allowing the company to capitalize on high-demand markets and expand its network. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The acquisition of four liquid energy terminals by Global Partners LP represents a strategic consolidation within the energy distribution industry, particularly in the Northeastern United States. By acquiring terminals with a combined shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels, Global Partners is significantly bolstering its storage and distribution capabilities for gasoline, distillates and ethanol.From an energy market perspective, the expansion is indicative of Global's intent to optimize its supply chain efficiency and responsiveness to market demands. The locations of the terminals suggest a deliberate move to tap into key markets and potentially reduce logistics costs. For instance, the Linden and Woodbury terminals in New Jersey position Global to access the New York Harbor market, a major trading hub for gasoline and distillates, which could lead to improved margins from optimized distribution logistics.Furthermore, the acquisition price of $212.3 million should be evaluated against the operational cash flow and the potential revenue these assets can generate. It's essential to monitor how this expansion affects Global's balance sheet in the short term and whether the added debt, if any, can be offset by the revenue from operations in these new terminals. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the acquisition of these terminals by Global Partners LP is a significant investment that needs to be closely scrutinized for its impact on the company's financial health. The purchase price of $212.3 million should be considered in relation to the company's overall capital allocation strategy and its ability to generate a return on investment that exceeds the cost of capital.Investors will be interested in how this acquisition will translate into revenue growth and EBITDA margins, given the capital-intensive nature of the energy distribution sector. The divestment of the Revere terminal for $150 million in the previous year and the subsequent reinvestment in these new assets suggest a strategic portfolio rebalancing. It will be important to assess the performance of these new terminals in comparison to the divested assets to determine if the capital reallocation will indeed result in a net positive for the company.Additionally, the timing of the acquisition could be influenced by current market conditions, including fluctuations in energy prices and demand patterns. The ability of Global Partners to integrate these terminals efficiently and leverage their strategic locations could be a determining factor in the success of this expansion and its reception by the market. Supply Chain & Logistics Expert The operational implications of Global Partners LP's acquisition are substantial with regards to supply chain and logistics within the energy sector. The strategic placement of the acquired terminals in the Northeast enhances the company's distribution network, potentially offering a more reliable supply chain to meet customer demands. This could translate into improved delivery times, reduced transportation costs and a fortified supply chain against disruptions.An integrated network, as mentioned by Global's President and CEO, can lead to economies of scale that benefit the company's operational efficiency. The emphasis on strategic growth and leveraging the network suggests a focus on long-term operational sustainability. The potential for these terminals to open new markets and add gasoline capabilities is pivotal for adapting to regional energy consumption patterns and customer needs.It will be important to observe how Global integrates these terminals into its existing operations and whether the company can achieve the projected synergies. The ability to enhance competitive advantage through this acquisition will depend on the effective management of these new assets and the seamless integration into the company's broader supply chain strategy. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM Global strengthens operations in the Northeast and continues to expand its terminal network WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Partners LP (NYSE: GLP) (“Global” or the “Partnership”) announced today the successful closing of its acquisition of four liquid energy terminals from Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (“Gulf Oil”). The terminals are strategically located in Chelsea, MA, New Haven, CT, Linden, NJ, and Woodbury, NJ, and will further enhance Global’s position in the energy economy of the Northeast. With a combined shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels, these terminals expand Global’s ability to store and distribute gasoline, distillates, and ethanol. This acquisition aligns with Global’s strategy to acquire and invest in assets that allow the Partnership to leverage scale from its integrated network in high demand markets. “This acquisition further delivers on our commitment to strategic growth and our ability to identify and capitalize on assets that leverage our growing network,” said Eric Slifka, Global’s President and Chief Executive Officer. The new terminals are a key fit in Global’s network. Linden, NJ and Woodbury, NJ open new markets while New Haven, CT adds gasoline capabilities to Global’s terminal portfolio in Connecticut, and the Chelsea, MA terminal allows Global to continue to serve the Boston market as it replaces the capabilities of its Revere terminal, which Global strategically divested for $150 million in 2022. Slifka continued, “We are happy to finalize this acquisition and welcome these terminals into our growing network. These assets will strengthen our existing operations and provide us with new opportunities to serve our customers and enhance our competitive advantage.” Global purchased the four terminals for $212.3 million. About Global Partners LP Building on a legacy that began more than 90 years ago, Global Partners has evolved into a Fortune 500 company and industry-leading integrated owner, supplier, and operator of liquid energy terminals, fueling locations, and guest-focused retail experiences.

SCY-247 shows promise in overcoming drug-resistant infections, particularly against Candida auris. Positive None. Negative None. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM JERSEY CITY, N.J., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX), a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat and drug-resistant infections, today announced the presentation of preclinical efficacy data on its second-generation fungerp candidate SCY-247 at the 34th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) in Barcelona, Spain from April 27-30, 2024. SCY-247 is being developed to address systemic fungal diseases, with a key focus on invasive fungal infections where resistance to current limited treatment options is a significant concern. These presentations at ECCMID 2024 continue to build upon SCY-247’s positive preclinical data illustrating its unique attributes in the fight against difficult-to-treat fungal infections. Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen associated with nosocomial infections and considered a serious global health threat. It is often resistant to commonly used antifungal drugs, with about 90% of U.S. C. auris samples resistant to fluconazole and some C. auris strains resistant to all three main classes of antifungals (azoles, echinocandins and polyenes). Candida glabrata is the most common non-albicans species causing systemic fungal infections. It also has high levels of resistance to fluconazole, and echinocandin resistance appears to be increasing. Patients with Candida infections that are resistant to both fluconazole and echinocandin drugs have very few treatment options. Azole-resistant Aspergillus infections are also difficult to treat, and affected patients are up to 33% more likely to die than patients with infections that can be treated with azoles. Oral Presentation: Title:The novel second-generation IV/oral triterpenoid SCY-247 is efficacious in an experimental murine model of invasive candidiasis caused by Candida glabrataSession:New compounds against biofilm-forming pathogensSession Date/Time:Sunday, April 28, 2024 at 1:30 pm CET / 7:30 am ETPresenting author:Nathan Wiederhold, Ph.D. (Professor, Director – Fungus Testing Laboratory, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio)SCY-247 demonstrated in vivo efficacy against C. glabrata invasive candidiasis. Significant reductions in fungal burden were observed in the kidneys of mice treated with SCY-247 in a dose dependent fashion.The work here utilized the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ (NIAID’s) suite of preclinical services for in vivo testing (Contract Nos. HHSN272201700039/ 75N93019D00022).

For more information, see the ECCMID website here. About SCY-247 SCY-247 is a second-generation antifungal compound, from a novel class of structurally-distinct glucan synthase inhibitors, triterpenoids (fungerps), being developed to address systemic fungal diseases. The triterpenoid class of antifungals represents the first new class of antifungal compounds since 2001. These agents combine the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors with the potential flexibility of having oral and intravenous (IV) formulations. SCY-247 is in pre-IND development stage and has demonstrated broad-spectrum antifungal activity, in vitro and in vivo. SCYNEXIS anticipates that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may grant SCY-247 Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and Fast Track designations for the IV and oral formulations of SCY-247. About SCYNEXIS SCYNEXIS, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCYX) is a biotechnology company pioneering innovative medicines to help millions of patients worldwide overcome and prevent difficult-to-treat infections that are becoming increasingly drug-resistant. SCYNEXIS is developing the company’s proprietary antifungal platform “fungerps”. Ibrexafungerp, the first representative of this novel class, has been licensed to GSK. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved BREXAFEMME® (ibrexafungerp tablets) in June 2021, for its first indication in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), followed by a second indication in November 2022, for reduction in the incidence of recurrent VVC. Late-stage clinical investigation of ibrexafungerp for the treatment of life-threatening invasive fungal infections in hospitalized patients is ongoing. Additional antifungal assets from this novel class are currently in pre-clinical and discovery phase, including the compound SCY-247. For more information, visit www.scynexis.com.

Oncology Research Analyst The revelation of TRIM7 as a key driver in immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) acquired resistance presents a significant stride in the oncology field. The ability to reverse acquired resistance to PD-1/L1 therapies could potentially expand treatment options for patients who have developed resistance to current immunotherapies. As an oncology research analyst, the focus on the ubiquitination pathways, specifically through TRIM7's stabilization of RACO-1 and degradation of STING and MAVS, is a noteworthy approach. This mechanism is particularly intriguing as it offers a targeted strategy to address the resistance issue, rather than a broad-spectrum method.Shattuck Labs' development of small-molecule inhibitors that can restore sensitivity to PD-1 therapy in resistant tumors could be a game-changer for cancer treatment regimens. If these preclinical results translate into human trials, the company could see a significant increase in their oncology pipeline's value. Investors should monitor the progression of these compounds through clinical trials, as successful outcomes could lead to substantial market opportunities and partnerships. Biotech Market Analyst From a market perspective, Shattuck Labs' announcement is likely to attract investor attention due to the high demand for effective treatments in oncology, particularly concerning drug resistance. The identification of TRIM7 as a novel target and the subsequent development of inhibitors could position Shattuck as a pioneer in a niche but critical area of cancer therapeutics. The preclinical data's presentation at a prestigious conference such as AACR increases the visibility of Shattuck's research endeavors and its potential impact on the market.Considering the extensive application of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors across multiple tumor types, the therapeutic utility of TRIM7 inhibition could have wide-ranging implications. It is essential, however, to remain cautious as the transition from preclinical to clinical efficacy is not guaranteed and the actual impact on the company's financials will depend on clinical trial outcomes, regulatory approvals and market adoption. Investors should assess the risks associated with the development stage of the compound while acknowledging the potential for high returns if the inhibitor successfully navigates the regulatory pathway. Pharmaceutical Development Expert Shattuck Labs' focus on bifunctional fusion proteins and the expansion of their oncology pipeline through the development of TRIM7 inhibitors is indicative of the innovative approaches being pursued in drug development. The specificity of TRIM7 inhibitors in targeting the ubiquitination pathway is a sophisticated strategy that may offer fewer side effects and improved outcomes compared to broader treatments. This precision medicine approach is reflective of the industry's shift towards targeted therapies, which are designed to improve patient outcomes by honing in on specific molecular targets.The potential to reverse PD-1 acquired resistance could lead to improved durability of response for patients, which is a significant concern in current cancer treatments. The long-term implications for patients could include prolonged survival rates and a better quality of life. As this compound moves into clinical trials, the pharmaceutical development landscape will closely watch for its safety profile and efficacy data, which will be important for its eventual market success. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM – Aberrant TRIM7 expression identified as a key driver of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) acquired resistance; inhibition of TRIM7 with small molecule inhibitors may prevent or reverse acquired resistance to PD-1/L1 blockade – AUSTIN, TX and DURHAM, NC, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Shattuck Labs, Inc. (Shattuck) (Nasdaq: STTK), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of bifunctional fusion proteins as a new class of biologic medicine for the treatment of patients with cancer and autoimmune disease, today announced preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic utility of TRIM7 inhibition to prevent or reverse acquired resistance to immune checkpoint therapy. These data were featured in an oral presentation during the AACR Annual Meeting 2024, being held from April 5-10, 2024, in San Diego, California. “One of the largest areas of unmet medical need in oncology is in the setting of acquired resistance to checkpoint inhibitors, and we expect this to continue to grow because of the broad application of anti-PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors across multiple tumor types. Our efforts in helping to define the underlying biology of acquired resistance were recently revealed with a publication in Cancer Cell,” said Taylor Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Shattuck. “I am very pleased to share how our team has leveraged those biological insights to identify a novel target, TRIM7, which appears to be a mediator of the acquired resistant phenotype in mouse and human tumors, and, importantly, this has led to a development compound that reverses PD-1 acquired resistance in pre-clinical studies through specific inhibition of TRIM7. We expect that these efforts will support expansion of our oncology pipeline alongside our lead program, SL-172154.” Presentation DetailsAbstract title: Aberrant TRIM7 Expression Potentiates RACO-1 Mediated Proliferation and Dysregulated Interferon Responsiveness in the Setting of anti-PD-1 Acquired Resistance in CancerLocation: San Diego Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaPresenter: Dr. George Fromm, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, Shattuck LabsSession Category: Experimental and Molecular TherapeuticsSession Title: Drug Discovery 2: New Therapies Date/Time: Tuesday, April 9, 2024, 4:05 PM - 4:20 PM (PT)Abstract Presentation Number: 6584 Key Takeaways TRIM7 is an E3 ligase which supports tumor cell proliferation downstream of KRAS signaling through ubiquitination and stabilization of RACO-1.

Market Research Analyst The reported increase in net merchandise sales by 13.0% and comparable net merchandise sales by 8.8% for PriceSmart indicates a positive trend in consumer demand and store performance. This growth is particularly notable in the context of the retail sector, where companies face challenges from e-commerce competition and changing consumer behaviors. The expansion of warehouse clubs from 50 to 54 also suggests a strategic growth initiative that could capture additional market share and enhance economies of scale.Moreover, the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, contributing 4.0% to net merchandise sales, highlights the significance of international operations for PriceSmart. Investors may see this as a strength in diversifying revenue streams and reducing reliance on any single market. However, reliance on currency fluctuations can also introduce volatility in earnings, which should be considered in financial planning. Financial Analyst PriceSmart's announcement of a special dividend of $1.00 per share is a strong signal to shareholders regarding the company's cash position and confidence in its financial stability. Special dividends are often perceived as a positive gesture by companies that have accumulated excess cash and wish to return value to their shareholders.

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are customary for our industry and commonly used by competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be reviewed in isolation or considered as an alternative to any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. The adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share metrics are important measures used by management to compare the performance of our core operations between periods. We define adjusted net income as net income, as reported, adjusted for: separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer, the write-off of certain Aeropost receivables, and the tax impact of the foregoing adjustments on net income. We define adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are useful metrics to investors and analysts because they present more accurate year-over-year comparisons for our net income and net income per diluted share because adjusted items are not the result of our normal operations. The following table shows the Company's reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended February 29,2024 February 28,2023 February 29,2024 February 28,2023 Net income as reported $ 39,271 $ 31,347 $ 77,318 $ 64,252 Adjustments: Separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure (1) — 7,747 — 7,747 Aeropost-related write-offs (2) — — — 2,125 Tax impact of adjustments to net income (3) — (550) — (550) Adjusted net income $ 39,271 $ 38,544 $ 77,318 $ 73,574 Net income per diluted share $ 1.31 $ 1.02 $ 2.54 $ 2.07 Separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure — 0.23 — 0.23 Aeropost-related write-offs — — — 0.07 Adjusted net income per diluted share $ 1.31 $ 1.25 $ 2.54 $ 2.37 (1) Reflects $7.7 million of separation costs associated with the departure of our former Chief Executive Officer in February 2023. (2) Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. (3) Reflects the tax effect of the above-mentioned adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, net, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including interest income; other income (expense), net; separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure; and Aeropost-related write-offs. The following is a reconciliation of our Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended February 29,2024 February 28,2023 February 29,2024 February 28,2023 Net income as reported $ 39,271 $ 31,347 $ 77,318 $ 64,252 Adjustments: Interest expense 3,293 2,814 6,109 5,563 Provision for income taxes 17,259 16,202 35,412 32,628 Depreciation and amortization 20,491 17,875 39,985 35,443 Interest income (3,225) (1,942) (6,091) (3,099) Other expense, net (1) 7,036 5,344 9,162 9,910 Separation costs associated with Chief Executive Officer departure (2) — 7,747 — 7,747 Aeropost-related write-offs (3) — — — 2,125 Adjusted EBITDA $ 84,125 $ 79,387 $ 161,895 $ 154,569 (1) Primarily consists of transaction costs of converting the local currencies into available tradable currencies in some of our countries with liquidity issues and foreign currency losses or gains due to the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities (primarily U.S. dollars) for the three and six months ended February 29, 2024. Primarily consists of foreign currency losses or gains due to the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities (primarily U.S. dollars) for the three and six months ended February 28, 2023.

(3) Reflects $2.1 million of Aeropost-related write-offs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Net Merchandise Sales - Constant Currency and Comparable Net Merchandise Sales – Constant Currency As a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. We believe that constant currency is a useful measure, indicating the actual growth of our operations. When we use the term ""net merchandise sales - constant currency,"" it means that we have translated current year net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. Similarly, when we use the term ""comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency,"" it means that we have translated current year comparable net merchandise sales at prior year monthly average exchanges rates. Comparable net merchandise sales - constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation. Net merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows: February 29, 2024 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended Netmerchandisesales % Growth Netmerchandisesales % Growth Net merchandise sales $ 1,260,916 13.0 % $ 2,395,930 11.9 % Favorable impact of foreign currency exchange 44,151 4.0 % 84,141 3.9 % Net merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis $ 1,216,765 9.0 % $ 2,311,789 8.0 % Comparable net merchandise sales growth rate on a net merchandise sales - constant currency basis is calculated as follows: March 3, 2024 Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-Six Weeks Ended % Growth % Growth Comparable net merchandise sales 8.8 % 8.4 % Favorable impact of foreign currency exchange 3.6 % 3.7 % Comparable net merchandise sales on a constant-currency basis 5.2 % 4.7 % View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pricesmart-announces-fiscal-2024-second-quarter-operating-results-1-00-per-share-special-dividend-plans-for-ninth-warehouse-in-costa-rica-302112192.html SOURCE PriceSmart, Inc.

NeurAxis also signed an exclusive option agreement for an innovative rectal expulsion device and secured $6.1 million in financing. CEO Brian Carrico is optimistic about future revenue growth and expansion of medical policy coverage. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The expansion of insurance coverage for NeurAxis' neuromodulation therapies represents a significant stride in the company's growth trajectory. With a 300% increase in covered lives, the company has successfully broadened its market penetration, which is a strong indicator for potential revenue growth. The emphasis on peer-reviewed studies, particularly in the pediatric space, is likely to bolster the company's credibility and support further insurance coverage. This strategy not only aligns with the current trend towards evidence-based treatments but also enhances the perceived value of NeurAxis' offerings in the healthcare market.The positive results from the multicenter registry and retrospective studies suggest that NeurAxis' IB-Stim technology could be a game-changer for patients with disorders of the gut-brain interaction. By demonstrating significant improvements in abdominal pain and functional disability, NeurAxis is positioning its technology as a potentially preferable alternative to traditional medications, which may lead to increased adoption and utilization in clinical practice. Financial Analyst The commitment of $6.1 million in convertible note financing from various investors, including affiliates of Inspire Health Alliance, is a vital sign of investor confidence in NeurAxis' business model and growth prospects. This infusion of capital is expected to support the company’s research initiatives and market expansion efforts. The exclusive option agreement with the University of Michigan for the innovative rectal expulsion device (RED) indicates NeurAxis' proactive approach to diversifying its product portfolio, which could open up new revenue streams.From a financial perspective, the company's goal to secure medical policy coverage for 50 million lives by the end of 2024 sets a clear milestone for future revenue projections. If achieved, this would substantially increase the addressable market for NeurAxis' technologies, potentially leading to a significant uptick in stock valuation as the market responds to the company's performance and growth potential. Healthcare Industry Analyst NeurAxis' strategy to leverage clinical research for expanding payer coverage is a testament to the importance of evidence-based medicine in securing reimbursement. The healthcare industry is increasingly moving towards outcomes-based care and NeurAxis' focus on generating strong clinical data is well-aligned with this shift. The company's targeted approach in the pediatric space, a niche yet important segment, could serve as a differentiator in a competitive neuromodulation market.The licensing of the rectal expulsion device from the University of Michigan also indicates a strategic move into diagnostics, complementing the therapeutic aspect of their business. This could not only enhance the company's product ecosystem but also improve patient care by providing clinicians with more comprehensive tools for diagnosis and treatment. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM CARMEL, Ind., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeurAxis, Inc. (“NeurAxis,” or the “Company”) (NYSE American: NRXS), a medical technology company commercializing neuromodulation therapies for chronic and debilitating conditions in children and adults, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 for the period ended December 31, 2023. Recent Operational Highlights Expanded total covered lives to approximately 16 million individuals, an increase of 300% compared to 4 million individuals as of April 1, 2023. Recent medical policy coverages include: BCBS plan in the mid-Atlantic region, providing coverage for approximately 7 million covered lives.Coverage from a major insurer covering approximately 1 million covered lives.BCBS plan in the mid-Atlantic with approximately 3.5 million covered lives. The company remains committed to clinical research in the pediatric space with a total of 15 peer-reviewed published studies using NeurAxis’ PENFS technology. Thirteen of those studies were carried out in US children’s hospitals and included children with disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). This level of evidence puts NeurAxis in a great position to continue expanding payor coverage and increase adoption of the technology.Announced the results of the largest multicenter, prospective registry in pediatric DGBIs. It evaluated outcomes of pediatric patients (8-18 years) following a 4-week course of IB-Stim in a real‐world clinical setting. Seven large tertiary care centers enrolled patients with pain-associated DGBIs. Patients were asked to fill out validated pediatric questionnaires, including the abdominal pain index (API). Data was collected weekly for the first 3 weeks and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Compared to baseline scores, there were significant improvements in abdominal pain (API) after 4 weeks of IB-Stim treatment at every time point, including 6 months (p<0.001) and 12 months (p<0.001).Announced the results of a retrospective study led by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center comparing and reviewing the records of 101 adolescent patients with FAPD treated with IB-Stim™ therapy or standard-of-care medications, amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) or cyproheptadine (antihistamine). The comparative analysis noted: at follow-up, IB-Stim™ therapy showed improvements in abdominal pain (p=0.001) and functional disability (p=0.048) compared to baseline, while amitriptyline showed improvements in abdominal pain (p=0.034).in a comparison of outcomes between groups, IB-Stim™ was more effective than cyproheptadine in improving abdominal pain (p=0.04) and did not differ from amitriptyline (p=0.64). Nausea scores did not differ between groups (p>0.05); anddisability scores between groups were only more effective for amitriptyline vs. cyproheptadine (p=0.03). Disability scores did not differ from amitriptyline compared with IB-Stim™ (p=0.21). Signed an exclusive option agreement with the University of Michigan for the right to license its’ innovative rectal expulsion device (RED). RED redesigns the balloon expulsion testing workflow to simplify anorectal function testing. RED can be used in the office and at the point of care to identify treatment targets for patients with chronic constipation. Secured $3 million in committed convertible note financing from affiliates of Inspire Health Alliance on November 8, 2023. The Company also secured an additional $3.1 million in committed financing from various investors, including affiliates of Inspire Health Alliance, with identical terms in the first quarter of 2024. Management Commentary Brian Carrico, Chief Executive Officer of NeurAxis, commented, “I am excited and pleased with the progress we have made throughout the last year executing our philosophy that the publication of strong data will result in strong insurance medical policy coverage, which will drive strong future revenue growth. Recently, we expanded our portfolio of publications on our proprietary neuromodulation therapies, which have led to early insurance medical policy coverage from major insurance plans nationally. To date, PENFS is covered for more than 16 million lives in the U.S. by multiple health insurers, an improvement from just 4 million lives a year ago. I believe we are on track to achieve our stated goal of having medical policy coverage for at least 50 million lives by the end of 2024, which will set the stage for a significant revenue ramp for our initial pediatric indication for FAP/IBS.” “Beyond driving adoption of our IB-Stim technology for FAP/IBS, we remain on track to expand the number of indications for IB-Stim in the years to come with further pediatric and adult clinical studies in place with expected FDA submissions over the next three years. Furthermore, we remain excited about the commercial opportunity for our recently licensed innovative rectal expulsion device, or RED, a self-inflating balloon expulsion test that allows for point-of-care testing to effectively identify patients with an evacuation disorder, such as constipation. We expect the device, which has the potential to be a significant near-term revenue driver for the company, to become commercialized in 2024,” Mr. Carrico continued. Dr. Adrian Miranda, Chief Medical Officer of NeurAxis, commented, “I am proud of the depth and breadth of the 14 studies that we have published, which include 10 different types of research such as placebo, long-term data, health-economic data, quality of life data, and real-world registry data. In recent months, we have announced results for multiple studies, including our retrospective comparative study led by the University of Cincinnati and investigators at Children’s Hospital of Orange County. We are pleased with the outcomes of our studies, which have been conducted by renowned institutions, and remain steadfast in leveraging our research publications to expand written policy coverage.” Mr. Carrico concluded, “I am excited about the opportunities we have in 2024 to further commercialize our lead pediatric indication for IB-Stim, while advancing our development pipeline for a number of new indications leveraging our unique neuromodulation therapy. I anticipate growth in 2024 to be driven by our expanding insurance coverage, and the commercialization of RED. With a strengthened balance sheet through a key investment from Inspire Health Alliance and long-term investors who understand the medical space well, I believe we are well positioned to execute our business plan in 2024.” Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Results Revenue in fiscal year 2023 of $2.5 million was down 8.4% compared to $2.7 million in fiscal year 2022. The decrease was primarily due to fewer shipments to certain customers as they manage through the insurance reimbursement process. While we have made great strides in recent months in gaining coverage, note that there is a lag between insurance coverage and order placement due to billing and coding implementation processes unique to each of our customers. Given our recent success with new payor coverage, we expect our revenue to increase in late 2024 and into 2025. Fourth quarter revenue in 2023 of $531.5 thousand was down 13.3% compared to $613.1 thousand for the same period in 2022. While revenue was down in the quarter, we had more account accounts ordering from us and we had more patients coming to us via our Guidance and Patient Services (GPS) assistance program. Gross profit margin in fiscal year 2023 was 87.7%, compared to 88.9% in fiscal year 2022. The change in gross margin was primarily due to growth in our patient assistance program that provides discounts to patients without insurance coverage. Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 86.4%, compared to 87.7% for the same period in 2022. Selling expenses for fiscal year 2023 were $323.6 thousand, a decrease of 21.3% compared to $410.9 thousand for fiscal year 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower commission costs, with the commission rate being lowered at the beginning of 2023, and lower revenue. Selling expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $72.6 thousand, an increase of 10.1% compared to $66.0 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2022. Research and development (R&D) costs for fiscal year 2023 were $169.3 thousand, a decrease of 25.0% compared to $225.6 thousand for fiscal year 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the initiation, payment and expense of more patient trials in fiscal year 2022 as the Company prepared for more FDA submissions. These trials continued into fiscal year 2023. General and administrative (G&A) costs for fiscal year 2023 were $8.3 million, an increase of 62.6% compared to $5.1 million for fiscal year 2022. Increased costs were primarily due to incremental headcount to build out market access and patient assistance teams including recruiting costs, as well as higher insurance, investor relations and board of director costs post-IPO, one-time advisory costs and higher advertising costs in order to expand market awareness. G&A costs for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $2.0 million, an increase of 46.1%, compared to $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher wages, higher public company expenses such as insurance and board fees post-IPO and professional services as the Company obtains market access. The net loss in fiscal year 2023 expanded to $14.6 million, versus $4.8 million in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to non-cash charges taken on debt conversion upon the IPO, including $4.9 million in amortization of the debt discount and deferred issuance costs and a $3.6 million charge taken on the extinguishment of debt, and higher G&A costs. The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $5.3 million due to higher G&A costs, significantly lower non-cash changes in the fair value of warrants and derivative financial instruments as they were either exercised or converted upon the IPO and the extinguishment of debt. Cash on hand at December 31, 2023 was $78.6 thousand. Cash used by operations of $6.7 million was substantially less than our net loss of $14.6 million for the same period primarily due to the $4.9 million non-cash debt discount charge upon conversion at the IPO and the $3.6 million non-cash debt extinguishment charge. Although the Company had no long-term debt as of December 31, 2023, $6.1 million in convertible note financing has been secured with $1.5 million funded as of March 31, 2023. Restatement of Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results The Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K today regarding a restatement of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 that will be included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023. The restatement will result, among other items, in a $3.7 million increase to the Company’s net loss and a $3.7 million increase to additional paid in capital as of and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2023 and is unrelated to revenues or cash expenses. The Company’s cash position as of September 30, 2023 did not change.

Corvus Pharmaceuticals Announces Initiation of Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Soquelitinib for Atopic Dermatitis,2024-04-09T20:01:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Corvus Pharmaceuticals announces the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for soquelitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis, with potential initial clinical data before year-end 2024.","Corvus Pharmaceuticals Announces Initiation of Placebo-Controlled Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Soquelitinib for Atopic Dermatitis Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags clinical trial Rhea-AI Summary Corvus Pharmaceuticals announces the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for soquelitinib in patients with atopic dermatitis, with potential initial clinical data before year-end 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Analyst The commencement of a Phase 1 clinical trial by Corvus Pharmaceuticals for soquelitinib, a selective ITK inhibitor, represents a significant milestone in the development of new treatments for atopic dermatitis. This trial is pivotal in determining the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the drug in humans. Given that atopic dermatitis affects a substantial patient population and current treatments have limitations, the development of an oral medication like soquelitinib could offer a more convenient alternative to injectable therapies.From a financial perspective, the successful progression through clinical trials can lead to an increase in a company's market value, driven by investor optimism about the drug's potential market share and revenue generation. The biopharmaceutical sector is highly sensitive to such developments and positive trial results could significantly impact Corvus's stock price and overall valuation. Conversely, any negative outcomes or delays could adversely affect investor confidence and the company's financial health. Medical Research Analyst Soquelitinib's mechanism of action involves ITK inhibition, which is a novel approach in the treatment of Th2-mediated diseases such as atopic dermatitis. The preclinical data and studies in companion dogs suggest soquelitinib's potential efficacy. However, it is important to note that success in preclinical studies does not always translate to human trials. The transition from animal models to human subjects introduces a new level of complexity and unpredictability.Furthermore, the trial's design as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is the gold standard for determining a drug's efficacy. The enrollment of 64 patients provides a relatively small but focused sample to assess initial responses and side effects. The results of this trial will be instrumental in deciding whether to proceed to larger Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, which will further evaluate the drug's effectiveness and safety profile. Market Research Analyst The market for atopic dermatitis treatments is evolving, with a growing demand for therapies that are both effective and user-friendly. The introduction of an oral ITK inhibitor like soquelitinib could disrupt the current treatment paradigm, which heavily relies on topical and injectable medications. The potential for soquelitinib to block multiple cytokines could position it as a superior treatment option, thereby capturing a significant market share if clinical trials prove successful.It is important for investors to monitor the progress of this trial closely, as it could indicate the future commercial potential of soquelitinib. The anticipation of initial clinical data release before year-end 2024 will likely keep investors' attention on Corvus, potentially leading to increased stock volatility as the data release approaches. The company's ability to meet its trial enrollment and data release targets will be critical indicators of its operational efficiency and could influence investor sentiment. 04/09/2024 - 04:01 PM Atopic dermatitis is the first immune disease indication being studied in the clinic for soquelitinib, the Company’s selective ITK inhibitor Corvus anticipates releasing initial clinical data from trial before year-end 2024 BURLINGAME, Calif., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: CRVS), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, today announced the initiation of the Company’s randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating soquelitinib in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The trial is expected to enroll 64 patients at 12 sites in the United States, with the potential for initial clinical data before year-end 2024. “The initiation of our Phase 1 atopic dermatitis trial is an important step towards unlocking the broad potential of ITK inhibition for immune diseases,” said Richard A. Miller, M.D., co-founder, president and chief executive officer of Corvus. “Soquelitinib has the potential to improve the treatment landscape for atopic dermatitis by providing an oral medication designed to block multiple cytokines involved in the inflammatory process, compared to current injectable biologic therapies that only inhibit one or a limited number of cytokines. We look forward to ramping up enrollment with the potential to share initial data from the trial before year-end, while also working to initiate our soquelitinib registrational Phase 3 trial for PTCL.” Corvus previously published preclinical data describing soquelitinib’s unique mechanism of action through ITK inhibition, supporting the rationale for its use in Th2-mediated diseases like atopic dermatitis. In addition, the Company has evaluated soquelitinib in companion dogs with naturally occurring, refractory atopic dermatitis. Results from this study demonstrated soquelitinib’s potential activity in this disease. About the Soquelitinib Atopic Dermatitis Phase 1 Clinical TrialThe randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial is planned to enroll 64 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that previously failed one prior topical or systemic therapy. Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive one of four 28-day dosing regimens (100 mg BID, 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID, or 400 mg QD) of soquelitinib or equivalent placebo. The primary endpoints include safety and tolerability, and efficacy, which will be measured by improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index score, Investigator Global Assessment, reduction in itch and various cytokine biomarkers. Corvus and a data monitoring committee will be able to monitor the data from the trial. About Atopic DermatitisAtopic dermatitis, also called eczema, is a chronic disease that can cause inflammation, redness, scaly patches, blisters and irritation of the skin. It affects up to 20% of children and up to 10% of adults, and treatments include topical therapies, oral therapies and systemic injectable biologic therapies. It is frequently associated with other allergic disorders such as food allergies and asthma. Atopic dermatitis, like asthma and allergy, involves the participation of Th2 lymphocytes which secrete cytokines that result in inflammation. Soquelitinib has been shown in preclinical studies to inhibit cytokine production from Th2 lymphocytes. About Corvus PharmaceuticalsCorvus Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the development of ITK inhibition as a new approach to immunotherapy for a broad range of cancer and immune diseases. The Company’s lead product candidate is soquelitinib, an investigational, oral, small molecule drug that selectively inhibits ITK. Its other clinical-stage candidates are being developed for a variety of cancer indications. For more information, visit www.corvuspharma.com. About SoquelitinibSoquelitinib (formerly CPI-818) is an investigational small molecule drug given orally designed to selectively inhibit ITK (interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase), an enzyme that is expressed predominantly in T cells and plays a role in T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune function. The immunologic effects of soquelitinib lead to what is known as Th1 skewing and is made possible by the high selectivity of soquelitinib for ITK. Research on soquelitinib’s mechanism of action suggests that it has the potential to control differentiation of normal T helper cells and enhance immune responses to tumors by augmenting the generation of cytotoxic killer T cells and the production of cytokines that inhibit cancer cell survival. Soquelitinib has also been shown to prevent T cell exhaustion, a major limitation of current immunotherapy and CAR-T therapies. Optimal doses of soquelitinib have been shown to affect T cell differentiation and induce the generation of Th1 helper cells while blocking the development of both Th2 and Th17 cells and production of their secreted cytokines. Th1 T cells are required for immunity to tumors, viral infections and other infectious diseases. Th2 and Th17 helper T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and allergic diseases. The Company believes the inhibition of specific molecular targets in T cells may be of therapeutic benefit for patients with cancers, including solid tumors, and in patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases.

New features like FlexFund and ISN app aim to improve customer value proposition. ISN raised minimum monthly fees and transaction fees by 20% in Q1 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of product enhancements and subsequent price increases by Porch Group's Inspection Support Network (ISN) could be indicative of the company's strategy to capitalize on its significant market share within the U.S. home inspection industry. With ISN processing around 40% of all U.S. home inspections, the impact of these changes is likely to be substantial. The introduction of FlexFund, which potentially increases average inspection revenue by 30% and the ISN app, which improved user engagement by 45%, suggests that Porch is leveraging technology to enhance customer value and grow its revenue streams.However, the increase in transaction fees by 20% could have mixed implications. While it may boost Porch's short-term revenue, there is a risk that customers might seek more cost-effective alternatives, potentially affecting long-term customer retention. It is important to monitor how these price adjustments will affect the company's market position, especially in a competitive SaaS landscape where pricing can be a key differentiator. Financial Analyst The financial implications of Porch's decision to raise its minimum monthly fee and transaction fees are significant. The price hike, if accepted by the market, could lead to an increase in revenue and margins for Porch, which would be positive for shareholders. The reported potential for a 30% increase in average inspection revenue due to the FlexFund feature is particularly noteworthy. This could enhance earnings forecasts and potentially result in upward revisions of stock price targets by analysts.However, it's essential to consider the elasticity of demand for Porch's offerings. The increase in fees must be justified by the perceived value of the new features and enhancements. If customers do not find the price increases to be commensurate with the value received, Porch could face customer churn, which would negatively affect its financial performance. Investors should look for upcoming earnings reports and customer retention metrics to assess the real impact of these strategic changes. Insurance Industry Expert The enhancements in ISN's product suite, particularly the digitized Florida Wind Mitigation template, are tailored to meet specific regional needs, which demonstrates a strategic approach to product development. This level of specialization within the insurance industry can create a competitive edge and potentially increase market penetration in underserved or highly specialized segments.Moreover, the FlexFund feature aligns with the trend in the insurance industry towards more flexible payment options, which can be a decisive factor for customers at the point of purchase. This innovation could set a precedent in the industry, especially if it leads to broader adoption and influences customer expectations. The long-term impact on the business will depend on the adoption rate of these features and the company's ability to maintain quality service at higher price points. 04/09/2024 - 04:01 PM SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Porch Group, Inc.

IL-18 engineered for resistance to IL-18BP and half-life extension, showing durable immunological effects. Split IL-12 subunits aim to reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy in cancer treatment. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The preclinical data from Mural Oncology's IL-18 and IL-12 programs represent a significant step in the development of novel cancer therapies. The engineering of IL-18 to resist IL-18BP and extend its half-life could potentially enhance the therapeutic efficacy and durability of the immune response in cancer treatment. This innovation addresses a critical limitation of current cytokine therapies, which often have short half-lives, reducing their effectiveness over time.Furthermore, the dual-targeted subunit approach to IL-12 aims to mitigate the cytokine’s toxicity. If successful, this could solve a longstanding challenge in oncology, as IL-12's anti-tumor properties have historically been overshadowed by its adverse effects. The strategy to concentrate IL-12 activity within the tumor microenvironment could be a game-changer, significantly improving the risk-benefit profile of IL-12 as an anti-cancer agent.From a medical research perspective, the implications of these findings are substantial. Should these candidates progress to clinical trials and demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans, they could offer new avenues for treatment, potentially improving patient outcomes and expanding the arsenal against various cancers. Biotech Patent Attorney The disclosure of Mural Oncology's preclinical data signifies an important intellectual property milestone. The novel protein engineering techniques applied to IL-18 and IL-12 not only present potential therapeutic advancements but also raise considerations regarding patent strategy and protection of biotechnological innovations.Given the competitive landscape of immuno-oncology, securing robust patent coverage for these engineered cytokines is crucial. The company's approach to extend the half-life of IL-18 and to target IL-12 to the tumor microenvironment could be key differentiators in the field. Protecting these innovations could provide Mural with a strategic advantage, potentially leading to licensing opportunities, partnerships and a stronger market position.For stakeholders, the strength and breadth of the patent portfolio will be a critical factor in assessing the company's long-term value and investment potential. It will be important to monitor the patent filings and grants related to these programs to gauge Mural's ability to defend its technology and maintain exclusivity in the market. Oncology Market Analyst The oncology market is highly receptive to innovations that promise to enhance efficacy while reducing toxicity. Mural Oncology's advancements in cytokine engineering could address unmet needs in cancer therapy, potentially leading to significant market opportunities. The ability to enhance the immune response with engineered IL-18 and to mitigate IL-12 toxicity could position Mural favorably in the immuno-oncology space.Analyzing the market dynamics, therapies that can be combined with existing treatments, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are particularly attractive. If Mural's IL-18 variant demonstrates synergy with these therapies, it could capture a share of this established market. Similarly, a re-engineered IL-12 with reduced toxicity could revitalize interest in a cytokine with known anti-tumor properties, creating a niche market.Investors and industry stakeholders will be monitoring the progression of these candidates closely. The transition from preclinical to clinical development is fraught with challenges, but the potential rewards are considerable. Positive clinical outcomes could lead to a revaluation of Mural's market potential and attract partnership deals or acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies. 04/09/2024 - 04:00 PM For the first time, the company shares data for its preclinical IL-18 and IL-12 programs—candidate nominations for each are expected later this year Combination of IL-18 binding protein resistance with additional half-life enhancement to IL-18 variant demonstrated durable immunological effects in preclinical models Data presented suggest dual-targeted, subunit approach to engineered IL-12 may mitigate cytokine’s hallmark toxicity without compromising efficacy WALTHAM, Mass and DUBLIN, Ireland, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mural Oncology plc (Nasdaq: MURA), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing novel, investigational engineered cytokine therapies designed to address areas of unmet need for patients with a variety of cancers, today shared poster presentations with pre-clinical data from its Interleukin-18 (IL-18) and IL-12 programs at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) annual meeting taking place April 5-10 in San Diego, California. This is the first time Mural has shared findings from either program. The details for the presentations are as follows, and both posters are available at https://www.muraloncology.com/publications/. Interleukin-18 engineered for resistance to IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) and half-life extension to enhance its therapeutic potential (Abstract #4076): IL-18 is a potent immune-stimulating cytokine, but it is limited by IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) – a secreted high affinity decoy receptor that binds with, and neutralizes, IL-18, thus limiting its efficacy over time.Mural’s protein engineering approach is twofold: first, it introduces mutations to IL-18 that are designed to minimally impact the structure while eliminating binding to IL-18BP. Secondly, it fuses IL-18 to protein scaffolds to extend the half-life and increase the cytokine’s exposure.The company believes the half-life enhancement may lead to a more durable immunological effect, as demonstrated by the interferon gamma and Th1 response, proinflammatory reactions necessary for the body’s immune response. Notably, the duration of Th1 response observed was significantly longer (approximately 7-9 days) than a “naked” approach without this half-life extension, which is generally cleared in 2-3 days. The optimal balance of potency and pharmacokinetic enhancement is still being determined to nominate a lead IL-18 development candidate. “Resistance to IL-18BP is the foundation of our approach. The mutations we introduced prevented the binding protein from neutralizing the cytokine’s efficacy. We show that resistance to IL-18BP combined with the drug’s extended half-life leads to a durable immunological effect in preclinical models. Our observation of increases in Th1 cytokines, which have been shown elsewhere to correlate with response to checkpoint inhibitors, are encouraging indications that our engineered IL-18 may provide a therapeutic complement to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy1,2,” said Mark Whitmore, Ph.D., Principal Scientist of Cancer Biology, and the poster’s lead author. Generation of tumor targeted self-assembling split IL-12 subunits for the treatment of cancer (Abstract #4066): IL-12p70 is a potent stimulator of the immune system with profound anti-tumor activity but very poor tolerability.Mural’s protein engineering approach aims to mitigate IL-12's hallmark toxicity by splitting the heterodimer into two inactive monomers: IL-12p35 and IL-12p40. These individual subunits are separately fused to two non-competitive antibody fragments.The goal of this is to assemble active IL-12p70 preferentially in the tumor microenvironment. The sequential administration of these targeted subunits concentrates the IL-12p70 activity primarily at the tumor site, thereby limiting systemic formation and associated toxicities.In vivo analysis demonstrated that targeting both subunits resulted in the greatest accumulation and retention of IL-12p70 complex in the tumor. “We believe that by self-assembling the split IL-12 subunits within the tumor microenvironments, we can circumvent native IL-12’s severe toxicities without compromising its efficacy. The data presented today provide strong rationale for our strategy of non-competitively targeting each subunit to a unique epitope on the same molecule,” said Joshua Heiber, Ph.D., Director of Research & Development, Cancer Biology, and the poster’s lead author. About Mural OncologyMural Oncology is leveraging its novel protein engineering platform to develop cytokine-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. By combining our expertise in cytokine biology and immune cell modulation and our protein engineering platform, we are developing medicines to deliver meaningful and clinical benefits to people living with cancer.

The change is attributed to Chart's robust backlog, successful Howden acquisition, and progress in deleveraging. Positive Moody's upgrades Chart Industries, Inc.'s credit outlook from 'Stable' to 'Positive'. Chart's credit ratings affirmed with a corporate family rating of 'B1', senior unsecured rating of 'B3', and senior secured notes rating of 'Ba3'. Speculative grade liquidity rating upgraded to SGL-2 and credit impact score upgraded to CIS-3. The upgrade reflects Chart's strong backlog, successful Howden acquisition, and progress towards deleveraging goals. Chart's CEO, Jill Evanko, emphasizes commitment to financial policy and target net leverage range of 2.0X to 2.5X. Negative None. Financial Analyst The positive shift in Moody's outlook on Chart Industries' credit ratings is indicative of the company's robust financial health and improved risk profile. The affirmation of ratings, coupled with the upgrade in liquidity rating, suggests that Chart has a solid order backlog and is successfully executing its post-acquisition strategy, particularly the integration of Howden. Investors should note that the company's commitment to deleverage, as evidenced by its target net leverage ratio, is a conservative financial strategy that could bolster balance sheet strength and potentially enhance creditworthiness over time.However, it's important to assess the implications of the company's decision to avoid material cash acquisitions and share repurchases until its leverage targets are met. While this approach supports fiscal prudence, it may also slow down the pace of growth through acquisitions, which is a common strategy in the industrial sector for achieving scale and diversification. Stakeholders should weigh the benefits of a stronger balance sheet against the opportunity costs of foregone investments. Credit Analyst The upgrade of Chart's speculative grade liquidity rating to SGL-2 signifies a higher confidence in the company's ability to meet its financial obligations in the short term. For lenders and credit investors, this is a reassuring sign of liquidity risk mitigation. The improvement in the credit impact score to CIS-3 should also be seen as a reflection of the company's operational performance and strategic initiatives that are resonating with credit rating agencies.It's essential to scrutinize the long-term sustainability of the company's credit profile, especially in the context of the industrial gas market's cyclical nature. While current market tailwinds are favorable, investors should remain vigilant about the potential impact of economic downturns on Chart's business segments. The company's focus on clean energy is commendable, but the transition to such markets can be fraught with unpredictability and regulatory changes that may affect future credit assessments. Market Research Analyst The reference to 'secular market tailwinds' in the announcement aligns with the broader industry trend towards clean energy solutions, where Chart Industries operates. This shift is likely to open up new revenue streams and could provide a competitive edge as global demand for environmentally sustainable technologies grows. The company's strategic positioning in this sector could be a key driver of its outperformance and may influence investor sentiment positively.On the flip side, investors should be mindful of the competitive dynamics within the clean energy and industrial gas markets. As more players enter the space, spurred by the attractive growth prospects, Chart's ability to maintain or expand its market share will be critical. Continuous innovation, cost efficiencies and strategic partnerships are likely to be significant factors in sustaining the company's growth trajectory and, by extension, its creditworthiness and stock performance. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM ATLANTA, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc.

At the same time, Chart’s speculative grade liquidity rating was upgraded to SGL-2 and credit impact score was upgraded to CIS-3. These ratings actions reflect Chart’s strong backlog, outperformance of commercial and cost synergy targets associated with the Howden acquisition, and progress in deleveraging towards its 2.0X to 2.5X net leverage target as well as secular market tailwinds. “This ratings action demonstrates continued strength in our business,” stated Jill Evanko, Chart’s CEO and President. “We are committed to our financial policy of deleveraging and will not do any material cash acquisitions or share repurchases until we are in our target net leverage range of 2.0X to 2.5X.” About Chart IndustriesChart Industries, Inc. is an independent global leader in the design, engineering, and manufacturing of process technologies and equipment for gas and liquid molecule handling for the Nexus of Clean™ - clean power, clean water, clean food, and clean industrials, regardless of molecule.

Founder Jessica Alba steps down as Chief Creative Officer to focus on new ventures while remaining on the board. CEO Carla Vernón praises Alba's vision and leadership. Alba expresses pride in Honest's impact and looks forward to supporting the company's future. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of record quarterly sales and profits by The Honest Company represents a significant milestone for the organization and the personal care industry. Historically, such financial performance can lead to positive investor sentiment, potentially influencing the company's stock price. The personal care market is highly competitive and the ability to report record numbers suggests that Honest's strategic initiatives and product offerings are resonating well with consumers.Furthermore, the company's emphasis on clean ingredients and sustainable design is not only a unique selling proposition but also aligns with growing consumer trends toward health and environmental consciousness. This alignment may provide Honest with a competitive edge and the potential for sustained growth, as more consumers seek out products that meet these criteria.However, investors should monitor the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory in the face of increasing raw material costs and potential shifts in consumer spending habits. The personal care industry is subject to fluctuations based on economic conditions and any significant changes could impact future financial results. Financial Analyst The re-affirmation of the full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is a critical piece of information for investors, as it provides a degree of certainty about the company's financial expectations. Adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for one-time items, is a key metric used to assess a company's operating performance and profitability. A steady outlook suggests management's confidence in the company's financial health and operational efficiency.It's important to note that while the departure of a high-profile leader like Jessica Alba could raise concerns about potential changes in company direction or strategy, the impact may be mitigated by her continued involvement on the board of directors. Leadership transitions are common in the corporate world and the market's response will likely hinge on the perceived stability of the leadership team and the ongoing execution of the company's strategic plan.Investors should consider the implications of leadership changes within the context of the company's overall performance and strategic direction. In this case, the positive financial results may outweigh concerns about the change in Alba's operational role. Sustainability Expert The Honest Company's growth vision and its commitment to clean ingredients and sustainability are not just marketing tactics but are increasingly becoming factors of strategic importance. The company's performance indicates that it is successfully tapping into a market segment that prioritizes these values. This approach can lead to brand loyalty and a strong customer base that is less price-sensitive and more resilient to market fluctuations.From a sustainability perspective, Honest's approach can lead to long-term cost savings and risk mitigation, as regulations around product ingredients and packaging are becoming stricter globally. Companies that are ahead in adopting sustainable practices may find themselves at an advantage, both in terms of compliance and in appealing to a growing demographic of environmentally and health-conscious consumers.Investors interested in environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria will likely view Honest's performance and strategic direction favorably. ESG-focused investing is on the rise and companies that demonstrate a commitment to these principles are often rewarded with a more engaged investor base and potentially a premium valuation. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM LOS ANGELES, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Honest Company (NASDAQ: HNST), a personal care company dedicated to creating clean- and sustainably-designed products, recently reported record quarterly sales and profits for the fourth quarter of 2023, along with an updated long-term growth vision.

The acquisition aims to automate labor-intensive activities and boost audit accuracy and efficiency using advanced domain analytics and natural language processing. The integration of RecordsOne's technology with Performant's data assets is expected to drive successful outcomes and elevate audit offerings. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of AI technology assets from RecordsOne by Performant Financial Corporation represents a strategic move aimed at enhancing the company's competitive edge within the healthcare payment integrity and analytics services sector. By integrating advanced natural language processing and domain analytics into their existing workflows, Performant is positioning itself to improve the efficiency and accuracy of its claims audit process. This could potentially lead to cost savings and higher margins, which are critical factors for investors evaluating the company's financial health and growth prospects.The move aligns with the broader industry trend of incorporating AI to streamline operations, a factor that's increasingly becoming a baseline expectation rather than a competitive advantage. As such, it's important to monitor how this technology integration will translate into financial metrics in the coming quarters. The market will likely look for improvements in operational efficiency, reduction in error rates and scalability of services as indicators of success. If Performant can leverage this technology to capture more market share or enhance its service offerings, it could have a positive impact on its stock performance. Healthcare Technology Analyst From a healthcare technology perspective, the acquisition signifies Performant's commitment to advancing its payment integrity solutions through AI, which is pivotal in an industry burdened by complex documentation and regulatory compliance. The integration of RecordsOne's technology could enable Performant to process claims more rapidly and with greater precision, addressing a key pain point in healthcare administration.Furthermore, the ability to further train the acquired AI using Performant's extensive data assets could lead to the development of more robust algorithms, tailored to the nuances of healthcare billing and insurance protocols. This could enhance Performant's value proposition to its clients by offering more sophisticated analytics services. However, it's important to track how Performant manages the integration of new technology and whether it can effectively translate these technical capabilities into measurable outcomes for clients, as this will be the ultimate test of the acquisition's success. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market implications, Performant's strategic acquisition could be seen as a response to the increasing demand for tech-driven solutions in healthcare payment services. By adopting RecordsOne's AI technology, Performant may not only streamline its own operational processes but also set a new standard in the industry for claims processing and audit efficiency. This could potentially disrupt the market dynamics and put pressure on competitors to seek similar technological advancements to remain competitive.However, the long-term success of this acquisition will depend on Performant's ability to seamlessly integrate the new technology into its service offerings and the extent to which it can effectively monetize these enhanced capabilities. It will be important for Performant to communicate the benefits of this acquisition to its stakeholders clearly and demonstrate the return on investment through improved service delivery and customer satisfaction, which could, in turn, influence the company's market position and investor sentiment. 04/09/2024 - 04:00 PM PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Performant Financial Corporation (Nasdaq: PFMT) (Performant), primarily operating as Performant Healthcare Solutions, a leading provider of technology-enabled payment integrity, eligibility, and related analytics services, today announced the strategic acquisition of key AI technology assets from RecordsOne, a technology company specializing in natural language processing and advanced domain analytics to enhance cost containment workflows within the healthcare sector. “Performant’s proprietary technology has consistently differentiated us from our competitors and I’m excited to incorporate these new game changing capabilities,” said Simeon Kohl, Chief Executive Officer at Performant. “This acquisition supports our strategic initiatives to increase scale and efficiency by leveraging technology to further automate historically labor-intensive activities.

Backlog of orders worth approximately $9.1 million as of March 31, 2024, showcasing increased demand. Awaiting FDA approval to commercialize Re-Tain® with an expected response by May 2024. Negative None. Financial Analyst ImmuCell Corporation's reported increase in total sales for the first quarter of 2024 by 111% compared to the same period in the previous year signals a remarkable growth trajectory. This performance is especially notable given the 42% increase from the preceding quarter, showing a strong upward trend in sales momentum. The company's ability to set a new all-time quarterly sales record indicates effective market penetration and demand fulfillment for its animal health products. Investors should consider the sustainability of this growth, particularly in relation to the company's production capacity and supply chain efficiency, as indicated by the backlog of orders.Moreover, the slight decrease in order backlog from December 2023 to March 2024, though still substantially higher year over year, may suggest that the company is beginning to catch up with demand or experiencing a normalization in order flow. This could be a positive sign of operational improvements but warrants monitoring to see if it reflects a peak in demand. The pending FDA approval for Re-Tain® represents a potential catalyst for future growth and market expansion, which could further impact the company's financial position and stock valuation. Market Research Analyst The animal health industry is a niche but growing segment of the pharmaceutical market and ImmuCell's performance can be a valuable indicator of the sector's overall health. The company's record sales figures suggest a robust demand for products that improve the health and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. This demand could be driven by various factors, including increased awareness of animal health, regulatory changes and a growing global need for protein sources.Investors should note the competitive landscape and potential market share gains by ImmuCell, as well as the impact of global economic conditions on the agriculture sector. The company's focus on practical and scientifically proven products may resonate well with customers prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness in livestock management. The anticipated FDA approval of Re-Tain® could provide a significant competitive advantage and open new revenue streams, further solidifying ImmuCell's market position. Veterinary Industry Expert ImmuCell's preliminary sales results reflect the importance of innovation in the veterinary pharmaceuticals sector. With the company's emphasis on practical solutions for cattle health, it addresses key challenges faced by dairy and beef producers, such as disease prevention and productivity enhancement. The substantial increase in sales and the large backlog of orders underscore the market's recognition of the value these products bring to the livestock industry.Understanding the technical aspects of products like Re-Tain® and their impact on animal health is important for evaluating the company's potential market impact following FDA approval. If Re-Tain® offers a novel approach or significant improvements over existing treatments, it could disrupt the market and drive further sales growth for ImmuCell. The long-term implications for the company hinge on continued product innovation, addressing emerging animal health concerns and maintaining a strong pipeline to meet the evolving needs of the agriculture sector. 04/09/2024 - 04:05 PM PORTLAND, Maine, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ImmuCell Corporation (Nasdaq: ICCC) (“ImmuCell” or the “Company”), a growing animal health company that develops, manufactures and markets scientifically proven and practical products that improve the health and productivity of dairy and beef cattle, today announced preliminary, unaudited sales results for the first quarter of 2024, which ended March 31, 2024.

TASEKO ANNOUNCES PRICING OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES OFFERING,2024-04-09T19:29:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Taseko Mines  announced a US$500 million Senior Secured Notes offering due 2030 at an 8.25% annual interest rate to redeem existing notes, fund projects, and for general corporate purposes.","TASEKO ANNOUNCES PRICING OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES OFFERING Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Taseko Mines announced a US$500 million Senior Secured Notes offering due 2030 at an 8.25% annual interest rate to redeem existing notes, fund projects, and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Taseko Mines Limited's announcement of a $500 million Senior Secured Notes offering with an 8.25% interest rate due in 2030 is a significant financial move. The decision to issue debt at this rate, above current averages for industrial companies, suggests a higher risk profile or a strategic move to lock in capital for expansion, despite higher costs. The market will likely scrutinize the interest rate, comparing it to the industry's average cost of debt to gauge Taseko's financial health and risk management strategy.The use of proceeds to redeem existing debt due in 2026 and to finance capital expenditures at key projects indicates a proactive approach to managing the company's debt maturity profile and investing in growth. Investors should consider the potential for increased earnings from the Florence Copper project and Gibraltar mine against the cost of additional interest expenses. The impact on Taseko's leverage ratios and cash flow will be important for evaluating the long-term sustainability of this financial strategy. Legal Expert The structuring of the Notes as Senior Secured with junior priority liens on subsidiary shares and certain rights under a joint venture agreement introduces layers of complexity for stakeholders. Investors need to understand the legal implications of these securities, particularly in scenarios of default or restructuring. The guarantees from restricted subsidiaries and the conditional release upon the admission of a minority joint venture partner for the Florence Copper project are legal nuances that could affect the Notes' recovery value in adverse situations.Furthermore, the fact that the Notes will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and will be exempt from registration requirements and prospectus qualification in Canada limits the potential investor base to 'qualified institutional buyers' and non-U.S. persons. This legal structuring has implications for liquidity and marketability of the Notes, potentially affecting their trading premium or discount in secondary markets. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Taseko's issuance of Senior Secured Notes is an indicator of the company's strategic direction and confidence in its projects. The allocation of funds towards the Florence Copper project and the Gibraltar mine suggests a bullish outlook on copper demand and prices. Given the importance of copper in electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies, the market will likely view this capital allocation as a positive signal for Taseko's future growth prospects.However, the market's reception of the Notes will also depend on the broader economic context, including interest rates, commodity prices and investor appetite for mining sector debt. The high-interest rate on the Notes might reflect current market conditions and investor expectations for higher yields amidst economic uncertainties. The success of this offering could set a precedent for similar companies considering debt financing in a potentially tightening credit market. 04/09/2024 - 03:29 PM VANCOUVER, BC, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Taseko Mines Limited (TSX: TKO) (NYSE American: TGB) (LSE: TKO) (""Taseko"") today announced that it has priced an offering of US$500 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the ""Notes"").

AOI focuses on regenerative farming, sustainability, and high-quality oil production. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Australian Oilseeds Holdings Limited (AOI) into the United States represents a strategic move that taps into the growing demand for health-conscious food products. The U.S. market has seen a surge in consumer preference for non-GMO and organic products, which aligns with AOI's product offerings. As the largest cold pressing oil plant in the APAC region, AOI's entry into the U.S. could disrupt the existing market dynamics and potentially capture a significant market share.AOI's commitment to regenerative farming and sustainable practices could also resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and may provide a competitive edge over conventional oil producers. The reduced carbon footprint of their products could appeal to stakeholders interested in corporate social responsibility. However, it is important to consider the challenges AOI may face, such as regulatory hurdles, establishing supply chains and consumer acceptance in a new market. Environmental Sustainability Analyst AOI's emphasis on sustainability and renewable energy use in their operations is noteworthy. Their investment in solar and biodiesel, along with low-impact packaging initiatives, demonstrates a proactive approach to reducing environmental impact. This could lead to cost savings in the long run and improve brand reputation, which is increasingly important to modern consumers.However, it's essential to scrutinize the actual implementation of these initiatives and the extent to which they contribute to the company's bottom line. The claim of a 40-50% lower carbon footprint compared to conventional processors is a significant statement that should be backed by transparent data and could be leveraged for marketing purposes. The long-term benefits of these sustainability efforts, including potential tax incentives and consumer loyalty, are aspects that stakeholders should watch closely. Financial Analyst The financial implications of AOI's expansion into the U.S. market are multifaceted. On one hand, the initial investment in establishing operations and marketing could be substantial. However, the potential revenue from accessing a large and growing segment of health-conscious consumers in the U.S. could outweigh these costs over time.Investors should consider the scalability of AOI's cold pressing technology and its ability to meet increased demand without compromising quality. Additionally, the company's financial health, including cash flow and debt levels, will be important in determining its ability to sustain expansion efforts. It will be important to monitor AOI's quarterly financial reports following the expansion to gauge the success of their U.S. market entry. 04/09/2024 - 03:15 PM ~ Over the past 20 years, AOI has grown to be the largest cold pressing oil plant in the APAC region, pressing strictly GMO free conventional and organic oilseeds ~ New York, NY and Sydney, Australia, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Australian Oilseeds Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: COOT), a Cayman Islands exempted company “Australian Oilseeds” or “AOI”) is pleased to announce that it will be expanding its Australian operations to the United States effective July 2024.

The paper highlights the potential of RMC-6236 in inhibiting RAS-dependent tumor growth across multiple cancer types, achieving deep and durable tumor regressions. Case studies from the Phase 1/1b clinical trial show complete responses in patients with NSCLC and PDAC, supporting the anti-tumor activity of RMC-6236. Positive None. Negative None. Oncology Doctor The recent findings regarding RMC-6236 suggest a significant advancement in the field of targeted cancer therapy. As an oncologist, the potential of this multi-selective inhibitor to induce complete responses in patients with advanced KRAS-G12V NSCLC and KRAS-G12D PDAC is highly encouraging. The ability to target both mutant and wild-type RAS-GTP is a notable deviation from existing therapies, which primarily focus on specific KRAS mutations in their inactive state.Moreover, the broad activity across various cancer types, including those with K/N/HRAS mutations, indicates a wide therapeutic window. This could lead to a paradigm shift in treating RAS-driven cancers, which are known for their aggressive nature and limited treatment options. The well-tolerated profile of RMC-6236 at effective dosages is also promising, potentially reducing the severity of side effects compared to more toxic treatments currently in use. Medical Research Analyst The preclinical data and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling for RMC-6236 provide a strong foundation for the ongoing clinical trials. From a research perspective, the translational approach taken by Revolution Medicines, which includes a rigorous PK/efficacy modeling, is exemplary. The predicted daily doses for tumor control and objective responses being validated by case studies is a robust indicator of the drug's potential efficacy in a clinical setting.The choice to expand the clinical development program based on these preliminary results is a calculated risk, but one that is backed by solid scientific data. The implications for stakeholders are substantial, as success in the pivotal studies could position RMC-6236 as a leading therapy in the RAS-targeted drug market. However, it is critical to remain cautious until larger clinical trials validate these early findings. Market Research Analyst The announcement pertaining to RMC-6236 is likely to have a positive impact on the market perception of Revolution Medicines. The stock market often reacts favorably to promising clinical trial data, especially in the high-stakes arena of oncology drug development. The potential expansion of the clinical program into pivotal studies could signal to investors a higher confidence level in the drug's prospects, possibly influencing the company's stock valuation.It is important to note that while these developments are promising, the actual market impact will depend on further clinical results, regulatory approvals and the ability of the company to successfully commercialize the drug. Additionally, the competitive landscape, with other companies also targeting RAS mutations, will play a important role in determining the long-term success and market share of RMC-6236. 04/09/2024 - 03:34 PM Simultaneous publication and presentation of RMC-6236 chemical structure, preclinical data and case studies during the “KRAS: Broadening the Attack Beyond G12C with Small Molecules and Immuno-Oncology"" Session at AACR 2024 in San DiegoREDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Revolution Medicines, Inc. (Nasdaq: RVMD), a clinical-stage oncology company developing targeted therapies for patients with RAS-addicted cancers, today announced the publication of a peer-reviewed research paper in Cancer Discovery. The scientific paper details the discovery and preclinical to clinical translation for RMC-6236, an investigational RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitor, and includes exemplary case studies from the current Phase 1/1b clinical trial demonstrating the initial anti-tumor activity of RMC-6236. This original research was led by scientists at Revolution Medicines and conducted in collaboration with researchers from across the U.S. and Europe. Oncogenic RAS proteins drive up to 30 percent of all human cancers, most notably non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). RAS G12 mutations, such as G12D, G12V and G12C, predominate in human cancers. Currently approved KRAS-targeted cancer therapies target one particular KRAS mutation, KRAS G12C, in the GDP-bound (OFF) state. The paper describes the discovery of RMC-6236, an oral, multi-selective inhibitor of the active GTP-bound (ON) state of both mutant and wild-type RAS. In preclinical studies, RMC-6236 was effective in inhibiting the growth of RAS-dependent tumor cells, while sparing normal tissues. RMC-6236 was found to be well-tolerated and drove deep and durable tumor regressions across multiple cancer types including NSCLC, PDAC, CRC, gastric and gynecologic cancers, with tumor models dependent on KRAS G12 mutations being particularly sensitive. This benefit was found to extend to models with K/N/HRAS hotspot mutations at G13 and Q61 as well. The paper also highlights translational pharmacokinetics (PK)/efficacy and PK/pharmacodynamics modeling, which predicted that daily doses of 100 mg and 300 mg would achieve tumor control and objective responses, respectively, in patients with RAS-driven tumors. Consistent with this, case studies from the Phase 1/1b RMC-6236 monotherapy clinical trial are featured, describing two patients with advanced KRAS-G12V NSCLC and KRAS-G12D PDAC, respectively, who were treated with 300 mg of RMC-6236 daily. Each of these two patients achieved a complete response as best response demonstrating the potential anti-tumor activity of RMC-6236. “The discovery of RMC-6236 allowed for the first-ever therapeutic evaluation of targeted concurrent inhibition of both canonical mutant and wild-type RAS-GTP (RAS(ON)) in RAS-driven cancers. The RMC-6236 clinical data that we have shared not only provide platform validation of our tri-complex inhibitor approach, but also refute the dogma that one could not induce anti-tumor activity by broad inhibition of multiple RAS variants, including wild-type RAS, at doses that would be well tolerated,” said Steve Kelsey, M.D., president, research and development of Revolution Medicines. “The research summarized in our Cancer Discovery paper, combined with the preliminary RMC-6236 clinical data presented in late 2023, provide us and our investigators with the confidence to advance and expand our RMC-6236 clinical development program.” Revolution Medicines is currently evaluating RMC-6236 as monotherapy in a Phase 1/1b trial in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring G12X, G13X and Q61X mutations (NCT05379985). Following promising preliminary data in this Phase 1/1b study, planning is underway to initiate pivotal studies of RMC-6236 as monotherapy in NSCLC and PDAC. RMC-6236 is also being evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy in patients with advanced RAS-mutated solid tumors (NCT06162221) and in combination with RMC-6291, the company’s investigational RAS(ON) G12C-selective inhibitor, for patients with advanced KRAS G12C-mutated solid tumors (NCT06128551). Today’s publication coincides with the company’s presentation of RMC-6236 preclinical data and additional clinical case studies during the “KRAS: Broadening the Attack Beyond G12C with Small Molecules and Immuno-Oncology” session today at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2024 in San Diego.

Hafnia Limited - Commencement of Trading and Admission to Trading on NYSE,2024-04-09T18:10:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,Hafnia  successfully completes the conversion of its common shares to be primarily recorded and settled within the Depository Trust Company in the U.S. and secondarily in Euronext Securities Oslo through a Central Securities Depository link. The company's common shares will commence trading on the NYSE under the ticker code 'HAFN' from 9 April 2024 after the Trading Suspension on the OSE is lifted.,"Hafnia Limited - Commencement of Trading and Admission to Trading on NYSE Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Hafnia successfully completes the conversion of its common shares to be primarily recorded and settled within the Depository Trust Company in the U.S. and secondarily in Euronext Securities Oslo through a Central Securities Depository link. The company's common shares will commence trading on the NYSE under the ticker code 'HAFN' from 9 April 2024 after the Trading Suspension on the OSE is lifted. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The listing of Hafnia Limited's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) represents a strategic move to access a broader capital market, potentially increasing the company's visibility among global investors. The transition to a dual listing, with primary recording and settlement through the Depository Trust Company (DTC) in the U.S. and secondary recording in Euronext Securities Oslo (VPS), could enhance liquidity for Hafnia's shares by making them more accessible to a wider investor base.From a financial standpoint, the successful completion of the Trading Suspension and Conversion indicates a well-managed administrative process, which is essential for maintaining investor confidence during such transitions. The resumption of trading on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) without any reported issues suggests minimal disruption to existing shareholders. The dual listing could potentially lead to a re-rating of the stock as it may now appeal to investors who prefer or are restricted to investing in U.S.-listed securities.However, it is important to monitor the costs associated with maintaining listings on multiple exchanges, as well as the regulatory compliance in different jurisdictions, which can be complex and resource-intensive. The impact of these factors on the company's financials should be considered by current and potential investors. Market Research Analyst The expansion of Hafnia Limited into the NYSE is a significant development in the company's growth trajectory. Historically, companies that list on U.S. exchanges may experience increased analyst coverage and media attention, which can lead to greater brand recognition and potentially impact stock performance positively.It is also noteworthy that Hafnia has chosen the ticker codes 'HAFN' for NYSE and 'HAFNI' for OSE, which suggests a branding strategy aimed at maintaining consistency and recognition across different markets. Investors should watch how the market reacts to Hafnia's new listing, as initial trading days can sometimes provide insights into market sentiment and long-term interest from institutional investors.Additionally, the completion of the Conversion and the seamless resumption of trading indicate a level of operational competence that could instill confidence in the market. This operational efficiency, combined with the strategic advantages of a U.S. listing, could bode well for the company's market performance in the short to medium term. 04/09/2024 - 02:10 PM SINGAPORE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Reference is made to the announcement made by Hafnia Limited (""Hafnia"" or the “Company”) on 27 March 2024, regarding the Company’s public filing of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), for its listing of the Company's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE""), the announcement 3 April 2024 regarding the approval by the NYSE for the U.S. listing and the announcement made on 4 April 2024 regarding suspension of the trading in the Company's common shares listed on the OSE (the ""Trading Suspension""), to amend the registration structure for all its common shares to be primarily recorded and settled within the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) in the United States and secondarily recorded and settled in Euronext Securities Oslo (the “VPS”) through a Central Securities Depository (“CSD”) link (the “Conversion”).
