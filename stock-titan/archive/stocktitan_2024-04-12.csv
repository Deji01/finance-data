This figure may then be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.About AgronomicsAgronomics is a leading London-listed company focussing on investment opportunities within the field of cellular agriculture. The Company has established a portfolio of over 20 companies in this rapidly advancing sector. It seeks to invest in companies owning technologies with defensible intellectual property that offer new ways of producing food and materials with a focus on products historically derived from animals. These technologies are driving a major disruption in agriculture, offering solutions to improve sustainability, as well as addressing human health, animal welfare and environmental damage. This disruption will decouple supply chains from the environment and animals and improve food security for the world's expanding population. A full list of Agronomics' portfolio companies is available at https://agronomics.im/.About Cellular AgricultureCellular Agriculture is the production of agriculture products directly from cells, as opposed to raising an animal for slaughter or growing crops. This encompasses cell culture to produce cultivated meat and materials, and fermentation processes that harness a combination of molecular biology, synthetic biology, tissue engineering and biotechnology to massively simplify production methods in a sustainable manner.Over the coming decades, the source of the world's food supply traditionally derived from conventional agriculture is going to change dramatically. We have already witnessed the first wave of this shift with the consumer adoption of plant-based alternative proteins but today, we are on the cusp of an even bigger wave of change. This is being facilitated by advances in cellular agriculture. This change is necessary, given scientists' claims that if we maintain existing animal protein consumption patterns, then we will not meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to 1.5℃.AT Kearney, a global consultancy firm, projects that cultivated meat's market share will reach 35% by 2040. This combined with the Good Food Institute's estimate that a US $1.8 trillion investment will be required in order to produce just 10% of the world's protein using this technology, means that we are on the cusp of a multi-decade flow of capital to build out manufacturing facilities.For further information please contact:Agronomics LimitedBeaumont Cornish LimitedCanaccord Genuity LimitedCavendish Securities PlcPeterhouse Capital LimitedSEC NewgateThe CompanyNomadJoint BrokerJoint BrokerJoint BrokerPublic RelationsJim MellonDenham EkeRoland CornishJames BiddleAndrew PottsHarry PardoeAlex AylenGiles BallenyMichael JohnsonLucy WilliamsCharles GoodfellowBob HuxfordAnthony Hughes+44 (0) 1624 639396info@agronomics.im+44 (0) 207 628 3396+44 (0) 207 523 8000+44 (0) 207 397 8900+44 (0) 207 469 0936agronomics@secnewgate.co.ukThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The private placement is priced 'at-the-market' and is anticipated to close soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The private placement executed by Oncocyte is a strategic financial move, aimed at bolstering the company's capital structure. The issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants at an 'at-the-market' price suggests a direct approach to capital raising without significant discounts, which can be indicative of investor confidence in the company's prospects. The immediate impact on the stock market may include dilution of existing shares, which often leads to a temporary decrease in share price as supply outstrips demand.However, the long-term effects could be more positive if the funds are allocated effectively towards growth initiatives or R&D. Investors should monitor the deployment of this capital to gauge future performance. The relatively small difference between the price of common stock and pre-funded warrants, along with the nominal exercise price of the warrants, makes this an attractive proposition for investors looking for potential upside with limited downside risk. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Oncocyte's entry into definitive securities purchase agreements is a signal to the market about the company's growth trajectory and liquidity position. The healthcare diagnostics sector is highly competitive and companies like Oncocyte need to invest continually in technology and market expansion to maintain relevance. The capital raised through this private placement could enable Oncocyte to scale operations or invest in strategic partnerships.Investors and competitors alike will be watching closely to see how Oncocyte utilizes this influx of funds. Success in leveraging these resources could lead to increased market share and improved competitive positioning. Conversely, any missteps in capital allocation could raise questions about management's strategic decision-making. It is important for stakeholders to consider the company's historical performance in managing investments and achieving projected outcomes. Biotech Industry Analyst In the context of the biotech industry, Oncocyte's capital raise through a private placement is a common occurrence, particularly for companies seeking to accelerate development pipelines or expand diagnostic services. The precision diagnostics field is rapidly evolving and continuous innovation is critical for maintaining a competitive edge. The funds raised could be instrumental in advancing Oncocyte's diagnostic technologies or expanding its product offerings.Given the industry's high burn rate for cash due to extensive research and development cycles, the financial health of a company like Oncocyte can be a significant indicator of its ability to sustain operations and pursue long-term growth strategies. Stakeholders should assess the company's R&D pipeline and potential market opportunities for any new diagnostics being developed. Effective use of the raised capital in these areas could be a key driver of Oncocyte's future valuation and market performance. 04/11/2024 - 09:46 PM IRVINE, Calif., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncocyte Corporation (Nasdaq: OCX) (“Oncocyte” or the “Company”), a precision diagnostics company, today announced that it has entered into definitive securities purchase agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”) for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of 5,077,387 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $ 2.9164 per share of common stock, and pre-funded warrants to purchase 342,888 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $2.9163 per pre-funded warrant (the “Pre-Funded Warrants”).

(Nasdaq: NRIX) announces the pricing of an upsized underwritten public offering, including shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants, with expected gross proceeds of $175.0 million.","Nurix Therapeutics Announces Pricing of Upsized $175.0 Million Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Nurix Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: NRIX) announces the pricing of an upsized underwritten public offering, including shares of common stock and pre-funded warrants, with expected gross proceeds of $175.0 million. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Nurix Therapeutics represents a significant capital influx, with expected gross proceeds of $175 million. This move indicates a strategic effort to bolster the company's financial position, potentially to fund research and development, expand operations, or pay off existing debts. The pricing of shares at $15.00 suggests a valuation decision that balances current market conditions with the aim of attracting a broad range of public investors.Furthermore, the inclusion of pre-funded warrants as an alternative investment option for certain investors is noteworthy. These warrants allow investors to purchase shares at a later date, at nearly the same price as the public offering, minus a nominal exercise price. This could be an attractive proposition for those who anticipate the company's value to increase but prefer to delay the actual share purchase.An additional aspect to consider is the 30-day option granted to underwriters to purchase extra shares. This over-allotment option could stabilize the stock price post-offering and provide a cushion against market volatility. However, it's important for investors to monitor how the influx of new shares might affect the stock's price due to potential dilution. Market Research Analyst The biotech sector, where Nurix operates, is highly competitive and capital-intensive. Raising capital through a public offering is a common strategy for such companies to sustain long-term projects, especially those in the clinical stage with no products on the market yet.

These measures are not recognised measures under IFRS, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of the financial information reported under IFRS. The Company uses non-IFRS measures including ""EBITDA"", ""EBITDA %"", and ""recurring revenue"". Management uses these non-IFRS measures to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, to prepare annual operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation. As required by Canadian securities laws, the Company defines and reconciles these non-IFRS measures below: EBITDA and EBITDA %EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income or loss) before finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is reconciled to net income (loss) from the financial statements. EBITDA % ratio is determined by dividing EBITDA by total revenue for the year. EBITDA and EBITDA % is frequently used to assess profitability before the impact of finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Management uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and to prepare annual operating budgets. EBITDA and EBITDA % are measures commonly reported and widely used as a valuation metric.Recurring RevenueRecurring Revenue consists of revenues generated through subscriptions that grant access to products and services with recurring billing cycles. The subscriptions are recognized on an overtime basis in accordance with IFRS 15. Recurring Revenue is a part of total revenue disclosed in the financial statements, as determined in accordance with IFRS 15. Recurring Revenue represents revenues that are stable and the Company expects to earn continuously. Recurring Revenue % is determined by dividing Recurring Revenue by total revenue for the year. Recurring Revenue is frequently used to determine any indicators of future revenue growth and revenue trends. Recurring Revenue and Recurring Revenue % are measures commonly reported and widely used as a valuation metric.

Empire Petroleum Announces Full Subscription of Rights Offering,2024-04-11T20:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Empire Petroleum  (EP) successfully completed its fully subscribed rights offering, exceeding the target with over 100% subscriptions. The offering is expected to generate approximately $20.66 million in gross proceeds for the company, which will be used for drilling activities, 3D seismic, land and lease purchases, enhanced oil recovery facilities, and general corporate purposes.","Empire Petroleum Announces Full Subscription of Rights Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Empire Petroleum (EP) successfully completed its fully subscribed rights offering, exceeding the target with over 100% subscriptions. The offering is expected to generate approximately $20.66 million in gross proceeds for the company, which will be used for drilling activities, 3D seismic, land and lease purchases, enhanced oil recovery facilities, and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The successful subscription of Empire Petroleum Corporation's Rights Offering is a positive signal for the company's liquidity and investor confidence. With subscriptions exceeding the available shares, there is a clear indication of strong demand and backing from the investor community. It is noteworthy that the Rights Offering is expected to generate approximately $20.66 million in gross proceeds, which can significantly bolster the company's capital for planned expansions and operations.From a financial perspective, the use of these funds for drilling activity, 3D seismic analysis, land and lease acquisitions and enhanced oil recovery facilities is a strategic investment into the company's core business. This capital injection should ideally lead to increased production capacity and potentially higher future revenues. However, investors should monitor how effectively the funds are utilized, as mismanagement could dilute the value of their investment. Energy Sector Analyst Empire Petroleum's focus on using the proceeds for current and future drilling activity, as well as for 3D seismic technology, suggests a commitment to advanced exploration techniques and resource optimization. 3D seismic technology is a critical tool in the energy sector, enabling more accurate imaging of subsurface geology to identify potential hydrocarbon reservoirs. This could lead to more efficient drilling and higher success rates in finding oil and gas deposits.Furthermore, the investment in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) facilities represents a long-term strategic move. EOR technologies can significantly increase the amount of crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field. As the industry faces challenges such as declining conventional oil reserves and increasing environmental concerns, EOR presents an opportunity to maximize output from existing assets and extend the life of mature fields. Market Research Analyst Empire Petroleum's Rights Offering also reflects broader market trends, where energy companies are seeking to strengthen their balance sheets and invest in technology to stay competitive. The proactive participation of major stockholders, including the Chairman and Energy Evolution Master Fund, suggests a vote of confidence in the company's strategic direction and management. This could be a positive indicator for potential investors.However, it's important to consider the dilutive effect of the Rights Offering on current shareholders. While it is a common fundraising approach, the introduction of additional shares can lead to a reduction in existing shareholders' percentage of ownership. This is somewhat mitigated by the pro-rata allocation of unsubscribed shares to oversubscribing stockholders, which aims to maintain a fair balance of ownership post-offering. 04/11/2024 - 04:15 PM TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Empire Petroleum Corporation (NYSE American: EP) (""Empire"" or the ""Company""), an oil and gas company with current producing assets in New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Louisiana, announced today its previously announced rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) was fully subscribed. The subscription period for the Rights Offering expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2024. The Company received subscriptions for more than 100% of the shares available in the Rights Offering. Accordingly, stockholders will receive their basic subscription privilege but, because there are not enough shares to satisfy all oversubscriptions, remaining shares will be allocated pro-rata, after eliminating all fractional shares, among oversubscribing stockholders. As previously indicated, our largest stockholders, Phil E. Mulacek, Chairman of the Board of the Company, and Energy Evolution Master Fund, Ltd., a Cayman Islands exempted company, participated in the Rights Offering and fully subscribed to the shares of common stock corresponding to their subscription rights, as well as fully exercising their over-subscription rights to purchase their pro rata share of the underlying securities related to the rights offering that remain unsubscribed. The Rights Offering is expected to result in gross proceeds, before expenses, to the Company of approximately $20.66 million. The Company will use the proceeds from the Rights Offering for current and future drilling activity, 3D seismic, land and lease purchases, enhanced oil recovery facilities and general corporate purposes. The Rights Offering is more fully described in the prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 7, 2024, as supplemented by the prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on March 28, 2024. About Empire Petroleum Empire Petroleum Corporation is a publicly traded, Tulsa-based oil and gas company with current producing assets in New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Texas, and Louisiana.

(SAIC) unveils a new strategic growth vision to enhance customer and stakeholder value. CEO Toni Townes-Whitley presents the 2024 Investor Day attendees with the company's innovative enterprise growth strategy. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining the recent announcement by Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) regarding their new enterprise growth strategy, a pivotal factor is the company's focus on strategic pivots and innovation investments. This signifies a deliberate shift to areas that could potentially offer higher margins and more sustainable revenue streams. It's an approach that resonates with the current market trend where companies are increasingly investing in innovation to differentiate themselves in competitive sectors.For investors, the promise of profitable organic growth is a positive signal. It suggests that SAIC is looking to improve its financial performance through internal development rather than relying on external factors or acquisitions. This could lead to a better valuation of the company's stock if the strategy is executed effectively. However, the actual impact on the stock will depend on the company's ability to deliver on these strategic changes and the market's perception of their potential for success. Financial Analyst The interaction with key analysts and shareholders is an integral part of SAIC's effort to communicate its future plans and instill confidence in its growth trajectory. By engaging with these stakeholders, SAIC is not only providing transparency but also potentially shaping expectations. The effectiveness of this communication can be reflected in stock performance, as it may affect investor sentiment.Investors will be looking for concrete metrics and milestones in the near future to gauge the success of the strategic shifts. These could include increased revenue from new products or services, improved profit margins and a stronger competitive position. Should SAIC's innovation investments lead to significant marketable products or services, it could indeed accelerate organic growth and enhance shareholder value. Investment Advisor SAIC's announcement points to a strategic repositioning that could be appealing to investors seeking growth in the technology sector. The focus on innovation is particularly relevant given the rapid pace of technological change. Investors will likely monitor the company's progress closely, looking for early indicators of the strategy's effectiveness such as patent filings, new product announcements, or partnerships in emerging technology areas.Long-term, if SAIC manages to carve out a niche in high-demand technology sectors, it could see a significant competitive advantage. However, innovation carries inherent risks and requires substantial investment, both financial and intellectual. The balance between investment and return will be critical and investors will need to weigh the potential for higher returns against the risks associated with the company's new strategic direction. 04/11/2024 - 06:29 PM Company to focus on strategic pivots and innovation investments to accelerate profitable organic growth RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Science Applications International Corp.

(LGVN) closes public offering, raising $5.2 million for clinical and regulatory development of Lomecel-B™. Board members and insiders participate in the offering. The Company also amends existing warrants to lower exercise price and extend expiration dates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent public offering by Longeveron Inc. represents a strategic move to bolster its financial position and support its clinical development programs. The offering's gross proceeds of approximately $5.2 million, before expenses, provide a capital infusion that can be pivotal for the company's operations. However, it's essential to note that the pricing of the shares and warrants at $2.35 is a critical factor for current and potential investors. This price point might reflect market sentiment about the company's valuation and future prospects.Moreover, the participation of board members and insiders to the tune of $700,000 sends a positive signal about their confidence in the company's direction. This insider buying could be interpreted as an endorsement of the company's strategy and potential for success in its clinical trials. Nonetheless, investors should consider the dilutive effect of the additional shares on the market, which can impact the stock's price and existing shareholders' value.Adjusting the exercise price of existing warrants from $16.50 to $2.35 is a significant alteration. This amendment potentially makes it more attractive for warrant holders to exercise their options, injecting more capital into Longeveron but also potentially leading to further dilution. The impact of these changes on Longeveron's stock will be closely watched by investors, as it may influence the company's ability to attract future capital and its overall market stability. Biotechnology Market Analyst Longeveron's focus on developing cellular therapies for conditions like hypoplastic left heart syndrome and Alzheimer's disease places it within a highly specialized and competitive segment of the biotechnology market. The success of its lead product candidate, Lomecel-B™, is important for the company's future. The allocation of the net proceeds from the public offering towards clinical and regulatory development indicates a commitment to advancing its pipeline.Investors should be aware of the inherent risks and long timelines associated with biotech clinical trials. The outcomes are uncertain and can significantly affect the company's financial health and stock performance. It is also important to consider the broader market context, including regulatory hurdles, market saturation and the competitive landscape when evaluating Longeveron's potential for growth.Given the early stage of Longeveron's product development, the successful use of the capital raised to navigate through clinical trials and regulatory processes is essential. The company's ability to achieve milestones and obtain necessary approvals will be a key driver of its valuation and investor confidence. Market analysts will be monitoring Longeveron's progress closely, as it could set a precedent for investment in similar early-stage biotech companies. Securities Compliance Expert Longeveron's adherence to SEC regulations in conducting its public offering is an important aspect of the transaction. The offering's reliance on a previously filed and effective registration statement on Form S-1 ensures compliance with federal securities laws. The availability of the final prospectus on the SEC's website provides transparency and allows investors to make informed decisions.For investors, the compliance with regulatory requirements is reassuring, as it reduces the risk of legal complications that could adversely affect the investment. However, it's essential for investors to review the prospectus and understand the risks associated with the securities being offered, including the potential for dilution and the amended terms of the existing warrants.The adjustment of the exercise price and the extension of the expiration dates for the existing warrants could have implications for the company's short-term liquidity and long-term financial strategy. Compliance experts will likely scrutinize these amendments to ensure they align with shareholder interests and regulatory standards. 04/11/2024 - 05:17 PM MIAMI, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Longeveron Inc.

The agreement grants Bio-Rad global exclusivity in transplant monitoring commercialization, with an equity investment option upon FDA clearance. The new product is set to launch in Q2 2024 in the US and EU. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Examining the partnership between Oncocyte Corporation and Bio-Rad Laboratories reveals a strategic move to capitalize on the growing transplant diagnostics market. The collaboration leverages Bio-Rad's established global distribution network and technical expertise in Droplet Digital PCR, a highly sensitive and quantitative DNA analysis technique. This partnership is poised to enhance the commercial prospects of the GraftAssure™ assay, particularly given the exclusivity granted to Bio-Rad for global commercial rights outside the US and Germany.With over 157,000 transplants occurring annually and a market growth rate of 9.1%, the potential market for non-invasive biomarker testing, such as dd-cfDNA, is significant. The assay's targeted launch to academic transplant centers positions it within a niche yet critical segment that could serve as a springboard for broader clinical adoption. The phased launch strategy, with a broader release in the second half of 2024, suggests a calculated approach to market penetration and scaling up production.However, the true inflection point for the assay's market impact hinges on FDA clearance. The option for IVD commercial rights upon FDA approval could be a catalyst for substantial revenue growth for Oncocyte, with Bio-Rad's subsequent equity investment reinforcing the financial stability and collaborative commitment of both entities. The market will be watching closely for the FDA's decision, as it will significantly influence the commercial trajectory of the GraftAssure™ assay. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the partnership agreement between Oncocyte and Bio-Rad is a strategic initiative that could generate substantial value for both companies. Bio-Rad's equity investment, contingent upon FDA clearance, not only provides Oncocyte with capital infusion but also signifies confidence in the product's commercial viability. The exclusivity aspect of the deal ensures that Bio-Rad has a vested interest in maximizing the assay's market penetration, which could lead to substantial revenue growth for Oncocyte, given the sizable market opportunity estimated at over $1 billion.Investors should note the potential for increased operational expenses as the companies ramp up for the launch and commercialization efforts. However, the co-marketing strategy in the US and Germany could mitigate some of these costs by leveraging Bio-Rad's existing resources. The deal's structure, with staged investments and commercial rights tied to regulatory milestones, reduces upfront risk for Bio-Rad while providing Oncocyte with the financial and operational support needed for market entry.It is important to monitor Oncocyte's SEC filings for further details on the financial terms, as they will provide greater insight into the deal's structure and the potential impact on the company's balance sheet. Investors should also consider the competitive landscape and the adoption rate of non-invasive testing in transplant monitoring to assess the long-term revenue potential of the GraftAssure™ assay. 04/11/2024 - 05:30 PM - Bio-Rad expects to make equity investment in support of deal - Agreement provides for global exclusivity in transplant monitoring commercialization - Bio-Rad granted subsequent investment option upon FDA clearance IRVINE, Calif., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oncocyte Corporation (Nasdaq: OCX), a precision diagnostics company, today announced a partnership agreement with Bio-Rad Laboratories (NYSE: BIO), a global leader in life science research and clinical diagnostics products, for the commercialization of its research use only GraftAssure™ assay, powered by Droplet Digital™ PCR (ddPCR™)*. The new product is expected to launch in Q2 2024 to a select group of academic transplant centers in the US and EU and more broadly in the second half of the year. As part of the agreement, Bio-Rad and Oncocyte will co-market the assay inside the US and Germany, with Oncocyte acting as commercial lead. Outside these countries Bio-Rad has been granted exclusive global distribution and commercial rights. “As we move towards launch, having the support of the Bio-Rad team in the US and Germany gives us the scale we need to meet the market opportunity,” said Josh Riggs, Oncocyte’s CEO. “The QX600 ddPCR platform, along with their expertise in serving the life science market, makes Bio-Rad a natural partner for our transplant technology.” Going forward, both companies have committed to joint efforts in developing a regulated product designed to facilitate widespread distribution and clinical adoption in the United States and beyond. Additionally, Bio-Rad has been granted an option for IVD commercial rights at FDA clearance, subject to meeting specific objectives. Exercising the option would come with a second equity investment into Oncocyte. Further details of the agreement can be found in Oncocyte’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. dd-cfDNA is a proven, non-invasive biomarker with growing demand offering an estimated three million testing opportunities globally and driving a market exceeding $1 billion.

Companies are focusing on digital transformation, cloud computing, and mainframe technologies to derive value for business-critical functions. Mainframe transformation is driving demand for new products and services in the region. Positive None. Negative None. IT Strategy Consultant From an IT strategy perspective, the report highlights a nuanced landscape where enterprises in Asia Pacific are not uniformly abandoning mainframes for cloud solutions. Instead, they're assessing the value proposition of mainframes in the context of their specific technical and business requirements. This suggests a mature approach to IT infrastructure, where the decision to optimize or modernize is not a one-size-fits-all but a strategic choice.Organizations are evidently recognizing the enduring strengths of mainframes—reliability, availability, security—particularly for business-critical functions. This is in contrast to the industry's earlier predictions of mainframes becoming obsolete. The report's findings indicate a shift towards a hybrid IT environment where mainframes coexist with cloud services, which is a significant development for businesses that could influence their investment in IT infrastructure.The mention of mainframe-as-a-service (MFaaS) as a growing trend is particularly interesting. By moving mainframe expenses from capital to operational expenditures, companies can potentially achieve greater financial flexibility. This model aligns with the broader industry shift towards 'as-a-service' offerings, potentially impacting how businesses budget for and manage their IT resources. Cloud Computing Analyst Cloud computing's role in this context is multifaceted. Companies are leveraging cloud services for their on-demand capabilities and integration with enterprise-wide DevOps methodologies. This reflects the broader industry trend towards agile, scalable and cost-efficient IT solutions. The shift towards cloud/mainframe integration is a testament to cloud computing's flexibility and its ability to complement existing technologies rather than replace them entirely.The report's indication of increased demand for products that support this integration suggests a market opportunity for cloud service providers. However, it also implies a challenge for providers to ensure seamless integration with legacy systems. The cultural change required to embrace DevOps in traditionally mainframe-focused organizations should not be underestimated, as it involves significant shifts in processes and mindsets.The growing interest in generative AI to enhance productivity within mainframe environments is another key point. It showcases the potential for cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize even the most established IT systems, suggesting a future where AI-driven automation could become a standard component of mainframe operations. Human Resources Specialist The skills shortage mentioned in the report is a critical human resources challenge. As mainframes continue to play a significant role in business operations, the need for skilled professionals who can manage and innovate on these platforms is becoming more acute. The integration of mainframes with generative AI applications further complicates this issue, as it requires a workforce that is not only proficient in legacy technologies but also adept in emerging technologies.This shortage could lead to increased competition for talent, potentially driving up labor costs and impacting the profitability of businesses in the region. Companies may need to invest more in training and development programs to upskill their existing workforce or consider alternative strategies such as partnerships with service providers who can supply the necessary expertise.The report's findings on the skills gap should serve as a call to action for educational institutions and the industry to collaborate on developing curricula and certification programs that address this impending shortage. 04/11/2024 - 08:00 PM Companies in the region take different approaches to optimizing legacy systems or modernizing software based on requirements, ISG Provider Lens™ report says SYDNEY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Both mainframe optimization and application modernization are major trends among enterprises in Asia Pacific, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Mainframes — Services and Solutions report for Asia Pacific finds that companies in the region (which for this report covers Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia and India) have had their sights set on digital transformation and cloud computing since before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in many cases, they have since realized they can continue to derive value from mainframe technologies far into the future. “After discovering the true costs of migration and cloud computing, enterprises in Asia Pacific are taking a range of different approaches to modernization,” said Michael Gale, partner and regional leader, ISG Asia Pacific. “They recognize that the most important thing is placing the right workload on the right platform.” Many companies cannot function without their mainframe environment because they rely on its reliability, availability and security for business-critical functions, the report says. Depending on technical and business requirements, they are choosing whether to host particular applications on the mainframe, take them off the mainframe completely or use cloud/mainframe integration. Most enterprises that use large, complex mainframes for strategic functions retain legacy applications but enhance them, ISG says. Their modernization playbooks may include using microservices, APIs or agile development processes. Companies with smaller, less complex mainframe implementations are more likely to reduce or eliminate legacy technology. These projects are often easier for organizations in Southeast Asia and India because they use more recent mainframe technologies. Mainframe transformation has increased demand in the region for new and updated products, the report says. Enterprises want to take advantage of on-demand cloud computing and enterprise-wide DevOps methodologies for cost savings and faster time to market. However, embracing DevOps in what has been a mainframe-focused organization also requires cultural change. To reduce the costs and risks of maintaining mainframes, a growing number of enterprises in Asia Pacific are embracing a mainframe-as-a-service (MFaaS) model, in which a service provider assumes full responsibility for upkeep and enhancement of the infrastructure, ISG says. MFaaS shifts mainframe costs from capital to operational expenditures, giving companies the freedom to concentrate on their core competencies while preparing for digital transformation. “Companies in this region that had expected mainframes to become obsolete have found lasting value in their resilience and capacity,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “Service providers are helping clients integrate legacy systems into hybrid cloud environments.” The report also explores other mainframe trends in Asia Pacific, including companies’ rising interest in using generative AI to boost productivity, and growing demand for mainframe operations management services that harmonize with comprehensive service management strategies. For more insights into the mainframe-related challenges facing Asia Pacific enterprises, including a skills shortage and the difficulty of integrating mainframes with generative AI applications, see the ISG Provider Lens™ Focal Points briefing here. The 2024 ISG Provider Lens™ Mainframes — Services and Solutions report for Asia Pacific evaluates the capabilities of 36 providers across five quadrants: Mainframe Optimization Services, Application Modernization Services, Mainframe as a Service (MFaaS), Mainframe Operations and Mainframe Application Modernization Software. The report names Wipro as a Leader in four quadrants. It names HCLTech, Infosys, Kyndryl and TCS as Leaders in three quadrants each. Capgemini is named as a Leader in two quadrants. Accenture, AWS, DXC Technology, Google, IBM and TMaxSoft are named as Leaders in one quadrant each. In addition, Capgemini is named as a Rising Star — a company with a “promising portfolio” and “high future potential” by ISG’s definition — in two quadrants. DXC Technology, Kyndryl and mLogica are named as Rising Stars in one quadrant each. In the area of customer experience, HCLTech is named the global ISG CX Star Performer for 2024 among mainframe service and solution providers.

Issues Statement Refuting Short Seller Allegations Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Globe Life Inc. refutes short seller allegations, emphasizing its sustainable earnings growth and commitment to shareholders and customers. The company plans legal action against the parties responsible for the misleading report. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Globe Life Inc.'s public refutation of allegations made by Fuzzy Panda Research highlights the delicate balance between investor relations and corporate reputation management. The company's immediate and assertive response indicates a high level of concern regarding the potential impact on shareholder value. The claim that the report contains 'wildly misleading' information suggests a strong confidence in their business model and operational integrity.The mention of 'sustainable earnings growth' and a large customer base with '17 million policies in force' points to a stable financial foundation, which is a key factor for investors. However, the market's reaction to such allegations, whether substantiated or not, can lead to volatility in the stock price. Investors should monitor the situation closely, as the company's pledge to pursue legal recourse implies a protracted dispute that could distract management and potentially incur significant legal costs. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, Globe Life Inc.'s intention to 'explore all means of legal recourse' against the allegations by Fuzzy Panda Research suggests that the company is prepared to defend its reputation and operations vigorously. This could involve defamation lawsuits or other legal actions to counteract the negative publicity. However, such legal battles are often lengthy and expensive and the outcomes can be uncertain.The company's commitment to ethics and compliance with government regulations is a critical aspect of corporate governance. Investors often look favorably upon companies that maintain high ethical standards and transparent business practices. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of Globe Life's internal processes to address unethical behavior will be scrutinized in light of these allegations, potentially affecting investor trust. Market Research Analyst The insurance sector, where Globe Life Inc. operates, is highly sensitive to trust and reputation. Customers and investors alike often base their decisions on the perceived stability and ethical conduct of a company. The assertion that Globe Life has a 'strong track record' is meant to reassure stakeholders of the company's reliability. However, the impact of the allegations on customer perception and, consequently, on market share and revenue growth, is an area of concern.Should the allegations gain traction or be proven true, it could lead to a decrease in consumer confidence and policy renewals, thus affecting the company's bottom line. Conversely, if Globe Life can effectively counter these claims and demonstrate transparency and ethical practices, it may reinforce investor and consumer confidence in the long run. Monitoring competitor reactions and customer sentiment will be essential in assessing the full impact on Globe Life's market position. 04/11/2024 - 05:02 PM MCKINNEY, Texas, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Globe Life Inc. (NYSE: GL) today issued the following statement refuting the allegations raised in a report issued today by Fuzzy Panda Research: For over 70 years, our business model has stood the test of the time and we continue to generate sustainable earnings growth that provides long-term value for our shareholders. With over 17 million policies in force, our millions of customers value the protection of the Company's products, and we strive to be there when our customers need us most. We are disappointed today to see self-motivated short sellers push inflammatory allegations in order to drive down Globe Life's stock price. We reviewed the report and found it to be wildly misleading, mixing anonymous allegations with recycled points pushed by plaintiff law firms to coerce Globe Life into settlements. The motivations behind this short seller's report are driven solely by short-term profit earned on the backs of the thousands of shareholders, hardworking employees, independent contractor sales agents and customers who know and trust our brand and strong track record. We have successfully defended ourselves against these types of claims. The short seller analysis by Fuzzy Panda Research mischaracterizes facts and uses unsubstantiated claims and conjecture to present an overall picture of Globe Life that is deliberately false, misleading and defamatory. Globe Life intends to explore all means of legal recourse against the parties responsible. Globe Life strives to act in accordance with the highest level of ethics and integrity at all levels of the organization and to comply with all government regulations. American Income Life (AIL) has processes in place to review, investigate and address all allegations brought to the Company's attention concerning unethical business practices, sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct and we do not tolerate such behavior. We intend to more fully rebut these allegations in the near future. Rest assured we are steadfast in our commitment to delivering sustainable earnings growth that provides substantial value for our shareholders. Our dedication to providing the highest quality to our customers remains unwavering.

Negative Draganfly Inc. is facing noncompliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) due to a stockholders' equity deficiency, potentially leading to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The company reported a stockholders' equity of C$407,716 (equivalent to $308,897) in its Form 20-F, falling short of the required minimum of $2,500,000 for continued listing on Nasdaq. A hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel is scheduled for May 21, 2024, to address the bid price deficiency and the Stockholders' Equity Rule deficiency. The outcome of the hearing will determine the company's continued listing on Nasdaq. The Panel has the discretion to grant an extension period for the Stockholders' Equity Rule deficiency, potentially until October 2, 2024. However, there is no guarantee that the Panel will approve the company's compliance plan or that Draganfly will regain compliance with listing requirements. Financial Analyst The notification from Nasdaq regarding Draganfly's noncompliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Rule is a significant concern for investors. The company's reported stockholders' equity of C$407,716, which is far below the Nasdaq minimum requirement of $2,500,000, casts doubt on the financial stability of Draganfly. This shortfall may trigger investor scrutiny on the company’s ability to sustain operations and fund future growth. The pending hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel adds a layer of uncertainty regarding the stock's continued listing. If delisted, Draganfly could face decreased liquidity and a potential decline in investor confidence, which often leads to a lower stock price. Legal Expert Draganfly’s upcoming hearing with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel represents a critical juncture in the company’s efforts to maintain its listing. The dual deficiencies of stockholders’ equity and bid price pose a legal challenge for the company. It is imperative for Draganfly to present a convincing compliance plan that addresses both issues. The Panel's discretion in granting an extension is not guaranteed and the company’s future on the Nasdaq hangs in the balance. The outcome of this hearing will have legal implications for Draganfly's reporting and disclosure obligations and by extension, its reputational standing in the market. Market Research Analyst While the company’s participation in the XPONENTIAL 2024 conference and the unveiling of new drone technologies indicate a forward-looking approach, these initiatives must be weighed against the backdrop of Draganfly's financial challenges. From a market perspective, the innovation in drone technology and artificial intelligence applications are growth drivers for the sector. However, Draganfly’s ability to capitalize on these opportunities is contingent upon overcoming its current financial hurdles. The market will be watching closely to see if the company can leverage its technological advancements to improve its financial standing and reassure stakeholders of its market viability. 04/11/2024 - 04:59 PM Draganfly to Speak at Law-Tech Connect™ Panel During AUVSI XPONENTIAL 2024 San Diego, CA., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Draganfly Inc.

On April 5, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company of its noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Rule”) by failing to maintain a minimum stockholders’ equity of at least $2,500,000 required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In the Company’s Form 20-F filed on March 27th, the Company reported stockholders’ equity of C$407,716 (the equivalent of $308,897). Additionally, as of April 5th, the Company did not meet the alternative continued listing standards under the Nasdaq Listing Rules. On March 28, 2024, the Company requested a hearing before an independent Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) regarding its previously disclosed bid price deficiency. The hearing before the Panel will be held on May 21, 2024. The hearing request automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. Pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Stockholders’ Equity Rule deficiency serves as an additional and separate basis for delisting. The Panel will consider both deficiencies in rendering a determination regarding the Company’s continued listing on Nasdaq. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has the discretion to grant an additional extension period with regard to the Stockholders’ Equity Rule deficiency that can expire as late as October 2, 2024. At the hearing, the Company will be asked to provide a plan to regain compliance with both deficiencies to the Panel. The Company intends to present a plan to regain compliance with both deficiencies and request the continued listing of its common shares on Nasdaq pending such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company’s request or that the Company will ultimately regain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on Nasdaq.

Negative None. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Summit Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: SMMT) (“Summit,” “we,” or the “Company”) today announced that Mostafa Ronaghi, PhD, has been appointed to its Board of Directors, effective immediately. “We are excited to add Dr. Ronaghi to complement our excellent group of current board members,” stated Robert W. Duggan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Summit. “Mostafa has valuable experience in translating innovative concepts in genomics and sequencing that ultimately lead to advancements in patient care through his work at Illumina, Grail, and his continuing ventures. As we intend to maximize the potential of ivonescimab, we are excited to add the acumen and expertise that Mostafa can bring to our impressive executive team.” Dr. Ronaghi is the Co-Founder and Executive Board Member of Cellanome. Prior to founding Cellanome, he was Chief Technology Officer, Senior Vice President, and member of the Executive Leadership Team at Illumina, Inc. (Nasdaq: ILMN) from 2008 to 2021. While at Illumina, in 2016, Dr. Ronaghi co-founded GRAIL, a next-gen liquid biopsy platform for cancer detection. Prior to Illumina, Dr. Ronaghi was Principal Investigator at the Stanford Genome Technology Center from 1999 to 2008. Throughout his prolific career, Dr. Ronaghi co-founded several other companies, including Pyrosequencing AB in 1997, ParAllele Biosciences in 2001, NextBio in 2004, Avantome in 2008, and Clear Labs in 2014, each of which sought to increase the understanding of particular diseases through next-generation sequencing (NGS), advanced genotyping, or other advanced technology. Dr. Ronaghi holds a Ph.D. in Biotechnology from Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. “Dr. Ronaghi and his decades of experience building and leading successful organizations will be a tremendous source of wisdom to our executives at Team Summit,” added Dr. Maky Zanganeh, Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Board of Directors of Summit. “I am very pleased at the opportunity to join Summit’s Board of Directors,” said Dr. Ronaghi. “This extraordinary team and its mission to increase the quality and duration of patients’ lives while reducing trauma is unparalleled. I am optimistic on the potential for ivonescimab to make a meaningful difference to those facing serious unmet medical needs, and I am thrilled to work with Team Summit in order to help it achieve its mission and goals.” About Ivonescimab Ivonescimab, known as SMT112 in Summit’s license territories, the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan, and as AK112 in China and Australia, is an investigational, novel, potential first-in-class bispecific antibody combining the effects of immunotherapy via a blockade of PD-1 with the anti-angiogenesis effects associated with blocking VEGF into a single molecule. Ivonescimab displays cooperative binding with each of its intended targets with higher affinity when in the presence of both PD-1 and VEGF. This could differentiate ivonescimab as there is potentially higher expression (presence) of both PD-1 and VEGF in tumor tissue and the tumor microenvironment (TME) as compared to normal tissue in the body. Ivonescimab’s tetravalent structure (four binding sites) enables higher avidity (accumulated strength of multiple binding interactions) in the tumor microenvironment with over 18-fold increased binding affinity to PD-1 in the presence of VEGF in vitro, and over 4-times increased binding affinity to VEGF in the presence of PD-1 in vitro (Zhong, et al, SITC, 2023). This tetravalent structure, the intentional novel design of the molecule, and bringing these two targets into a single bispecific antibody with cooperative binding qualities have the potential to direct ivonescimab to the tumor tissue versus healthy tissue. The intent of this design is to improve upon previously established efficacy thresholds, in addition to side effects and safety profiles associated with these targets. Ivonescimab was discovered by Akeso Inc. (HKEX Code: 9926.HK) and is currently engaged in multiple Phase III clinical trials. Over 1,600 patients have been treated with ivonescimab in clinical studies globally.

(TSX:CWL);(OTCQX:CWLPF) today issued its financial results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter ended February 29, 2024. All references to quarters or years are for the fiscal periods unless otherwise noted and all currency amounts are in Canadian dollars.Financial Highlights (in $000s except per share amounts) Three Months Ended Six Months Ended 2.29.24 2.28.23 2.29.24 2.28.23 Professional fees - Caldwell 14,946 16,705 29,112 33,680 Professional fees - IQTalent1 2,741 4,745 5,911 11,459 Consolidated professional fees 17,687 21,450 35,023 45,139 Direct expense reimbursements 179 133 378 352 Revenues 17,866 21,583 35,401 45,491 Cost of sales 14,061 18,266 29,105 39,191 Reimbursed direct expenses 179 133 378 352 Gross profit 3,626 3,184 5,918 5,948 Selling, general and administrative expenses2 4,783 6,070 9,305 11,159 Restructuring (income) expenses3 - - (7,979) 2,530 Acquisition-related expenses4 - 204 - 879 Operating profit (loss) (1,157) (3,090) 4,592 (8,620)Finance expenses (income) 83 56 495 (64)Earnings (loss) before tax (1,240) (3,146) 4,097 (8,556)Income tax expense (recovery) (375) (826) 1,184 (2,293)Net earnings (loss) after tax (865) (2,320) 2,913 (6,263)Basic earnings (loss) per share $(0.029) $(0.090) $0.099 $(0.242) Professional fees of IQTalent are presented net of elimination of intercompany revenue.Selling, general and administrative expenses include a benefit from a lower share price reducing share-based compensation expense by $12 in the current quarter compared to a benefit of $344 in the same quarter last year.Restructuring income of $7,979 in the first half of the current year includes separation expense of $1,089 for management staff reductions at IQTalent, more than offset by a net gain on lease termination of $9,068 as IQTalent negotiated a termination of its Nashville leased facility resulting in a recovery of lease impairment charges expensed in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Restructuring expenses of $2,530 in the first quarter of the prior year include $2,264 of separation expense for staff reductions at IQTalent and $266 in onerous lease costs at Caldwell for the sublease of our San Francisco office as a result of our transition to a remote work environment.Acquisition-related expenses consist of transaction fees and IQTalent purchase price structured as compensation expense, which were fully amortized into income as at 12/31/22.""We saw modest sequential improvement in our results, as the softness in executive search bookings that we experienced in the first quarter dampened our second quarter revenue,"" said John Wallace, chief executive officer. ""There has been a measurable uplift in new executive search bookings and activity so far this calendar year and we therefore anticipate significantly higher revenue in the third quarter.""""The increased confidence we've seen coming into the new calendar year from Caldwell's executive level clients has led to a strong upturn in new bookings, as they look to fill out their executive teams. There are still suppressed hiring levels at the mid-level, which is impacting IQTalent on a more prolonged basis than Caldwell. Positively, beginning next quarter, IQTalent will realize the benefit of significant cost reduction initiatives. The Nashville office lease termination and the right sizing of software license agreements to reduced headcount levels will further align our cost structure with current revenue levels.""Wallace added: ""Our executive search team has leveraged their wealth of experience and knowledge to navigate what has been a challenging market. We do expect higher search volumes as hiring demand continues to improve. Our clients appreciate our ability to support their talent acquisition requirements across every level, ensuring a seamless experience. By continuing to expand and strengthen our coverage across industry sectors and functional roles, and leverage opportunities for both business segments to collaborate, we anticipate continued growth for the remainder of the year.""About Caldwell PartnerCaldwell Partners is a technology-powered talent acquisition firm specializing in recruitment at all levels.

Positive Consolidated revenues increased to $37.8 million for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023. Gross margins rose to 30%, driven by healthcare operations contributing 32% and e-commerce profit margins improving to 26%. Operating expenses increased to $34.5 million, primarily due to expenses related to the Progressive Care acquisition. Net loss for 2023 was $3.8 million, with the company ending the year with $26.3 million in cash. Recent business developments include the launch of an OPKO Healthcare storefront in China and the acquisition of Outfitter Satellite Inc. Negative Operating expenses significantly increased to $34.5 million, impacting the company's financials. A non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $13.9 million was recorded related to the Progressive Care acquisition. Net loss for 2023 was $3.8 million, indicating a decrease in profitability compared to the previous year. Market Research Analyst The expansion of NextPlat Corp into the high-growth healthcare sector and its strategic investment in Progressive Care Inc. suggests a diversification strategy that could mitigate risks associated with their core e-commerce business. The reported increase in consolidated revenues and improved gross margins, particularly from the healthcare operations, indicates a potentially successful integration of Progressive Care. However, the notable increase in operating expenses and a non-cash goodwill impairment charge raise questions about the long-term sustainability of this growth. The healthcare industry typically offers higher margins than retail, but it also comes with regulatory challenges and a need for constant innovation to stay competitive.NextPlat's entry into the Chinese market via Alibaba's Tmall Global platform represents an aggressive move to tap into one of the world's largest markets. While this offers significant revenue potential, it also exposes the company to geopolitical risks and the complexities of operating in a market with different consumer behaviors and regulatory frameworks. The addition of OPKO Healthcare's products could be beneficial if the demand for health and wellness products continues to rise in China, but this will depend on successful marketing and the ability to navigate China's stringent e-commerce and health product regulations.The acquisition of Outfitter Satellite Inc. and the subsequent expected doubling of North American technology e-commerce product sales is a bullish sign for revenue growth. Yet, acquisitions can be double-edged swords, potentially leading to integration challenges and unforeseen costs that could affect profitability. Financial Analyst The significant year-over-year increase in revenue and the improvement in gross profit margin are positive indicators of NextPlat's performance. However, the substantial net loss, even though reduced from the previous year and the goodwill impairment charge associated with the Progressive Care acquisition could be a concern for investors. Goodwill impairment suggests that the acquired assets may not generate future benefits as initially expected, which could impact investor confidence.The one-time gain on remeasurement of fair value related to the Progressive Care consolidation is a non-cash item that investors should consider when evaluating the company's operational performance. While the cash position at the end of the fiscal year appears strong, it is important to monitor how this liquidity is managed, especially in light of the increased operating expenses and expansion initiatives.Investors should also consider the company's strategy of diversifying into healthcare and the potential for synergies between its e-commerce and healthcare operations. While diversification can lead to revenue growth, it also requires careful management to ensure that the company's core competencies are not diluted. E-Commerce Industry Expert NextPlat's partnership with Alibaba to launch an OPKO-branded storefront on Tmall Global is a strategic move that leverages Alibaba's vast e-commerce infrastructure and consumer base. The focus on health and wellness products aligns with a global trend towards healthier living and could capture a lucrative market segment. However, the success of this venture will heavily rely on effective localization strategies and understanding of Chinese consumer preferences.The e-commerce landscape, especially in China, is highly competitive with local giants like JD.com and Pinduoduo. NextPlat will need to differentiate its offerings and ensure seamless logistics and customer service to build brand loyalty. Additionally, the expansion into veterinary and animal health products is an interesting choice, as this niche market has been growing steadily, driven by the increasing pet ownership and care investment. If NextPlat can secure the necessary government approvals, this could open up another revenue channel.It's also worth noting the resilience of NextPlat's technology e-commerce business, which has continued to experience transaction volume growth despite economic headwinds. This suggests a strong market position and a potentially robust recurring revenue stream from airtime contracts, which is key for long-term financial stability. 04/11/2024 - 04:38 PM Company Expands Healthcare and Technology Focus Through the Launch of its E-Commerce Development Program with Alibaba's Tmall Global and Strategic Investment in Progressive Care Inc. COCONUT GROVE, Fla., April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL, NXPLW) (""NextPlat"" or the ""Company""), a global e-Commerce provider, today announced the financial results for the fiscal year-ended December 31, 2023 which consolidates the operations of its e-commerce business with the results of its healthcare operations, Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB: RXMD) (""Progressive Care""). ""Central to our growth plans for NextPlat in 2023 were efforts to increase our long-term participation in the high growth healthcare and consumer products sectors and the expansion of our business into large new international markets such as in China through our partnership with Alibaba. I am proud to report that in 2023, we made significant progress against these growth initiatives, highlighted by our announcement of an e-Commerce Development Program with OPKO Healthcare, who selected us to launch their online storefront in China, and our expanded strategic investment into Progressive Care, our new healthcare subsidiary. These developments, along with the planned launch of new products such as our Florida Sunshine brand of premium-grade vitamins and dietary supplements, represent significant opportunities for NextPlat to generate profitable new revenue streams, creating value for our clients, their customers, and our shareholders this year,"" said Charles M. Fernandez, Executive Chairman and CEO of NextPlat Corp. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights: Consolidated revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $37.8 million, an increase of over 222% versus revenue of approximately $11.7 million for the full year ending December 31, 2022. Results for the full year ended December 2023 reflect e-commerce revenue of approximately $11.0 million and approximately $26.8 million in revenue contributed from the Company's healthcare operations (specifically, Progressive Care whose results are consolidated as of July 1, 2023).Gross margins for the full year ended December 31, 2023, increased significantly to 30%, up from 21% reported for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to the healthcare operations because of the Progressive Care consolidation. Gross profit margin attributable to our healthcare operations was approximately 32% (for the consolidation period). Our e-commerce profit margins improved to 26% from 21% reported in the year ended December 2022, driven largely by continued increases in the sales of higher margin, recurring airtime revenue.Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $34.5 million compared to approximately $9.7 million in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily driven by expenses including stock-based compensation of approximately $2.4 million (non-cash expense), operating expenses of approximately $2.4 million and salaries and wages of approximately $4.1 million attributable to the healthcare operations as a result of the Progressive Care acquisition as of July 1, 2023, depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $1.6 million, and net other operating expense of approximately $0.4 million. Operating expenses in 2023 also included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $13.9 million related to the Progressive Care acquisition.Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $3.8 million, or $0.22 diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss of approximately $9.2 million, or $0.96 diluted earnings per share reported for the year ended December 31, 2022. Net loss for the full year of 2023 includes a one-time gain on remeasurement of fair value of equity interest in affiliate of approximately $11.4 million (non-cash gain) related to the change in accounting method due to the Progressive Care consolidation as of July 1, 2023.The Company ended the 2023 fiscal year with approximately $26.3 million in cash.Organizational Highlights and Recent Business Developments: The Company's technology e-commerce business continued to see positive increases in global transaction volumes for satellite phones and tracking devices as demand for high margin, recurring airtime contracts remained at record monthly levels. Transaction volume growth in 2023 largely offset the unprecedented surge in demand for connectivity solutions following the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022 and economic weakness in certain European markets.The Company's healthcare business, Progressive Care, saw continued growth driven by significant increases in its pharmacy prescription volumes as well as multiple new 340B services contracts secured in the fourth quarter of 2023.Effective as of July 1, 2023, Progressive Care became a consolidated subsidiary of NextPlat for accounting purposes as a result of the controlling interest in Progressive Care obtained by the Company in concert with the Company's Executive Chairman and CEO, Charles M. Fernandez, and its Director, Rodney Barreto.On March 1, 2024, NextPlat launched the exclusive OPKO Healthcare (""OPKO"")-branded storefront in China on Alibaba's Tmall Global platform. The OPKO storefront initially lists health and wellness products including an assortment of nutraceuticals for bone, joint and eye health as well as supplements for nutrition and immunity and defense, the sales of which will create a new international e-commerce revenue stream for the Company. NextPlat intends to significantly expand the OPKO online storefront with a wide array of veterinary and animal health products early in the second quarter of 2024 subject to receipt of the final government approvals.On March 26, 2024, NextPlat expanded its North American technology e-commerce business with acquisition of Outfitter Satellite Inc. This accretive acquisition is expected to more than double the Company's North American technology e-commerce product sales and recurring revenue, driving increased profitability through improved business efficiencies and shared resources while supporting future domestic operations and distribution.David Phipps, President of NextPlat and CEO of Global Operations, added, ""With a global presence in 18 countries across 5 continents, which enables us to serve customers in more than 165 countries, we are providing unmatched global reach for our partners and customers. We are encouraged by the continued ability of our platform to support our customers and through our e-commerce development program with Alibaba and its Tmall Global platform in China, we are now able to provide truly global online market access for products of all types. We are excited about the potential of the Chinese market for American-made products, especially health and wellness products such as OPKO's and are looking forward to supporting additional brand and product launches this year including our own Florida Sunshine-branded products.""

Key findings include a decline in used near- and non-prime registrations, rising monthly payments despite lower vehicle prices, significant growth in EV registrations among near- and non-prime consumers, and a renewed interest in leasing. The report emphasizes the importance of leveraging data and AI-powered risk analysis to provide affordable loan opportunities to lower-credit consumers.","Near- and Non-Prime Consumers At Risk of Being Priced Out of the Vehicle Market, Open Lending Research Finds Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Open Lending (NASDAQ: LPRO) releases a quarterly report on near- and non-prime automotive lending trends, highlighting the challenges faced by underserved consumers and the potential for increased access to electric vehicles. Key findings include a decline in used near- and non-prime registrations, rising monthly payments despite lower vehicle prices, significant growth in EV registrations among near- and non-prime consumers, and a renewed interest in leasing. The report emphasizes the importance of leveraging data and AI-powered risk analysis to provide affordable loan opportunities to lower-credit consumers. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The report by Open Lending Corporation highlights significant shifts in automotive lending patterns, particularly among near- and non-prime consumers. The decline in used vehicle registrations for this demographic suggests a market contraction which could signal challenges for auto lenders targeting this segment. However, the rise in near- and non-prime EV registrations indicates a growing market for electric vehicles among consumers with lower credit scores.From an industry perspective, these trends may influence lending strategies. Financial institutions might consider revising their risk assessment models to accommodate the apparent willingness of near- and non-prime consumers to embrace EVs. This shift could lead to a broader financing ecosystem that supports the transition to more sustainable transportation options. Furthermore, the increased interest in leasing among these consumers could indicate an adaptation to high interest rates, which lenders could capitalize on by offering more tailored leasing options. Financial Analyst Open Lending's focus on AI-powered risk analysis and default insurance-backed lending could be a game-changer for financial institutions. By enabling more accurate loan decisioning, lenders can potentially reduce default risks while expanding their customer base. This approach could lead to more competitive loan products for near- and non-prime consumers, potentially increasing market share for proactive lenders.The reported increase in monthly payments despite a drop in average vehicle prices reflects a squeeze on consumer affordability, likely impacting loan performance and default rates. Lenders need to monitor these dynamics closely as they could affect the profitability of loan portfolios. Additionally, the overall economic improvement mentioned may not be evenly distributed, suggesting that lenders should be strategic in targeting consumer segments that are showing recovery. Economist The automotive lending trends reported have broader economic implications. The discrepancy between vehicle pricing and monthly payment trends could suggest a lag in the transmission of price adjustments to consumers, which may stem from persistent high interest rates. This lag could dampen consumer spending, which is a critical driver of economic growth.The increase in EV accessibility for near- and non-prime consumers is positive for economic inclusivity and could support environmental policy goals. However, it is essential to consider the long-term affordability of these vehicles, as higher financing costs could undermine the sustainability of this trend. The report hints at the resilience of certain consumer segments despite macroeconomic challenges, which could be indicative of untapped market potential. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM Lending enablement provider releases quarterly data report on near- and non-prime automotive lending trends, potential for EV access AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Open Lending Corporation (NASDAQ: LPRO) (“Open Lending” or the “Company”), an industry trailblazer in automotive lending enablement and risk analytics solutions for financial institutions, today released a new Near- and Non-Prime Consumer Update, continuing its quarterly report series on automotive lending trends among near- and non-prime consumers. The latest Update uncovers disproportionate economic impacts on the underserved, spotlighting opportunities for automotive lenders to drive vehicle accessibility. Near- and non-prime consumers are at risk of being priced out of the automotive market entirely. Tracking these trends can help automotive lenders position themselves to serve deserving yet overlooked consumers. Key findings from the study include: Used near- and non-prime registrations are down double digits year over year. Near- and non-prime registrations declined 10% in 2023, while prime and super-prime stayed flat. Vehicle prices may be starting to come down, but monthly payments are not. While the average vehicle price dipped year-over-year in Q4 2023, the average monthly payment rose, with near- and non-prime consumers taking on a larger payment hike than prime and super-prime consumers. EVs may be starting to become accessible to consumers outside of prime. New near- and non-prime EV registrations grew 161%, and used EV registrations saw almost 100% growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Near- and non-prime consumers are showing a renewed interest in leasing, likely as a means to offset high interest rates and monthly payments. “The economy is slowly improving, but high vehicle prices and interest rates are putting lower-credit consumers in a tough position, where access to personal transportation is often prohibitively expensive,” said Kevin Filan, SVP of marketing at Open Lending. “Data shows there is more to these consumers’ borrowing potential than their credit scores show. By bringing them loan opportunities they can afford at a time of macroeconomic difficulty, automotive lenders can secure a stronger future for the automotive industry. Using AI-powered risk analysis and bolstered by default insurance, our Lenders Protection™ loan decisioning engine allows you to do just that.” For more insights, access the full report.

(Nasdaq: KYTX), a patient-centered, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing cell therapies for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, announced today its attendance at the 2024 annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology to be held in Denver, Colorado, starting on April 13. Of particular interest: On April 15, Jeremias Motte, M.D., a senior physician and neurologist at the University Hospital in Bochum, Germany, will present a case study of a successful treatment of patients suffering from concomitant myasthenia gravis and Lambert-Eaton syndrome1On April 16, Kyverna will host a conference call discussing recent experience with KYV-101 in patients suffering from neurological autoimmune diseases. Call-in details will be published in advance on the company's website (ir.kyvernatx.com)On April 16, Marinos Dalakas, M.D., FAAN, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals and a neurology specialist, will discuss advances in the therapeutic algorithm for autoimmune neuromuscular disorders""We welcome the publication of these reports from named-patient case studies that contribute to building confidence in the desired safety and efficacy profile for innovating CAR T-cell therapies,"" said Jeffrey Dunn, M.D., the Lily Sarafan director of Neuroimmunology and clinical professor and chief of Neuroimmunology within the Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. ""We look forward to attending AAN and engaging with the scientific community in seeking to develop paradigm-shifting treatment options for patients living with autoimmune diseases,"" said Peter Maag, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Kyverna. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves modifying a patient's T cells to recognize and remove B cells in the patient's body. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy specifically targets CD19, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells, which are involved in various types of autoimmune diseases. About Multiple Sclerosis (MS)Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurodegenerative autoimmune disease affecting over 2.8 million individuals worldwide2. It affects more frequently women, people of Northern European descent, and is also associated with certain environmental and genetic factors. Patients with MS can experience a range of symptoms including blurred vision, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, and, in severe cases, the inability to walk or stand. Current disease-modifying treatments for MS aim to reduce the frequency of disease relapses and delay progression of disability, but the disease remains a chronic condition that will progressively worsen for most patients. About Myasthenia Gravis (MG)Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder associated with muscle weakness in tissues throughout the body, potentially manifesting in partial paralysis of eye movements, problems in chewing and swallowing, respiratory problems, speech difficulties and weakness in skeletal muscles. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months. Disease symptoms reach their maximum levels within two to three years in approximately 80% of patients. Up to 20% of MG patients experience respiratory crisis at least once in their lives.3 About KYV-101KYV-101 is an autologous, fully human CD19 CAR T-cell product candidate for use in B cell-driven autoimmune diseases. The CAR in KYV-101 was designed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to improve tolerability and tested in a 20-patient Phase 1 trial in oncology. Results were published by the NIH in Nature Medicine4. KYV-101 is currently being evaluated in sponsored, open-label, Phase 1/2 trials of KYV-101 in patients with lupus nephritis, an autoimmune disease in which more than half of patients do not achieve a complete response to current therapies and are at risk of developing kidney failure. Additionally, FDA's IND clearance has been obtained for Phase 2 trials of KYV-101 for multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis, and a Phase 1/2 trial for systemic sclerosis. We believe that the differentiated properties of KYV-101 are critical for the potential success of CAR T cells as autoimmune disease therapies. KYV-101 is also being evaluated in investigator-initiated trials for multiple indications in multiple geographies. About Kyverna TherapeuticsKyverna Therapeutics, Inc.

FIRST CLASS 8 HEAVY-DUTY ELECTRIC FREIGHT TRUCK MAKES HISTORIC CROSSING OF U.S.-MEXICO BORDER,2024-04-11T22:11:00.000Z,Neutral,Very Positive,SDG&E and Bali Express collaborate to achieve zero emissions freight transport with the successful crossing of an electric freight truck from the U.S. into Mexico. The partnership aims to promote sustainability and cleaner energy future through innovative electrification of transportation systems.,"FIRST CLASS 8 HEAVY-DUTY ELECTRIC FREIGHT TRUCK MAKES HISTORIC CROSSING OF U.S.-MEXICO BORDER Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary SDG&E and Bali Express collaborate to achieve zero emissions freight transport with the successful crossing of an electric freight truck from the U.S. into Mexico. The partnership aims to promote sustainability and cleaner energy future through innovative electrification of transportation systems. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Policy Analyst The partnership between SDG&E and Bali Express signifies a strategic move in the transportation industry's shift towards sustainability. The introduction of a Class 8 heavy-duty electric freight truck for cross-border operations is a tangible step in addressing the environmental concerns associated with freight transport, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. This initiative aligns with global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.From an environmental policy standpoint, the collaboration could serve as a model for public-private partnerships aimed at decarbonizing heavy industries. The charging infrastructure provided by SDG&E is a critical component, as it addresses one of the main barriers to electric vehicle (EV) adoption: the availability of charging stations. By focusing on medium- to heavy-duty trucks, the project targets a segment of transportation that has been slower to electrify due to technical and economic challenges. Energy Sector Analyst The electrification of freight trucks presents both opportunities and challenges for the energy sector. SDG&E's investment in charging infrastructure is an indicator of the utility's commitment to supporting the growing demand for electricity as the transportation sector evolves. The initiative could lead to an increase in electricity consumption, which might necessitate upgrades to the grid to ensure reliability and manage peak loads.Moreover, this development has the potential to enhance SDG&E's revenue streams and may positively influence the company's stock performance in the long term. Investors should monitor the scalability of such infrastructure projects and their impact on the utility's operational costs and profit margins. The transition to electric trucks also has implications for the oil and gas industry, potentially reducing demand for diesel fuel as more fleets adopt EV technology. Transportation Industry Analyst The launch of the electric freight corridor by SDG&E and Bali Express is a significant advancement in the logistics and transportation industry. It demonstrates a growing trend towards sustainable practices and could influence other companies to consider similar investments in electric vehicles (EVs). The move may also be a competitive differentiator for Bali Express, positioning them as a leader in eco-friendly logistics.For the transportation sector, the adoption of electric trucks could lead to operational cost savings over time, given the lower maintenance and fuel costs associated with EVs compared to traditional diesel trucks. However, the initial capital expenditure for electric trucks and the installation of charging infrastructure is substantial. Companies will need to balance these upfront costs with the long-term benefits of reduced emissions and potential government incentives for clean energy initiatives. 04/11/2024 - 06:11 PM SDG&E and Bali Express forge path to zero emissions freight transport Video and Pictures Here SAN DIEGO, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) and Bali Express today announced the historic crossing of a Class 8 heavy-duty electric freight truck from the U.S. into Mexico. The semi-truck made its maiden voyage into Mexico, marking a significant milestone as the binational region moves towards a net-zero future. These dedicated trucks will utilize recently built charging infrastructure installed by SDG&E designed to provide reliable and accessible charging options for medium- to heavy-duty electric freight trucks crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. ""Today marks a historic milestone in our journey toward reducing emissions and paving the way for a cleaner energy future,"" said Caroline Winn, Chief Executive Officer at SDG&E.

Juan Baez, owner of the San Diego-based Bali Express emphasized the importance of working together in achieving sustainability goals. ""We are thrilled to be working with SDG&E in this historic endeavor,"" said Baez. ""By adding electric freight trucks, we are not only reducing our carbon footprint but also leading the way towards a more sustainable future for freight transportation on both sides of the border. We're proud to be a leader in this transition and excited about the first ever crossing."" ""The historic crossing of this electric freight truck symbolizes San Diego's commitment to innovation, cross-border cooperation and our binational community,"" said City of San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. ""We're not just reducing emissions; we're building a cleaner future for the people who live near our border and leading the way on international trade and environmental responsibility."" The chargers were partially funded by a $200,000 grant through the California Energy Commission's Clean Transportation Program – which has provided more than $1 billion to alternative fuel and vehicle technology projects that are designed to deliver health, environmental and economic benefits to communities. ""To accommodate the transition to zero-emission trucks on both sides of the border, it's critically important we have the necessary infrastructure,"" said California Energy Commissioner Patty Monahan. ""The California Energy Commission is helping fund projects across the state to build a better and more equitable charging infrastructure system for both cars and trucks."" San Diego County Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Nora Vargas – who is Governor Newsom's appointee to the California Air Resources Board - emphasized the importance of reducing emissions in border communities while also growing our economy. ""As a fronteriza, I am thrilled that we're moving forward with the use of bold and innovative energy technology that helps reduce air pollution, offers sustainable cross-border freight transportation, and strengthens our binational and interdependent economy,"" said Vargas. ""I know the binational region firsthand, and this is a great example of the kind of public-private partnerships can improve air quality and promote economic prosperity for the binational region. As the Supervisor for border communities, I am proud and excited that we are moving toward a cleaner, greener and more prosperous future."" The electric charging infrastructure is a part of SDG&E's Power Your Drive for Fleets program. The program connects fleet operators with resources and financial incentives to easily and cost-effectively design and install charging infrastructure for medium- and heavy-duty fleets. About SDG&E:SDG&E is an innovative energy delivery company that provides increasingly clean, safe and reliable energy to better the lives of the people it serves in San Diego and southern Orange counties.

This effort is intended to improve financial flexibility, lower finance costs, and strengthen the Company's balance sheet.The proposed amendments to the Convertible Debentures will have four key benefits for the Company's capital structure and operating cash flow: 1) meaningfully extend maturity of the Convertible Debentures; 2) reduce cash interest payments; 3) reduce total debt outstanding; and 4) provide the Company with flexibility to pay interest in cash or common share equivalents.The Company has called a meeting to be held on April 30, 2024 (the ""Debentureholder Meeting"") of the holders of the Convertible Debentures (the ""Debentureholders"") in order to consider certain amendments to the trust indenture dated October 28, 2021 (the ""Indenture""). The amendments, if approved by the requisite majority of the Debentureholders, will result in the following changes to the terms of the Convertible Debentures (each a ""Convertible Debenture Amendment"" and collectively the ""Convertible Debenture Amendments""): partially redeeming (the ""Partial Redemption"") an aggregate of 50% of the principal amount outstanding under the Convertible Debentures, such that the current principal amount of $17,250,000 shall be reduced to $8,625,000 in consideration for the issuance of 70,500,000 common shares of the Company (a ""Common Share""), with a deemed value of $8,625,000 ($0.122 per Common Share). The Common Shares would be distributed to the Debentureholders on a pro-rata basis, on or around May 6, 2024 (the ""Redemption Date"") to those Debentureholders of record as of May 3, 2024, and the interest upon the principal amount of Debentures called for redemption shall cease to be payable from and after the Redemption Date. Although the Company intends to affect the Partial Redemption on May 6, 2024 or as soon as practicable thereafter, there is no guarantee that the Redemption Date will be May 6, 2024. Any accrued and unpaid interest on the debentures which compose the Partial Redemption (the ""Redeemed Debenture"") will be paid in cash on or around May 6, 2024. Prior to and excluding April 30, 2024, the Redeemed Debentures will accrue interest at a rate of 7% per annum; if applicable, subsequent to and including April 30, 2024, the Redeemed Debentures will accrue interest at a rate of 10% per annum;amending the terms of the Convertible Debentures such that the interest payment dates (which are currently bi-annual) shall occur once annually on December 15th of each year (the ""Accrual Date"");amending the definition of ""Interest Rate"" in the Convertible Debenture Indenture to increase the interest rate on the Convertible Debentures from 7.0% to 10.0% per annum;amending the terms of the Indenture to allow, at the election of the Company, for the payment of the interest accrued on the Convertible Debentures through the issuance of Common Shares, which shall have a deemed price-per-share equal to the greater of: (i) the 10-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (""VWAP"") prior to the Accrual Date, or (ii) the minimum acceptable price to the TSX Venture Exchange (the ""TSXV""), pursuant to the policies of the TSXV;amending the terms of the Convertible Debentures such that the maturity of the Convertible Debentures will be extended from October 31, 2026 to December 15, 2029; approving an application to de-list the Convertible Debentures from trading on the TSXV, which de-listing is expected to occur on or around May 3, 2024; andthe semi-annual interest payment of $603,750 due April 30, 2024 (the ""Deferred Payment""} on the Convertible Debentures will be deferred, such that a total of $603,750 will be paid in conjunction with the first annual interest payment due December 15, 2024 on the same terms as described above on a pro-rata basis, which payment may also be satisfied through the issuance of Common Shares. The Deferred Payment shall be paid to Debentureholders of record as at April 29, 2024.Debentureholders will have the opportunity to vote on the Convertible Debenture Amendments as a single resolution at the Debentureholder Meeting.The board of directors of the Company unanimously recommends that the Debentureholders vote FOR the proposed Convertible Debenture Amendments.

(NYSE:PFS) and Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: LBAI) have received regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve for their merger, with no further approvals needed. Provident will issue $200 million of Tier 2 subordinated debt as part of the merger, and submit a capital plan to maintain satisfactory capital after the merger. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The approval by the Federal Reserve for Provident Financial Services, Inc. to merge with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. represents a significant milestone in the banking sector. This move can potentially alter the competitive landscape within the regional banking space. The issuance of $200 million of Tier 2 qualifying subordinated debt is a strategic financial maneuver, which aims to bolster Provident's capital structure while ensuring compliance with regulatory capital requirements.From an investor's perspective, the capital plan submission to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York post-merger indicates a proactive approach to maintaining financial health. However, the requirement to provide advance notice for any capital distributions may signal a more cautious stance on shareholder payouts in the near term. Investors should monitor the post-merger integration closely to assess the effectiveness of cost synergies and the realization of projected benefits from the merger. Market Research Analyst The consolidation of Provident and Lakeland is indicative of an ongoing trend in the banking industry where regional players are seeking scale to compete more effectively. The merger is poised to create a larger, more robust entity capable of offering a wider array of products and services. It is essential to consider the potential for enhanced market reach and customer base expansion, which could drive future revenue growth.Analyzing the market reaction to similar mergers in the past, one can anticipate a period of adjustment as the combined entity works to align operations and corporate cultures. It is important for stakeholders to consider the short-term costs associated with the merger against the long-term strategic advantages. Furthermore, as the merger is set to finalize in the second quarter, tracking the progress of the subordinated debt issuance will provide insights into Provident's market confidence and financial positioning. Legal Expert Receiving regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve is a critical step in the merger process, indicating that the proposed union between Provident and Lakeland has been scrutinized for compliance with banking regulations. The conditions set forth, such as the issuance of subordinated debt and the submission of a capital plan, are safeguards to preserve the financial stability of the merged entity.The legal commitment to submit a capital plan and provide notice for capital distributions underscores the importance of transparency and regulatory oversight in the post-merger phase. As the merger progresses, it will be important to ensure that all legal and regulatory conditions are met to prevent any potential disruptions or penalties that could impact the merged entity's operations and market reputation. 04/11/2024 - 06:59 PM ISELIN, N.J. and OAK RIDGE, N.J, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Services, Inc.

(Nasdaq: MBUU) (“Malibu” or the “Company”) today issued the following statement in connection with a lawsuit filed by Tommy’s Boats (“Tommy’s”) and its related parties in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on April 10, 2024: “The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by Tommy’s. Tommy’s was formerly a longtime dealer partner of ours, and we ended our relationship due to concerns about Tommy’s own conduct and its financial soundness. Indeed, Tommy’s lender is also suing it for violating the agreements Tommy’s used to finance the purchase of our boats. We will always act to protect our business, our customers and our shareholders. As such, we believe it is important to clarify the following points: Any and all boats that Malibu sold to Tommy’s were ordered by Tommy’s. Malibu only sold boats to Tommy’s that Tommy’s ordered, and Malibu fulfilled its obligations under its agreements with Tommy’s. We value our relationships with our dealer partners, and we live up to our agreements.Malibu took action in light of Tommy’s sales of boats out of trust. In the fall of 2023, Malibu first became aware that Tommy’s was selling boats out of trust (selling boats that were bank collateral and not reporting the sales to the bank or repaying the bank). Upon learning that Tommy’s was selling out of trust, Malibu engaged with Tommy’s and M&T Bank, on numerous occasions, regarding Tommy’s financial position and potential paths forward. Those discussions did not result in a resolution that we believed was in the best interest of our shareholders, dealer partners and end-customers, and we therefore ended our relationship with Tommy’s. We do not currently have any dealership agreements in effect with Tommy’s.Tommy’s is already mired in litigation over its default on its lending agreements. Earlier this month and in response to, among other things, Tommy’s conduct in selling boats out of trust, M&T Bank sued Tommy’s for breach of its lending agreement. M&T has filed a motion to appoint a receiver over the assets of Tommy’s.Malibu is working to mitigate any disruption for our partners and customers – as well as our business. We have been working with our dealership network and are in discussions with strong dealer partners to limit any service gaps in markets previously served by Tommy’s. We remain committed to serving Malibu’s end-users in all our markets.” About Malibu Boats, Inc.Based in Loudon, Tennessee, Malibu Boats, Inc.

The company's proactive approach and technical expertise in treating PFAS indicate a strong commitment to meeting stringent regulatory standards. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Compliance Expert The introduction of new EPA regulations on PFAS levels in drinking water is a significant development for utilities. Middlesex Water Company's proactive strategy to meet these stringent requirements demonstrates foresight and a commitment to compliance. By initiating its strategy prior to the regulations taking effect, the company shows an understanding of the regulatory landscape and a willingness to invest in necessary infrastructure upgrades.From an environmental compliance standpoint, the company's expertise in granular activated carbon treatment positions it favorably in the industry. This technology is effective for reducing PFAS to the newly established levels, potentially giving Middlesex a competitive edge. However, the financial implications of these upgrades and the effectiveness of seeking funding sources will be critical to monitor. The ability to secure private or public funding can significantly offset the costs and impact on the company's financial health. Financial Analyst With the EPA's new PFAS regulations, there are financial implications for water utilities like Middlesex Water Company. Shareholders and investors should pay attention to the company's capital expenditures and how these will be managed. The need for plant upgrades implies significant investment, which could affect the company's short-term profitability. However, in the long term, these investments may enhance the company's reputation for quality and reliability, potentially leading to a stronger market position.It is also important to consider the impact of these regulatory changes on the utility sector as a whole. Companies that are unable to adapt quickly may face penalties or loss of consumer trust, which could be advantageous for Middlesex if it successfully implements the necessary changes ahead of its competitors. Market Research Analyst The EPA's stringent PFAS regulations will likely drive innovation and market shifts within the water treatment industry. Middlesex Water Company's early adoption of granular activated carbon technology indicates a strategic move to not only comply with new standards but also to potentially capture a larger market share by being a first mover. As consumers become more aware of PFAS health implications, they may favor utilities that have demonstrated an ability to provide cleaner water.Moreover, the gap between the new federal MCL and New Jersey's existing standards suggests that Middlesex Water may gain a competitive advantage in its local market by exceeding state requirements. This commitment to high-quality water standards may resonate well with environmentally conscious consumers and could be leveraged in marketing strategies to attract new customers. 04/11/2024 - 05:06 PM ISELIN, N.J., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Middlesex Water Company (NASDAQ: MSEX), in line with its ongoing commitment to delivering safe, clean and reliable water services, is well positioned to meet the new national drinking water regulations for PFAS (Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl substances) that were announced on April 10, 2024 by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Company begun implementing its strategy in 2023 in anticipation to the new EPA regulation. PFAS are a group of widely used chemicals, used in industry and consumer products like non-stick cookware and food packaging since the 1940s. The EPA’s new regulations create a new national requirement for regulating six PFAS found in the nation’s drinking water supply and establishes a new Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for PFOS and PFOA at 4 parts per trillion (4 ppt). This new federal MCL for PFOS and PFOA is lower than the New Jersey standard of 14 ppt established in 2021. Information on EPA’s new regulations can be found at Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) | US EPA “Middlesex Water’s technical expertise in successfully treating PFAS using granular activated carbon has well positioned us to respond to this new, more stringent EPA regulation,” said Nadine Leslie, Middlesex Water President and CEO. “It should be noted that water utilities do not produce PFAS chemicals but bring cost effective and innovative solutions to meet all state and federal safe drinking compliance requirements,” added Leslie. “Preliminary engineering studies are underway to ensure we implement the latest and most effective PFAS treatment approaches. We are also working to identify potential private and public sources to fund the significant investments needed to construct the anticipated necessary plant upgrades,” added Leslie.

(NYSE: MOH) secured a Comprehensive Health Care Program contract from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The contract covers six service regions and is set to commence on October 1, 2024, with a potential five-year duration and three one-year extensions. Molina Healthcare of Michigan will be among nine health plans providing coverage to Michigan's approximately 2 million Medicaid beneficiaries. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Policy Analyst Molina Healthcare's new Medicaid contract in Michigan represents a significant development in the managed care sector. The awarding of contracts in six service regions enhances the company's presence in a competitive marketplace. Medicaid contracts are typically large-scale and involve substantial financial implications, both for the state and the contracted health plans. The inclusion of Molina Healthcare of Michigan as one of nine health plans servicing nearly 2 million beneficiaries suggests a notable expansion of their customer base.Managed care organizations like Molina are often evaluated based on their ability to manage costs while providing quality care. The success of Molina in securing this contract may indicate their proficiency in these areas, which could, in turn, influence investor confidence. The long-term nature of the contract, with potential extensions, provides a stable revenue stream and the opportunity for sustained growth. However, it is also important to monitor the execution of the contract terms and the company's ability to maintain compliance with state health service requirements, as these factors can impact future renewals and profitability. Market Research Analyst The announcement from Molina Healthcare regarding the Michigan Medicaid contract is a strategic win that likely reflects positively on the company's market positioning and operational capabilities. For investors and stakeholders, this development could signal a strengthening of Molina's business portfolio. The managed care industry is driven by the ability to secure and maintain state contracts, which are often competitive and subject to rigorous performance standards.Investors typically look for growth opportunities and a five-year contract with extension options can be seen as a long-term investment that may enhance earnings predictability. The impact on the stock market will depend on how this contract influences Molina's overall financial performance relative to market expectations. It's also worth considering the broader economic implications, such as the potential for job creation and the economic activity associated with servicing a larger Medicaid population. Healthcare Financial Analyst The financial implications of the contract for Molina Healthcare are multifaceted. On one hand, the expansion in Michigan represents an increase in potential revenue streams, given the size of the Medicaid population covered. On the other hand, managing a larger pool of beneficiaries comes with increased risk and the need for efficient resource allocation. The performance of Molina's stock will likely reflect the market's assessment of the company's ability to manage these risks and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the new contract.It's essential to consider the cost structures associated with expanding operations and the potential need for capital investments to support the increased scale. Additionally, the terms of the contract may include specific financial penalties or incentives tied to quality and performance metrics, which could impact profitability. As the go-live date approaches, analysts and investors will be closely monitoring Molina's quarterly financials for indicators of how the impending contract is influencing the company's cost management and revenue projections. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM LONG BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Molina Healthcare, Inc.

PaxMedica Achieves Key Milestone in the Development of PAX-101  And Provides Update on Potential NDA Submission,2024-04-11T20:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"PaxMedica, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PXMD) completes pivotal registration batches of PAX-101, an IV formulation of suramin, for potential FDA approval in treating Stage 1 Human African Trypanosomiasis. The milestone sets the stage for NDA submission in Q4 2024, with plans to address Autism Spectrum Disorder and secure a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The announcement by PaxMedica regarding the completion of pivotal registration/validation batches for PAX-101 represents a notable development in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly within the scope of treatments for neglected tropical diseases such as Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). The progression towards a New Drug Application (NDA) submission signifies a potential expansion in the company's product portfolio and an entry into the U.S. market, which could have a substantial impact on the company's revenue and market valuation.Investors should note that the potential approval of PAX-101 by the FDA would not only provide a treatment option for a fatal disease but also could result in the company receiving a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher. These vouchers can be sold or transferred and have previously commanded high market values, thus representing a significant financial asset. Additionally, the company's intention to fund a sustainable global supply chain indicates a long-term strategic approach that may appeal to investors with an interest in corporate sustainability and global health initiatives. Medical Research Analyst The clinical relevance of PAX-101 extends beyond its current application for HAT. PaxMedica's strategic pivot to explore the drug's efficacy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) symptoms could address a significant unmet medical need. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for the core symptoms of ASD, which means that a successful trial could position PAX-101 as a first-in-class option in this therapeutic area.From a research perspective, this could open new avenues for understanding the pathophysiology of ASD and potentially other neurological disorders. The implications for healthcare providers, patients and insurance companies are profound, as this could lead to changes in standard care protocols and potentially improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD. Healthcare Economist While the immediate business implications of PaxMedica's announcement are clear, the broader economic impact is multifaceted. The development of treatments for neglected diseases like HAT often lacks commercial incentive due to limited patient populations and low return on investment. However, PaxMedica's approach to funding a sustainable supply chain for PAX-101 may set a precedent for pharmaceutical companies by demonstrating the viability of investing in treatments for rare diseases.In the long term, if PAX-101 is successful in treating ASD, the economic benefits could be substantial. The societal costs associated with ASD are significant, including healthcare expenses, educational support and lost productivity. An effective treatment could thus alleviate some of these economic burdens. However, the pricing strategy for PAX-101 will be critical, as it must balance affordability and accessibility with the company's need to recoup research and development expenses. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM TARRYTOWN, New York, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN – PaxMedica, Inc. (NASDAQ:PXMD), a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing treatments for neurological disorders, today announced the completed execution of its three pivotal registration/validation batches of PAX-101, an IV formulation of suramin. This achievement is an important milestone to enabling a New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is currently planned for Q4 2024, and for the potential commercial availability in the U.S. of the first and only form of suramin for the treatment of Stage 1 Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a fatal, neglected tropical disease, if approved by the FDA. Reaching this milestone is critical to PaxMedica's journey towards potential FDA approval for PAX-101, currently the accepted standard of treatment outside the United States for the deadliest cause of HAT, according to the CDC. A successful review and approval of the NDA could further qualify the company for a Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV). PaxMedica plans to fund a sustainable global supply chain for PAX-101, and further advance research and clinical trials to address Autism Spectrum Disorder. This underscores the company’s commitment to tackling some of the most challenging neurological conditions. “This is a very significant milestone for PaxMedica as it endeavors to move PAX-101 towards an NDA submission,” said Howard Weisman, chairman and CEO of PaxMedica. “The long-term vision for PaxMedica is to further clinical investigation of PAX-101 as a treatment for individuals who struggle with Autism Spectrum Disorder. With this important manufacturing milestone completed, we have removed a major impediment to testing PAX-101 as a treatment for the core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This also progresses us towards our goal of being able to be a consistent and reliable global source of this lifesaving drug for the treatment of HAT currently listed as one of the World’s Essential Medicines. It is our goal to ultimately conduct clinical trials for the use of PAX-101 in the treatment of the core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder. There are currently no approved medications for the core symptoms Autism Spectrum Disorder.” About PaxMedica PaxMedica, Inc. is a forward-looking clinical-stage biopharmaceutical firm specializing in developing cutting-edge, anti-purinergic drug therapies (APT) aimed at addressing a range of challenging neurologic disorders.

(NYSE: CPA) reported a significant increase in passenger traffic for March 2024 compared to the previous year. The company saw a 12.3% rise in capacity (ASMs) and an 11.5% increase in system-wide passenger traffic (RPMs), resulting in a slightly lower system load factor of 86.5%. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst When assessing the preliminary passenger traffic statistics released by Copa Holdings, one should consider the broader context of the aviation industry and the company's strategic positioning. The reported increase in ASM and RPM indicates that Copa Holdings is expanding its operational scale, which can be seen as a response to rising demand or as part of a planned expansion strategy. However, the slight decrease in load factor might raise some concerns about efficiency and yield management. While the growth in capacity and traffic is positive, the airline must ensure that this expansion does not come at the expense of profitability.It's important to note that the aviation sector is highly sensitive to macroeconomic factors, such as fuel prices, geopolitical events and economic cycles. As such, investors should monitor these indicators alongside the company's performance metrics to gauge the potential impact on future earnings. Additionally, Copa Holdings' performance in the Latin American market should be compared with regional competitors to understand if these growth figures are in line with the market or if they signify a competitive advantage. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in capacity and passenger traffic suggests potential revenue growth for Copa Holdings. However, the nuanced decrease in load factor may hint at a slight inefficiency in matching supply with demand. Investors should analyze the cost implications of increased capacity, such as higher operating expenses and weigh them against the revenue potential from additional traffic. The key will be to look at subsequent financial statements to determine if the increased ASM and RPM translate into improved top and bottom-line figures.Moreover, it's critical to evaluate the company's pricing strategy and ancillary revenue generation, as these can significantly influence profit margins. The airline industry operates on thin margins and small changes in load factor and yield can have a disproportionate effect on profitability. As such, it is essential to dissect the company's revenue management strategies and operational efficiency metrics in future earnings calls and reports. 04/11/2024 - 05:00 PM PANAMA CITY, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Copa Holdings, S.A.

Announces Pricing of $1,500,000,000 6.200% Senior Notes Due 2034 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Jefferies Financial Group Inc. announces the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.200% Senior Notes due 2034, with an effective yield of 6.222%. The offering is expected to settle on April 16, 2024, with the net proceeds intended for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. regarding the pricing of their public offering of $1.5 billion in Senior Notes at a 6.200% interest rate is a substantial move in the company's capital structure strategy. The effective yield slightly higher than the interest rate indicates a slight premium over the par value, which can be seen as a positive sign of investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness. The long-term nature of these notes, maturing in 2034, provides investors with a predictable income stream, which could be particularly attractive in a low-interest-rate environment.From a financial planning perspective, this capital raise through debt rather than equity helps avoid shareholder dilution.

Debt Capital Markets Expert Jefferies' choice of using a shelf registration for this offering allows for a more efficient transaction process. A shelf registration is a procedure that allows an issuer to fulfill regulatory requirements beforehand and go to market quickly when conditions are favorable. The involvement of multiple financial institutions as book-runners and co-managers indicates a broad interest in the offering and a potentially wide distribution of the notes.The selection of a single global coordinator and joint book-runner, along with a diverse group of senior co-managers and co-managers, reflects a strategic approach to balance the need for a lead on the deal while also ensuring distribution capabilities and investor reach. The pricing of the notes in the current market environment will be a benchmark for future offerings, not just for Jefferies but also for similar firms in the financial sector. Market Research Analyst The issuance of Senior Notes by Jefferies Financial Group can be seen as a response to the current capital market conditions. With interest rates potentially on the rise, locking in a fixed interest rate for the next decade can be a strategic move to manage future interest expenses. It reflects a forward-looking approach to capital management, especially considering the potential for increased borrowing costs as monetary policy tightens.Investors will evaluate this offering within the context of the broader financial sector and current economic trends. The demand for this debt issuance will be indicative of the market's risk appetite and the perceived stability of the financial services industry.

(NVOS) announced the repayment of Mast Hill $3,500,000 Note and FirstFire $277,777 Note with cash proceeds from the Streeterville Note. The Company issued a secured convertible promissory note of $6,210,000 to Streeterville Capital, CEO Robert Mattacchione highlighted the importance of reducing dilution. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The repayment of existing debt with the proceeds from a new financing arrangement is a strategic financial move by Novo Integrated Sciences. By settling the Mast Hill and FirstFire notes, the company has effectively restructured its short-term debt obligations. This action could be seen as an attempt to streamline the capital structure and improve the balance sheet ahead of the RC Consulting Consortium Group LLC transaction and other strategic initiatives.From a cash flow perspective, the use of cash proceeds to pay off debt indicates that the company is prioritizing current liabilities and is focused on reducing potential equity dilution. This is a positive signal to investors who might be concerned about the impact of new debt on their share value. However, the issuance of a convertible note introduces the possibility of future dilution if Streeterville Capital chooses to convert the note to equity.It is also worth noting that the discount on the purchase price of the note—$710,000 less than the principal sum—suggests favorable terms for Streeterville, which may raise questions about the cost of capital for Novo Integrated Sciences. Investors should monitor the company's interest expenses and the terms of the convertible feature to assess the impact on future earnings. Debt Market Analyst The issuance of the $6,210,000 secured convertible promissory note by Novo Integrated Sciences to Streeterville Capital represents a nuanced capital market transaction. Convertible notes are hybrid financial instruments that carry the characteristics of both debt and equity. They provide companies with a mechanism to raise capital with the flexibility of conversion to equity, often used by companies seeking to minimize immediate dilution of shares while still bringing in capital.For debt market stakeholders, the key elements to consider are the security of the note, the interest rate and the conversion terms. The secured nature of the note implies that Streeterville has collateral backing their investment, potentially lowering the risk profile of the note. However, the specific terms of the security and conversion rights are not detailed and these would significantly influence the risk assessment.Market participants often view the repayment of shorter-term, higher-interest debt as a positive development, as it can lead to a reduction in the company's cost of capital. However, the long-term implications hinge on the company's ability to either service the new debt from operational cash flows or to successfully execute on its strategic transactions, such as the monetization of the gold-backed bond, without resorting to dilutive conversions. 04/11/2024 - 05:00 PM Both the Mast Hill $3,500,000 Note and the FirstFire $277,777 Note were Paid in Full with Cash Proceeds from the Streeterville Note BELLEVUE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: NVOS) (the “Company” or “Novo”) announced today the Company has entered into a securities purchase agreement, dated April 5, 2024, with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) pursuant to which the Company issued a secured convertible promissory note (the “Note”) with a maturity date of April 8, 2025 in the principal sum of $6,210,000. On April 8, 2024, Streeterville paid the purchase price of $5,500,000 in exchange for the Note. On April 10, 2024, the Company repaid in full the remaining outstanding balances for both the Mast Hill $3,500,000 note and the FirstFire $277,777 note, each dated in September 2023. Robert Mattacchione, the Company’s CEO and Board Chairman, stated, “While the Company continues to work toward closing the previously disclosed RC Consulting Consortium Group LLC transaction, the Ophir gem collection transaction, and monetization of a one-billion dollar gold-backed bond to raise non-dilutive funding, it is very important to have repaid the Mast Hill and FirstFire notes with cash, thereby curtailing dilution.” About Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. Novo Integrated Sciences, Inc. is pioneering a holistic approach to patient-first health and wellness through a multidisciplinary healthcare ecosystem of services and product innovation. Novo offers an essential and differentiated solution to deliver, or intend to deliver, these services and products through the integration of medical technology, advanced therapeutics, and rehabilitative science. We believe that “decentralizing” healthcare, through the integration of medical technology and interconnectivity is an essential solution to the rapidly evolving fundamental transformation of how non-catastrophic healthcare is delivered both now and in the future. Specific to non-critical care, ongoing advancements in both medical technology and interconnectivity are allowing for a shift of the patient/practitioner relationship to the patient’s home and away from on-site visits to primary medical centers with mass-services. This acceleration of “ease-of-access” in the patient/practitioner interaction for non-critical care diagnosis and subsequent treatment minimizes the degradation of non-critical health conditions to critical conditions as well as allowing for more cost-effective healthcare distribution. The Company’s decentralized healthcare business model is centered on three primary pillars to best support the transformation of non-catastrophic healthcare delivery to patients and consumers: First Pillar: Service Networks. Deliver multidisciplinary primary care services through (i) an affiliate network of clinic facilities, (ii) small and micro footprint sized clinic facilities primarily located within the footprint of box-store commercial enterprises, (iii) clinic facilities operated through a franchise relationship with the Company, and (iv) corporate operated clinic facilities. Second Pillar: Technology. Develop, deploy, and integrate sophisticated interconnected technology, interfacing the patient to the healthcare practitioner thus expanding the reach and availability of the Company’s services, beyond the traditional clinic location, to geographic areas not readily providing advanced, peripheral based healthcare services, including the patient’s home. Third Pillar: Products. Develop and distribute effective, personalized health and wellness product solutions allowing for the customization of patient preventative care remedies and ultimately a healthier population. The Company’s science-first approach to product innovation further emphasizes our mandate to create and provide over-the-counter preventative and maintenance care solutions. Innovation through science combined with the integration of sophisticated, secure technology assures Novo Integrated Sciences of continued cutting-edge advancement in patient-first platforms.

The shift to Flight II ships represents an evolution in naval capabilities and aligns with the U.S. Navy's strategic objectives to modernize its fleet.From a business perspective, the ongoing production and future deliveries of the Flight II ships are likely to provide a stable revenue stream for HII. This is important given the long-term nature of defense contracts and the predictability they offer to companies in the defense sector. Moreover, the continuation of this program underlines the strong partnership between industry and government, which is essential for the advancement of national defense initiatives.It is important to note that amphibious transport docks like the San Antonio class are not just assets for force projection but also serve as platforms for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. Their versatility in supporting a wide range of missions enhances the operational readiness of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. As such, the delivery of LPD 29 and the ongoing construction of subsequent ships are likely to have a positive impact on HII's reputation and its position within the defense industry. Military Procurement Expert The transition from LPD Flight I to LPD Flight II involves significant procurement and design enhancements, reflecting the evolving requirements of the U.S. Navy. The San Antonio-class ships are designed to support the Marine Corp’s Force Design, which is a strategic framework aimed at adapting the Marine Corps to future challenges. This transition is indicative of the Navy's commitment to maintain a technological edge and address emerging threats.From a procurement standpoint, the modification to the contract for the design and construction of the Philadelphia (LPD 32) suggests confidence in HII's ability to deliver on complex projects. The awarded contract modification also implies a substantial financial commitment, which is a positive signal for HII's future earnings and stock performance. Investors often look for such long-term contracts as they provide visibility into the company's future revenue and profitability.Furthermore, the ability of LPDs to operate within various naval formations, such as amphibious readiness groups and expeditionary strike groups, underscores their strategic importance. The versatility of these ships in supporting diverse missions contributes to the overall efficacy and agility of the U.S. naval forces, making the continued investment in this class of ships a priority for the Department of Defense. Strategic Defense Analyst The delivery of the Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29) and the ongoing production of the LPD Flight II ships are reflective of the broader strategic realignment within the U.S. defense strategy. The U.S. Navy is focused on enhancing its amphibious and expeditionary capabilities, which is pivotal in the context of global security challenges and the need for rapid deployment forces. These ships play a critical role in force projection and the ability to respond to crises, which is central to maintaining global stability and peace.The strategic implications of these developments extend beyond immediate defense capabilities. They signal a long-term commitment to maintaining a robust industrial base that can support the Navy's ambitious shipbuilding goals. This has broader economic implications, including job creation and the development of technological expertise within the defense sector.For investors, the delivery of the LPD 29 and the ongoing contracts for LPD Flight II ships are indicative of HII's alignment with national defense priorities, which can be a determinant of the company's long-term success. The defense industry is heavily influenced by geopolitical tensions and defense spending policies and companies that are well-positioned to meet the strategic needs of the military tend to perform well in this sector. 04/11/2024 - 06:45 PM PASCAGOULA, Miss., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII’s (NYSE:HII) Ingalls Shipbuilding division announced today the delivery of amphibious transport dock Richard M.

The company's active collagen products aim to address common health concerns like post-meal blood sugar spikes naturally. Darling Ingredients plans to launch its first active collagen peptide product in Fall 2024, targeting consumer products companies. Positive None. Negative None. Nutritional Science Expert The discovery of specific collagen peptide profiles by Darling Ingredients presents a significant advancement in the field of nutritional science and wellness. Collagen peptides, known for their role in skin and joint health, are now being explored for their potential to modulate physiological responses such as blood sugar levels.From a nutritional standpoint, the ability to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes is a promising development, especially in the context of rising global concerns about metabolic health issues. If these collagen peptides can be incorporated into consumer products effectively, they may offer a natural alternative to support blood sugar management, which can be particularly appealing to health-conscious consumers.However, while the initial findings are promising, it is essential to consider the scale and scope of the scientific trials conducted. The long-term efficacy and safety of these collagen peptides in diverse populations remain to be seen. It will be important to monitor ongoing clinical trials and peer-reviewed publications for a better understanding of the potential impact on public health. Market Research Analyst Darling Ingredients' announcement positions the company at the forefront of a growing market for functional foods and ingredients that cater to specific health concerns. The health and wellness segment is expanding rapidly and consumers are increasingly looking for products with added health benefits.By targeting the health-conscious segment with a focus on natural and scientifically backed ingredients, Darling Ingredients could tap into a lucrative market. The branding of these collagen peptides as natural and the emphasis on proprietary processes may differentiate their products in a crowded marketplace.However, the success of these products will depend on consumer acceptance and the perceived effectiveness of the collagen peptides. Marketing strategies and partnerships with consumer product companies will be key. It will also be important to watch how competitors respond to this innovation and whether Darling Ingredients can maintain a competitive edge through its patents pending. Financial Analyst The announcement by Darling Ingredients could have a notable impact on its financial performance, contingent on the successful commercialization of the new collagen peptide products. Investors should monitor the company's R&D expenditure, as well as the costs associated with bringing these products to market, which may affect short-term profitability.In the long term, if these products gain market acceptance, they could contribute to a diversified revenue stream and potentially higher margins due to the proprietary nature of the process. It will be essential to track the progress of the patent applications, as securing patents could provide a competitive moat and affect the company's valuation.Additionally, partnerships with consumer product companies could lead to licensing deals or joint ventures, which may have financial implications such as royalty income or shared revenues. These developments should be factored into any financial models and investment theses regarding Darling Ingredients. 04/11/2024 - 04:46 PM IRVING, Texas, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Darling Ingredients Inc.

(NYSE: BHR) (""Braemar"" or the ""Company"") today sent a letter reminding shareholders to disregard any proxy materials received from activist investor Blackwells Capital LLC (""Blackwells"") in connection with the Company's 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ""2024 Annual Meeting""), which is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. As previously announced on March 25, 2024, Braemar's Board of Directors (the ""Board"") unanimously determined that the Blackwells Nomination Notice was invalid due to Blackwells' numerous false statements and material omissions in violation of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") rules and the Company's Bylaws. As a result, a vote for any of Blackwells' purported nominees on the white proxy card will not be counted. The full text of the letter is below: April 11, 2024 Dear Fellow Shareholder, Thank you for your investment. We remain fully committed to maximizing value for you and are excited about the Company's significant growth opportunities as we continue to invest in premium-branded and high-quality independent luxury hotels and resorts. This year your vote at Braemar's 2024 Annual Meeting – scheduled for May 15, 2024 – will be critically important. You may have received proxy materials – including a white proxy card – from activist investor Blackwells Capital LLC (""Blackwells""), which owns less than 1% of Braemar's voting stock outstanding, yet is attempting to acquire effective control of your Company by electing its four nominees to the eight-person Board.Your Board has unanimously determined that Blackwells' proxy campaign is invalid and recommends that you discard any white proxy card you receive from Blackwells.Most notably, Blackwells failed to disclose its true objectives – which Braemar believes include an underhanded attempt to effectuate a takeover of the Company at a price significantly below its intrinsic value. This lack of required transparency was in addition to numerous false statements and material omissions in violation of SEC rules and the Company's Bylaws.As of now, Braemar will not be facing a contested director election at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The Company has filed a lawsuit against Blackwells in order to protect your investment and prevent Blackwells from proceeding with its illegal proxy solicitation to seize control of the Braemar Board. This means a vote for any of Blackwells' purported nominees on the white proxy card will not be counted.The Braemar Board strongly recommends that you disregard the white proxy card sent to you by Blackwells and to wait for the Company's proxy materials, including the GOLD proxy card, which will be sent to you in the near term.Protect your investment and do NOT vote any proxy card sent to you by Blackwells.Braemar has been successfully executing its strategy Braemar's iconic portfolio of resorts and urban hotels delivered the highest revenue per available room (""RevPAR"") in the publicly traded lodging REIT industry during fiscal year 2023, generating RevPAR of approximately $307, compared to the full-service lodging REIT peer average of approximately $196.1 Since its founding in 2014 through fiscal year 2023,2 Braemar also delivered RevPAR growth of approximately 79%, outperforming the full-service lodging REIT peer average growth of approximately 28%.3The Company continues to strengthen its balance sheet and has recently announced the successful refinancing or extension of nearly all of its 2024 debt maturities totaling approximately $300 million, including the recent refinancing of the Capital Hilton in Washington, D.C., and loan extensions for properties like Pier House Resort & Spa, Ritz-Carlton St. Thomas, Ritz-Carlton Lake Tahoe and Hilton La Jolla Torrey Pines.Braemar's portfolio delivered robust results in fiscal year 2023, delivering a hotel EBITDA per key of approximately $49,200 ahead of the peer average of approximately $35,700.1 The Company's resort properties continue to outpace 2019 results and its urban properties continue to recover.The Company has a successful track record of growing its asset base by executing a disciplined, value-accretive capital allocation approach. Since 2013, Braemar has acquired 11 hotels that have delivered an attractive average yield on cost of 8.5% on a trailing 12-month basis as of December 31, 2023. The recent acquisitions of the Ritz-Carlton Reserve Dorado Beach and the Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North continue to surpass expectations, which reported strong RevPAR growth of 9% and 5%, respectively, during the fourth quarter of 2023.The Board has the experience and expertise to continue leading Braemar and grow your investment The Board is actively engaged in overseeing management's execution of the Company's strategy.The Board is comprised of eight highly qualified individuals – Monty J. Bennett, Stefani D. Carter, Candace Evans, Kenneth H. Fearn, Jr., Rebeca Odino-Johnson, Matthew D. Rinaldi, Richard J. Stockton and Abteen Vaziri – six of whom are independent.Our directors have the right mix of experience and skillsets that are critical to Braemar's business and future success, including relevant REIT and lodging industry, real estate investment, management, finance, legal and governance expertise.The Board regularly evaluates its composition to ensure it reflects the appropriate skills and experience necessary to drive growth and maximize value for all Braemar shareholders.Soon you will be receiving the Company's proxy materials and GOLD proxy card.

The company issued 1,331,452 shares of common stock at $2.88 per share for the CEO and $2.25 per share for other investors. Carmell will have approximately 20.58 million shares outstanding. The funds will support commercial launch efforts for their anti-aging bio-aesthetics technology products. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent private placement by Carmell Corporation signifies a strategic move to bolster its financial health and support the commercial launch of its product pipeline. The $3 million in gross proceeds, although not substantial for a biotech firm, provides the necessary capital to fund ongoing operations and research endeavors. The pricing strategy, with a discount for investors other than the CEO, is a common incentive in private placements to attract capital. However, the discount rate should be analyzed in the context of the company's valuation and investor confidence.Investors should consider the dilutive effect of the additional shares on the market, which now total around 20.58 million. It's essential to monitor the company's subsequent earnings reports and any announcements regarding the use of the raised funds. The performance of the 10 products mentioned by the CEO will be a important factor in evaluating the long-term return on this investment. Financial stakeholders should scrutinize the company's ability to execute its commercialization strategy and the market potential of its anti-aging bio-aesthetics technology. Market Research Analyst The anti-aging market is witnessing significant growth, driven by an increasing global population of elderly individuals and a rising demand for products that can delay signs of aging.

The offering is expected to settle on April 16, 2024, for general corporate purposes. Positive Jefferies Financial Group Inc. successfully priced a total of €1.25 billion in senior unsecured notes under its Euro Medium Term Note Program. The 2026 Notes have a fixed rate of 3.875% and will mature on April 16, 2026. The 2029 Notes have a fixed rate of 4.000% and will mature on April 16, 2029. The net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and are not available for sale in the United States without registration or an exemption. Negative None. Financial Analyst Jefferies Financial Group Inc.'s decision to price a substantial amount of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes could be indicative of their strategy to bolster liquidity and finance corporate initiatives. The notes' fixed interest rates of 3.875% for the 2026 Notes and 4.000% for the 2029 Notes reflect the current borrowing costs in the context of the prevailing economic environment. It's important to assess the yield spread against comparable maturity government bonds to gauge investor sentiment towards the company's credit risk.Investors should consider the potential impact of this debt issuance on JFG's balance sheet, particularly the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratios. The use of proceeds for general corporate purposes is quite broad and could encompass debt refinancing, which might improve financial metrics if it replaces more expensive debt. However, it could also signal upcoming investments or acquisitions, which might carry more risk. The unregistered nature of these notes suggests a targeting of institutional investors, possibly due to the lower regulatory requirements and faster issuance process. Market Research Analyst The issuance of senior unsecured notes by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. could have implications for the company's stock performance, as it may influence investor perceptions of the company's leverage and financial strategy. The interest rates set for the 2026 and 2029 Notes are competitive, which could suggest confidence among institutional investors in the company's long-term financial health. Observing the secondary market performance of these notes post-settlement will provide insights into the market's view of JFG's creditworthiness.Given that the notes are denominated in euros, this move also indicates JFG's approach to currency risk management and its outlook on the euro's future value relative to other currencies. Investors should monitor foreign exchange trends as they could affect the company's cost of debt servicing. Additionally, the timing of this issuance may be strategic, potentially taking advantage of current market conditions before any anticipated shifts in interest rates or economic policy within the Eurozone. Legal Expert The legal aspect of Jefferies Financial Group's issuance of unregistered notes is significant due to the implications for both the issuer and potential investors. The notes' status as unregistered securities means they are subject to certain restrictions and are typically only available to qualified institutional buyers. This limits the investor pool but also reduces the regulatory burden on JFG.It's important for investors to be aware of the Securities Act of 1933, which governs the registration of these securities. The exemption from registration relies on Rule 144A or Regulation S, which could affect the liquidity of these notes. Furthermore, the legal stipulations tied to these notes, such as covenants and default terms, will be important in understanding the protections afforded to investors and the constraints placed on JFG's operations. 04/11/2024 - 05:28 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- On April 9, 2024, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: JEF) (“JFG”, “we” or “our”) priced €750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and €500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Fixed Rate Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2029 (the “2029 Notes” and, together with the 2026 Notes, the “Notes”), each under its Euro Medium Term Note Program.

22nd Century Group Expands CMO Business with New Pinnacle Brand Cigarillo Products,2024-04-11T20:45:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"22nd Century Group, Inc. (XXII) expands its Pinnacle private label brand to include cigarillo products at a top-5 U.S. gas station convenience store chain, experiencing over 10% growth in re-order volumes. The company aims to boost revenue and profitability through new product offerings and increased production volumes.","22nd Century Group Expands CMO Business with New Pinnacle Brand Cigarillo Products Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary 22nd Century Group, Inc. (XXII) expands its Pinnacle private label brand to include cigarillo products at a top-5 U.S. gas station convenience store chain, experiencing over 10% growth in re-order volumes. The company aims to boost revenue and profitability through new product offerings and increased production volumes. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The expansion of 22nd Century Group's Pinnacle brand into cigarillo products at a leading U.S. convenience store chain signifies a strategic move to capitalize on the existing market presence. The sustained growth of re-order volumes for Pinnacle cigarette products indicates a successful penetration in the private label tobacco space, which is often characterized by higher margins compared to branded products. This move could potentially enhance the company's revenue streams and improve its competitive positioning within the tobacco industry.Furthermore, the announcement of the new CMO customer contract, which is projected to increase production volumes by at least 20%, suggests an aggressive push to scale operations. If successful, this could lead to improved economies of scale and a stronger bargaining position with suppliers, ultimately contributing to the company's goal of achieving breakeven operations by the first quarter of 2025. Financial Analyst The introduction of the Pinnacle cigarillo products and the new CMO contract is likely to have a positive impact on 22nd Century Group's financials. The top-5 U.S. convenience store chain's network of 1,700 stores across 26 states provides a substantial distribution channel for these products. The growth in tobacco sales and market share captured by this chain could translate into increased sales volumes for 22nd Century Group.An important aspect for investors to consider is the timing of the shipments, scheduled for the second quarter, which could lead to a near-term increase in revenue. However, the long-term success of these initiatives will depend on consumer acceptance of the new cigarillo products and the company's ability to maintain and grow its private label contracts. The commitment to breakeven by the first quarter of 2025 sets a clear financial target for the company, which should be monitored closely by stakeholders for progress updates. Tobacco Industry Analyst The tobacco industry is highly regulated and subject to changing consumer preferences, with an increasing focus on harm reduction. 22nd Century Group's emphasis on nicotine harm reduction could resonate with current trends towards healthier alternatives and could potentially open up new customer segments. The expansion into cigarillos, a category that has seen varied regulatory scrutiny compared to cigarettes, could be a tactical approach to diversify product offerings and mitigate risk.It is also noteworthy that the company is leveraging private label partnerships to grow its brand. This strategy can be beneficial as it allows for faster market penetration without the significant marketing costs associated with building a consumer brand. However, the dependency on a limited number of large contracts for distribution could pose a risk if those partnerships are disrupted. Continuous innovation and adaptation to regulatory changes will be key for the company to maintain its growth trajectory within the tobacco sector. 04/11/2024 - 04:45 PM Pinnacle Branded Products Growing At Over 10% at Top-5 U.S. C-Store ChainMocksville, North Carolina--(Newsfile Corp. - April 11, 2024) - 22nd Century Group, Inc.

The Pinnacle cigarillo will provide a new alternative to this c-store chain's customers, as well as help to further the number of Pinnacle branded product offerings available to customers. Stocking shipments of the new Pinnacle products are scheduled in the second quarter.

(the “Company” or “FRMO”) (OTC Pink: FRMO) today reported its financial results for the 2024 third quarter ended February 29, 2024. Financial Highlights FRMO’s total book value as of February 29, 2024 was $357.8 million ($8.13 per share on a fully diluted basis), including $138.4 million of non-controlling interests. Excluding the non-controlling interests, book value was $219.5 million ($4.99 per share). This compares with total book value at the prior fiscal year end on May 31, 2023 of $284.1 million ($6.45 per share), including $114.8 million of non-controlling interests. Excluding the non-controlling interests, book value was $169.2 million ($3.85 per share). Current assets, comprised primarily of cash and equivalents, equity securities, and digital assets, amounted to $241.8 million as of February 29, 2024, and $201.3 million as of May 31, 2023. Total liabilities were $30.7 million as of February 29, 2024, and $19.4 million as of May 31, 2023, comprised primarily of securities sold, not yet purchased, and deferred taxes. For the three months ended February 29, 2024, FRMO’s net income (loss) attributable to the Company was $12,988,910 ($0.30 per diluted share), compared to $(34,901,022) ($(0.79) per diluted share) a year earlier. Net income for the quarter is attributable to unrealized gains from digital assets held directly and indirectly, through the Company’s various investments in managed funds, offset by unrealized losses from equity securities. The equity security investment that accounts for the significant component of unrealized (losses) gains from equity securities is identified as Investment A in Note 4 of the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Investment Concentration. For the nine months ended February 29, 2024, net income attributable to the Company was $50,021,124 ($1.14 per diluted share), compared to $7,446,825 ($0.17 per diluted share) for the nine months ended February 28, 2023. Net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain (loss) from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes for the three months ended February 29, 2024 was $14,653,283 ($0.33 per diluted share) compared to $(12,121,031) ($(0.28) per diluted share) for the three months ended February 28, 2023. The nine-month figures, as of the same end dates, are $36,480,505 ($0.83 per diluted share) and $815,704 ($0.02 per diluted share), respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain from equity securities and digital assets net of taxes is a measure not based on GAAP and is defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in “Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures” at the end of this release. Valuation of securities and digital assets are subject to change after February 29, 2024. The market value of several securities and digital assets might have changed substantially since that date. We look forward to finding new ways to expand our digital asset mining operations. As of February 29, 2024 and May 31, 2023, the Company held a 21.79% equity interest in Horizon Kinetics Hard Assets LLC (“HKHA”), a company formed by Horizon Kinetics LLC (“Horizon”) and certain officers, principal stockholders and directors of the Company. The Company also holds a 4.95% interest in Horizon and earns substantially all of its advisory fees from Horizon. Due to the common control and ownership between HKHA and the Company’s principal stockholders and directors, HKHA has been consolidated within the Company’s financial statements.

Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 – With the exception of historical information, the matters discussed in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words like “believe,” “expect” and “anticipate” mean that these are our best estimates as of this writing, but that there can be no assurances that expected or anticipated results or events will actually take place, so our actual future results could differ significantly from those statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: our ability to maintain our competitive advantages, the general economics of the financial industry, our ability to finance growth, our ability to identify and close acquisitions on terms favorable to the Company, and a sustainable market. Further information on our risk factors is contained in our quarterly and annual reports as filed on our website www.frmocorp.com and on www.otcmarkets.com/stock/FRMO/filings. Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures Net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities, digital assets, and diluted earnings per common share is net income attributable to the Company exclusive of unrealized gains (losses) from equity securities, digital assets, and diluted earnings per common share net of tax. Net income (loss) attributable to the Company is the GAAP measure most closely comparable to net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets. Management uses net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities, digital assets, and diluted earnings per common share along with other measures, to gauge the Company’s performance and evaluate results, which can be skewed when including unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities, digital assets, and diluted earnings per common share, which may vary significantly between periods. Net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities, digital assets, and diluted earnings per common share is provided as supplemental information, and is not a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to the Company and does not reflect the Company’s overall profitability. The following table reconciles the net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities to net income (loss) attributable to the Company for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended Nine Months Ended February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 February 29, 2024 February 28, 2023 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Amount Diluted earnings per common share Amount Diluted loss per common share Amount Diluted earnings per common share Amount Diluted earnings per common share (000’s except per common share amounts and percentages) Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company Excluding the Effect of Unrealized (Loss) Gain from Equity Securities and Digital Assets, and Diluted Earnings per Common Share Reconciliation: Net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ 12,989 $ 0.30 $ (34,901) $ (0.79) $ 50,021 $ 1.14 $ 7,447 $ 0.17 Unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets (8,648) (90,424) 38,802 24,006 Unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets attributable to noncontrolling interests (7,852) (66,580) 22,341 17,152 Unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets attributable to the Company (795) (23,844) 16,462 6,854 Tax (benefit) expense on unrealized gain (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets attributable to the company (869) 1,065 (2,921) (223) Unrealized (loss) gain from equity securities and digital assets attributable to the Company, net of taxes (1,664) $ (0.04) (22,780) $ (0.52) 13,541 $ 0.31 6,631 $ 0.15 Net income (loss) attributable to the Company excluding the effect of unrealized gain (loss) from equity securities and digital assets $ 14,653 $ 0.33 $ (12,122) $ (0.28) $ 36,481 $ 0.83 $ 816 $ 0.02 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 44,025,624 44,022,781 44,026,234 44,032,153 (Components may not sum to totals due to rounding) View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240411397268/en/ Thérèse Byars Corporate Secretary Email: tbyars@frmocorp.com Telephone: 646-495-7337 www.frmocorp.com Source: FRMO Corp.

Garden State, a premium dealership and marina location, generated around $14.0 million in sales in 2023. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The acquisition of Garden State Yacht Sales by OneWater Marine Inc. represents a strategic expansion in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. market. This move is indicative of OneWater's commitment to growth through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), a common strategy for businesses looking to increase market share, diversify offerings and achieve economies of scale.The boating industry is characterized by high seasonality and consumer discretionary spending. The addition of Garden State's product lineup and services, including maintenance and storage, is likely to enhance OneWater's value proposition to customers. By acquiring a company with an established presence and approximately $14.0 million in sales, OneWater may see an immediate impact on its revenue streams. However, the integration process will be critical to realize the full potential of synergies and avoid any operational disruptions.Investors should monitor the efficiency of the integration process and how well OneWater leverages Garden State's existing customer base and operational strengths. The acquisition's success will largely depend on OneWater's ability to maintain the quality of service and capitalize on cross-selling opportunities. Financial Analyst The financial aspect of this acquisition is particularly interesting given the mention of a 'minimal capital outlay.' This suggests that OneWater is able to expand its assets and revenue potential without significantly impacting its balance sheet or cash reserves. For stakeholders, this could imply that the company is managing its financial leverage prudently, which is often a positive signal. However, the actual cost and terms of the deal were not disclosed, which makes it challenging to evaluate the full financial implications.With Garden State's reported sales of $14.0 million, the acquisition could be accretive to OneWater's earnings, pending the final acquisition costs and the operational efficiency post-acquisition. Stakeholders should look for future earnings reports and management discussions to assess the impact of the acquisition on OneWater's profitability and earnings per share. Legal Expert From a legal perspective, the definitive agreement to acquire Garden State Yacht Sales suggests that due diligence has been completed and that both parties have agreed to the terms. However, the transaction is likely subject to customary closing conditions and potentially regulatory approvals, depending on the size and market impact of the acquisition.It is important for investors to consider any potential legal risks associated with the acquisition, such as antitrust considerations, especially given the mention of OneWater's growing footprint in the Mid-Atlantic market. The company's statement indicates confidence in its 'proven integration playbook,' which may mitigate some of the legal and operational risks commonly associated with M&A activities. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM Acquisition strengthens presence in the Mid-Atlantic U.S.BUFORD, Ga., April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OneWater Marine Inc.

Authorizes Stock Repurchase Program Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags buyback Rhea-AI Summary First Seacoast Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSEA) authorizes a stock repurchase program for up to 507,707 shares, about 10% of outstanding shares. The program will start after filing Form 10-Q for March 31, 2024, with the SEC. Repurchases will be on the open market under SEC Rule 10b5-1, subject to market conditions. The program expires 12 months after the effective date, with no guarantee on the final repurchased shares. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The authorization of a stock repurchase program by First Seacoast Bancorp represents a strategic decision that can have several implications on its stock valuation and investor sentiment. When a company buys back its shares, it typically signals a self-assessment of undervaluation or a surplus of cash that it opts to return to shareholders rather than reinvesting in the business. This can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) due to a reduced share count, potentially causing the stock price to rise if the market views the buyback as a positive signal regarding the company's future prospects. Moreover, the repurchase plan, which encompasses a significant 10% of the outstanding shares, could also indicate management's confidence in the company's financial health and stability. However, investors should be mindful of the fact that buybacks can sometimes be used to artificially inflate stock prices or to offset the dilution from employee stock compensation. Therefore, while the announcement may generate short-term positive momentum in the stock price, the long-term effects will largely depend on the underlying financial performance and strategic direction of the company. Financial Analyst From a financial standpoint, the repurchase program's impact on First Seacoast Bancorp's capital structure should be examined. The reduction in common stock outstanding will improve return on equity (ROE) by decreasing the equity base. This could be viewed favorably by investors seeking efficiency in capital utilization. However, it's important to consider the source of funding for the repurchase. If the company is using debt to finance the buyback, it may lead to higher leverage ratios, which could be a concern if earnings are volatile or if the company operates in a cyclical industry. Additionally, the timing of the repurchase, set to occur after the filing of the quarterly report, suggests the company is waiting to provide full disclosure of its financials, which could influence the repurchase strategy. This transparency is important for maintaining investor trust. The use of an SEC Rule 10b5-1 trading plan also adds a layer of compliance and automation to the repurchase process, potentially mitigating concerns of insider trading and ensuring repurchases occur without regard to any subsequent material non-public information the company may receive. 04/11/2024 - 04:30 PM DOVER, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Seacoast Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq Capital Market: FSEA), the holding company for First Seacoast Bank, announced today it has authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 507,707 shares of common stock, representing approximately 10% of shares currently outstanding, to be effective as soon as practicable after the Company files its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2024, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Company intends to conduct the repurchases on the open market, including by means of a trading plan adopted under SEC Rule 10b5-1, subject to market conditions and other factors. There is no guarantee as to the number of shares that the Company may ultimately repurchase. The program will expire 12 months after the effective date, regardless of whether all shares will have been repurchased. The Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time.

Announces Pricing of Upsized Private Offering of Senior Notes Due 2029 and Senior Notes Due 2031 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Transocean (NYSE: RIG) announced a successful private offering of $1.8 billion in Senior Notes due 2029 and 2031. The Notes are guaranteed by Transocean and subsidiaries, with interest rates of 8.250% and 8.500% per annum, respectively. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Transocean's upsized private offering to $1.8 billion in Senior Notes is a significant financial move that warrants a thorough analysis. The interest rates of 8.250% for the 2029 Notes and 8.500% for the 2031 Notes are relatively high, which could indicate that the company is considered a higher credit risk. This is not uncommon for companies in the energy sector, particularly those involved with offshore drilling, as they face volatile commodity prices and regulatory challenges.The use of the proceeds from such offerings is typically for refinancing existing debt, funding capital expenditures, or supporting general corporate purposes. Investors should consider the company's debt maturity profile and evaluate how this offering affects its liquidity and leverage ratios. The fact that the Notes are guaranteed by Transocean Ltd. and certain subsidiaries suggests a strong commitment to meeting its obligations, which might be reassuring to potential investors. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the upsizing of the offering could be interpreted as a positive signal of investor confidence in Transocean's financial health and future prospects. However, the high-interest rates attached to these Senior Notes might reflect a less optimistic view from the market regarding the risk associated with the offshore drilling industry. It is critical to assess the industry trends, such as oil price fluctuations and advancements in renewable energy, as they can significantly impact Transocean's operations and, consequently, its ability to service debt.Investors should also consider the timing of the offering and the potential impact on the company's stock. An upsized offering can dilute existing shareholders but could also provide the capital necessary for strategic investments or to improve the balance sheet. The short-term and long-term effects on the stock price will depend on how the market interprets the use of the capital raised and the company's subsequent performance. Energy Sector Analyst Transocean's decision to issue Senior Notes is a strategic financial maneuver within the energy sector. The interest rates reflect the inherent risks of the offshore drilling industry, which is capital intensive and subject to environmental regulations and geopolitical factors. The guarantee by Transocean Ltd. enhances the attractiveness of the Notes, but it also indicates a level of risk that the parent company is willing to shoulder.Analyzing the company's project pipeline and operational efficiency is important for understanding the potential return on these investments. The energy sector is undergoing a transition with increased focus on sustainability and efficiency and companies like Transocean must navigate these changes while managing their debt obligations. The successful deployment of the raised funds into profitable projects could lead to improved financial performance and shareholder value over time. 04/11/2024 - 06:25 PM STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd.

The Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Transocean Ltd. and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The 2029 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.250% per annum, and the 2031 Notes will bear interest at the rate of 8.500% per annum. The offering is expected to close on or about April 18, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.

JELD-WEN Announces Changes in North America Window Operations,2024-04-11T21:15:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. announces the closure of two manufacturing facilities in Vista, California, and Hawkins, Wisconsin, to streamline window product offerings and enhance long-term profitability. The company expects one-time costs of $45 million but anticipates annual pre-tax income improvements of at least $11 million.","JELD-WEN Announces Changes in North America Window Operations Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. announces the closure of two manufacturing facilities in Vista, California, and Hawkins, Wisconsin, to streamline window product offerings and enhance long-term profitability. The company expects one-time costs of $45 million but anticipates annual pre-tax income improvements of at least $11 million. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The decision by JELD-WEN to shut down two manufacturing facilities and streamline its window product offerings is a strategic move aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and cost management. This step is indicative of a broader trend in the manufacturing sector where companies are continually seeking ways to optimize their supply chain and production processes in response to market demands and competitive pressures.From a market perspective, the closure of these facilities and the discontinuation of the Auraline product line suggest a shift in consumer preferences or a strategic realignment to focus on more profitable or in-demand products. The projected annual pre-tax income improvements of at least $11 million reflect a significant cost-saving initiative that could improve the company's financial health over the long term. However, the one-time costs of $45 million could have a short-term negative impact on the company's financials, potentially affecting investor sentiment.The consolidation of wood window manufacturing in Illinois also points to a rationalization of assets to reduce overheads and streamline operations. However, investors should monitor how these changes might impact market share, customer relationships and brand reputation, as well as the potential risks associated with the consolidation of operations, such as production bottlenecks or quality control issues. Financial Analyst With JELD-WEN's announcement, there is a clear financial implication for both short-term and long-term horizons. The immediate one-time costs of $45 million will likely be a hit to the company's earnings in the fiscal year of 2024. This expenditure includes severance, asset write-offs and other closure-related expenses. Investors should consider the implications of these costs on the company's net income and earnings per share for the year.On the flip side, the anticipated annual pre-tax income improvements of $11 million suggest a positive long-term outlook. These savings could potentially lead to margin expansion and increased profitability. It is important for investors to weigh the short-term costs against the long-term benefits and consider how these actions fit into the company's overall financial strategy.Another aspect to consider is the impact of these closures on the company's balance sheet. The reduction in assets and potential liabilities associated with the facilities could alter the company's financial ratios, which are critical for creditors and investors alike. The market will also be looking at how these changes affect the company's cash flows, as the initial cash outlay for the closures will need to be managed alongside ongoing operational expenses. Human Resources Consultant The human element of JELD-WEN's operational changes cannot be overlooked. The closure of the two facilities affects approximately 450 associates, which raises concerns about workforce management and corporate reputation. From an HR standpoint, the company will need to manage the layoffs sensitively to minimize the impact on employee morale and the associated risks of knowledge loss.The transition of employees, if any are to be retained and relocated, requires careful planning to ensure a smooth integration into the Rantoul facility. Additionally, the company's employer brand may be affected, which could influence future talent acquisition and retention. Investors should consider the potential costs associated with retraining, relocation and increased turnover.Moreover, the company's approach to managing these changes will be scrutinized by both current and prospective employees. The manner in which JELD-WEN handles the closures and communicates with its workforce could have long-term implications for its corporate culture and operational effectiveness. 04/11/2024 - 05:15 PM Company will close two manufacturing facilities and streamline window product offerings as part of transformation journey CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- JELD-WEN Holding, Inc. (NYSE: JELD) today announced actions to simplify its North America windows operations by closing its Vista, California, and Hawkins, Wisconsin, manufacturing facilities. Today's announcement is a further step in JELD-WEN's transformation journey to strengthen the foundation of the company and position itself for long term, profitable growth. In connection with these site closures, the company expects to incur one-time costs of approximately $45 million and generate annual pre-tax income improvements of at least $11 million. The Vista, California, site manufactures composite windows (marketed and sold under the brand name Auraline) and has approximately 110 associates. Multiple market factors have made it prohibitive to competitively sustain the composite windows product line and it will be discontinued. As a result, JELD-WEN plans to close the Vista composite windows facility. Orders placed within 90 days of April 11, 2024, will be accepted and fulfilled under currently stated lead times. JELD-WEN expects to incur one-time costs in 2024 of approximately $21 million related to the Vista closure and after project completion, recognize an annual pre-tax income improvement of at least $4 million. The Hawkins, Wisconsin, site manufactures wood windows and employs approximately 340 associates. JELD-WEN will consolidate production from Hawkins into its wood windows manufacturing facility in Rantoul, Illinois. One-time costs related to this site consolidation are estimated at approximately $24 million, most of which should be incurred in 2024. Annual pre-tax income improvement, after completion of these activities, is expected to be at least $7 million. JELD-WEN will address any updates about the closures during its quarterly earnings call scheduled for May 7, 2024. ### About JELD-WEN, Inc.JELD-WEN Holding, Inc.

Richtech will provide and maintain ADAM robots, while Zipphaus will handle daily cafe operations. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of the joint venture between Richtech Robotics Inc. and Zipphaus Corp. to launch robotic cafes in high-traffic areas like hospitals, airports and schools is a strategic move that taps into the growing trend of automation in the service industry. By utilizing Richtech's advanced robots in conjunction with Zipphaus's operational experience, the venture, Zipphaus Plus, LLC, aims to enhance customer experience while improving efficiency.One key aspect to consider is the potential increase in efficiency and reduction in labor costs that robotic systems can bring to the service industry. The deployment of ADAM robots may also appeal to tech-savvy consumers and those interested in novel dining experiences, potentially driving foot traffic and revenue. However, the success of this initiative will heavily depend on the seamless integration of the robots into the existing service framework, customer acceptance and the reliability of the technology.Furthermore, the scalability of this model across different markets and the ability to maintain a consistent level of service quality will be critical for long-term success. Investors should monitor the initial roll-out in hospitals and the customer feedback it generates, as it will be indicative of the venture's future potential. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the formation of Zipphaus Plus, LLC could influence Richtech Robotics Inc.'s revenue streams by diversifying its business model from merely selling robots to participating directly in service operations. This joint venture indicates a strategic pivot towards recurring revenue through service operations, which could enhance Richtech's valuation if the concept proves successful in the initial locations.Investors should consider the capital expenditures associated with the development and maintenance of the ADAM robots, alongside the potential for increased revenue from the cafes. The long-term financial health of the JV will hinge on its ability to control operational costs while maximizing the revenue per visitor.It is also important to note that such partnerships can face significant upfront costs and may take time to become profitable. Therefore, the impact on Richtech's and Zipphaus's short-term financial performance may be limited, with the potential for more significant contributions to earnings in the future. Technology Adoption Expert In the context of technology adoption, the joint venture's focus on deploying robotic systems in customer-facing environments is an ambitious move. The integration of AI-driven service robots into daily operations could set a precedent for the wider adoption of such technologies in the service industry.ADAM robots represent a significant technological advancement and their performance in high-stress environments like hospitals and airports will be closely watched. The ability of these robots to handle complex tasks and interact with customers in a natural and efficient manner will be key to their acceptance. Additionally, the successful adoption could pave the way for further investments in AI and robotics technologies, influencing future labor dynamics and consumer expectations.The venture's ability to navigate technological challenges, such as ensuring the robots' functionality and adaptability, will be important to its success. Stakeholders should also consider the potential implications for the workforce, as increased automation may lead to shifts in employment patterns within the service sector. 04/11/2024 - 08:08 PM The companies intend to launch the robotic beverage system ADAM in customer facing locations inside hospitals, airports, and schools LAS VEGAS, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Richtech Robotics Inc.

The shares will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'ULS'.","UL Solutions Announces Pricing of Upsized Initial Public Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags IPO offering Rhea-AI Summary UL Solutions Inc. announced the pricing of its upsized initial public offering of 33,800,000 shares of its Class A common stock at $28.00 per share. The offering consists of secondary shares to be sold by UL Standards & Engagement. The shares will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'ULS'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by UL Solutions Inc. regarding the pricing of its upsized initial public offering (IPO) is a significant event that merits a closer examination from a financial perspective. The decision to price 33,800,000 shares at $28.00 each indicates a substantial market valuation, reflective of investor confidence and the company's perceived growth potential. The offering being entirely secondary suggests that UL Standards & Engagement, the current sole stockholder, is capitalizing on the company's market position to liquidate part of its holdings.Investors should note that UL Solutions will not benefit directly from the proceeds of this sale, as it is not offering any new shares. This could imply that the company is sufficiently capitalized and does not require additional funds for expansion or operations. However, the lack of direct capital infusion from the IPO could be a missed opportunity for accelerated growth. The underwriters' option to purchase additional shares could indicate a strong demand for the stock, potentially leading to a favorable market response upon listing. Market Research Analyst The entry of UL Solutions into the public market with its shares trading under the ticker 'ULS' on the New York Stock Exchange is poised to attract significant attention from the investment community. The involvement of prominent financial institutions as bookrunners and co-managers, such as Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and others, adds credibility to the offering and may enhance investor confidence.Market participants will likely scrutinize the company's performance metrics, competitive positioning and future growth strategies post-IPO. The secondary nature of the offering may lead to a realignment of the shareholder base, which can have implications for corporate governance and future decision-making processes. In the broader context, the performance of UL Solutions' stock post-IPO could serve as a barometer for investor sentiment towards the industry and similar future offerings. Securities Lawyer The legal aspects of this IPO are important for ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. The effectiveness of the registration statement by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a mandatory step that permits the company to proceed with the offering. Potential investors should be aware that the final prospectus, once available, will provide essential details about the company's financial health, risk factors and management's discussion and analysis, which are pivotal for making informed investment decisions.Furthermore, the statement that the offering will only be made by means of a prospectus is a standard regulatory disclaimer to prevent unlawful solicitation of sales. The announcement also adheres to the legal requirement of not accepting offers to buy before the registration statement becomes effective, ensuring that all transactions are conducted in accordance with securities laws. 04/11/2024 - 09:37 PM NORTHBROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- UL Solutions Inc.

(CSE: WIFI) (OTC Pink: AAIRF) (""Aires"" or the ""Company""), a pioneer in cutting-edge technology designed to protect against electromagnetic radiation and optimize human health, is pleased to announce the filing the Company's Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and disclose key performance metrics (non-IFRS and unaudited financial results). To keep financial results comparable on a YoY basis while making them consistent with ongoing and future reporting, all figures below combine the results of Aires and those achieved by HUCK Project LLC (""HUCK"") pursuant to the Distributor-Royalty agreement initially announced on August 28, 2023 and which has been subsequently terminated by mutual agreement of the parties, as announced on February 16, 2024.The Aires team is proud of its Q4 2023 performance, achieving record order volume of $3.7 million,1 largely due to enhancements made to Aires' marketing and advertising strategy. The increased order volume represents strong growth YoY (up $1.3 million for 53% growth), while advertising and promotion expenses grew by only a modest $0.3 million YoY as we continue to scale up our growth engine, and marketing costs were slightly reduced by 2% YoY.The record level of quarterly order volume was achieved despite a temporary shortage of product that limited sales. The related supply chain constraint has now been resolved, and the Company has been fully stocked since that time thanks to the negotiation of new supply terms and increased working capital from our recently closed $4 million financing, as announced on February 16, 2024.The Company's most important quarterly achievement was reporting its first significant adjusted quarterly EBITDA profitability at $77,750, which is a milestone that underscores the Company's ongoing strategic delivery of shareholder value. EBITDA adjustments are for inclusion of HUCK results and non-recurring expenses associated with restructuring and other one-time costs. Please see ""Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation Table for Q4/2023"" below for more details.The Aires team is equally proud of its annual performance in 2023 on multiple fronts. The Company drove an impressive order volume increase of 79% YoY to $10.4 million (up from $5.8 million in 2022). The strong order volume financial results are a direct result of the brand-building vision of American Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, and his ability to consistently drive growth, such as 2022's order volume increase of 128% YoY. As with previous years, the main catalyst for revenue growth was Bruni's measured, data-driven and iterative growth engine.American Aires CEO, Josh Bruni, commented: ""This success builds on the hard work and sustainable growth we've demonstrated over the past 2 years. These financial results are just the latest proof that we have what it takes to reach and convert the massive and growing consumer market focused on wellbeing and EMF protection. Now it's time to focus on making 2024 our best year ever and continuing our trajectory of significant revenue growth. That means staying the course but with the welcomed advantage of working with a larger budget. That will involve ramping up our predictable growth engine to drive further revenue increases and deepening and widening our relationships with athletes, celebrities and performers to elevate Aires to the level of household brand.""Gross margin as a percentage in 2023 was mostly in line at 61% relative to from 2022's level (62%), exemplifying continued focus on optimization of manufacturing and fulfillment costs. Gross margin in dollars increased by 76% YoY to $6.4 million (up from $3.6 million in 2022) on the back of stronger order volumes.The financial results for 2023 demonstrate the effectiveness and ROI of the Company's revamped advertising and promotions approach, which includes expanded spending on social media platforms and further spending on developing affiliate relationships to promote Aires' products. During the year, advertising and promotion spend increased by only $1.3 million YoY compared to an annual YoY increase in order volume that was 3.4x greater ($4.6 million).Marketing expenses remained relatively stable with a modest 8% YoY increase to $2.1 million. The expenses are based on contracts with a number of marketing agencies that provide services based on a fee as opposed to commissions. As a result, marketing expenses are not expected to increase in the same proportion to sales.Overhead costs for the year remained flat at $1.9 million. Largely non-recurring legal and professional fees increased mainly related to an increased use of legal firms during the year for capital raising events and restructuring activities. In contrast, the Company diligently drove down office and general costs by 5% and consulting and payroll expenses by 7%, demonstrating our commitment to efficiency and to creating value for Aires shareholders. American Aires Chief Financial Officer, Vitaliy Savitsky, commented: ""American Aires is a young high-growth company, so a lot of my focus has been on disciplining growth, measuring effectiveness of ad spend, and reducing costs. That strategy paid off tremendously in 2023 with its difficult year in the capital markets. Instead of losing ground, we focused on hitting adjusted EBITDA profitability and on growing sustainably. I'm very excited about scaling up the business in existing markets and expanding internationally in 2024 and beyond with this disciplined approach. That's our strategy and vision for further strengthening our industry leader status and delivering more shareholder value.""Detailed breakdown of preliminary, non-IFRS, unaudited figuresDue to the HUCK agreement being in effect since August 28, 2023 and for the entire Q4 2023, the Company realized the economic benefit from the sale of its products in the form of royalty and credit reimbursement rather than the typical formula of revenues less cost of goods sold (""COGS""), less advertising and promotion, less marketing and other expenses. As a result, accounting rules required revenues, COGS, advertising and promotion, marketing and certain other expenses to be allocated to HUCK during this period. The Company reported cash royalty income and credit reimbursement income for 2024 in the amounts of $283,427 and $197,183, respectively, or $480,610 combined. Management believes that the overall net income effect of the HUCK agreement on the Company's bottom line was negligible in 2024 as HUCK realized neither profit nor loss from the distribution partnership. However, to keep investors well informed and be able to compare results with prior years and future quarters, since the HUCK agreement was terminated as of January 1, 2024, the Company is pleased to provide certain relevant metrics on a combined basis, removing the effect of the HUCK agreement to demonstrate the true state of operations.

The company aims to preserve 690 hectares of tropical forest to combat climate change. However, Sigma Lithium faces non-compliance issues with Nasdaq due to delayed Form 40-F filing, impacting trading and management activities. Positive Expansion of Tropical Forest Conservation program to create a 'Conservation Belt Against Deforestation'. Acquisition of land 250km away to preserve 690 hectares of tropical forest. Efforts to combat climate change by protecting the Medio Vale Jequitinhonha region. Non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules due to delayed Form 40-F filing. Potential impact on trading activities and insider trading restrictions. Company's commitment to completing Annual Filings promptly to regain compliance. Negative Risk of adverse climate change impacts if the Conservation Belt is deforested. Negative repercussions on the company's stock performance due to Nasdaq non-compliance. Management and insider trading restrictions affecting business operations. Uncertainty regarding the completion timeline of the Annual Filings. Environmental Sustainability Analyst The expansion of Sigma Lithium's Atlantic Forest Conservation program demonstrates a strategic approach to environmental sustainability, particularly in the context of the company's carbon 'in-setting' initiatives. The acquisition of additional 350 hectares for conservation purposes not only contributes to the preservation of biodiversity but also serves as a compensatory measure for the environmental impact of the company's operations. The concept of 'in-setting' involves taking actions within a company's own supply chain or operational scope to reduce its carbon footprint, as opposed to 'offsetting' which typically involves investing in environmental projects elsewhere.By creating a 'Conservation Belt Against Deforestation,' Sigma Lithium is likely to enhance its corporate social responsibility profile, which can be attractive to investors who prioritize environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. However, the financial implications of land acquisition for conservation must be weighed against the potential benefits. Investors may seek clarity on how these initiatives align with the company's long-term financial goals and operational efficiency. Additionally, the conservation efforts may mitigate regulatory risks and enhance the company's reputation, potentially leading to a more favorable market position. Compliance & Risk Management Expert The notice from Nasdaq regarding Sigma Lithium's non-compliance due to the delayed filing of its annual report on Form 40-F is a matter of concern from a compliance and risk management perspective. The delayed filing could be indicative of underlying issues in the company's financial reporting processes, especially since this delay is attributed to the transition from non-operating to operating quarters following the start of commercial production. Investors may perceive this delay as a red flag, potentially impacting the stock's performance negatively in the short term.It is important to monitor the company's ability to meet the extended deadline to regain compliance. Failure to do so could result in further regulatory actions, including potential delisting. The imposed black-out period for management and other insiders prevents them from trading shares, which is a standard procedure to maintain market integrity but also signals to the market that internal stakeholders are temporarily restricted from capitalizing on their knowledge about the company's affairs, which could affect investor sentiment. Financial Analyst From a financial analysis standpoint, the delay in filing the Form 40-F by Sigma Lithium necessitates a closer examination of the company's financial health and operational performance. The transition to commercial production is a significant milestone for any company and the additional audit procedures suggest complexities in financial reporting. Investors should consider both the short-term implications of the delayed filing on stock performance and the potential long-term impact on the company's growth trajectory and profitability.While the conservation initiative may not have a direct financial impact, it is part of a broader trend where companies integrate sustainability into their business model to potentially reduce long-term operational risks and costs, such as those associated with environmental compliance. The long-term benefits of such initiatives may include stronger relationships with stakeholders, improved market positioning and potential access to capital from increasingly ESG-focused investors. 04/11/2024 - 07:30 PM EXPANDING TROPICAL FOREST CONSERVATION PROGRAM 250KM AWAY Sigma Lithium today announced an expansion in the Tropical Forest Conservation program, aimed to create a ""Conservation Belt Against Deforestation"" around the Medio Vale do Jequitinhonha by acquiring areas potentially at risk to be deforested to become cattle pastures. The Company's affiliates plan to acquire land in a region located 250km away from the Company, 100% within the tropical forest/ Atlantic Forest bioma. If the Conservation Belt were to be deforested, it would significantly increase adverse climate change impacts in the Medio Vale Jequitinhonha, which is already experiencing some of the higher temperatures in Brazil. The Conservation Belt represents an ""environmental protection of tropical forests"" encircling the Medio Vale do Jequitinhonha that currently alleviates the high temperatures already experienced by the semi-arid region. Aracuai and Itinga, the towns where the Company is located, are in the ""caatinga"" bioma (Brazilian semi-arid vegetation). Sigma Lithium (through one of its related parties) will add approximately 350 hectares of Atlantic Forest land to be preserved, in addition to the 340 hectares already preserved, totaling 690 hectares of equivalent to 7 km2 (square kilometers of tropical forest). This initiative is part of its environmental compensation program, whereby the Company compensates the ""caatinga"" (semi-arid, low bush-type vegetation) located around the Company with tropical forest located 250km away, to create a Conservation Belt against deforestation.DELAYED FILING OF FORM 40-F The Company has received a letter from Nasdaq, dated April 5, 2024 (the ""Letter""), stating that the Company is not in compliance with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules due to the delayed filing of its annual report on Form 40-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Form 40-F""). The Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company has 60 calendar days from the date of the Letter to file the annual report on Form 40-F or submit a plan to regain compliance.If the plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 40-F's due date, or until September 30, 2024. Management and other insiders of Sigma Lithium are subject to a black-out period and prohibited from trading, until the Company's Annual Filings are completed.SÃO PAULO, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SIGMA Lithium Corporation (""Sigma Lithium"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: SGML, TSXV: SGML, BVMF: S2GM34), a leading global lithium producer dedicated to powering the next generation of electric vehicles with carbon neutral, responsibly sourced lithium concentrate, today announced an expansion in the Atlantic Forest Conservation program, aimed to create a ""Conservation Belt Against Deforestation"" (""Conservation Belt"") around the Medio Vale do Jequitinhonha by acquiring areas potentially at risk to be deforested to become cattle pastures. The Company also announces that it has received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq""), dated April 5, 2024 (the ""Letter""), stating that the Company is not in compliance with certain Nasdaq Listing Rules due to the delayed filing of its annual report on Form 40-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the ""Form 40-F""). EXPANDING ATLANTIC FOREST CONSERVATION PROGRAM The Conservation Belt represents an ""environmental protection of tropical forests"" encircling the Medio Vale do Jequitinhonha that provides humidity and currently alleviates the high temperatures already experienced by the semi-arid region. Aracuai and Itinga, the towns where the Company is located, are in the ""caatinga"" bioma (Brazilian semi-arid vegetation). The Company's affiliates plan to acquire tropical forest land located in a region 250km away from Sigma Lithium, 100% within the Atlantic Forest bioma. If the Conservation Belt were to be suppressed, it would significantly increase adverse climate change impacts in the Medio Vale Jequitinhonha, already experiencing some of the higher temperatures in Brazil. Sigma Lithium (through one of its related parties) will add approximately 350 hectares of Atlantic Forest land to be preserved, in addition to the total of 340 hectares already preserved, as part of its carbon ""in-setting"" initiatives to decrease emissions and footprint in the region. This donation is the environmental compensation for future deforestation of ""caatinga"" (semi-arid low bush-type vegetation) around the Company. DELAYED FILING OF FORM 40-F In accordance with the requirements of the Nasdaq rules, the Company has received the Letter, stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) due to the delayed filing of its Form 40-F. The Letter has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Consistent with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), the Company has 60 calendar days from the date of the Letter to submit a plan to regain compliance and, if the plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the Form 40-F's due date, or until September 30, 2024, to regain compliance. Until the Company's annual information form, its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, the related management's discussion and analysis and the Form 40-F containing such documents (collectively, the ""Annual Filings"") are filed, management and other insiders of Sigma Lithium are subject to a black-out period and prohibited from trading. As the Company previously announced in its press release dated April 1, 2024, the delay in the Annual Filings is due to the additional audit procedures required because of the initiation of commercial production in early 2023 and the ensuing hybrid reporting of non-operating and operating quarters. The Company is making every effort, diligently and expeditiously with its auditors to complete the work necessary to finalize the 2023 audit of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company expects to file the Annual Filings before the end of April 2024 and will announce the date of the release of the Annual Filings in a subsequent press release.

Business Update Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary DHT Holdings, Inc. provides a business update for the first quarter of 2024, estimating time charter equivalent earnings for its fleet at $50,900 per day. The Company's VLCCs operating in the spot market earn $54,000 per day, while VLCCs on time-charter earn $39,500 per day. In the second quarter, 42% of spot days have been booked at $54,200 per day, and 54% of revenue days at $46,900 per day. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported time charter equivalent earnings of $50,900 per day for DHT Holdings' fleet, particularly the VLCCs, present an intriguing data point for market analysts. The differentiation between earnings from the spot market and time-charter provides insight into the company's revenue diversification and risk management strategies. Spot market earnings tend to be more volatile, reflecting the immediate supply and demand dynamics, while time-charter rates are usually fixed over a period and offer stability.Assessing the performance against industry benchmarks, one could infer that the average daily earnings, especially in the spot market, may indicate the company's competitive positioning and operational efficiency. The booking of 42% of available spot days at a higher rate in the second quarter signals a potential uptick in demand or strategic pricing maneuvers. The aggregate booking rate for the second quarter also suggests a robust forward-looking earning potential, which could be of interest to stakeholders monitoring the company's quarter-over-quarter performance. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the disclosed figures translate into a significant stream of revenue for DHT Holdings. The revenue days metric, representing the total number of days vessels were available for earning revenue, is key for understanding the utilization rate of the fleet. A high number of revenue days, particularly in the spot market, implies efficient asset use and can be a positive indicator for investors.Investors should also note that the advance booking of over half the available revenue days at a substantial rate indicates a strong forward revenue visibility. This could impact the company's stock price as it reflects investor confidence in the company's ability to secure and maintain profitable contracts. However, investors should also consider the inherent risks of the shipping industry, such as fluctuating oil prices, geopolitical tensions and regulatory changes, which can all affect charter rates and occupancy levels. Economist An economist might view the reported earnings in the context of the broader economic environment. The VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) market is closely tied to global economic activity and trade flows. High daily earnings can be indicative of strong global oil demand and trade, which in turn might be a sign of a robust economic landscape. Conversely, it could also point to a tight supply in shipping capacity, leading to higher charter rates.The fact that DHT Holdings has secured a significant portion of its second quarter's revenue days at favorable rates could be interpreted as a microeconomic indicator of sector strength.

VBI Vaccines Announces Closing of $2 Million Registered Direct Offering Priced At-the-Market Under Nasdaq Rules,2024-04-11T20:05:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"VBI Vaccines Inc. (VBIV) closes a registered direct offering, raising approximately $2 million. The offering included 2,272,728 common shares and warrants at $0.88 per share.

(VBIV) closes a registered direct offering, raising approximately $2 million. The offering included 2,272,728 common shares and warrants at $0.88 per share. The net proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of VBI Vaccines Inc.'s registered direct offering represents a strategic financial maneuver aimed at bolstering the company's working capital and supporting general corporate activities. With an offering price set at $0.88 per common share and associated warrant and an exercise price of $0.76 for each warrant, the transaction has yielded approximately $2 million in gross proceeds. This capital infusion is timely, as biopharmaceutical companies like VBI typically face significant research and development expenses alongside regulatory compliance costs.Considering the warrants are immediately exercisable and have a five-year validity, investors might view this as an opportunity for potential future equity at a predetermined price, which could be beneficial if the stock appreciates. However, the immediate dilution effect of the additional shares could exert downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. The alignment with Nasdaq rules and the involvement of H.C. Wainwright & Co. as the exclusive placement agent add a layer of credibility to the transaction.It is important to monitor how effectively VBI allocates the net proceeds towards its stated goals. Efficient use of these funds could lead to advancements in their product pipeline, which may positively influence the company's valuation in the long term. Biotech Market Analyst In the context of the biopharmaceutical industry, VBI Vaccines Inc.'s recent capital raise through a registered direct offering can be seen as a strategic step to maintain liquidity and fund ongoing operations. This is a common practice among biotech companies, especially those in the stages of clinical development or seeking to expand their research capabilities.The biotech sector is highly capital-intensive, with a long lead time to profitability due to the extended periods of research, development and clinical trials required before a product can reach the market. The gross proceeds of $2 million, before fees and expenses, may seem modest in comparison to the industry's typical capital requirements. Therefore, the impact of this capital raise on VBI's business operations and research endeavors should be critically assessed in subsequent financial and operational updates.Investors and analysts should also consider the industry's competitive landscape and VBI's position within it. Any progress in their vaccine development programs, potentially funded by this offering, could be a catalyst for future growth. However, the biotech market is highly volatile and sensitive to both clinical trial outcomes and regulatory developments, which must be factored into any analysis of VBI's financial strategy and its implications for the company's stock performance. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- VBI Vaccines Inc. (Nasdaq: VBIV) (VBI), a biopharmaceutical company driven by immunology in the pursuit of powerful prevention and treatment of disease, today announced the closing of its previously announced registered direct offering priced at-the-market under Nasdaq rules of 2,272,728 of its common shares and warrants to purchase up to 2,272,728 common shares, at an offering price of $0.88 per common share and associated warrant. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.76 per share, are exercisable on the date of issuance, and will expire five years following the date of issuance. H.C. Wainwright & Co. acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering. The gross proceeds to VBI from this offering were approximately $2 million, before deducting the placement agent’s fees and other offering expenses.

The property is newly constructed and under a long-term net lease.","FCPT Announces Acquisition of a Banfield Pet Hospital for $2.4 Million Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) acquires Banfield Pet Hospital property for $2.4 million, located in Iowa with a 7.3% cap rate. The property is newly constructed and under a long-term net lease. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Investment Analyst The acquisition of a newly constructed Banfield Pet Hospital property by Four Corners Property Trust (FCPT) represents a strategic addition to their portfolio, particularly given the property's placement in a robust retail corridor. The purchase price of $2.4 million, at a 7.3% capitalization rate, is indicative of the yield FCPT expects from this investment. This rate is slightly above the national average for net lease retail properties, which suggests FCPT is confident in the property's long-term performance.Investors should note that the net lease structure typically involves tenants covering most of the property expenses, which can lead to a more predictable income stream for the REIT. The 10-year lease term with Banfield, a well-established veterinary clinic chain, adds a layer of security to the investment. However, it's important to consider the inherent risks of single-tenant properties, such as tenant solvency and market changes impacting the demand for veterinary services. Veterinary Industry Analyst The veterinary care industry has shown resilience and growth, partly due to increased pet ownership and expenditure on pet care. Banfield Pet Hospital, as a national brand, benefits from this trend, which in turn provides FCPT with a tenant that has a strong customer base. The location within a strong retail corridor could leverage high traffic and visibility, potentially driving up the property's value and securing its revenue potential.Long-term trends in the pet care industry, such as the rise of pet health insurance and technological advancements in veterinary medicine, could further solidify the importance of such an investment for FCPT. While the investment appears sound, it is essential to monitor the broader economic factors that could influence consumer spending on pet healthcare. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM MILL VALLEY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE:FCPT), a real estate investment trust primarily engaged in the ownership and acquisition of high-quality, net-leased restaurant and retail properties (“FCPT” or the “Company”), is pleased to announce the acquisition of a Banfield Pet Hospital property for $2.4 million. The property is newly constructed and located in a strong retail corridor in Iowa under a long term, net lease with approximately 10 years of term remaining.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary Argan, Inc. (AGX) announces financial results for Q4 and fiscal year 2024, with revenues reaching $573.3 million, a 26% increase. The company declares a regular quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share. Net income for the year was $32.4 million, a slight decrease from the previous year. EBITDA rose by 7% to $51.3 million. Cash dividends per share increased to $1.10. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report from Argan, Inc. reveals a mixed financial landscape. The company's revenue growth is notable, with a 26% year-over-year increase, signaling a strong market demand for their services. However, the decline in gross margin percentage from 19.0% to 14.1% raises concerns about potential increases in cost of goods sold or pricing pressures. This contraction could indicate a less favorable cost structure or a competitive pricing environment that warrants investor attention.Another point of interest is the slight decrease in net income despite the rise in revenues. This divergence often suggests rising operational costs or one-time expenses that have not been offset by the revenue growth. The increase in EBITDA is positive, but it's essential to understand what is driving this metric up, considering the net income dip. The increase in cash dividends per share from $0.25 to $0.30, alongside a modest increase in diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year, indicates a confidence in the company's liquidity and a commitment to shareholder return, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. Market Research Analyst Looking at the industry context, Argan, Inc.'s project backlog is a critical indicator of future revenue potential. A decrease in project backlog from $822 million to $757 million could be a sign of slowing demand or increased competition in their market sector. It's important to consider the company's backlog in relation to its revenue growth—while revenues have grown, a shrinking backlog may suggest challenges in sustaining this growth long-term.The company's net liquidity increase is modest but positive, suggesting a stable financial position for handling short-term obligations. The strategic move to increase the cash dividends could be aimed at signaling financial stability and rewarding shareholders despite a competitive or cost-intensive market environment. Economist From an economic perspective, the financial results of Argan, Inc. must be evaluated against broader economic conditions, including inflation rates, interest rates and industry-specific trends. The gross margin compression could be reflective of broader economic pressures such as increased labor or material costs. The company's ability to pass these costs onto customers without affecting demand is important for maintaining profitability.The increase in cash and investments by approximately $87 million is a strong liquidity indicator, which provides the company with a buffer in an uncertain economic climate. This financial cushion could support strategic investments or weather potential economic downturns. However, the decline in net income and gross profit year-over-year, despite revenue growth, could be a warning sign of inefficiencies or market saturation that may require strategic adjustments. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Declares Regular Quarterly Dividend of $0.30 Per Share ROCKVILLE, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Argan, Inc. (NYSE: AGX) (“Argan” or the “Company”) today announces financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The Company will host an investor conference call today, April 11, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET. Consolidated Financial Highlights ($ in thousands, except per share data) January 31, For the Quarter Ended: 2024 2023 Change Revenues $ 164,554 $ 118,778 $ 45,776 Gross profit 23,633 20,028 3,605 Gross margin % 14.4 % 16.9 % (2.5 )% Net income attributable to the stockholders of the Company $ 12,018 $ 13,633 $ (1,615 ) Diluted per share 0.89 1.00 (0.11 ) EBITDA attributable to the stockholders of the Company 17,564 11,227 6,337 Cash dividends per share 0.30 0.25 0.05 January 31, For the Fiscal Year Ended: 2024 2023 Change Revenues $ 573,333 $ 455,040 $ 118,293 Gross profit 80,834 86,361 (5,527 ) Gross margin % 14.1 % 19.0 % (4.9 )% Net income attributable to the stockholders of the Company $ 32,358 $ 33,098 $ (740 ) Diluted per share 2.39 2.33 0.06 EBITDA attributable to the stockholders of the Company 51,338 48,109 3,229 Cash dividends per share 1.10 1.00 0.10 January 31, As of: 2024 2023 Change Cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 412,405 $ 325,458 $ 86,947 Net liquidity (1) 244,919 236,199 8,720 Share repurchase treasury stock, at cost 97,528 88,641 8,887 Project backlog 757,000 822,000 (65,000 ) (1) Net liquidity, or working capital, is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities. David Watson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Argan, commented, “Our solid fourth quarter performance closed out a strong fiscal 2024 for our Company, highlighted by a 26% increase in consolidated revenues to $573.3 million and a 7% increase in annual EBITDA to $51.3 million. Fourth quarter 2024 project backlog grew to $757.0 million sequentially, as compared to backlog of $730.0 million at the close of the third quarter. Backlog levels have remained relatively consistent since fiscal 2022 despite significant revenue growth in the same timeframe. We are energized about the opportunities we’re seeing in the market and our growing project pipeline, which includes several contracts secured after year-end for renewable, natural gas-fired and industrial projects that are in various stages of development and are expected to begin this year. The demand for reliable energy resources is only increasing as the power grid meets the needs of an expanding installed base of data centers, as the increased adoption of EVs and their charging requirements drives energy consumption, and as renewable power solutions require back-up sources. Argan’s capabilities and expertise are suited to the construction and support of all types of energy facilities, and with our established reputation as a proven partner, we’re excited about the marketplace interest we are seeing for our services.” “While our fiscal 2024 results were strong, as we’ve previously discussed, our international subsidiary, Atlantic Projects Company (“APC”), was impacted during the year by operational and contractual challenges related to its Kilroot Power Station project in Northern Ireland (the “Kilroot” project). As a result of these challenges, during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 we recorded loss amounts of approximately $2.1 million and $13.6 million, respectively, associated with the Kilroot project. APC has substantially completed the scope of their work and turned over one of the two power units to the owner, which achieved first fire in March. We’ve identified and submitted claims in excess of the amount of our recorded loss and will vigorously pursue those claims.” “Our progress during fiscal 2024 illustrates the underlying strength of our business as we continue to grow our solid reputation as a full-service construction and project management partner with extensive capabilities for the support of both traditional and renewable power facilities as well as industrial projects. As we move through fiscal 2025, we’re focused on leveraging our strong reputation to continue to capitalize on the opportunities we’re seeing.” Fourth Quarter Results Consolidated revenues for the quarter ended January 31, 2024 were $164.6 million, an increase of $45.8 million, or 38.5%, from consolidated revenues of $118.8 million reported for the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced increased revenues at several projects, including the Shannonbridge Power Project; the Trumbull Energy Center, a large combined cycle, gas-fired power plant under construction near Lordstown, Ohio; and the three ESB FlexGen Peaker Plants being built in Dublin, Ireland. The increase in revenues was partially offset by decreased revenues at the Guernsey Power Station and Kilroot project as the projects were at or near completion during the current quarter. For the quarter ended January 31, 2024, Argan’s consolidated gross profit was approximately $23.6 million, or 14.4% of consolidated revenues, reflecting positive contributions across all three reportable business segments. However, the consolidated gross profit for the quarter was adversely impacted by the loss related to the Kilroot project. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended January 31, 2023 was $20.0 million, or 16.9% of consolidated revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.4 million, to $11.9 million for the quarter ended January 31, 2024, from $10.5 million in the comparable prior year period. However, as a percentage of revenues, these expenses declined to 7.2% from 8.8% between the same periods. Other income increased by $2.8 million primarily due to the favorable effects of increased interest rates on the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and investments. During the quarter ended January 31, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of $5.0 million primarily due to consolidated pre-tax book income of $17.0 million. For the comparable period last year, Argan recorded an income tax benefit of $3.2 million on consolidated pre-tax book income of $12.0 million, primarily due to the favorable recognition of tax benefits related to research and development credits. For the quarter ended January 31, 2024, Argan achieved net income of $12.0 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to $13.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for last year’s comparable quarter. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) for the quarter ended January 31, 2024 increased to $17.6 million compared to $11.2 million in the same period of last year. Fiscal Year 2024 Results Power Industry Services Revenues from the power industry services business increased by 20.3%, or $70.2 million, to $416.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2024 (“Fiscal 2024”) compared with revenues of $346.0 million for the year ended January 31, 2023 (“Fiscal 2023”), largely due to an increase in construction activities at the Trumbull Energy Center, the Shannonbridge Power Project, the ESB FlexGen Peaker Plants and the Midwest Solar and Battery Projects. The revenues increase was partially offset by decreased construction activities associated with the Guernsey Power Station project, the Maple Hill Solar facility and the Equinix data center project, as those projects are generally near or at completion. Revenues from power industry services represented approximately 72.6% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024. The project backlog amounts for the power industry services reportable segment as of January 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. Industrial Construction Services Revenues from industrial construction services increased by $50.0 million, or 53.9%, to $142.8 million for Fiscal 2024 compared with revenues of $92.8 million for Fiscal 2023, and represented approximately 24.9% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024 and 20.4% of consolidated revenues for the prior fiscal year. The Company’s focused business development efforts in a growing regional business environment have led to new customer project awards and an expansion of larger initiatives, with the industrial construction services segment increasing its revenues while maintaining its project backlog at $127.5 million as of January 31, 2024 as compared to $123.5 million as of January 31, 2023. Consolidated Operating Results Consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2024 were $573.3 million, which represented an increase of $118.3 million, or 26.0%, from consolidated revenues of $455.0 million reported for Fiscal 2023. For Fiscal 2024, the Company reported a consolidated gross profit of approximately $80.8 million, which represented a gross profit percentage of approximately 14.1% of corresponding consolidated revenues. The gross profit for Fiscal 2024 primarily reflected the profit contributions of efficient construction activities related to the major projects of the power industry services reporting segment, which was adversely impacted by the loss recorded in Fiscal 2024 related to the Kilroot project. The gross profit percentages of corresponding revenues for the power industry services, industrial construction services and telecommunications infrastructure services segments for Fiscal 2024 were 14.1%, 12.9% and 26.5%, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $44.4 million and $44.7 million for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively, representing 7.7% and 9.8% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively. For Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, the amounts of other income, net, were $12.5 million and $4.3 million, respectively, representing an increase of 188.0% that was primarily due to meaningful increases in investment yields and average balances of invested funds between periods. The Company recorded income tax expense of $16.6 million for Fiscal 2024, primarily due to consolidated pre-tax book income in the amount of $48.9 million. For Fiscal 2023, consolidated pre-tax book income was $46.0 million and the income tax expense was $11.3 million. For Fiscal 2024, Argan reported net income of $32.4 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $33.1 million, or $2.33 per diluted share, for the prior fiscal year. EBITDA for Fiscal 2024 increased to $51.3 million from $48.1 million for the prior fiscal year. The Company paid its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share in January 2024. As of January 31, 2024, cash and liquid investments totaled $412.4 million and balance sheet net liquidity was $244.9 million; furthermore, the Company had no debt. Dividend Declaration and Share Repurchase Program On April 10, 2024, the Argan Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock, payable April 30, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 22, 2024. The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by 20% from $0.25 to $0.30 per share of common stock in October 2023 and paid a total of $1.10 per common stock share during Fiscal 2024. During Fiscal 2023, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.25 per common stock share for a total of $1.00 per share. During Fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased 303,160 shares of common stock at a cost of $12.5 million, including the repurchase of 90,719 shares of common stock at a cost of $4.0 million during the three months ended January 31, 2024.

The Reverse Split aims to boost the price per share by approximately fifty times, with the Class A ordinary shares trading on a split-adjusted basis.

ANNOUNCES 1 FOR 50 REVERSE SHARE SPLIT Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary NFT (NYSE American: MI) announces a 1 for 50 reverse split of its Class A and Class B ordinary shares, effective around April 12, 2024. The Reverse Split aims to boost the price per share by approximately fifty times, with the Class A ordinary shares trading on a split-adjusted basis. NFT's Articles and Memorandum of Association were amended in connection with the Reverse Split. Shareholders will receive new ordinary shares in exchange for their existing shares, and stock options, restricted shares, and equity incentive plans will be adjusted accordingly. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a reverse stock split by NFT Ltd. is a significant event that warrants a detailed financial analysis. A reverse split is typically employed by companies seeking to boost their stock price, often to maintain compliance with exchange listing requirements or to appear more attractive to investors. In this case, a 1 for 50 ratio is quite substantial, which indicates that the company is attempting a dramatic adjustment to its stock's market perception.From a financial perspective, the reverse split does not inherently change the company's market capitalization, as it is a cosmetic change. However, it can have psychological effects on the market, potentially making the stock more appealing to institutional investors who may shy away from lower-priced shares. Additionally, the reduction in the number of shares outstanding could lead to increased volatility due to a lower float. Investors should monitor the stock's liquidity and the potential impact on its bid-ask spread post-split.It is also important to consider the implications for stock options and restricted shares. The proportional adjustment ensures that the value of these instruments is maintained, but the higher post-split price could affect the liquidity and marketability of these options. Investors holding options should re-evaluate their strategies in light of the new exercise prices and share quantities. Market Research Analyst Examining the reverse stock split by NFT Ltd. from a market research standpoint, it is essential to assess the historical performance and general sentiment towards reverse splits. Historically, reverse splits have been met with mixed reactions. Some investors view them as red flags, suggesting a company's underlying issues, while others see them as a company's commitment to improving its stock's standing in the market.The market's reception to NFT Ltd.'s reverse split will largely depend on the company's communication strategy and the subsequent performance of the stock. If the stock price fails to maintain the expected post-split levels, it could lead to a negative perception and a sell-off. Conversely, if the price stabilizes or increases, it might restore investor confidence. Market research should focus on comparable cases and industry trends to forecast potential outcomes for NFT Ltd.An additional point to consider is the impact on index inclusion. Stocks trading below certain thresholds may be excluded from major indices and by increasing their share price, NFT Ltd. is potentially positioning itself to meet these criteria, which could result in increased demand for the shares from index funds and ETFs. Legal Expert From a legal standpoint, the reverse stock split by NFT Ltd. involves several regulatory and compliance considerations. The company must have obtained shareholder approval for such a move, as indicated in the announcement. This process involves disclosure requirements and a vote at a shareholder meeting.Post-split, the company must adhere to the updated Articles and Memorandum of Association, reflecting the new share structure. This change in the fundamental corporate documents must be filed with the appropriate regulatory bodies and communicated to shareholders.Additionally, the treatment of fractional shares, which will be rounded up to the nearest whole share, must be handled in a way that is fair and equitable to all shareholders. The issuance of new share certificates and the role of the transfer agent are also critical, as they must ensure a seamless transition for shareholders' holdings. The legal team must oversee the entire process to avoid any potential disputes or regulatory issues that could arise from an improperly managed reverse split. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM Hong Kong, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NFT Ltd. (NYSE American: MI) (""Company"" or ""NFT"", formerly known as Takung Art Co., Ltd.), as an emerging online trading platform operator of international art and collectibles today announced that a 1 for 50 reverse split of its Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares was approved by the Company's shareholders on March 18, 2024 and is expected to become effective on or around April 12, 2024 (the “Reverse Split”). Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Split, NFT shareholders will receive one new ordinary share of NFT for every fifty shares they hold. NFT’s Class A ordinary shares are expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on April 12, 2024. The Reverse Split is expected to lead NFT’s Class A ordinary shares to trade at approximately fifty times the price per share at which it trades prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Split. NFT, however, cannot assure that the price of its Class A ordinary shares after the Reverse Split will reflect the 1 for 50 Reverse Split ratio, that the price per share following the effective time of the Reverse Split will be maintained for any period of time, or that the price will remain above the pre-split trading price. NFT's Articles and Memorandum of Association was amended and restated in connection with the Reverse Split. As of April 11, 2024, there were approximately 154.5 million of NFT's Class A ordinary shares outstanding. Effecting the Reverse Split will reduce that amount to approximately 3.09 million Class A ordinary shares outstanding. Treatment of Stock Options and Restricted Shares The number of ordinary shares into which NFT's outstanding stock options and restricted shares as well as the options' relevant exercise price per share will be proportionally adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split. The number of shares authorized for issuance under NFT's equity incentive plans will also be proportionally reduced to reflect the Reverse Split. Fractional Shares Any fractional shares that would have resulted because of the Reverse Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. New Ordinary Share Certificates NFT will adopt a new share certificate in connection with the implementation of the reverse share split. NFT's transfer agent, VStock Transfer LLC, will manage the exchange of share certificates. Shareholders of record will receive a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of their old certificates as soon as practicable following the effectiveness of the Reverse Split. Shareholders should not send in their old stock certificates until they receive a letter of transmittal from VStock Transfer LLC. Shareholders who hold their shares through a securities broker or nominee (i.e., in ""street name"") will be contacted by their brokers or nominees with any instructions. For more information, shareholders and securities brokers should contact VStock Transfer LLC at 212-828-8436.

Positive Blue Owl Capital Inc. successfully priced $750,000,000 of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2034. The notes will be fully guaranteed by various entities under Blue Owl. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay outstanding borrowings and for general corporate purposes. Blue Owl intends to potentially use the remaining net proceeds for strategic acquisitions or growth initiatives. The offering is subject to customary closing conditions and will target qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons. The Company plans to enter into a registration rights agreement for the notes. The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of $750,000,000 of 6.250% Senior Notes due 2034 by Blue Owl Capital Inc. is a significant move in terms of corporate financing. This action suggests a strategic approach to capital structure management, where the company is taking advantage of the current interest rate environment to lock in long-term financing at a fixed rate. The decision to use the proceeds to repay existing debt under their revolving credit facility indicates a focus on reducing short-term liabilities and interest expenses, which could improve the company's balance sheet and financial ratios such as the debt-to-equity ratio and interest coverage ratio.Furthermore, the earmarking of funds for potential strategic acquisitions or growth initiatives indicates an expansionary strategy. Investors should monitor the deployment of these funds as successful acquisitions can lead to revenue growth and increased market share, while unsuccessful ones can become a financial burden. The use of a registration rights agreement is also noteworthy as it could potentially increase the future liquidity of the notes, making them more attractive to institutional investors. Legal Expert Blue Owl Capital's decision to offer the notes under Rule 144A and Regulation S is a common practice for private placements to qualified institutional buyers and non-U.S. persons, respectively. These regulations allow the company to raise capital without the need for a public offering, which can be a faster and less costly process. However, it's important to note that these notes will be subject to restrictions on resale, limiting their marketability to certain investor types.The lack of registration under the Securities Act means that the company is not subject to the same level of disclosure and regulatory oversight as it would be in a public offering. While this can be beneficial for the company in terms of flexibility and confidentiality, it requires investors to conduct thorough due diligence. The planned future exchange offer under a registration statement could alleviate some of these concerns by providing additional protections and disclosures to note holders. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the offering of senior notes by Blue Owl Capital Inc. can be seen as a reflection of investor confidence in the company's ability to service its debt. The 6.250% interest rate is a key figure to compare against current market rates for similar maturities and credit ratings. If this rate is competitive, it can indicate a strong market position and creditworthiness.Investors should also consider the broader economic context, such as interest rate trends and the credit cycle, which can affect the cost of borrowing and the demand for such debt instruments. The timing of this offering could be strategic, aimed at capitalizing on market conditions before any anticipated shifts in the interest rate environment. The impact on the stock market will largely depend on how the proceeds are used to generate value and the market's perception of the company's growth prospects and risk profile. 04/11/2024 - 04:07 PM NEW YORK, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Blue Owl Capital Inc.

AAR signs extension and expansion of V2500 engine component distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products,2024-04-11T20:05:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"AAR Corp. (NYSE: AIR) extends and expands its distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co.,  for V2500 engine components, aiming to simplify the supply chain and enhance global support for operators and repair facilities.","AAR signs extension and expansion of V2500 engine component distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary AAR Corp. (NYSE: AIR) extends and expands its distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., for V2500 engine components, aiming to simplify the supply chain and enhance global support for operators and repair facilities. Positive None. Negative None. Supply Chain Analyst The extension and expansion of AAR CORP.’s distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. (SPP) for V2500 engine components represents a strategic move that could potentially strengthen AAR’s position in the aviation supply chain. By securing an exclusive agreement, AAR ensures a steady revenue stream from the distribution of these specific components. Moreover, the expansion to include all starter/valve subcomponents may improve economies of scale, leading to better cost management and possibly increased margins.From a supply chain perspective, the inclusion of global piece part support and 24/7 AOG (Aircraft on Ground) support could enhance AAR's customer service and responsiveness. This might lead to improved customer retention and attract new business, particularly from operators seeking reliable parts distribution with shorter lead times. However, the success of this initiative largely depends on AAR's ability to manage logistics efficiently across its global stocking locations. Aerospace Market Analyst The aerospace components market is highly competitive, with a focus on reliability and timely delivery. AAR's exclusive distributorship for the V2500 engine components could position the company as a key player in this niche market. Considering the V2500 engine is widely used in commercial aviation, this agreement might open up significant sales opportunities for AAR.However, it is important to monitor how this exclusive arrangement impacts AAR's relationships with other manufacturers and the broader market. While exclusivity can be advantageous, it may also limit AAR's flexibility in partnerships and could potentially alienate other suppliers. Investors should keep an eye on AAR's quarterly financials to assess the real impact of this agreement on sales growth and market share within the aerospace components sector. Financial Analyst Investors will likely view the announcement of AAR's contract extension and expansion with SPP as a positive development, given the potential for increased revenue and market share. The long-term nature of the agreement provides a predictable income source that could be favorable for AAR's financial stability. It is also indicative of AAR's ability to maintain and grow strategic partnerships within the industry.However, the specifics of the contract, such as the financial terms and expected volume of sales, are important for a complete financial analysis. Without this information, it is challenging to estimate the precise impact on AAR's bottom line. Investors should look for follow-up announcements or details in future earnings reports to better understand the financial implications of this deal. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM WOOD DALE, Ill., April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AAR CORP. (NYSE: AIR), a leading provider of aviation services to commercial and government operators, MROs, and OEMs, has signed an extension and expansion of its V2500 engine component distribution agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. (SPP). Under the agreement, AAR has extended its exclusive agreement to distribute the V2500 pneumatic starter and starter control valve on behalf of SPP for the life of the program. The contract also expands AAR's exclusive distributorship with the addition of all V2500 starter/valve subcomponents. ""AAR is proud to expand and extend our support of Sumitomo Precision Products on this critical engine component,"" said Paige Immordino, AAR's Vice President of Distribution – Commercial.

Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported monthly and quarterly volumes are critical indicators of market activity and liquidity, which can influence investor sentiment and trading strategies. Higher trading volumes typically suggest a robust trading environment, which may positively affect Nasdaq's transaction-based revenues. On the other hand, if volumes are lower than the industry average or previous periods, this could signal a slowdown and potentially impact Nasdaq's financial performance.Furthermore, the estimated revenue capture provides insights into the company's efficiency in converting trading volumes into revenues. This metric is particularly important for assessing the company's pricing power and competitive positioning within the exchange industry. An increase in revenue capture could indicate a strong value proposition to traders, whereas a decline might suggest increased competition or pricing pressures. Financial Analyst When analyzing the number of listings, it's essential to consider both the quantity and quality of companies joining Nasdaq. An increase in listings often reflects the exchange's attractiveness to new companies and can lead to higher listing fees and enhanced market prestige. The types of companies listing can also matter; for instance, a surge in tech listings might attract a different investor base compared to biotech firms.Lastly, index statistics are vital for understanding broader market trends and the performance of Nasdaq's proprietary indices. Strong performance can attract index-following investments and enhance the exchange's brand as a benchmark provider. Conversely, underperformance may lead to reduced index licensing revenues and could reflect broader market challenges. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM NEW YORK, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today reported monthly volumes for March 2024, as well as quarterly volumes, estimated revenue capture, number of listings, and index statistics for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 on its investor relations website.

Zink attributed the success to strategic investments in both brands, focusing on modernizing Good Times and enhancing operational efficiency at Bad Daddy’s. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported sales data for Good Times Restaurants Inc. provides insight into the company's current operational performance. A 0.9% increase in same store sales for the Good Times brand, though modest, indicates resilience and positive customer reception amidst challenging conditions. Conversely, the 3.2% decrease for Bad Daddy's reflects ongoing struggles within the casual dining sector, possibly due to shifting consumer preferences or heightened competition.From a market perspective, the differentiation in performance between the two brands could suggest a need for distinct strategic approaches. The average weekly sales figures, $27,133 for Good Times and $50,880 for Bad Daddy’s, highlight the higher revenue-generating capability of Bad Daddy's despite its same store sales decline. This dichotomy may point to higher price points or a more robust customer base at Bad Daddy's locations.Investors might view the capital investments and operational changes mentioned as a proactive approach to reinvigorate the brands, which could potentially lead to improved long-term performance. However, the immediate financial impact of these investments should be monitored closely for their return on investment. Financial Analyst Good Times Restaurants Inc.'s quarterly performance has implications for shareholder value. The positive same store sales growth for the Good Times brand, albeit slight, is a favorable sign, especially against the backdrop of adverse weather conditions. This resilience could translate to a stable revenue stream. The reported sequential improvement at Bad Daddy’s, despite a year-over-year decline, may indicate a recovery trajectory, which could have positive implications for future earnings.It is important to analyze the cost structure associated with the reported capital investments and operational changes. If these initiatives lead to significant improvements in guest experience and operational efficiency, they could result in margin expansion and enhanced profitability over time. However, if the costs outweigh the benefits, it could lead to margin compression.Investors will likely scrutinize the next few quarters to assess whether the strategic changes implemented will lead to sustained growth or if they are simply a short-term fix. The company's ability to adapt to market trends and consumer demands, while managing costs, will be critical in determining its financial health and stock performance. Consumer Behavior Analyst The contrasting sales trends between Good Times Restaurants Inc.'s brands could reflect broader consumer behavior shifts. The Good Times brand's growth, despite unfavorable weather, suggests a loyal customer base and an effective value proposition that resonates with its target market. In contrast, the decline at Bad Daddy's might indicate that consumers are becoming more selective or that there are external pressures, such as economic factors or alternative dining options, influencing their dining habits.The observed pattern of a weak January followed by a strong March could be indicative of consumer spending cycles or the impact of specific marketing campaigns. Understanding these patterns is important for aligning marketing strategies with consumer expectations and demand.It's also noteworthy that the company attributes part of its performance to operational changes aimed at fostering an 'ownership mindset' and enhancing guest experiences. This acknowledgment underscores the importance of customer service quality in driving sales and suggests that the company is investing in areas that could positively influence consumer satisfaction and repeat business. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM GOLDEN, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Good Times Restaurants Inc. (Nasdaq: GTIM), operator of Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar and Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard, today announced that same store sales1 increased 0.9% for its Good Times brand and decreased 3.2% for its Bad Daddy’s brand compared to the same prior-year fiscal quarter and average weekly sales2 were $27,133 and $50,880 for its Good Times and Bad Daddy’s brands, respectively, for its second fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2024. Ryan Zink, President and CEO, said “The strength of our Good Times brand is clearly evident from this quarter’s sales performance. Our Colorado-based brand delivered positive same store sales despite significantly unfavorable weather during the quarter.” “The sequential improvement in Bad Daddy’s same store sales is encouraging, with same store declines nearly half of what we saw in the first fiscal quarter. The more impressive trend is that, like many in the casual dining space, we saw a weak January but this was then offset by improving trends throughout the quarter, with a particularly strong March in spite of our Colorado Bad Daddy’s being affected by the same unfavorable weather impacting our Good Times brand.” Zink continued. Mr. Zink concluded, “I believe that the top line results this quarter demonstrate the success of our strategies at both concepts, including meaningful capital investments at Good Times to freshen and modernize that brand, and the operational changes at Bad Daddy’s driving a greater ownership mindset and ultimately improved hospitality and guest experience.” About Good Times Restaurants Inc.: Good Times Restaurants Inc. owns, operates, and licenses 41 Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar restaurants through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar is a full-service “small box” restaurant concept featuring a chef-driven menu of gourmet signature burgers, chopped salads, appetizers and sandwiches with a full bar and a focus on a selection of local and craft beers in a high-energy atmosphere that appeals to a broad consumer base.

The company strengthened its balance sheet with $160 million in asset sales and financing transactions. Operational highlights include an LOI with a US-based hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease and progress in restoring Ellendale's capacity. Despite challenges from outages, the HPC and Cloud Services sectors show growth. Positive None. Negative Net loss for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was $62.8 million, compared to $7.3 million in the fiscal third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was a loss of $2.3 million, compared to $0.9 million in the fiscal third quarter 2023. Adjusted net loss for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was $28.9 million, compared to $1.4 million in the fiscal third quarter 2023. The Company experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during the nine months ended February 29, 2024, of $2.6 million. The increase in cost of revenues in the fiscal third quarter 2024 was due to higher energy costs and increases in depreciation and amortization expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the fiscal third quarter 2024 increased due to higher depreciation and amortization expenses and lease expenses. The Ellendale facility experienced a power outage starting in January, impacting operations and financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $4.8 million of expenses associated with facilities not yet generating revenue. Adjusted net loss was negatively impacted by $15.6 million of expenses associated with facilities and equipment not yet generating revenue. Financial Analyst The reported financial results of Applied Digital Corporation for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 indicate a significant year-over-year revenue increase, which is a positive signal for investors and analysts monitoring the company's growth trajectory. However, the reported Adjusted EBITDA loss and net loss for the quarter reflect operational challenges, such as the power outages at the Ellendale facility, which have affected profitability. The EBITDA loss, in particular, signals that the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are not covering operational costs, which could be a concern for cash flow management in the short term.The company's strategic decision to divest non-core assets, such as the Garden City Facility and the announcement of asset sales and financing transactions worth $160 million, are indicative of a proactive approach to strengthening the balance sheet. This could be interpreted as a positive move towards improving financial stability and focusing on core growth areas. The exclusivity and LOI with a US-based hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease is a significant development, potentially providing a stable and long-term revenue stream. Investors should closely monitor the finalization of this deal as it could substantially impact future earnings and validate the company's growth strategy.It is important to note that the company's increased selling, general and administrative expenses, which are not directly tied to revenue generation, may raise concerns over cost control. As Applied Digital continues to scale, the effective management of these costs will be critical to maintaining profitability. In the long term, the company's focus on high-performance computing and cloud services is aligned with industry trends towards increased demand for computational power, suggesting potential for growth if operational challenges can be mitigated. Market Research Analyst The datacenter hosting and cloud services industries are experiencing a surge in demand due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence, machine learning and other high-performance computing applications. Applied Digital's focus on these sectors positions it to capitalize on this trend. The company's fiscal third-quarter results demonstrate robust revenue growth, a signal of increasing market share and successful capacity expansion. However, the high costs associated with bringing new facilities online and the impact of operational setbacks, such as the power outage in Ellendale, have placed a strain on profitability.Investors should consider the company's long-term prospects, given its strategic investments in HPC datacenter hosting. The construction of the 100 MW facility in Ellendale and the potential 400 MW capacity lease with a hyperscaler could provide Applied Digital with a competitive edge in the HPC hosting market. The emphasis on ultra-low-cost and efficient liquid-cooled infrastructure for HPC applications is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the industry's need for cost-effective and sustainable datacenter solutions.The operational update suggests that Applied Digital is on track to restore capacity at the Ellendale facility, which is important for meeting existing and future demand. The market's response to these developments will be telling, as investors weigh the immediate financial losses against the potential for substantial growth and market penetration. The company's ability to secure project-level financing for the investment-grade tenant will be a key factor in determining its financial health and ability to execute on its growth strategy. Energy Industry Analyst The energy requirements of datacenter hosting and cloud services are substantial and Applied Digital's increased energy costs reflect the scaling of operations. The reported power outage at the Ellendale facility and the subsequent need to replace transformers highlight the critical nature of reliable energy infrastructure for datacenter operations. The company's proactive measures to procure industry-standard transformers from North American manufacturers is a step towards ensuring operational reliability and may also resonate positively with stakeholders concerned about supply chain risks and energy sustainability.Given the high energy consumption of datacenters, Applied Digital's focus on highly efficient liquid-cooled infrastructure is a strategic move. Liquid cooling is becoming an industry norm for HPC applications due to its efficiency in heat management, which can lead to reduced energy costs and improved sustainability. As the company continues to recover from the power outage and aims to operate at 65%-75% capacity by the end of May, the efficiency of its cooling infrastructure will be a key determinant of long-term operational costs and environmental impact.The company's financial performance is closely tied to its energy strategy and the industry is watching how Applied Digital manages its energy consumption and costs amid growing demand for HPC and cloud services. The potential lease agreement with a hyperscaler also suggests that Applied Digital's energy solutions are attractive to major players in the industry, which could lead to further business opportunities and partnerships. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM DALLAS, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Applied Digital Corporation (Nasdaq: APLD) (""Applied Digital"" or the ""Company""), a designer, builder, and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure designed for High-Performance Computing (“HPC”) applications, cloud services (“Cloud services”), and datacenter hosting (“Datacenter hosting”), reported financial results for the fiscal third quarter ended February 29, 2024. The Company also provided an operational update. Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights Total revenue of $43.3 millionAdjusted EBITDA loss of $2.3 millionDespite the considerable challenges from the outages at Ellendale, our HPC and Cloud Services sectors continue to make strides with additional clusters deployed, and we continue to make progress in our Ellendale HPC facility construction. Post-Quarter Operational Highlights Significantly strengthened balance sheet with $160 million of announced asset sales and financing transactions.Entered into exclusivity and executed a letter of intent (the ""LOI"") with a US-based hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease, inclusive of our current 100 MW facility and two forthcoming buildings. In advanced discussions for project-level financing for this investment-grade tenant.Started receiving new equipment deliveries and on track to incrementally restore Ellendale's capacity over the next two months, targeting to achieve 65%-75% capacity by the end of May. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"") is set forth in the schedule accompanying this release. See “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures.” Management Commentary ""During the quarter, Applied Digital encountered several challenges that impacted our financial performance due to facility power outages in our datacenter hosting business. Despite these short-term setbacks, we made significant progress with our key growth initiatives in the development of our Cloud Services business and the establishment of our special purpose built 100 MW HPC datacenter in Ellendale,"" stated Wes Cummins, Chairman and CEO of Applied Digital. ""Other achievements included welcoming our newest Cloud Services customer, Together AI, and the strategic decision to divest our Garden City Facility."" ""Moreover, we are pleased to announce a pivotal advancement. We have entered into exclusivity and executed an LOI with a US-based hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease of our Ellendale HPC campus. This encompasses our 100 MW facility under construction and plans for two additional buildings. In addition, we continue to see outsized demand for HPC hosting capacity at our differentiated Ellendale campus. where we have more than 600MW of future capacity. We are progressing with project level financing tailored for this investment-grade tenant. This milestone advances our strategic growth initiatives and stands as an impressive achievement for our organization."" ""Looking forward, we are encouraged by the robust demand we are witnessing across our business. We believe we are well-positioned to execute our growth strategy and capitalize on the increasing opportunities presented by both traditional customers and emerging HPC applications."" Cloud Service Update Applied Digital’s Cloud Services provides high-performance computing power for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. The Company continues to seek and sign additional customers, and the pipeline remains robust. During the fiscal third quarter, we did experience a substantial drag on earnings, adjusted earnings and EBITDA from expenses resulting from increased levels of in-service equipment that were not yet contributing to revenue generation. Near the end of the quarter, more of this equipment began generating revenue, which we expect will make a positive impact on the financial performance of this segment in the fiscal fourth quarter. High-Performance Computing (HPC) Datacenter Hosting Update Applied Digital’s HPC hosting business designs, builds, and operates next-generation data centers, which are designed to provide massive computing power and support high-performance computing applications within a cost-effective model. During the fiscal second quarter, the Company broke ground on its first 100 MW high-performance compute facility in Ellendale, North Dakota. The new 342,000-square-foot building will provide ultra-low-cost and highly efficient liquid-cooled infrastructure for HPC applications. The Company has entered into exclusivity and executed an LOI with a US-based hyperscaler for a 400 MW capacity lease, inclusive of our current 100 MW facility and two forthcoming buildings in Ellendale, North Dakota. The Company is in advanced discussions with traditional financing counterparties for this investment-grade tenant. The exclusive negotiation period with the initial HPC anchor tenant identified for our Ellendale campus expired at the end of March. Datacenter Hosting Update The Company’s 100 MW facility in Jamestown, North Dakota, operated at full capacity during the quarter ended February 29, 2024; however, the Company’s 180 MW facility in Ellendale, North Dakota experienced a power outage starting in January. In response to these challenges, our utility provider installed equipment to enable us to selectively power-down the affected portions of our site. Upon re-energization we have determined the failures were due to transformers not meeting industry standards. The Company has successfully procured new transformers and related components from North American industry-leading manufacturers. As of the date of this report, the Ellendale facility has begun energization and has been re-energized to approximately 14% of its full capacity, or 25 MW. In addition, the Company anticipates that as new transformers are received and installed, the Ellendale facility will target operating capacity of approximately 65%-75% of full capacity by the end of May 2024. Financial Results for Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Ended February 29, 2024 Balance Sheet Applied Digital ended the fiscal quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $41.0 million and $61.8 million in debt outstanding. Operating Results Total revenues in the fiscal third quarter 2024 were $43.3 million, up 208% from the fiscal third quarter 2023. The increase in revenues were driven by increased capacity across the Company’s three datacenter hosting facilities between periods as well as the Company's recognizing revenue under its Cloud services segment which began providing service during the current fiscal year. Cost of revenues in the fiscal third quarter 2024 was $47.1 million compared to $10.5 million in the fiscal third quarter 2023. The increase in the cost of revenues was attributable to higher energy costs due to a higher number of MWs online. The increase was also driven by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and personnel expenses primarily driven by the growth in the business as more facilities were energized compared to the fiscal third quarter of 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the fiscal third quarter 2024 were $30.4 million compared to $10.5 million in the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which, by nature, are not directly attributable to revenue generation, was primarily driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense for equipment not yet supporting revenue, an increase in lease expenses for facilities that have not yet begun generating revenue, and an increase in professional service expenses related to legal services associated with discrete transactions and projects as well as general support of the growth of the business compared to the fiscal third quarter 2023. Net loss for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was $62.8 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of 121.4 million. This compares to a net loss of $7.3 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, based on a weighted average share count of 94.1 million for the fiscal third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, for the fiscal third quarter 2024 was loss of $2.3 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA of $0.9 million for the fiscal third quarter 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by $4.8 million of expenses associated with facilities that are not yet generating revenue. Adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, for the fiscal third quarter of 2024, was $28.9 million or adjusted net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.24, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 121.4 million. This compares to an adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure, of $1.4 million, or $0.01 per basic and diluted share, for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 94.1 million. Adjusted net loss was negatively impacted by $15.6 million of expenses associated with facilities and equipment that are not yet generating revenue. Cash Flows The Company experienced a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during the nine months ended February 29, 2024 of $2.6 million. The primary drivers of the change were: Purchase of property, equipment, and other assets of $87.0 million, driven by construction of the Company's HPC hosting datacenter;Finance lease prepayments of $35.1 million and finance leases recurring payments of $27.5 million, primarily driven by the Company's leases of hosting equipment for Cloud services; andDebt repayments of approximately $52.3 million. These were partially offset by the following: Net cash received from operating activities of $47.9 million, driven by the recurring operations of the business;Borrowings of $31.4 million including funding received from related party loans; andNet cash received from the issuance of common stock of $121.0 million under the Company's at-the-market sales agreement.

Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we are presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. We are providing these non-GAAP financial measures to disclose additional information to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations by providing perspective on results absent one-time or significant non-cash items. We utilize these measures in the business planning process to understand expected operating performance and to evaluate results against those expectations.

Likewise, we may determine to modify the nature of the adjustments to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business. Change in Presentation Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, the Company updated its presentation of non-GAAP measures. As a result of this updated presentation, the Company no longer excludes start-up costs as an adjustment to Operating loss, Net loss, or EBITDA in our calculation of Adjusted operating loss, Adjusted net loss, Adjusted net loss per diluted share, and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net loss, and Adjusted net loss per diluted share are non-GAAP measures and are defined below. Adjusted Operating Loss, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share “Adjusted Operating Loss” and “Adjusted Net Loss” are non-GAAP measures that represent operating loss and net loss, respectively, excluding stock-based compensation, litigation expenses, non-recurring professional service costs, non-recurring research and development expenses, loss on classification of held for sale, loss on abandonment of assets, and loss on legal settlement. Adjusted net loss is further adjusted for the loss on the change in fair value of related party debt and the loss on extinguishment of debt. We define “Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share” as Adjusted net loss divided by weighted average diluted share count. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA “EBITDA” is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, litigation expenses, non-recurring professional service costs, non-recurring research and development expenses, loss on classification of of held for sale, loss on abandonment of assets, loss on the change in fair value of related party debt, loss of extinguishment of debt, and loss on legal settlement.

(KRMD) successfully appealed an audit report by The British Standards Institute (BSI) in the EU, ensuring no interruption in product sales.

(KRMD) successfully appealed an audit report by The British Standards Institute (BSI) in the EU, ensuring no interruption in product sales. The company's certification remains intact, allowing for continued expansion in the international market. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement by KORU Medical Systems regarding the successful appeal of the BSI assessment report is a positive development for the company's operations in the European market. The decision allows KORU to maintain its product certification and continue sales without disruption. This outcome may alleviate concerns among investors regarding potential revenue impacts and market access in the EU, which is a significant market for medical technology companies.From a market perspective, uninterrupted access to the EU market is essential for maintaining revenue streams and growth trajectories, especially for a company like KORU that emphasizes international expansion. The ability to continue operations as usual may be viewed favorably by the market, potentially influencing the company's stock valuation in the short term. Long-term implications include sustained market presence and the possibility of leveraging this positive regulatory outcome to enhance credibility with other international regulatory bodies. Medical Device Regulatory Expert The regulatory landscape for medical devices in the EU is stringent, with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) imposing rigorous standards for product safety and performance. KORU Medical's successful appeal against the recommendation for non-certification signifies the company's commitment to compliance and its ability to navigate complex regulatory processes.This development may instill confidence in stakeholders regarding KORU's regulatory competence, which is important for long-term success in the medical device sector. The ability to promptly address nonconformances and maintain certifications can be a differentiator in the industry, potentially impacting KORU's competitive standing. For peers and competitors, this serves as a reminder of the importance of robust quality management systems and the need for proactive engagement with notified bodies like BSI. Healthcare Industry Analyst The successful appeal by KORU Medical Systems highlights the company's resilience in addressing challenges that could have led to a significant setback in the EU, a key market for healthcare products. The healthcare industry, particularly the segment dealing with large volume subcutaneous infusion solutions, is highly competitive and sensitive to regulatory compliance. A suspension or interruption in certification could have had a cascading effect on KORU's market share and growth potential.By avoiding such a scenario, KORU not only secures its current position but also sends a strong signal to the market about its reliability and stability as a supplier. This could potentially lead to increased trust among healthcare providers and patients, ultimately translating into sustained or increased adoption of their products. The company's proactive approach and transparent communication about the appeal process may also contribute positively to its reputation, which is a vital asset in the healthcare market. 04/11/2024 - 04:05 PM MAHWAH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KORU Medical Systems, Inc.

"ADM Animal Nutrition Expands Recall to Include 17 Additional Lots of Chicken, Swine and Rabbit Feed Products",2024-04-11T19:30:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"ADM Animal Nutrition, a division of ADM, is expanding a recall due to elevated levels of magnesium, sodium, calcium, and/or phosphorus in various products impacting chickens, swine, and rabbits. The recall includes multiple product lines with specific lot numbers, sizes, and species affected, causing potential harm such as increased water consumption, reduced feed efficiency, and loose stools.","ADM Animal Nutrition Expands Recall to Include 17 Additional Lots of Chicken, Swine and Rabbit Feed Products Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary ADM Animal Nutrition, a division of ADM, is expanding a recall due to elevated levels of magnesium, sodium, calcium, and/or phosphorus in various products impacting chickens, swine, and rabbits. The recall includes multiple product lines with specific lot numbers, sizes, and species affected, causing potential harm such as increased water consumption, reduced feed efficiency, and loose stools. Positive None. Negative None. Veterinary Nutrition Expert The recall of ADM Animal Nutrition products due to elevated levels of magnesium, sodium, calcium, and/or phosphorus is significant from a veterinary nutrition standpoint. These minerals are essential for animal health but can be detrimental in excess. For instance, high sodium levels in chickens can lead to water imbalance, impacting feed efficiency and potentially leading to mortality. Similarly, excess calcium and phosphorus in swine diets can disrupt nutrient absorption, hindering growth and feed conversion ratios. This recall not only affects the immediate health of the animals but could also lead to longer-term issues such as developmental problems and decreased productivity, which in turn may affect the profitability of farms relying on these feeds. Supply Chain Risk Analyst From a supply chain perspective, the expanded recall by ADM presents considerable risks that could ripple through the agricultural industry. The distribution of affected products across multiple states suggests a widespread issue that may disrupt the supply of feed to numerous farms. The direct impact is the potential shortage of safe feed, which could force producers to seek alternative suppliers, possibly at higher costs. Indirectly, the recall could damage ADM's reputation among its clientele, leading to a loss of market share. The recall also highlights the importance of robust quality control measures in the supply chain to prevent such occurrences, which can have significant financial implications. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, ADM's recall could lead to a short-term increase in operational costs due to the logistics of recalling and replacing the products, potential settlements and implementing stricter quality control measures. There's also the possibility of a longer-term impact on revenue if customer trust is eroded, leading to a decrease in sales. Investors may exhibit concern over the recall's implications on ADM's future earnings, potentially affecting stock performance. Monitoring ADM's response to the recall and any changes in market share or legal repercussions will be essential for evaluating the company's financial health and resilience in the face of such challenges. 04/11/2024 - 03:30 PM Specific lots may contain elevated levels of magnesium, sodium, calcium and/or phosphorus; may harm chickens, swine, rabbits QUINCY, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ADM Animal Nutrition, a division of ADM (NYSE: ADM), is expanding the recall announced on March, 30, 2024, to include the following additional products due to elevated levels of magnesium, sodium, calcium and/or phosphorus: Pen Pals® Chicken Starter-Grower (Product Nos. 70009AAA46 and 70009AAA44); Pen Pals Egg Maker Complete (Product No. 70010AAAE4); MaxLean GF Concentrate (Product No. 12354AAA); ShowTec Sow Ration with Thermal Care (Product No. 12343AAA); ShowTec BB 18 BMD (Product No. 18241AGNE4); ShowTec BB 18 BMD/DBZ (Product No. 18241PLM); ShowTec Hi Fat 18 BMD (Product No. 18007AGNE4); ShowTec Lo Fat 15 BMD (Product No. 15350AGN); MoorMan's ShowTec Hi Fat 16 BMD (Product No. 16700AGN); MoorMan's ShowTec Burst Starter w/DF DEN (Product No. 24320CVW); MoorMan’s ShowTec Sale Burst w/DF CTC/DEN (Product No. 24320AYWE4); Pen Pals® Professional Show Rabbit Feed (Product No. 81657AAA); and Pen Pals Professional Rabbit 18 (Product No. 80033AAA).

"Solugen Breaks Ground on Bioforge™ Marshall Facility, Bolstering U.S. Biomanufacturing Capabilities",2024-04-11T19:02:00.000Z,Low,Very Positive,"Solugen, in partnership with ADM, breaks ground on a new biomanufacturing facility in Marshall, MN, to meet the rising demand for sustainable solutions. The facility aims to produce low-carbon organic acids using ADM-sourced dextrose, reducing emissions and creating high-skill manufacturing jobs. The project received financial incentives and is expected to boost the local economy while advancing sustainable biomanufacturing.","Solugen Breaks Ground on Bioforge™ Marshall Facility, Bolstering U.S. Biomanufacturing Capabilities Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Solugen, in partnership with ADM, breaks ground on a new biomanufacturing facility in Marshall, MN, to meet the rising demand for sustainable solutions. The facility aims to produce low-carbon organic acids using ADM-sourced dextrose, reducing emissions and creating high-skill manufacturing jobs. The project received financial incentives and is expected to boost the local economy while advancing sustainable biomanufacturing. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Economist The groundbreaking of Solugen's new biomanufacturing facility, in partnership with ADM, signifies a strategic move towards sustainable production, which is increasingly being recognized as a competitive advantage in the market. The facility's potential to avoid up to 18 million kilograms of CO2 emissions annually aligns with global efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of industrial processes. This shift towards bio-based production processes could influence the long-term valuation of companies like Solugen, as investors and consumers alike are showing preference for environmentally responsible companies.Moreover, the use of ADM-sourced dextrose as a feedstock for low-carbon organic acids suggests a symbiotic relationship that benefits both entities. ADM diversifies its product offerings, potentially increasing its resilience against market volatility in traditional commodities. This collaboration could set a precedent for similar partnerships, impacting the supply chain dynamics and possibly leading to more integrated operations in the bioeconomy sector. Market Research Analyst The establishment of Bioforge™ Marshall with an annual production capacity of 120 kilotonnes indicates a response to the growing demand for sustainable products. This capacity expansion is likely to capture a significant market share in the sustainable chemicals sector, which is witnessing a substantial consumer-driven shift. The direct pipelines for dextrose from ADM's plant not only streamline the production process but also reduce logistical costs and emissions, potentially offering Solugen a competitive edge in terms of cost-efficiency and sustainability.Furthermore, the creation of over 50 high-skill manufacturing jobs and collaboration with local educational institutions may foster a skilled labor pool and enhance community relations, strengthening Solugen's regional presence. The ripple effect of this investment could stimulate local economies and encourage further investments in sustainable technologies. This facility could serve as a benchmark for the industry, influencing stock valuations of companies in the bioeconomy space. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the $760,000 incentive from Minnesota's Job Creation Fund is a modest yet significant endorsement of Solugen's expansion. This grant, while not a major financial stimulus, does indicate government support for sustainable initiatives, which could lead to further incentives or funding opportunities. The strategic location adjacent to ADM's corn processing complex suggests a cost-saving strategy that could improve Solugen's profitability margins.The investment in the new facility is a forward-looking move that may yield long-term benefits. However, it is important to monitor Solugen's capital expenditure and the facility's ramp-up progress to ensure that the anticipated production efficiencies and cost savings materialize. Investors should also consider the scalability of Solugen's chemienzymatic technology and its adaptability to various market demands, as these factors will be pivotal in determining the company's financial performance and impact on the stock market. 04/11/2024 - 03:02 PM MARSHALL, Minn., April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Solugen, a rapidly scaling climate technology company revolutionizing everyday chemicals, broke ground on its new state-of-the-art biomanufacturing facility today during a ceremony held in Marshall, Minn. The new facility is the result of a strategic partnership with ADM (NYSE: ADM), a global leader in sustainably sourced solutions from nature, and aims to meet the increasing demand for sustainable solutions while bolstering domestic biomanufacturing capabilities. ""Today's groundbreaking underscores our commitment to innovation and the future of biomanufacturing in the U.S.""The 500,000-square-foot Bioforge™ Marshall is being constructed on a 34-acre parcel adjacent to ADM's existing corn processing complex. The facility will utilize ADM-sourced dextrose to manufacture low-carbon organic acids for applications in water treatment, agriculture, energy, and home and personal care. ""Today's groundbreaking represents a key milestone in our growth journey, underscoring our commitment to innovation and the future of biomanufacturing in the U.S.,"" said Gaurab Chakrabarti, CEO and Co-Founder of Solugen. ""As the demand for sustainable products continues to rise, we look forward to partnering with our customers in their decarbonization efforts."" Bioforge™ Marshall will house three modular trains, or production lines, boasting a total production capacity of up to 120 kilotonnes per annum (KTA) of product. The facility will employ up to 100 temporary workers during construction and is expected to create over 50 high-skill manufacturing jobs upon reaching full production. The pioneering process employed by Solugen's Bioforge™ Marshall facility is estimated to avoid the emissions of up to 18 million kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year compared to the base case of similar petrochemical and fermentation-based products. ""Solugen's chemienzymatic technology is a transformative force in sustainable chemical manufacturing,"" said Sean Hunt, Co-Founder and CTO of Solugen. ""The new facility will significantly increase our existing capabilities, enabling us to expand the market share of low-carbon chemistries."" Dextrose will serve as the primary feedstock, with an estimated 150 million pounds converted annually at full production. The facility will feature two dextrose pipelines connecting directly to the adjacent ADM plant, boosting production and significantly lowering the cost and emissions associated with transport. ""We are excited to be taking the next step in our partnership with Solugen and to help meet the increasing demand for sustainable products,"" said Chris Cuddy, Senior Vice President, President of ADM's Carbohydrate Solutions business unit. ""Sustainability is core to ADM's purpose and one of the enduring global trends powering our strategic growth. Our partnership with Solugen offers another avenue in which ADM can diversify the products made from our corn stream and continue to support plant-based solutions for use in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products."" In support of the project, Solugen was awarded $760,000 in financial incentives from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development's Job Creation Fund (JCF). ""DEED is proud to support the advancement of sustainable biomanufacturing in Minnesota through our investment in Solugen's expansion to Marshall,"" said DEED Commissioner Matt Varilek. ""This transformative project not only creates quality jobs but also builds upon our state's rich legacy of innovation. Congratulations to Solugen and thank you for your commitment to investing in Minnesota's future."" The facility, which is expected to come online in the fall of 2025, is primed to serve as a powerful economic driver for the city of Marshall. The investment demonstrates Solugen's commitment to onshoring domestic manufacturing while ensuring communities like Marshall reap the benefits of the growing bioeconomy. ""As a community deeply rooted in agriculture and innovation, we warmly welcome Solugen to Marshall,"" said City of Marshall Mayor Bob Byrnes. ""We appreciate Solugen's commitment to sustainable development, job creation, and diversifying our industrial base. ADM's continued investment in Marshall has made opportunities like this possible. We look forward to strengthening these partnerships and advancing our mission of economic vitality and community well-being."" Solugen has initiated collaborations with local educational institutions and workforce development groups, including Marshall Public Schools, Minnesota West Community and Technical College, Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU), Southwest Minnesota Private Industry Council, and Marshall Chamber of Commerce.

The partnership aims to enhance home improvement lending services, expanding reach and expertise in the residential solar equipment market. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Medallion Bank's partnership with TriBeam Financial marks a strategic move to diversify its consumer loan portfolio. The focus on financing home solar systems is timely, considering the growing consumer interest in renewable energy solutions. This partnership could enhance Medallion Bank's loan origination volume, potentially increasing its interest income. The association with a fintech company like TriBeam, which has a considerable network of installers, could also streamline the loan application process, thereby improving customer experience and satisfaction. However, the solar financing market is competitive, with various players offering similar services. Medallion Bank will need to leverage TriBeam's technology effectively to differentiate itself and capture market share. Market Research Analyst The residential solar equipment sector is witnessing an upward trend, driven by consumer awareness and favorable government policies. Medallion Bank's entry into this market through TriBeam Financial could tap into this growing demand. This move is likely to be received positively by investors as it signals Medallion's adaptability and commitment to growth sectors. However, it's important to monitor the performance metrics of this new venture, such as the default rates on solar loans and the operational costs associated with this new partnership. These factors will be critical in assessing the long-term profitability and sustainability of this business line. Risk Management Expert Entering the home solar financing market exposes Medallion Bank to new credit risks, particularly in assessing the creditworthiness of customers in a relatively new industry. The success of this partnership will largely depend on the bank's ability to manage these risks effectively. While the partnership could lead to diversification benefits, there is also the risk of dilution of focus from Medallion's core segments. It is imperative for the bank to maintain stringent underwriting standards and to closely monitor the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding renewable energy financing. The bank's risk management strategies will need to evolve in tandem with this new market dynamic. 04/11/2024 - 04:01 PM SALT LAKE CITY, April 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Medallion Bank (Nasdaq: MBNKP, the “Bank”), an FDIC-insured bank providing consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles, boats, and home improvements, along with offering loan products and services through fintech strategic partners, announced today it had entered into a definitive agreement with TriBeam Financial, Inc.

The reported 136% growth in 340B contract services revenue is especially noteworthy, as it suggests the company has effectively capitalized on the 340B drug pricing program, which allows hospitals and clinics serving underserved populations to obtain discounted medications.However, the significant goodwill impairment charge of approximately $13.9 million raises concerns about the overvaluation of assets in the past and may indicate integration challenges following the change in control transaction with NextPlat Corp. While goodwill impairments are non-cash charges and do not affect liquidity, they can impact investor perception and the company's book value. The increase in the cash balance is a positive sign, indicating liquidity to support operations and potential investments. Yet, stakeholders should consider the implications of the reported net loss, which has substantially increased from the previous year, largely due to the goodwill impairment. Pharmacy Market Analyst The impressive growth in pharmacy prescription revenue by 17% reflects Progressive Care's successful efforts in expanding its pharmacy operations. The company's focus on specialized care and patient medical adherence could be contributing to increased customer loyalty and prescription volume. This is indicative of a competitive advantage in the pharmacy sector, where customer service and adherence programs can differentiate a provider.Moreover, the expansion of services through partnerships, such as the one with Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, suggests a strategic move to offer cost-effective drug options, which can be appealing in a price-sensitive market. The addition of OTC benefit programs aligns with current trends in the pharmacy industry to increase convenience and access to healthcare products, potentially driving foot traffic and cross-selling opportunities. The increased gross profit margin to 30% is a positive sign of operational efficiency and may reflect a favorable shift in the sales mix towards higher-margin services. Healthcare Industry Analyst The strategic emphasis on the 340B program positions Progressive Care in a niche market with regulatory support aimed at providing affordable medication to underserved communities. The growth in this area not only enhances the company's revenue streams but also aligns with broader healthcare industry trends focused on cost containment and value-based care. The increase in the number of prescriptions filled, albeit modest, indicates steady demand for the company's services.However, the reported net loss, exacerbated by the goodwill impairment, is a red flag that warrants careful assessment of the company's valuation and future earnings potential. The consolidation of Progressive Care as a subsidiary of NextPlat post-acquisition may offer strategic benefits and resource sharing but also introduces complexity in financial reporting and potential risks associated with integrating operations and corporate cultures. 04/11/2024 - 04:00 PM Results Driven by 17% Increase in Pharmacy Prescription Revenue and Over 136% Growth in 340B Contract Services Revenue MIAMI, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB: RXMD) (""Progressive Care"" or the ""Company""), a personalized healthcare services and technology provider, today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company reported record annual revenues of approximately $49.7 million, a 22% increase from results reported for the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by strong growth at its PharmcoRx pharmacies and the addition of multiple new 340B contracts in the second half of 2023. ""Progressive Care's significant growth in 2023 reflects its continuing commitment to ensuring strong patient medical adherence through highly specialized care and its proven ability to support the unique needs of 340B covered entities. I am pleased with our team's success in greatly strengthening the Company's financial foundation and driving improved operational performance. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our pharmacy operations with new programs, such as the OTC benefit programs announced last year, and add additional clients within the 340B space,"" said Charles M. Fernandez, Chairman and CEO of Progressive Care Inc. 2023 Annual Financial Highlights Total revenues increased by approximately $9.1 million, or 22%, to approximately $49.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $40.6 million in 2022. Sequentially, total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by approximately 18% over revenue reported for the third quarter of 2023.Prescription revenue, net of PBM fees, increased by approximately $5.8 million, or 17%, to approximately $40.7 million in 2023, compared to approximately $34.9 million in 2022.340B contract revenue increased to approximately $9.0 million in 2023, an increase of approximately $5.2 million, or 136%, compared to approximately $3.8 million in 2022. The increase was attributable to an increase in the number of 340B contracts being serviced by the Company.Annual gross profit margin increased to approximately 30% in 2023, from approximately 24% in 2022.Fiscal 2023 results include a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $13.9 million, mostly related to the pharmacy services reporting unit. The impairment charge represents approximately 48% of the total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, net that were recognized in the change in control transaction with NextPlat Corp in July 2023.Cash balance as of December 31, 2023, was approximately $7.9 million, as compared to approximately $6.7 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company experienced a net cash provided by operations of approximately $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.Organizational Highlights and Recent Business Developments PharmcoRx added several additional 340B contracts during fiscal 2023 as it continues to support the unique needs of 340B covered entities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately $0.8 million of the $5.2 million increase in 340B contract revenue was attributable to new 340B contracts, with the remaining $4.4 million increase related to increased prescription volume from existing 340B contracts.Furthering its commitment to improving community access to valuable healthcare services, through partnerships with ProHealth Connect and NationsBenefits announced late in 2023, the Company began offering additional products and services for new and existing Medicare Advantage patients whose wish is to utilize their OTC benefits to purchase over-the-counter products at its PharmcoRx pharmacies. The Company also expanded its in-pharmacy offerings through an agreement with the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company (""Cost Plus Drugs""). The Cost Plus Drugs program allows participating patients the ability to purchase generic and branded medicines at cost plus a low fixed markup.On June 30, 2023, NextPlat Corp (NASDAQ: NXPL, NXPLW) (""NextPlat""), Charles M. Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Rodney Barreto, Vice-Chairman of the Company, exercised their common stock purchase warrants in Progressive Care and collectively owned 53% of Progressive Care's voting common stock. As such, this constituted a change in control in Progressive Care and effective as of July 1, 2023, it is now a consolidated subsidiary of NextPlat for accounting purposes. Mr. Fernandez concluded, ""Looking ahead, our plans for Progressive Care remain focused on further supporting its growth in the large 340B and long-term care markets, as well as its ability to continue providing high quality, specialized offerings and services for our pharmacy customers. Our team is confident in the long-term value of Progressive Care and are committed to actively exploring every opportunity to best unlock its potential to the benefit of our patients, providers, and our shareholders."" Summary Financials for the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 Our results of operations as reported in our consolidated financial statements for the periods six months ended December 31, 2023 (""Successor""), six months ended June 30, 2023 (""Predecessor""), and the year ended December 31, 2022 (""Predecessor"") are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Although GAAP requires that we report on our results for the Successor and Predecessor periods separately, management views our operating results for the combined year ended December 31, 2023 by combining the results of the Predecessor and Successor periods because management believes such presentation provides the most meaningful comparison of our results to prior periods. We believe the key performance indicators such as operating revenues and expenses for the Successor period combined with the Predecessor period provide more meaningful comparisons to other periods and are useful in understanding operational trends.

The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in prescription revenue, net of PBM fees of approximately $5.8 million, and an increase in 340B contract revenue of approximately $5.2 million, which was offset by a decrease in COVID-19 testing revenue of approximately $1.9 million, when compared to the prior year. We have filled approximately 489,000 and 463,000 prescriptions during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of prescriptions filled. Gross profit margins increased from 24% for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 30% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in gross profit margins during 2023, compared to the prior year, was primarily attributable to the increase in 340B contract revenue, which has higher margins than revenue generated from pharmacy operations. Loss from operations increased by approximately $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, because of the increase in gross profit of approximately $5.5 million, partially offset by the increase in operating expenses of approximately $16.9 million. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the recognition of approximately $13.9 million of goodwill impairment which was mostly related to the pharmacy operations reporting unit. Net Loss We had a net loss of approximately $19.4 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment recognized in 2023, partially offset by the NextPlat transaction-related expenses and losses recognized in the prior year.

Proceeds for general corporate purposes including debt repayment.","Nuveen Announces Closing of $1.25 Billion Senior Notes Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Nuveen, closes $1.25 billion senior unsecured notes offering with two series, 5.550% due 2030 and 5.850% due 2034. Proceeds for general corporate purposes including debt repayment. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of senior unsecured notes by Nuveen represents a significant capital market activity that can influence the company's financial structure and cost of capital. The offering size of $1.25 billion, split into two series with different maturity dates, indicates a strategic approach to managing the company's debt profile. The interest rates of 5.550% for the 2030 Notes and 5.850% for the 2034 Notes are reflective of current market conditions and the company's creditworthiness.The decision to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, with a focus on repaying existing debt, is a prudent move. It suggests that Nuveen is proactive in managing its debt obligations and is likely seeking to optimize its interest expense. This action could potentially improve Nuveen's credit rating and reduce future borrowing costs, which in turn can have a positive effect on the company's profitability and stock valuation over time. Debt Capital Markets Expert Examining the structure of the offering, the involvement of multiple reputable financial institutions as joint book-running managers underscores the credibility of the issuance. It is also noteworthy that the notes were offered exclusively to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons, which implies that Nuveen is targeting sophisticated investors, likely due to the unregistered nature of the securities. This can be a strategic choice to expedite the capital-raising process while avoiding the regulatory complexities of a public offering.However, the lack of registration under the Securities Act means that the liquidity of these notes could be lower, as they cannot be freely traded in the U.S. secondary market. Investors should be aware of the trade-off between the potentially higher yield and the reduced liquidity of these instruments. Risk Management Expert From a risk perspective, the issuance of unsecured notes means that the debt is not backed by specific collateral, which inherently carries a higher risk for investors compared to secured debt. This is typically compensated by a higher interest rate, as seen in the rates for the 2030 and 2034 Notes. Investors would need to carefully consider Nuveen's overall financial health, including its cash flow and debt-to-equity ratio, to assess the risk of default.Additionally, the choice to repay existing debt that has a lower interest rate suggests a strategic response to the current interest rate environment. It is imperative for investors to understand the implications of such refinancing activities on the company's interest expense and overall financial stability in both the short and long term. 04/11/2024 - 02:07 PM NEW YORK, April 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuveen, LLC (""Nuveen"") announced today that it has closed an offering of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes which have been issued in two series: (i) a series of 5.550% senior notes due 2030 in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million (the ""2030 Notes"") and (ii) a series of 5.850% senior notes due 2034 in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million (the ""2034 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes will mature on January 15, 2030, and the 2034 Notes will mature on April 15, 2034. Nuveen intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the repayment of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due November 1, 2024 previously issued by Nuveen Finance, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen. BofA Securities, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp. and UBS Securities LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the 2030 Notes, and BofA Securities, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. and TD Securities (USA) LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the 2034 Notes. Academy Securities, Inc., Blaylock Van, LLC, Capital One Securities, Inc. and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. were co-managers for the Notes. The Notes were offered only to (i) persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act"") and (ii) certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and therefore may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Issues Ruling in Norwich Case that Prevents FDA Approval of Norwich’s Abbreviated New Drug Application Until 2029,2024-04-11T17:03:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Bausch Health Companies Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision preventing the approval of Norwich Pharmaceuticals' generic version of XIFAXAN until 2029. The Court also invalidated certain patents related to XIFAXAN for treating IBS-D.,"Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Issues Ruling in Norwich Case that Prevents FDA Approval of Norwich’s Abbreviated New Drug Application Until 2029 Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags fda approval Rhea-AI Summary Bausch Health Companies Inc. and Salix Pharmaceuticals announced that the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the decision preventing the approval of Norwich Pharmaceuticals' generic version of XIFAXAN until 2029. The Court also invalidated certain patents related to XIFAXAN for treating IBS-D. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Legal Expert The affirmation of the U.S. Court of Appeals regarding Bausch Health's patent litigation is a significant event for the company and its stakeholders. This decision effectively extends the exclusivity period for XIFAXAN until October 2029, which is critical for maintaining the drug's market share against generic competition. From a legal standpoint, the upholding of the district court's decision indicates a strong defense of the existing patent claims that cover the drug's composition and usage.However, it is important to note that while the exclusivity is upheld, the invalidation of certain patents related to the treatment of IBS-D by XIFAXAN could open avenues for future legal challenges. This might lead to potential litigation costs and a need for a strategic realignment of the company's intellectual property portfolio. Stakeholders can expect Bausch Health to continue investing in legal defenses to protect its market position, which could influence the company's financial planning and resource allocation. Financial Analyst The appellate court's decision has direct financial implications for Bausch Health. By preventing generic competition for XIFAXAN until 2029, the company secures its revenue stream from this product for several more years. This is positive news for investors as it provides a clearer revenue forecast and could potentially lead to an upward revision of the company's valuation.On the flip side, the affirmation of patent invalidity might be a concern for investors, as it reflects vulnerability in the company's patent portfolio and could signify risks for other products. Investors should monitor Bausch Health's R&D pipeline and any strategic moves to mitigate the impact of patent cliffs on its long-term growth prospects. Market Research Analyst The pharmaceutical market is highly sensitive to patent litigation outcomes due to the impact on competitive dynamics. Bausch Health's ability to retain exclusivity on XIFAXAN until 2029 means that the company can continue to capitalize on the established market for IBS-D treatments without the immediate pressure of price erosion from generics.Understanding the market's response to such news is crucial. The decision may be viewed favorably by investors and could lead to an increase in stock market confidence in Bausch Health's near-term profitability. However, the market will also be aware of the invalidated patents and may expect Bausch Health to increase investment in new product development or strategic acquisitions to fill potential future revenue gaps. 04/11/2024 - 01:03 PM LAVAL, QC / ACCESSWIRE / April 11, 2024 / Bausch Health Companies Inc.

Redfin Report: Monthly Payments Set New Record–And Buyers’ Costs Will Likely Stay High on Inflation News,2024-04-11T15:58:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Daily average mortgage rates hit a five-month high after an inflation report, leading to record U.S. housing payments of $2,747, up 11% from last year, with home prices at $378,250.","Redfin Report: Monthly Payments Set New Record–And Buyers’ Costs Will Likely Stay High on Inflation News Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Daily average mortgage rates hit a five-month high after an inflation report, leading to record U.S. housing payments of $2,747, up 11% from last year, with home prices at $378,250. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The recent uptick in mortgage rates, which have reached a peak not seen in almost half a year, is a direct consequence of inflationary pressures. This trend is indicative of a broader economic climate where the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of rate hikes to combat inflation. This environment has a multi-faceted impact on the housing market, as higher mortgage rates typically cool demand by increasing the cost of borrowing. This, in turn, can lead to a slowdown in home price appreciation.From an investment perspective, companies in the housing sector, including lenders and real estate agencies, might face a decrease in transaction volumes. However, the increase in mortgage rates could also signal a strengthening economy, which could benefit other sectors. Investors should monitor the balance between rising rates and economic growth, as it will be critical in determining market sentiment. Economist The report from Redfin underscores a significant shift in the housing affordability landscape. An 11% year-over-year increase in median U.S. housing payments is substantial, outpacing general wage growth. This disparity suggests that housing affordability is declining, which could have long-term socioeconomic implications. Higher housing costs can lead to reduced consumer spending in other areas, potentially slowing economic growth.Furthermore, the housing market is a key indicator of economic health. If mortgage rates continue to rise, we might witness a cooling period in the housing market, which could precede a broader economic slowdown. Stakeholders should consider the potential for a market correction and its implications on consumer spending and the construction industry. Real Estate Market Analyst The concurrent rise in home prices and mortgage rates presents a complex scenario for the real estate market. While the median home-sale price has increased by 4.5%, the higher financing costs due to elevated mortgage rates may start to outweigh the benefits for both buyers and sellers. For buyers, the cost of entering the market becomes more prohibitive, potentially reducing demand. For sellers, while the higher prices could be seen as beneficial, the reduced pool of buyers may lead to longer listing times and possibly necessitate price reductions.Real estate companies may need to adjust their strategies, possibly focusing on alternative financing options or incentives to maintain sales volumes. The market dynamics suggest a shift towards a buyer's market, which could lead to increased competition among sellers and real estate service providers. 04/11/2024 - 11:58 AM Daily average mortgage rates reached their highest level in nearly five months following Wednesday’s hotter-than-expected inflation report, which will likely keep mortgage rates elevated for the foreseeable future SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- (NASDAQ: RDFN) —The median monthly U.S. housing payment hit an all-time high of $2,747 during the four weeks ending April 7, up 11% from a year earlier. That’s according to a new report from Redfin (redfin.com), the technology-powered real estate brokerage. Housing payments are soaring because home prices and mortgage rates are high. The median home-sale price is $378,250, up 4.5% year over year and just about $5,000 shy of the record high hit in June 2022. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.82%, below the near-8% rates hit last October but still more than double pandemic-era lows. Prices are staying stubbornly high because there’s enough homebuying demand to prop them up. Redfin’s Homebuyer Demand Index—a measure of requests for tours and other buying services from Redfin agents—is at its highest level since last July. A separate measure of tours shows they’ve increased 33% since the start of 2024, much bigger than last year’s increase over the same period (that’s partly because Easter fell during this week last year). And even though supply is picking up—new listings rose 14% year over year—inventory is still low compared to typical spring levels, meaning there’s competition for many of the homes that are on the market. Mortgage rates, the other factor driving up monthly housing payments, remain elevated because the Fed has kept interest rates high so far this year. Daily average mortgage rates jumped to their highest level since last November this week because the March inflation report was hotter than expected, after rising last week because the latest jobs report showed a stronger-than-expected economy. “For homebuyers, the latest CPI report means mortgage rates will stay higher for longer because it makes the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates in the next few months,” said Redfin Economic Research Lead Chen Zhao. “Housing costs are likely to continue going up for the near future, but persistently high mortgage rates and rising supply could cool home-price growth by the end of the year, taking some pressure off costs.” For more of Redfin economists’ takes on the housing market, including how current financial events are impacting mortgage rates, please visit Redfin’s “From Our Economists” page.
