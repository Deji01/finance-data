The transaction is expected to boost earnings in 2024, with estimated peak sales exceeding $10 million annually. PKU GOLIKE® is a next-generation medical formula designed to improve patient experience and adherence to strict PKU diets. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of PKU GOLIKE® by Eton Pharmaceuticals represents a strategic expansion of the company's metabolic franchise. The transaction's expected accretion to 2024 earnings and the estimated peak sales exceeding $10 million annually are significant figures for a niche market. The U.S. phenylketonuria (PKU) medical formula market's estimated $100 million annual value indicates a substantial opportunity for revenue growth, especially considering the limited patient population of 8,000 PKU patients utilizing medical formulas. The inclusion of rights to future line extensions and a first negotiation right for an innovative drug candidate (RLF-OD032) under development for PKU treatment may further enhance Eton's market position in the coming years.From a financial perspective, the accretive nature of the deal suggests that Eton's EPS (earnings per share) is expected to increase post-acquisition. Investors will likely monitor the integration process and the effectiveness of Eton's sales force in increasing PKU GOLIKE's market penetration. The financial success of this acquisition will depend on how well Eton can leverage its existing relationships in the metabolic community and how insurance coverage policies evolve for PKU medical formulas. Market Research Analyst Understanding the PKU medical formula market dynamics is important for assessing the potential impact of Eton's acquisition. PKU GOLIKE's proprietary Physiomimic™ technology and its taste-masked, odor-free coating are designed to improve patient compliance and experience. These product differentiators could provide a competitive advantage in the market. However, the actual impact on market share will depend on the effectiveness of Eton's marketing strategies and the ability to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on the benefits of PKU GOLIKE® over existing alternatives.Moreover, the successful commercialization of PKU GOLIKE in Europe since 2019 by Relief's subsidiary APR suggests a tested and viable product. Eton's challenge will be to replicate this success in the U.S. market, which may have different regulatory and competitive landscapes. The market research will need to closely follow patient and healthcare professional feedback, as well as sales performance data, to gauge the adoption rate and to refine targeting strategies for the metabolic sales force. Medical Research Analyst The medical implications of this acquisition extend beyond the financials. PKU is a rare metabolic disorder requiring lifelong management and the availability of improved medical formulas like PKU GOLIKE® can significantly affect patient quality of life. The delayed amino acid release formulation of the product aligns with the dietary management needs of PKU patients, potentially offering better satiety and metabolic control. The long-term health outcomes and the potential reduction in healthcare costs associated with better-managed PKU could be a point of interest for medical research and health economics.Furthermore, the ongoing development of line extensions for other metabolic conditions and the new drug candidate RLF-OD032 suggest a commitment to innovation in the rare disease space. The expected FDA filing of RLF-OD032 as a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application indicates a potentially expedited regulatory pathway, leveraging previous research data. The medical community will be watching closely for clinical trial results and FDA feedback, which will have implications for the standard of care in PKU treatment. 03/22/2024 - 02:00 AM PKU GOLIKE® is a commercial ultra-rare disease medical formula complementary to Eton's existing metabolic franchise and specialty call pointTransaction is expected to be accretive to 2024 earningsEstimated peak sales of more than $10 million annuallyU.S. phenylketonuria (""PKU"") medical formula market estimated to be $100 million annually DEER PARK, Ill., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today announced that it has acquired U.S. rights to PKU GOLIKE® from RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding SA (“Relief”) (SIX: RLF, OTCQB: RLFTF, RLFTY). “We are excited to be partnering with Relief on PKU GOLIKE in the United States. After extensive discussions with metabolic geneticists, dieticians, and PKU patients, we believe PKU GOLIKE is the best product in the estimated $100 million U.S. PKU medical formula market. With our sales force and existing relationships in the metabolic community, we believe we can significantly increase the awareness, education, and adoption of this important product,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals. “We are very pleased to gain this partnership with Eton for PKU GOLIKE patients in the US as it is aligned with RELIEF’s strategy to enhance patient access to our innovative products,” said Michelle Lock, interim CEO of Relief. “Eton brings valuable know-how in the metabolic space as well as commercialization expertise for products in rare diseases.” PKU is a rare inherited disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine, leading to a toxic buildup of phenylalanine when eating foods that contain proteins. Treatment of PKU requires patients to follow a strict diet that severely limits phenylalanine content and typically requires low protein foods supplemented by phenylalanine-free medical formulas. Excessive levels of phenylalanine in the blood accumulate in the brain and inhibit proper brain development. It is estimated that 8,000 PKU patients in the U.S. utilize medical formulas to manage their diet. PKU GOLIKE® is a next generation medical formula product engineered with the patent protected, pharmaceutical grade Physiomimic™ technology for the dietary management of PKU under medical supervision. PKU GOLIKE’s taste-masked, odor-free coating technology is designed to provide a better taste and a superior experience compared to alternative PKU medical formulas. In addition, PKU GOLIKE’s delayed amino acid release formulation is designed to keep patients full for a longer period of time. Relief launched PKU GOLIKE Granules in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the PKU GOLIKE Tropical Bar in the second quarter of 2023. Only a few months into the product’s launch, PKU GOLIKE’s fourth quarter net sales in the U.S. were at an annual run rate of more than $1 million. Relief, through its subsidiary APR, has commercialized PKU GOLIKE in Europe since 2019 and seen strong adoption. Eton plans to promote PKU GOLIKE with its existing metabolic sales force, which currently promotes Eton’s Carglumic Acid, Betaine, and Nitisinone products. PKU patients’ care is typically overseen by metabolic geneticists and their support staff of nurse practitioners and registered dieticians. Medical formulas for PKU are frequently covered by insurance and are regulated by the FDA as medical food products. PKU GOLIKE is exclusively distributed in the United States by Pentec Health. Patients and healthcare professionals seeking additional information on the product can visit www.PKUGOLIKE.com. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Eton’s 2024 earnings and the company expects peak sales of more than $10 million annually. As part of the transaction, Eton also received U.S. rights to Relief’s GOLIKE medical formulas line extensions under development for the management of the metabolic conditions tyrosinemia and homocystinuria, which are expected to launch in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Eton has also been granted a right of first negotiation for Relief’s RLF-OD032 development candidate. RLF-OD032 is an innovative drug product candidate under development for the treatment of PKU and is expected to be filed with the FDA in the second half of 2025 as a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application. Relief will continue to own PKU GOLIKE rights outside the United States.

About Phenylketonuria (PKU) Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a defect of the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine (Phe), leading to a toxic buildup of Phe from the consumption of foods containing protein or aspartame. Untreated PKU can result in global developmental delay or severe irreversible intellectual disability, as well as growth failure, hypopigmentation, motor deficits, ataxia and seizures. Living with PKU requires a limited diet and very careful management. If left unmanaged, PKU can lead to devastating consequences, such as brain damage. People living with PKU do not have the ability to metabolize Phe, which is found in many foods, and they require supplementation of amino acid-based phenylalanine-free medical formulas as part of an effort to prevent protein deficiency and optimize metabolic control. Medical formulas used in PKU are challenged to provide a range of amino acids slowly and without a medicinal aftertaste. About PKU GOLIKE PKU GOLIKE® products are foods for special medical purposes (FSMPs) for the dietary management of PKU in both children and adults for use under medical supervision. Developed with Relief’s proprietary, patent-protected Physiomimic Technology™ drug delivery platform, PKU GOLIKE® products are the first prolonged-release amino acid FSMPs, characterized by a special coating that ensures physiological absorption of the amino acids mirroring that of natural proteins. The special coating also masks the unpleasant taste, odor and aftertaste of the amino acids. PKU GOLIKE® granules are flavorless and can be mixed with many foods. PKU GOLIKE® products contain all 19 amino acids that people with PKU need to maintain neurological and muscular health and is fortified with 27 essential vitamins and minerals, including ones normally found in protein-rich foods like iron, calcium and vitamin B12. The PKU GOLIKE® line of products are available in convenient packets (PKU GOLIKE Plus® 3-16 and 16+) and medical formula bars (PKU GOLIKE BAR®). PKU GOLIKE® products have been commercially available in the U.S. since October 2022. For more information, visit www.pkugolike.com (Please note this site is intended for U.S. audiences only).

The conference is attended by researchers, physicians, patient advocates and industry representatives providing sales, partnership and collaboration opportunities.ANGLE is presenting two posters at the conference:1. Integrating isolation using label-independent microfluidics and advanced staining for comprehensive Circulating Tumour Cell AnalysisANGLE's Parsortix® system and Portrait®+ CTC Staining Kit together provide an optimised, efficient, and standardised solution for the harvest and characterisation, via immunofluorescence (IF) staining, of a diverse range of CTC phenotypes. In the presented data, half of the CTC-positive breast cancer patient blood samples contained only mesenchymal CTCs, while half had a combination of both epithelial and mesenchymal CTCs. Patients with purely mesenchymal CTCs would have been missed by epitope-dependent systems. This is important because mesenchymal CTCs or CTCs undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition are clinically significant, playing a critical role in cancer progression, treatment resistance and metastasis.CTC clusters harvested by the Parsortix system were observed in 75% of the CTC-positive patients which is crucial given that CTC clusters have been shown to have up to 100 times the increased metastatic potential compared to single CTCs. The Parsortix cassette's unique design is suited to capturing and harvesting clusters which is often difficult with other CTC systems.The study results highlight the importance of using ANGLE's Parsortix system combined with the Company's Portrait+ CTC Staining Kit, to enable the isolation and analysis of a range of CTC phenotypes and CTC clusters, both of which are important in cancer progression and metastasis.2. Interrogating HER2 status in Circulating Tumour Cells isolated using the Parsortix® system from Metastatic Breast Cancer patientsThe diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is currently guided by the evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in tissue biopsies. However, a tissue biopsy is invasive, is at a single point in time and, with little opportunity for repeat testing, can become out of date. The longitudinal monitoring of HER2 expression from blood is possible through minimally invasive CTC-based liquid biopsy techniques. ANGLE has developed an IF assay for HER2 protein identification on CTCs isolated and harvested using the Parsortix system from the peripheral blood of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.Results from an in-house study in 26 patients found that CTCs overexpressing HER2 were present at similar levels in patients that had HER2+ or HER2- tumours by primary tissue biopsy. HER2 status of CTCs was also dynamic, changing over time in 37% of CTC positive donors which is unsurprising given that temporal changes in HER2 tissue status are also well documented in the literature. One third-party study of 575 breast cancer patients similarly found that 38% had changed HER2 status from the original primary tissue biopsy to the metastatic tissue biopsy, at disease recurrence. These initial results using Parsortix-based harvest of CTCs demonstrate how the HER2 status between primary tumours and CTCs can diverge, and that analysis of HER2 expression on CTCs has the potential to help guide clinical decision making in MBC patients, allowing for regular monitoring and tracking of treatment and/or disease progression.ANGLE Chief Scientific Officer, Karen Miller, commented:""We are delighted to have had two posters presented at the EBCC conference. The results of these studies further demonstrate the potential utility of ANGLE's sample-to-answer Parsortix system and Portrait imaging assays for reliable and repeatable assessment of biomarkers in a range of solid tumours, including breast.

The project enhances Denmark's energy independence and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The partnership between TotalEnergies, BlueNord, and Nordsøfonden proves successful in achieving this milestone. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The recommencement of operations at the Tyra hub by TotalEnergies signifies a notable development for the energy sector, particularly within the European context. The Tyra hub's projected output of 5.7 million cubic meters of gas and 22,000 barrels of condensate per day is set to restore Denmark's status as a self-sufficient entity and a net exporter of natural gas. This is significant given Europe's ongoing energy supply concerns, especially in light of geopolitical tensions and the transition towards renewable energy sources.From an economic standpoint, the Tyra hub's return to functionality could potentially stabilize or even lower gas prices regionally due to increased supply. For TotalEnergies and its partners, this translates into a boost in revenue streams and possibly enhanced stock market performance. The emphasis on a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions aligns with the growing investor interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, which could positively influence investor sentiment and attract ESG-focused investments. Environmental Policy Expert The redevelopment of the Tyra hub incorporates advanced digital solutions and technological innovations aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental implications of this project are noteworthy, particularly the claim of a 30% reduction in emissions compared to the former facilities. This positions TotalEnergies as a leader in sustainable practices within the offshore gas sector, potentially setting a precedent for future redevelopment projects.The recycling and reuse of 98.5% of materials from the decommissioned facilities demonstrate a commitment to circular economy principles, which could serve as a model for the industry. This aspect of the project may influence regulatory discussions and stakeholder expectations regarding environmental responsibility in energy infrastructure projects. Market Research Analyst The strategic importance of the Tyra hub's production capabilities cannot be understated in the context of European energy security. The hub's connectivity through export pipelines to Nybro in Denmark and Den Helder in the Netherlands enhances the resilience of the European gas supply network. The ability to efficiently deliver gas to key markets may offer TotalEnergies a competitive edge in the region, potentially affecting market dynamics and the bargaining power of gas suppliers.Long-term, the Tyra hub's role in supporting Denmark's energy independence and its contribution as a net exporter could influence regional energy policy and trade balances. For investors, the project's success may indicate the potential for stable, long-term returns, particularly as Europe seeks to diversify its energy sources amidst shifting geopolitical landscapes. 03/22/2024 - 03:00 AM PARIS & COPENHAGEN, Denmark--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News: TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) announces the restart of production from the Tyra hub in the Danish North Sea, after the completion of a major redevelopment project of this hub. At plateau, the Tyra hub will produce 5.7 million cubic meters of gas and 22,000 barrels of condensate per day, once again making Denmark self-sufficient and a net exporter of natural gas. TotalEnergies operates the Tyra field on behalf of Danish Underground Consortium, a partnership between TotalEnergies (43.2%), BlueNord (36.8%) and Nordsøfonden (20%). “We are pleased to restart the Tyra hub, one of the most technologically advanced offshore gas installations in the world.

For further details the reader is directed to the Company’s year ended December 31, 2023 Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis available on sedarplus.ca OPERATIONS REVIEW Mining efforts in 2023 focused on the Mahler, New Fold, and Mud Pond zones. Deepening of the lower Mahler ramp system provided access to high-grade ore in the Lower Mahler mining zone that supported strong grades and record metal production. It is expected that ore from this zone will continue to support budgeted zinc grades for FY2024. Mining is expected to continue in the same zones in 2024. Major projects completed include the counter-weight rail replacement for the service cage and purchase of a telehandler for underground material movement. EXPLORATION UPDATE Underground: Drill programs in 2023 targeted Lower Mahler, N2D, New Fold, and Fowler. Underground drilling totaled 58 drillholes and 29,937 ft. Of these, eight were completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, totaling 5,884 ft. Drilling has continued to target New Fold and Lower Mahler in the first quarter of 2024. All underground drilling was completed with Company-owned underground drills by Company employees. Of the total drilling, five holes were completed targeting the down dip extensions of Lower Mahler, and the area between Lower Mahler and New Fold. A total of 7,984 ft was drilled, with mineralization intercepted 600 ft down dip from the current active faces of Lower Mahler. Surface: Surface drilling in 2023 focused on the exploration and further delineation of the Turnpike project (formerly identified as Sphaleros). A total of 25 holes totaling 10,717 ft were drilled in the first and second quarters of 2023. Two holes were drilled testing the 24 Crescent target, a district target within close proximity to existing Empire State Mine infrastructure. Drilling totaled 2,023 ft. Kilbourne: Titan has begun work on further defining the Kilbourne graphite trend, a graphite exploration target hosted within the same stratigraphic sequence as ESM’s zinc mineralization. The host unit is Unit 2 of the lower marbles. Mapping and drilling have documented 8.2 km of strike length, to a depth of 1 km from surface. Approximately 2.5 km of this strike length is within the affected area of the Empire State Mine and is covered by current permitting. The remaining strike length is securely within mineral rights held by ESM. Exploration activities began in the third quarter of 2023 with surface trenching and channel sampling generating 99 samples. Based on that sampling a representative bulk sample (X tons) was sent to RDI labs in Wheat Ridge Colorado for metallurgical testing. Drilling began in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is projected to continue into the second quarter of 2024. To date, nine holes totaling 2,718 ft have been completed. Assays and Quality Assurance/Quality Control To ensure reliable sample results, the Company has a rigorous QA/QC program in place that monitors the chain-of-custody of samples and includes the insertion of blanks and certified reference standards at statistically derived intervals within each batch of samples. Core is photographed and split in half with one-half retained in a secured facility for verification purposes. Sample preparation (crushing and pulverizing) has been performed at ALS Geochemistry (“ALS”), an independent ISO/IEC accredited lab located in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. ALS prepares a pulp of all samples and sends the pulps to their analytical laboratory in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, for analysis. ALS analyzes the pulp sample by an aqua regia digestion (ME-ICP41 for 35 elements) with an ICP – AES finish including Cu (copper), Pb (lead), and Zn (zinc). All samples in which Cu (copper), Pb (lead), or Zn (zinc) are greater than 10,000 ppm are re-run using aqua regia digestion (Cu-OG46; Pb-OG46; and Zn-OG46) with the elements reported in percentage (%). Silver values are determined by an aqua regia digestion with an ICP-AES finish (ME-ICP41) with all samples with silver values greater than 100 ppm repeated using an aqua regia digestion overlimit method (Ag-OG46) calibrated for higher levels of silver contained. Gold values are determined by a 30 g fire assay with an ICP-AES finish (Au-ICP21). The Company has not identified any drilling, sampling, recovery, or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data set out in this news release. Qualified Person The scientific and technical information contained in this news release and the sampling, analytical and test data underlying the scientific and technical information has been reviewed, verified and approved by Donald R.

It currently has five commercial rare disease products: ALKINDI SPRINKLE ® , PKU GOLIKE ® , Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, and Nitisinone. Eton has three additional product candidates in late-stage development: ET-400, ET-600, and ZENEO ® hydrocortisone autoinjector. For more information, visit www.etonpharma.com .About Phenylketonuria (PKU)Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a defect of the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine (Phe), leading to a toxic buildup of Phe from the consumption of foods containing protein or aspartame. Untreated PKU can result in global developmental delay or severe irreversible intellectual disability, as well as growth failure, hypopigmentation, motor deficits, ataxia and seizures. Living with PKU requires a limited diet and very careful management. If left unmanaged, PKU can lead to devastating consequences, such as brain damage. People living with PKU do not have the ability to metabolize Phe, which is found in many foods, and they require supplementation of amino acid-based phenylalanine-free Medical Foods to prevent protein deficiency and optimize metabolic control. Currently available Medical Foods may lead to poor or suboptimal clinical outcomes and compliance because they are rapidly absorbed and are characterized by an unpleasant odor and aftertaste. Such factors contribute to barriers to social interaction for PKU patients, further limiting Medical Foods compliance and exposing patients to the risks of poor disease control.About PKU GOLIKEPKU GOLIKE ® products are Medical Foods for the dietary management of PKU in both children and adults. Developed with the Relief proprietary, patent-protected Physiomimic Technology™ drug delivery platform, PKU GOLIKE ® products are the first prolonged-release amino acid Medical Food, characterized by a special coating that ensures physiological absorption of the amino acids mirroring that of natural proteins. The special coating also masks the unpleasant taste, odor and aftertaste of the amino acids. PKU GOLIKE ® granules are flavorless and can be mixed with many foods. PKU GOLIKE ® granule products contain all 19 amino acids that people with PKU need to maintain neurological and muscular health and is fortified with vitamins and minerals, including ones normally found in protein-rich foods like iron, calcium, and vitamin B12. The PKU GOLIKE ® line of products is available in convenient packets (PKU GOLIKE Plus ® 3-16 and 16+) and medical food bars (PKU GOLIKE BAR ® ). PKU GOLIKE ® products have been commercially available in the U.S. since October 2022.

The offer document expected in April 2024, with a minimum acceptance threshold of 65% of share capital. Positive MorphoSys AG receives U.S. antitrust clearance under the HSR Act for acquisition by Novartis AG. Novartis intends to submit a voluntary public takeover offer for all outstanding MorphoSys shares at € 68.00 per share. The total equity value of the proposed takeover offer amounts to € 2.7 billion. The offer document is set to be published by Novartis in April 2024 after approval from BaFin. The acceptance period for MorphoSys shareholders to tender their shares will commence upon the publication of the offer document. The Takeover Offer requires a minimum acceptance threshold of 65% of MorphoSys' share capital. The closing of the Takeover Offer is expected to occur in the first half of 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The antitrust clearance from the United States for the acquisition of MorphoSys by Novartis is a significant milestone in the M&A landscape. This clearance indicates a green light for the merger from a regulatory standpoint, which is a critical hurdle for any deal of this magnitude. The deal is poised to reshape the competitive dynamics in the biopharmaceutical industry, particularly in the therapeutic areas where MorphoSys operates.From a market perspective, the acquisition price of €68.00 per share in cash represents a substantial investment by Novartis, with a total equity value of €2.7 billion. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring the acceptance rate of the tender offer, as the minimum threshold is set at 65% of MorphoSys' share capital. This threshold is a standard safeguard in takeover offers, ensuring that the acquiring company gains a significant level of control over the target.It is also important to note the timing of the transaction, with expectations for the deal to close in the first half of 2024. This provides a clear timeline for investors and allows for strategic planning. The market will likely react to this news with a focus on the potential for Novartis to strengthen its portfolio and drive growth through the acquisition of MorphoSys' assets. Financial Analyst The receipt of antitrust clearances in the US, Germany and Austria removes a major uncertainty surrounding the proposed acquisition of MorphoSys by Novartis. For investors, the removal of regulatory barriers often leads to adjustments in the stock prices of both entities involved. Typically, the target company's stock price may rise towards the offer price, while the acquirer's stock might react depending on how the market perceives the deal's value.Financially, the deal's impact on Novartis' balance sheet and future earnings will be scrutinized. The acquisition cost of €2.7 billion will be weighed against the potential revenue streams and synergies expected from MorphoSys' pipeline and existing products. Long-term benefits may include enhanced drug development capabilities and an expanded market presence.Regarding the tender offer, the set price of €68.00 per share will be compared against MorphoSys' current trading price and historical performance. A premium on the current market price can be indicative of Novartis' confidence in MorphoSys' value and future prospects. However, it is essential for investors to consider the potential risks, such as integration challenges and the performance of MorphoSys' pipeline post-acquisition. Legal Expert The completion of regulatory requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is a complex legal process that ensures that the proposed acquisition does not create anti-competitive issues within the market. The fact that MorphoSys has now received all mandatory regulatory approvals implies a comprehensive review by the authorities and suggests that the merger is not expected to harm competition.Legal considerations moving forward will include the adherence to the provisions of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act. The BaFin's role in approving the publication of the offer document is crucial, as it ensures that all information disclosed to the shareholders of MorphoSys meets regulatory standards for transparency and fairness.The legal stipulation of a 65% minimum acceptance threshold is a common mechanism designed to protect the interests of the acquiring company. It prevents a scenario where the acquirer does not obtain enough shares to exert meaningful control, which could lead to a complex and potentially contentious integration process. For MorphoSys' shareholders, understanding the legal terms of the offer and the implications of tendering their shares is essential for making an informed decision. 03/22/2024 - 02:50 AM PLANEGG and MUNICH, GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / March 22, 2024 / MorphoSys AG (FSE:MOR)(NASDAQ:MOR) today announced the receipt of U.S. antitrust clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the ""HSR Act"") in connection with the proposed acquisition of MorphoSys by Novartis AG (""Novartis""), following the expiration of the HSR Act waiting period.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/22/2024 - 02:23 AM OSLO, Norway, March 22, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Aker Carbon Capture has been awarded a feasibility study and an eight-months test campaign to explore the capture of CO2 emissions from WACKER's metallurgical-grade silicon production at the Holla plant in Kyrksæterøra, Norway. The German multinational chemical group has set a goal to halve its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and be net zero by 2045. Silicon metal is one of WACKER's most important raw materials for producing two key products in its portfolio: silicones and hyperpure polysilicon. Currently, the silicon metal produced in Holla covers around one-third of demand at WACKER's sites in Germany. ""We are proud to collaborate with WACKER, a pioneer of modern chemistry, on their journey towards net zero. The test campaign will provide valuable learning for implementation of our carbon capture technology in a new industry. Additionally, the feasibility study will explore commercial application of the technology at the Holla plant"", said Tove Ormevik, Director Delivery Functions and Aftermarket at Aker Carbon Capture. ""Together, we see carbon capture as a significant opportunity to reduce Norway's CO2 emissions"", she continued. Reducing emissions from the process industry is an important contributor to meeting the Norwegian climate target of 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 relative to 1990 levels. According to Statistics Norway the process industry represents approximately 20% of the total Norwegian GHG emissions, with 12 million CO2e in 2022. The European Commission recently presented a 90% net GHG emissions reduction proposal compared to 1990 levels as the recommended target for 2040. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is a solution to significantly reduce emissions from hard-to-abate sectors, such as cement, waste incineration, bioenergy, and other process industries. Aker Carbon Capture's Mobile Test Unit is a complete CO2 capture plant that includes the company's advanced carbon capture technology, meaning that the results from test campaigns are scalable towards large scale plants. It is transportable, flexible and can operate on different flue gases. Aker Carbon Capture has more than 35,000 operating hours on different flue gases around the world.

In addition, Enablence will feature an extended roadmap of planar lightwave circuit (PLC) based devices designed for optical computing, high-channel density optical interconnectivity, and LiDAR. At OFC, Enablence will preview new optics solutions that deliver high-power handling capacity, exceptionally low loss, and efficient use of space to deliver interposers and flat performance NxN routers previously not possible in the industry. OFC 2024Meet us at Booth Number 1251At OFC on Thursday, April 4th Enablence Technologies' Todd Haugen will join AFL Global, Lumentum, Infinera, VIAVI Solutions on a Lightwave Magazine industry panel to discuss how AI is transforming the optical and networking industry. AI is fast becoming a driving force for innovation within the networking industry. According to Lightwave, the AI market will easily surpass $306 Billion in 2024. Panellists will discuss a range of key insights derived from a new comprehensive AI survey conducted at OFC 2024. This is designed to help understand AI's role in shaping the future of networking. From redefining capacity to enabling proactive network management, AI is transforming traditional service providers and data center capabilities. ""AI is reshaping the optical industry in three critical areas,"" commented Todd Haugen, CEO Enablence Technologies. ""Overall network capacity will increase as large language models (LLMs) or other generative AI models proliferate, and this will drive demand for networking optics. Demand for high bandwidth, low latency intra-rack connectivity will also accelerate. LLM training is performed by data centers with racks upon racks of GPU pods (AI compute) that need massive amounts of high bandwidth, low latency interconnectivity,"" noted Haugen. ""Co-packaged optics (CPOs) and NxN routers will emerge to address this need. The rate of GPU deployment to provide AI computing is accelerating as companies like Nvidia increase production volumes and drive interconnect demand.""""Finally, the need for high throughput, low power AI computing inside the chassis will also quickly emerge. Companies such as Lightmatter.ai with its Envise product line are already bringing optics inside the chassis, significantly increasing throughput while dramatically decreasing power consumption and heat generation,"" added Haugen.According to Enablence Technologies, the demand for optics generated by AI in all three of these areas will also re-shape how optics companies invest in R&D. It will drive unprecedented growth in optics over the next 10 years. ""We are already working with customers in each of these three areas to accelerate AI transformation,"" said Haugen. At OFC, Enablence will demonstrate exceptionally low loss NxN routers with flat spectral performance across all channels previously not possible in the industry. The demonstration leverages the latest tuneable laser from Freedom Photonics, the FP4209, Fast Random-Access Tuneable Laser (InstaTune). This compact, self-contained, tuneable laser module can emit any wavelength within the specified range and resolution with usec switching times and is currently available in the C-band with future availability in the O- / L- / U-bands.

The market's reception of this offering will be a key indicator of investor confidence in Stevanato Group's growth prospects and current valuation.Investors should monitor the utilization of the net proceeds, as effective deployment could drive future growth and profitability, while inefficient use may not yield the expected return on investment. The 30-day option granted to underwriters to purchase additional shares could further affect the market's supply-demand dynamics shortly after the offering. Market Research Analyst Stevanato Group operates in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, which are known for their high capital expenditure requirements, particularly in drug containment and delivery systems. The company's decision to raise additional capital can be interpreted as a proactive move to strengthen its competitive position within the industry. The use of proceeds for investment activities and working capital needs suggests a focus on long-term operational readiness and the ability to respond to market demands.However, the timing and pricing of the offering are pivotal. A $26.00 price point needs to be assessed against the company's historical stock performance and industry multiples to determine its attractiveness to potential investors. Moreover, the involvement of prominent financial institutions as underwriters and book-runners adds a layer of credibility to the transaction, potentially increasing investor interest.Analyzing peer companies and sector-specific trends will be important in understanding the impact of this offering on Stevanato Group's market positioning. The health of the life sciences sector, regulatory environments and technological advancements are external factors that could influence the success of the company's strategic initiatives funded through this capital raise. Legal Expert The offering is being conducted under an automatic shelf registration statement on Form F-3, which has been declared effective by the SEC. This legal framework allows for a more streamlined and flexible process for companies to access public markets. The legal stipulations that the offering is subject to customary closing conditions and that no proceeds from the Selling Shareholder Offering will go to the company are standard practices in such transactions.It is also essential to consider the regulatory landscape that the company operates in. As a provider of solutions to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences industries, Stevanato Group must navigate a complex web of regulations. Compliance with these regulations, as well as the potential impact of changes in policy, can have significant implications for the company's operations and the success of its investments.Investors should be aware of the legal disclaimers indicating that the press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities, highlighting the importance of consulting the prospectus and final prospectus supplement for detailed information on the offering. This is a standard precaution to ensure compliance with securities law and to inform investors of the official channels for obtaining offering documents. 03/21/2024 - 11:45 PM PIOMBINO DESE, Italy--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Stevanato Group S.p.A.

The company plans to use the proceeds for repurchasing interests and general corporate purposes. The shares will be listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol 'AUNA'. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Auna S.A.'s initial public offering (IPO) at $12.00 per class A share represents a significant milestone for the company and has direct implications for market participants. The allocation of net proceeds to repurchase a 21.2% interest in Auna Salud S.A.C. indicates a strategic move to consolidate its business operations, which could potentially lead to increased operational efficiency and profitability. This repurchase could be viewed favorably by investors as it may signal confidence in Auna Salud's future performance.Furthermore, the decision to use additional funds to repay existing term loans and working capital facilities could improve Auna's balance sheet by reducing leverage. A healthier financial structure might make the company more resilient to economic downturns and more attractive to risk-averse investors. However, the impact of these actions on the company's financials will depend on the terms of the debt and the cost savings from lower interest payments.The listing on the New York Stock Exchange enhances the company's visibility and access to a larger pool of investors, potentially leading to greater liquidity for its shares. The choice of exchange and the timing of the IPO are essential, as they reflect the company's readiness to meet regulatory requirements and the market's appetite for new listings. Market Research Analyst Entering the New York Stock Exchange could be a strategic move for Auna, considering the NYSE's reputation and the potential for increased exposure to a diverse investor base. The performance of Auna's stock post-IPO will be an important indicator of investor confidence in the Latin American healthcare sector and Auna's business model. It is also reflective of the market's valuation of the company's growth prospects.Investors will likely monitor how effectively Auna utilizes the IPO proceeds for the stated objectives. The repurchase of interests and debt repayment are tactical financial decisions, but the long-term growth will depend on Auna's ability to capitalize on market opportunities in Latin America's healthcare industry. The company's performance in Mexico, Peru and Colombia, as well as its expansion strategies, will be critical in determining its future market share and profitability.Additionally, given the volatility of the healthcare sector, partly due to regulatory changes and the competitive landscape, investors will be keen on Auna's adaptability and innovation in service delivery. Auna's growth trajectory post-IPO could serve as a barometer for the sector's potential in emerging markets. 03/21/2024 - 11:34 PM LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Auna S.A.

Advisors ARC Group and I-Bankers Securities, Inc. provided financial advisory services. Legal counsels Rimon P.C., Stuarts Humphries, Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, Maples, and Clayton Utz were involved in the transaction. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The completion of the business combination between Australian Oilseeds and EDOC Acquisition Corp., leading to the listing of Australian Oilseeds on Nasdaq, represents a significant shift in the company's market accessibility and potential for growth. The expansion of production capacity, particularly in the context of rising global demand for organic and non-GMO food products, positions AOI to capitalize on market trends favoring healthier and sustainable food options. The doubling of cold-pressing capacity and the construction of a new multi-seed crushing plant are strategic moves that could enhance AOI's supply chain resilience and product offerings, potentially leading to increased revenue streams and market share in the APAC region.Investors and stakeholders should monitor how AOI manages its operational scale-up and whether it can maintain product quality and consistency, which are important for customer retention and brand reputation in the organic food market. The company's performance post-listing will provide insights into the market's reception of AOI's business strategy and its execution capabilities. Financial Analyst With Australian Oilseeds beginning to trade on the Nasdaq, there will likely be increased visibility and scrutiny of the company's financial health and strategic direction. The move to go public often comes with a need for enhanced transparency and may lead to a more diversified shareholder base. This transition can provide AOI with capital for further expansion and R&D, but also places pressure on the company to deliver consistent financial performance and growth.Investors should evaluate AOI's financial metrics in upcoming quarters, such as earnings growth, profit margins and return on investment, to gauge the company's ability to leverage its increased capacity and market position. The impact on the stock price will be contingent on AOI's ability to meet or exceed market expectations, manage operational costs associated with the scale-up and navigate the competitive landscape of the organic food industry. Sustainability Expert The emphasis on sustainable and non-GMO food production aligns with global trends towards environmental responsibility and health consciousness. AOI's positioning as a leader in cold-pressed oil production in the APAC region taps into consumer preferences for chemical-free and natural ingredients. The company's expansion and public listing could serve as a case study for the integration of sustainability into core business practices and the potential for market differentiation based on these values.Stakeholders should consider the long-term implications of AOI's sustainability commitments on brand loyalty and consumer trust. The ability to meet increasing demand while adhering to sustainable practices will be a key factor in AOI's success. Additionally, the company's environmental impact, including resource management and carbon footprint, will be important metrics for investors who prioritize ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria in their investment decisions. 03/21/2024 - 09:11 PM ~ Over the past 20 years, AOI has grown to be the largest cold pressing oil plant in the APAC region, pressing strictly GMO free conventional and organic oilseeds ~ ~ AOI has expanded its existing oil processing plant and is building an additional larger multi-seed crushing plant in Queensland to become the largest cold-pressed producer in the Oceanic/APAC region ~ ~ Upon Closing, Australian Oilseeds Investments Pty Ltd. will begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker “COOT” ~ Victor, NY and Cootamundra New South Wales, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Australian Oilseeds Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Australian Oilseeds”, “AOI” or “Pubco”) and EDOC Acquisition Corp., a publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company (“EDOC”), today announced they have closed their previously announced business combination (the “Business Combination”).

Patent Attorney The grant of U.S. patent 11,932,910 to Myriad Genetics underscores the importance of protecting intellectual property in the biotechnology industry. A strong patent portfolio is a critical asset for companies operating in this space, as it can deter competition and provide exclusive market rights for a certain period. The patent covers a foundational method in the preparation of cell free DNA, which is a cornerstone in the development of MRD assays.However, the scope and enforceability of the patent are key factors that will determine its actual business impact. It will be important to monitor any challenges to the patent's validity or potential infringement cases, as these could affect Myriad Genetics' ability to capitalize on its proprietary technology. Additionally, the patent's international status and corresponding protection will affect global market opportunities. Oncology Doctor The development of a high-definition MRD assay by Myriad Genetics could be a game-changer in the management of cancer. MRD assays are important for detecting minimal residual disease, which is a small number of cancer cells that remain in the patient after treatment and can lead to relapse. The patent for a method that enriches cell free DNA samples with ctDNA enhances the potential for early detection and accurate monitoring of cancer recurrence.As a clinician, the availability of such sensitive and specific tests could inform treatment decisions and follow-up strategies, potentially leading to more tailored and effective interventions. However, the clinical adoption of this assay will depend on its integration into treatment guidelines and reimbursement policies. It will also be essential to evaluate how this assay performs in real-world settings compared to traditional monitoring methods. 03/21/2024 - 09:40 PM SALT LAKE CITY, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Myriad Genetics, Inc., (NASDAQ: MYGN), a leader in genetic testing and precision medicine, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent that will strengthen its ability to deliver a tumor-informed, high-definition, molecular residual disease (MRD) assay to market. U.S. patent 11,932,910, entitled Combinatorial DNA Screening, covers Myriad’s foundational and proprietary method of preparing cell free DNA. This method describes a key aspect of tumor-informed MRD assays that detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) through sequencing. Specifically, the patented method relates to the manner in which a sample is sufficiently enriched with ctDNA that it can be detected, if present, with high sensitivity and specificity. “The 2016 filing date of this patent—at the advent of MRD development—highlights Myriad’s foresight about the potential role of tumor-derived cell-free DNA in the expanding field of cancer diagnostics,” said Paul J. Diaz, President and CEO, Myriad Genetics. “The issuance of this patent showcases some of Myriad’s novel proprietary technology that we believe will help advance Myriad’s position as a precision medicine leader—both via its own Precise MRD offering and via potential licensing opportunities in the MRD space. We have developed our Precise® MRD assay by leveraging Myriad’s existing technology, laboratory systems and processes, infrastructure and intellectual property, building upon our FDA-approved MyChoice® companion diagnostic and FirstGene platforms. We believe that our unique set of capabilities will enable us to profitably commercialize Precise MRD, advancing oncology care for patients in this emerging under-penetrated market.” Myriad has made significant strides in developing its Precise MRD assay. The test is currently being installed in the company’s new state-of-the-art laboratory facility in Salt Lake City, where it will soon undergo further validation to enable its use in a range of applications, including biopharma studies and interventional prospective trials. Myriad has announced several important research collaborations: a retrospective study of MRD efficacy in metastatic breast cancer with researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a retrospective analysis of MRD utility in metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clinicians at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and a prospective pan-cancer study beginning in May with pioneering MRD researchers at the National Cancer Center East in Japan. “We will be presenting initial learnings from our retrospective MRD studies in conferences this spring and summer, and we expect to have full results from the renal study later this year,” said Dale Muzzey, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer, Myriad Genetics. “We are on track to process samples for biopharma partners by Q4’24 and to submit to MolDx by year end, with commercial launch targeted for the second half of 2025. The approach described in the granted patent is core to our Precise MRD test, though in the years since that initial filing we have continued to refine the test, incorporating and protecting these innovations along the way.” Precise MRD is available for use in research studies pursued jointly by Myriad and academic or pharmaceutical investigators. “The sensitivity and detection limit achieved with Precise MRD allows it to perform across a wide range of indications, including those with scarce ctDNA that were not well suited to first-generation tests,” said Muzzey. “We intend for it to monitor ctDNA levels throughout a cancer patient’s clinical care, starting immediately after diagnosis and continuing through survivorship monitoring. We see significant opportunity to pair Precise MRD with MyRisk, our market-leading hereditary cancer test, and our recently acquired Precise Tumor and soon to launch Precise Liquid tests, to offer a comprehensive set of easy to use clinical decision support tools for oncologists to advance the care of patients.” About Myriad Genetics Myriad Genetics is a leading genetic testing and precision medicine company dedicated to advancing health and well-being for all. Myriad develops and offers genetic tests that help assess the risk of developing disease or disease progression and guide treatment decisions across medical specialties where genetic insights can significantly improve patient care and lower healthcare costs.

The trial aims to confirm safety and efficacy, with the first patient dosed on March 20, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of a Phase II/III clinical trial for sovleplenib by HUTCHMED marks a significant milestone in the development of treatments for warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA), a condition with currently limited therapeutic options. The progression to a registration-stage trial reflects confidence in the preliminary data and suggests a potential for the drug to meet an unmet medical need, which could translate into a substantial market opportunity. Given the rarity of wAIHA, the treatment's success could also pave the way for sovleplenib's application in other autoimmune diseases, potentially expanding its commercial viability.From a safety and efficacy standpoint, the primary endpoint—durable hemoglobin response—is a direct measure of the drug's impact on the disease's clinical manifestation. A positive outcome here would not only be promising for patient health outcomes but could also strengthen investor confidence in HUTCHMED's pipeline. However, investors should consider the inherent risks of clinical trials, including the possibility of adverse effects or failure to meet the primary endpoint, which could affect the company's stock performance. Healthcare Industry Analyst Within the healthcare sector, the advancement of sovleplenib into late-stage clinical trials is a noteworthy event, particularly for a specialized area like wAIHA. The disease's low prevalence means that the potential patient population is small, which could limit the drug's revenue potential. However, orphan drugs for rare diseases often benefit from regulatory incentives, such as extended market exclusivity and tax credits, which can enhance profitability.The collaboration with notable Chinese medical institutions and principal investigators adds credibility to the study and could facilitate faster patient recruitment and trial execution. The involvement of the China National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in the consultation process also indicates regulatory engagement, which could streamline the NDA filing and approval process if the trial data is positive. It's important for stakeholders to monitor patient enrollment rates and interim data releases, as these can provide early indications of the trial's progress and potential outcome. Financial Analyst For investors, the initiation of the registration stage of the Phase II/III clinical trial for sovleplenib represents a key inflection point in HUTCHMED's valuation. The trial's success could lead to a new drug application, which would be a major catalyst for the company's stock. The market often responds favorably to positive clinical trial outcomes, especially for drugs targeting diseases with high unmet needs. Conversely, delays or negative results could pose significant risks to the company's projected earnings and growth trajectory.Given the specifics of the trial, such as the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the results will have a high level of scientific validity, which is important for regulatory approval and market acceptance. Investors should assess the potential impact of sovleplenib on HUTCHMED's revenue, considering both the size of the wAIHA market and the possibility of premium pricing for orphan drugs. Additionally, the strategic implications of the drug's success for HUTCHMED's overall pipeline and future R&D directions should be considered in investment analyses. 03/21/2024 - 08:00 PM HONG KONG and SHANGHAI, China and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., March 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HUTCHMED (China) Limited (“HUTCHMED”) (Nasdaq/AIM:HCM; HKEX:13) today announces that it has initiated the registration stage of the Phase II/III clinical trial of sovleplenib in adult patients with warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (“wAIHA”) in China. This follows positive data from the proof-of-concept Phase II stage of the trial and subsequent consultation with the China National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”). If positive, the data from the trial may be used to support a future New Drug Application (“NDA”) filing. wAIHA is an autoimmune disorder that can lead to anemia and has limited treatment options. The first Phase III patient received their initial dose on March 20, 2024. ESLIM-02 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial. The objective of the registration stage of the study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of sovleplenib in adult patients with wAIHA. The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of patients who achieve a durable hemoglobin (Hb) response by Week 24. 21 patients have been enrolled in the study so far and approximately 90 more patients are expected to be enrolled to this registration stage. The lead principal investigators are Dr. Fengkui Zhang of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Blood Diseases Hospital, Dr. Bing Han of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Dr. Liansheng Zhang of Lanzhou University Second Hospital. Additional details may be found at clinicaltrials.gov, using identifier NCT05535933. About Sovleplenib Sovleplenib is a novel, investigational, selective small molecule inhibitor for oral administration targeting the spleen tyrosine kinase, also known as Syk. Syk is a major component in B-cell receptor and Fc receptor signaling and is an established target for the treatment of multiple subtypes of B-cell lymphomas and autoimmune disorders. HUTCHMED currently retains all rights to sovleplenib worldwide. In addition to wAIHA, sovleplenib is also being studied in immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”). ESLIM-01 (NCT05029635) is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in China of sovleplenib in patients with primary ITP that met all its endpoints. ITP is an autoimmune disorder that can lead to increased risk of bleeding. The NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for this indication and accepted the New Drug Application (NDA) for review with Priority Review in January 2024. A dose-finding study in the U.S. is in planning (NCT06291415). About wAIHA and Syk AIHA is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (“RBCs”) due to the production of antibodies against RBC. The incidence of AIHA is estimated to be 0.8-3.0/100,000 adults per year with an estimated prevalence of 17 per 100,000 adults and a death rate of 8%-11%.1,2 wAIHA is the most common form of the autoimmune hemolytic diseases,3 accounting for about 75-80% of all adult AIHA cases.4 The accelerated clearance of antibody-coated RBCs by immunoglobulin Fc receptor (“FcR”) bearing macrophages is thought to be the pathogenic mechanism in wAIHA.5 Activation of the FcR is associated with a signaling subunit, FcRγ, whose phosphorylation subsequent to receptor binding results in the recruitment and activation of Syk.6 Activated Syk mediates downstream signaling of the activated FcRs in phagocytic cells, resulting in phagocytosis of RBCs.7 In addition, activation of Syk through the B-cell receptor mediates activation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes into antibody secreting plasma cells.8 Therefore, inhibition of Syk may have potential effects in the treatment of wAIHA through inhibition of phagocytosis and reduction of antibody production. About HUTCHMED HUTCHMED (Nasdaq/AIM:​HCM; HKEX:​13) is an innovative, commercial-stage, biopharmaceutical company. It is committed to the discovery, global development and commercialization of targeted therapies and immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases.

The AGM will be held in Amsterdam on May 22, 2024, with key decisions outlined for shareholder approval. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The proposal to distribute a cash dividend of US$ 0.36 per outstanding share indicates a tangible return to shareholders, which can influence investor sentiment and the stock's attractiveness. The commitment to quarterly payments suggests a stable and predictable cash flow to investors, which is often well-received in the market. The dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the dividend and dividing by the stock price, becomes a key metric for income-focused investors.Furthermore, the authorization for share repurchases until the 2025 AGM could potentially reduce the number of outstanding shares, which may lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) if the net income remains constant or grows. This buyback program signals management's confidence in the company's valuation and future prospects, often leading to a positive market reaction. Corporate Governance Expert The reappointment of key executives and board members, such as Mr. Jean-Marc Chery and the approval of stock-based compensation, reflect the company's continuity in leadership and compensation philosophy. These decisions can impact investor trust and the long-term strategy of the company. Stock-based compensation aligns the interests of executives with shareholders, as it ties a portion of their earnings to the company's performance. However, excessive reliance on stock-based compensation can also dilute existing shareholders' equity if not managed carefully.The amendment to the Articles of Association and the approval of a new 3-year Unvested Stock Award Plan for Management and Key Employees are also critical. They can affect the control structure and incentive mechanisms within the company, potentially influencing its strategic direction and operational effectiveness. Securities Regulation Expert The shift in the settlement standard by the SEC to t+1 in the US, while Europe remains at t+2, may have implications for liquidity and cross-border trading. This adjustment could lead to increased efficiency and reduced credit risk in the US market. Investors and traders might need to adapt their strategies accordingly, especially those dealing with arbitrage opportunities or who are active in both markets.It is essential for investors to be aware of the ex-dividend, record and payment dates for dividends, as these dates determine eligibility for dividend payments. The restricted transfer between New York and Dutch registered shares around these dates is a standard anti-dilution measure to ensure that dividends are paid only to eligible shareholders. 03/21/2024 - 07:40 PM STMicroelectronics Reports on Resolutions to be Proposed at the 2024 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Amsterdam, March 22, 2024 - STMicroelectronics (NYSE: STM), a global semiconductor leader serving customers across the spectrum of electronics applications, announced the resolutions to be submitted for adoption at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) which will be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on May 22, 2024.

Positive None. Negative High loan interest rates exceeding prime rate, declining gold and silver prices impacting cash flow projections, cancellation of mine agreement due to water rights payment issues, focus shift from current project to TMRC/Alhambra project 03/21/2024 - 10:47 PM ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- In early November 2023, the Company initiated discussions with a firm in Texas with the objective of securing capital essential for the acquisition of the mill, its construction on the site in Duncan, AZ, refurbishment of two mines for approval by MSHA, and provision of working capital for the initial mining and mill operation ramp up. During this period, the Company faced challenges regarding water rights payments, resulting in the cancellation of the mine agreement by the water rights holders around mid- November. Despite encountering setbacks, the Company diligently pursued financing opportunities, providing comprehensive information and supplementary materials on the mining property and district. Subsequently, detailed listings of necessary equipment acquisitions and cost projections for mine refurbishment were submitted during ongoing discussions. Following a thorough review and editing process of projected costs, a 15-month cash and operational cash flow plan was developed, submitted, and deliberated upon. Due to the holiday season, these discussions extended into late January 2024. In late January, the Company received details concerning the projected cost to finance the required loan request. The proposed loan interest rate notably exceeded the current prime rate, compounded by a market downturn in gold and silver prices. Additionally, monthly mine payments were slated to increase to $175,000, further exacerbated by the fluctuating and declining value of precious metals from time to time, resulting in an approximate decrease in the cash flow projection of $500,000. Considering these developments and mindful of preserving the Company’s stability, particularly the consideration of the past challenges faced in 2015 and 2016, the Company has made the decision to withdraw from the aforementioned project. Instead, focus will be redirected towards the long-term objectives of the TMRC/Alhambra project.

(PROK) releases financial results for 2023, showing significant revenue growth and positive clinical developments in CKD treatments.","ProKidney Reports Full Year 2023 Financial Results and Recent Corporate Highlights Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary ProKidney Corp. (PROK) releases financial results for 2023, showing significant revenue growth and positive clinical developments in CKD treatments. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement from ProKidney Corp. regarding its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, represents a critical inflection point for investors and stakeholders. The performance of a late clinical-stage company such as ProKidney is heavily scrutinized for its ability to manage cash burn and secure funding for ongoing trials and operations. As the company is in the late stages of clinical development, the financial results will indicate how effectively the company is progressing towards commercialization and what runway it has before needing additional capital.Investors should examine key financial metrics such as earnings, revenue growth and cash reserves. For a company in the biotech sector, the burn rate is particularly important as it can signal the company's capacity to continue operations without the immediate need for additional financing. A comparison of these results with industry benchmarks can provide insights into the company's operational efficiency and market potential. Medical Research Analyst ProKidney's focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD) places it in a high-impact medical field with significant unmet needs. CKD affects millions globally and is a growing concern due to aging populations and rising incidences of diabetes and hypertension. The financial health of ProKidney can be indicative of its potential to bring new therapies to market, which could disrupt current treatment paradigms.Understanding the company's pipeline progress, especially in late clinical stages, is essential. The success or failure of their cellular therapeutics technology could have profound implications for the future of CKD treatment. If ProKidney's financial results suggest that they are on a stable path, this could signal upcoming milestones such as new partnerships, trial completions, or even preparation for a product launch. Each of these milestones can have a significant impact on the company's valuation and the broader market for CKD treatments. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, ProKidney's financial results also serve as a barometer for investor sentiment in the biotechnology sector, particularly in niche markets like CKD. Positive financial results can boost confidence not only in ProKidney but in similar companies within the space, potentially leading to increased investments across the sector. Conversely, if the financials are weaker than expected, it may reflect broader challenges faced by companies operating in this therapeutic area.It's also important to consider the competitive landscape. How ProKidney's financial position compares to its peers could influence partnership opportunities, merger and acquisition activity and overall market dynamics. The company's ability to allocate resources effectively towards marketing and sales efforts post-approval will be important in gaining market share once its product reaches the market. 03/21/2024 - 07:49 PM WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ProKidney Corp. (Nasdaq: PROK) (“ProKidney” or the “Company""), a leading late clinical-stage cellular therapeutics company focused on chronic kidney disease (CKD), today announced financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. “We are very excited about the future of ProKidney. Building on the positive interim Phase 2 data that we released last Fall for rilparencel (which we sometimes refer to as REACT®) demonstrating the potential to preserve kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced kidney disease, we look forward to the REGEN-007 Phase 2 interim data readout mid-year,” said Bruce Culleton, Chief Executive Officer at ProKidney. “Our clinical data to date have shown that rilparencel may meet a current unmet medical need by preserving kidney function and delaying the onset of dialysis in high-risk patients with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes. Rilparencel has the potential to be very meaningful to this high-risk patient population where there are limited options for care outside of preparing for transplantation or dialysis.” Corporate Updates Appointment of Dr. Bruce Culleton as ProKidney CEO. In November, the Company announced Dr. Bruce Culleton assumed the role of the CEO and joined the ProKidney board of directors. Dr. Culleton joined ProKidney in July 2023 as Executive Vice President of Clinical Development and Commercialization. Dr. Culleton has dedicated his 25-year professional career to improving the health and quality of life of patients with kidney disease and held executive leadership positions at Baxter Healthcare and CVS Kidney Care, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Health. Appointment of Nikhil Pereira-Kamath as Chief Business Officer. As CBO, Mr. Pereira-Kamath has global responsibility for commercial strategy, defining the Company’s growth and partnering activities, and overseeing the Company’s project management, business development and investor relations, bringing with him over a decade of experience as a seasoned entrepreneur in addition to a strong foundation in finance. Mr. Periera-Kamath had previously joined ProKidney in July 2023 as Vice President of Business Development & Innovative Solutions. Prior to joining ProKidney, he was Chief Executive Officer and subsequently Chairman of the Board, a role he continues to hold, of Africa Healthcare Network (AHN), the largest independent provider of dialysis and kidney care in sub-Saharan Africa. Clinical Development Updates Reported positive interim Phase 2 RMCL-002 study data in November, demonstrating the potential of rilparencel to preserve kidney function in moderate and high-risk patients with CKD caused by type 2 diabetes. Updated data include information from 83 patients enrolled in the RMCL-002 study and demonstrated a safety profile in line with previous rilparencel Phase 1 & 2 trials, and similar to that of a kidney biopsy.As disclosed in November 2023, overall, the updated RMCL-002 data showed preservation of kidney function in several patient groups with advanced CKD caused by type 2 diabetes. Patients with Stage 4 CKD with severe albuminuria-- broadly viewed to have the highest risk of kidney failure and where there remains a significant unmet clinical need-- showed the most potential benefit. Full results from RMCL-002 are expected in 1H 2024.Based on these emerging results, as disclosed in November 2023, the Company is updating its ongoing PROACT 1 Phase 3 clinical study (REGEN-006) protocol to focus on patients with higher risk of kidney failure. In the PROACT 1 Phase 3 clinical study, the eGFR enrollment range will be modified from the current range of ≥20 to ≤ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 to a new range of ≥20 to ≤ 35 ml/min/1.73m2. The Company believes that this focus on the most severe patients will better align with RMCL-002 results and clinical feedback. No changes are planned for the Phase 3 trial, PROACT 2 (REGEN-016), which is currently ≥20 to ≤ 44 ml/min/1.73m2. Maintaining the eGFR enrollment range of PROACT 2, which includes the CKD Stage 3b population, will enable the Company to seek a broader commercial label. Manufacturing has been temporarily paused while ProKidney amends the PROACT 1 protocol and concurrently, in response to Qualified Person Audit, optimizes capabilities to meet EU and Global manufacturing and quality management system standards for Phase 3 studies and prepares for transition to commercial manufacturing. No safety events were responsible for this pause and the Company expects PROACT 1 will resume, and PROACT 2 will commence, enrollment in mid-2024.Interim results from the ongoing REGEN-007 Phase 2 open-label trial of rilparencel in patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD caused by type 2 diabetes is expected in mid-2024, with full Cohort 1 12 month follow up data anticipated in 1H 2025. Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights Liquidity: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2023, totaled $363.0 million, compared to $490.3 million on December 31, 2022. We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held at December 31, 2023, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2025. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $106.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $82.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase of $24.6 million was driven primarily by increases in clinical trial costs related to our Phase 3 program of approximately $16.6 million. Additionally, we have seen increases in cash and equity compensation costs of approximately $17.2 million as we continue to hire additional personnel in the areas of clinical development, quality, manufacturing, and biostatistics to support our ongoing clinical trials. Further, we have seen increases in other research and development costs of approximately $4.7 million primarily related to additional spending on manufacturing improvements, materials and professional fees. These costs have been offset by decreases in equity-based payments for services rendered by a third party in the year ended December 31, 2022. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $44.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared $70.9 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease of $26.1 million has been primarily driven by decreases of $33.0 million associated with the recognition of equity-based compensation costs in 2022 for shares sold at less than their fair value prior to the business combination Additionally, there have been decreases in costs related to equity-based compensation and costs related to the business combination that occurred in 2022. These decreases have been offset by increases in professional fees and cash compensation costs of approximately $7.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Net Loss Before Noncontrolling Interest: Net loss before noncontrolling interest was $135.4 million and $148.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Shares outstanding: Class A and Class B ordinary shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023 totaled 228,178,263.

Financial Analyst Reviewing FedEx Corp.'s recent financial report highlights several areas of interest for shareholders and potential investors. The 19% year-over-year increase in operating income and the 16% adjusted basis increase signal effective cost management and operational efficiency, likely reflecting positively on stock valuation. The reduction in capital spending forecast, from $5.7 billion to $5.4 billion, suggests a strategic reallocation of resources, which could improve free cash flow and potentially benefit share price.The announcement of an additional $500 million share repurchase in the fourth quarter, along with a new $5 billion share repurchase program, is a strong indication of management's confidence in the company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. Historically, such buybacks can be seen as a positive signal to the market, often resulting in a bullish outlook for the stock as it indicates a surplus of cash and a potentially undervalued share price.However, the narrowed full-year earnings outlook range requires careful consideration. While it may reflect management's confidence in meeting targets, it also reduces the margin for error. Investors should monitor subsequent performance closely, especially given the uncertain economic environment and potential volatility in fuel prices. Market Research Analyst The DRIVE program's impact on FedEx's operational efficiency is noteworthy. By focusing on cost reduction and revenue quality, FedEx appears to be successfully navigating a challenging demand environment. This strategic initiative could be a differentiator in the competitive logistics sector, potentially increasing FedEx's market share and strengthening its position against rivals.Additionally, the low-single-digit percentage decline in forecasted revenue year over year should be contextualized within the broader industry trends, such as e-commerce growth and global trade patterns. Investors would benefit from understanding how FedEx's digital innovations and network optimization align with these trends. A company's ability to modernize and adapt to changing market conditions is often a critical factor in long-term success and stock performance.The permanent cost reductions from the DRIVE transformation program, estimated at $1.8 billion, could significantly improve the company's competitive edge by allowing it to offer more aggressive pricing or invest in new growth areas. This is particularly important as the logistics industry faces increasing pressure from new entrants and changing consumer expectations. Economist From an economic perspective, FedEx's financial results and forecasts provide insights into the broader economic landscape. The revenue decline projection may reflect subdued global economic activity and trade headwinds, which could have implications for other sectors reliant on shipping and transportation services. The company's performance is often seen as a bellwether for global economic health, given its international operations and role in supply chains.The capital spending reduction and focus on efficiency improvements through fleet and facility modernization are indicative of a strategic shift towards cost control in an uncertain economic environment. This aligns with broader economic trends where businesses are preparing for potential downturns by streamlining operations and preserving capital.FedEx's commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040 is also significant, as it reflects the growing importance of sustainability in corporate strategy. This goal may influence investor sentiment, particularly among those prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria and could impact the company's long-term financial performance by preemptively addressing regulatory risks and consumer demand shifts towards greener options. 03/21/2024 - 04:08 PM Operating Income Up 19% Year Over Year; Up 16% on an Adjusted Basis Reduces Capital Spending Forecast Plans Additional $500 Million Share Repurchase in Fourth Quarter Board of Directors Authorizes New $5 Billion Share Repurchase Program Narrows Full-Year Earnings Outlook Range MEMPHIS, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FedEx Corp. (NYSE: FDX) today reported the following consolidated results for the third quarter ended February 29 (adjusted measures exclude the items listed below): Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 As Reported (GAAP) Adjusted (non-GAAP) As Reported (GAAP) Adjusted (non-GAAP) Revenue $21.7 billion $21.7 billion $22.2 billion $22.2 billion Operating income $1.24 billion $1.36 billion $1.04 billion $1.17 billion Operating margin 5.7% 6.2% 4.7% 5.3% Net income $879 million $966 million $771 million $865 million Diluted EPS $3.51 $3.86 $3.05 $3.41 This year’s and last year’s quarterly consolidated results have been adjusted for: Impact per diluted share Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 Business optimization costs $0.35 $0.36 Business realignment costs — 0.01 Third quarter income and margin improved despite lower revenue, primarily due to execution of the company's DRIVE program and the continued focus on revenue quality. “FedEx delivered another quarter of improved profitability in what remains a difficult demand environment, reflecting outstanding service and continued benefits from DRIVE,” said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief executive officer. “We are making meaningful progress on our transformation, while strengthening our value proposition and improving the customer experience. I've never been more confident in our path ahead as we build a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network.” FedEx Express operating results improved due to lower structural costs resulting from DRIVE initiatives and the benefit from one additional operating day, partially offset by lower revenue. FedEx Ground operating results increased due to lower structural costs resulting from DRIVE initiatives, higher base yield, and reduced self-insurance costs. Cost per package was flat, as lower line-haul expense and improved dock productivity offset higher first- and last-mile costs. FedEx Freight operating results decreased due to lower fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment and lower shipments, partially offset by higher base yield and the benefit from one additional operating day. Last year's third quarter operating income included a $30 million gain on the sale of a facility. Share Repurchase Program The company completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) transaction during the quarter. Approximately 4.1 million shares were delivered under the ASR agreement. The year-to-date decrease in outstanding shares benefited third quarter results by $0.09 per diluted share. FedEx expects to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock during the fiscal fourth quarter, which will bring the fiscal 2024 buyback total to $2.5 billion. The FedEx Corp. Board of Directors has also authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, in addition to the existing $0.6 billion that remains available for repurchase under the 2021 authorization. Cash on-hand as of February 29, 2024 was $5.6 billion. “DRIVE is having a real impact, supporting both operating income growth and margin expansion,” said John Dietrich, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. “As we look ahead, we’re focused on continuing to deliver on DRIVE and our commitments to support long-term shareholder returns.” Outlook FedEx is unable to forecast the fiscal 2024 mark-to-market (MTM) retirement plans accounting adjustments. As a result, FedEx is unable to provide a fiscal 2024 earnings per share or effective tax rate (ETR) outlook on a GAAP basis and is relying on the exemption provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is reasonably possible that the fiscal 2024 MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on fiscal 2024 consolidated financial results and ETR. For fiscal 2024, FedEx expects: A low-single-digit percentage decline in revenue year over year; Earnings per diluted share of $15.65 to $16.65 before the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, compared to the prior forecast of $15.35 to $16.85 per diluted share; Earnings per diluted share of $17.25 to $18.25 before the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments after also excluding costs related to business optimization initiatives, compared to the prior forecast of $17.00 to $18.50 per diluted share; Permanent cost reductions from the DRIVE transformation program of $1.8 billion; ETR of approximately 25% prior to the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments; and Capital spending of $5.4 billion, compared to the prior forecast of $5.7 billion, with a priority on investments to improve efficiency, including fleet and facility modernization, network optimization, and automation. These forecasts assume the company's current economic forecast and fuel price expectations, successful completion of the planned stock repurchases, and no additional adverse geopolitical developments. FedEx’s ETR and earnings per share forecasts are based on current law and related regulations and guidance. Corporate Overview FedEx Corp.

The financial section of this release is provided on the company's website at investors.fedex.com RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 Results The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or “reported”). We have supplemented the reporting of our financial information determined in accordance with GAAP with certain non-GAAP (or “adjusted”) financial measures, including our adjusted third quarter fiscal 2024 and 2023 consolidated operating income and margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, adjusted third quarter fiscal 2024 FedEx Express and FedEx Ground segment operating income and margin and adjusted third quarter fiscal 2023 FedEx Express segment operating income and margin. These financial measures have been adjusted to exclude the effects of the following items (as applicable): Business optimization costs incurred in fiscal 2024 and 2023; and Business realignment costs incurred in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company’s long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We incurred costs associated with our business optimization initiatives in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023. These costs were primarily related to professional services and severance. Business optimization costs are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. Additionally, we incurred costs associated with our business realignment activities in connection with the FedEx Express workforce reduction plan in Europe in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. These costs were related to certain employee severance arrangements. Costs related to business optimization initiatives and business realignment activities are excluded from our third quarter fiscal 2024 and 2023 consolidated and FedEx Express and FedEx Ground segment non-GAAP financial measures, as applicable, because they are unrelated to our core operating performance and to assist investors with assessing trends in our underlying businesses. We believe these adjusted financial measures facilitate analysis and comparisons of our ongoing business operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the company’s and our business segments’ core operating performance, and may assist investors with comparisons to prior periods and assessing trends in our underlying businesses. These adjustments are consistent with how management views our businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and evaluating the company’s and each business segment’s ongoing performance. Our non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement and should be read together with, and are not an alternative or substitute for, and should not be considered superior to, our reported financial results. Accordingly, users of our financial statements should not place undue reliance on these non-GAAP financial measures. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. As required by SEC rules, the tables below present a reconciliation of our presented non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Fiscal 2024 Earnings Per Share and Effective Tax Rate Forecasts Our fiscal 2024 earnings per share (EPS) forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes fiscal 2024 mark-to-market (MTM) retirement plans accounting adjustments and estimated costs related to business optimization initiatives in fiscal 2024. Our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate (ETR) forecast is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effect of fiscal 2024 MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments. We have provided these non-GAAP financial measures for the same reasons that were outlined above for historical non-GAAP measures. Costs related to business optimization initiatives are excluded from our fiscal 2024 EPS forecast for the same reasons described above for historical non-GAAP measures. We are unable to predict the amount of the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments, as they are significantly affected by changes in interest rates and the financial markets, so such adjustments are not included in our fiscal 2024 EPS and ETR forecasts. For this reason, a full reconciliation of our fiscal 2024 EPS and ETR forecasts to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is impracticable. It is reasonably possible, however, that our fiscal 2024 MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments could have a material effect on our fiscal 2024 consolidated financial results and ETR. The table included below titled “Fiscal 2024 Earnings Per Share Forecast” outlines the effects of the items that are excluded from our fiscal 2024 EPS forecast, other than the MTM retirement plans accounting adjustments.

Fourth-Quarter Results The 2023 fourth-quarter revenue from continuing operations for Autoscope Technologies Corporation (“AATC” or the “Company”), which includes the results of Image Sensing Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AATC (“ISNS”), was $2.6 million compared to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenue from royalties was $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $2.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 5 percent increase. The increase in royalties resulted from increased selling prices and continued strong demand for Autoscope Vision in North America. Product sales were $102,000 in the 2023 fourth quarter compared to $32,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 219 percent increase. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased sales of Wrong Way detection products. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 93 percent, a 1-percentage point decrease from a gross margin of 94 percent for the same period in 2022. Royalty gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was unchanged at 96 percent. Product sales gross margin percent for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 16 percent compared to (53) percent in the prior year period. The increase in the product sales gross margin percent was the result of higher sales of Wrong Way detection products, which have higher margins due to the lack of fixed costs associated with capitalized software development amortization. Investment income was $178,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $41,000 in the prior year period. The increase in investment income is a result of the increased investments, primarily in debt securities. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $437,000 compared to a tax expense of $189,000 in the prior year period. The tax benefit resulted from changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The Company reported net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2023 of $1.1 million or $0.20 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $103,000 or $0.02 per basic and diluted share in the prior year period. This increase is primarily due to increased royalty revenue, increased investment income, and the income tax benefit recognized during the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Full Year Results Revenue from continuing operations increased $4.6 million in 2023 compared to 2022. Royalty income increased to $13.0 million in 2023 compared to $8.2 million in 2022, an increase of 58.4 percent. The increase in royalty revenue resulted primarily from the increased availability of components to fulfill the sales order backlog in 2023 compared to 2022 in addition to increased end user selling prices and strong market demand for Autoscope Vision in North America. Product sales decreased to $173,000 in 2023 from $366,000 in 2022, a decrease of 52.7 percent. The decrease in product sales was primarily due to the expected decline of the Company’s legacy video detection product sold in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) markets. Gross margins increased to 94.4 percent in 2023 compared to 91.5 percent in 2022. Gross margins on royalty sales increased to 96.7 percent in 2023 compared to 94.9 percent in 2022. Gross profit for royalties in 2023 increased $4.6 million or 58.9 percent compared to the prior year. The increase in royalty gross profits and percentage is primarily the result of increased volume and increased end user selling prices for Autoscope Vision. Gross margin on product sales decreased to (74.0) percent in 2023 from 16.1 percent in 2022. Product sales gross profit in 2023 decreased $187,000 or 316.9 percent compared to the prior year. The decrease in product sales gross margin percent was the result of lower margin sales on planned discontinued video detection products, as well as inventory obsolescence recognized for these discontinued products and fixed costs associated with capitalized software development cost amortization. Investment income was $377,000 for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in investment income is a result of the increased investments, primarily in debt securities. Consolidated net income from continuing operations was $4.5 million, or $0.83 per basic and diluted share, in 2023 compared to $149,000, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, in 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2023, we had $6.5 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $1.2 million on December 31, 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased to $5.0 million in 2023 compared to net cash used by operating activities of continuing operations of $0.6 million in 2022. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased in 2023 compared to the prior year primarily as the result of higher net income, higher accounts payable, lower accounts receivables, and lower deferred taxes offset by higher inventory in 2023 compared to 2022. Net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations was $2.0 million in 2023 compared to net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations of $5.0 million in 2022. The decrease in the amount of net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations in 2023 compared to the prior year is primarily the result of lower net activity of purchases and sales of securities, lower purchases of property and equipment and lower capitalized software development costs. To generate a greater return on our cash position, the Company purchased and sold various debt and equity securities, the net of which was $2.0 million during 2023, compared to $4.4 million in 2022. Net cash used by financing activities of continuing operations was $2.9 million in 2023 compared to net cash used of $2.6 million in 2022. The increase in net cash used for financing activities of continuing operations is primarily due to higher quarterly cash dividends paid in 2023 compared to 2022. The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.13 per share in 2023 compared to quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share in 2022. “Overall, we are pleased with our top-line performance as demand for Autoscope Vision remains strong. The 2023 sale of the RTMS radar business has enabled us to focus our resources on creating additional value by leveraging our video detection expertise with the benefit of a reduction in overall operational expenses.

The company focuses on advancing SENTI-202 in the U.S. and SENTI-301A in China, with promising pipeline programs. Financially, Senti Bio holds $35.9 million in cash and expects operations funded into Q1 2025. Positive Successful clearance of IND for SENTI-202 by the U.S. FDA in December 2023. Strategic collaboration with Celest Therapeutics for clinical development of SENTI-301A in China. Financially sound with $35.9 million in cash and anticipated receivables from GeneFab transaction. Focus on advancing SENTI-202 in the U.S. and SENTI-301A in China to bring new treatments to patients. Resource allocation efforts to streamline business operations and extend cash runway into Q1 2025. Negative Net loss of $18.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and $71.1 million for the full year. Increase in research & development expenses from $7.0 million to $9.1 million for Q4 2023 compared to 2022. General and administrative expenses of $9.3 million for Q4 2023 and $37.2 million for the full year 2023. Non-recurring $12.3 million gain from discontinued operations and $25.7 million impairment related to the GeneFab transaction affecting net loss. Medical Research Analyst The FDA's clearance of the IND for SENTI-202, a novel CAR-NK cell therapy for AML, represents a significant milestone for Senti Biosciences. The transition from preclinical to clinical stages is a pivotal moment for biotech firms, as it validates the therapeutic's potential and can significantly influence investor sentiment. The anticipated initiation of dosing in a Phase 1 trial presents an inflection point where early efficacy and durability data will be scrutinized for signs of clinical benefit and safety profile.AML, being a high unmet medical need and the novelty of Logic Gated CAR-NK cell therapies, which aim to enhance specificity and reduce off-target effects, could position SENTI-202 as a disruptive force if clinical outcomes are positive. The therapeutic's progress will likely be monitored closely, as success in early trials could lead to partnership opportunities, licensing deals, or even buyout speculation, each carrying implications for stock volatility and liquidity.However, the high costs associated with R&D in biotech, particularly in the cell and gene therapy space, can strain financial resources. Senti Bio's reported increase in R&D expenses from 2022 to 2023 reflects the typical trajectory as programs advance, but it also underscores the importance of strategic partnerships and the necessity of a solid cash runway, which Senti Bio estimates to extend into the first quarter of 2025. Financial Analyst Senti Bio's financial results highlight a common narrative in the biotech industry: significant R&D investments leading to net losses. The reported net loss widening from 2022 to 2023 can be attributed to increased R&D spending and an impairment charge related to leasehold improvements. However, the non-recurring gain from discontinued operations suggests a one-time financial boost that investors should not expect to recur.Investors should note the company's cash position of $35.9 million, bolstered by an anticipated $18.9 million receivable from the GeneFab transaction. This liquidity is critical for sustaining operations without the immediate need for dilutive financing. Nonetheless, the dependency on certain conditions being met for the GeneFab receivable introduces an element of risk.The stock market reaction to such news typically involves weighing the potential of the clinical pipeline against the financial health of the company. While the extended cash runway is reassuring, the inherent risks of drug development, such as trial failures or regulatory setbacks, persist and can rapidly alter the investment thesis. Therefore, monitoring the burn rate and pipeline progress remains paramount for evaluating Senti Bio's financial trajectory. Biotech Market Analyst The biotech sector is known for its volatility, driven by binary events such as clinical trial results and regulatory approvals. Senti Bio's IND clearance for SENTI-202 places it within a competitive landscape where innovation and speed to market are key. The potential 'first-in-class' status of SENTI-202 may provide competitive advantages in the AML treatment domain, but it also faces the challenge of proving its efficacy and safety against existing treatments and other therapies in development.The strategic focus on SENTI-202 and SENTI-301A and the scaling back of other programs, indicates a targeted allocation of resources, which is often well-received by investors seeking clear strategic direction. However, the biotech market is sensitive to both clinical and financial milestones. As such, the collaboration with Celest Therapeutics in China opens up a significant market for SENTI-301A and success there could serve as a catalyst for the company's valuation.It is essential to contextualize Senti Bio's updates within broader market trends, including the increasing interest in cell and gene therapies. The company's strategic partnerships and prioritization of resources may be seen as a proactive approach to navigating a challenging financial landscape while pursuing innovative treatments with the potential to address unmet medical needs. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM – IND for SENTI-202, a potential first-in-class logic-gated treatment for AML, cleared by the U.S. FDA; First patient dosing anticipated in the second quarter of 2024 – – Cash and anticipated receivables from GeneFab transaction expected to fund operations into the first quarter of 2025 – SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Senti Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNTI) (“Senti Bio” or the “Company”), a biotechnology company developing next-generation cell and gene therapies using its proprietary Gene Circuit platform, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “In 2023, we achieved several critical milestones including clearing our first Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for SENTI-202, entering into a strategic collaboration agreement with Celest Therapeutics for the clinical development of SENTI-301A to treat solid tumors in China, and establishing a manufacturing partnership with GeneFab that will support the manufacturing of our oncology programs,” said Timothy Lu, MD, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Senti Bio. “We also made strategic decisions to focus our resources on advancing SENTI-202 in the U.S. and SENTI-301A in China through our partnership with Celest, with the goal of bringing new treatments to patients.” Dr. Lu continued, “We will continue to advance our pipeline programs to demonstrate the potential of Gene Circuits including the clinical-scale manufacturing of chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (“CAR-NK”) cells. Additionally, we are continuing our efforts to develop next-generation cell and gene therapies in areas outside of oncology through our collaborations with Spark Therapeutics and BlueRock Therapeutics.” CORPORATE UPDATES Prioritization of clinical programs: In January 2024, Senti Bio announced plans to streamline its business operations and prioritize the clinical development of SENTI-202, a potential first-in-class, off-the-shelf Logic Gated CAR-NK investigational cell therapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”). Additionally, the Company will continue to support the clinical development activities of SENTI-301A for the treatment of advanced glypican 3 (“GPC3”)-expressing hepatocellular carcinoma (“HCC”) in China through its partnership with Celest Therapeutics (Shanghai) Co. Ltd (“Celest”). Strategic steps included the scaling back of all other research and development initiatives while continuing to support ongoing partnerships with Spark Therapeutics and BlueRock Therapeutics. The Company expects that these resource allocation efforts, combined with other expected receivables, will extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2025. PIPELINE HIGHLIGHTS SENTI-202 for AML: In December 2023, Senti Bio announced the IND application for SENTI-202 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Phase 1 clinical trial will focus on relapsed/refractory AML patients in the U.S. and Australia. The Company anticipates the following from the Phase 1 clinical trial: First patient dosed in the second quarter of 2024Initial efficacy data by year-end 2024Initial durability data in 2025 SENTI-301A for HCC: In November 2023, Senti Bio announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Celest, a China-based biotechnology company, for the clinical development of SENTI-301A to treat solid tumors in China. Celest plans to enroll patients initially through a pilot trial in mainland China and expects to dose the first patient in the second quarter of 2024. SENTI-301A is a calibrated release (cr) IL-15 multi-armed off-the-shelf CAR-NK cell therapy designed for the treatment of GPC3-expressing tumors, including HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer.

(HQI) reported financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, showing revenue growth but decreased net income. Franchise royalties and total revenue increased, but SG&A expenses surged due to workers' compensation costs and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly. The CEO highlighted growth strategies, acquisitions, and cost control efforts for future profitability. Positive Franchise royalties and total revenue increased in Q4 and full year 2023. SG&A expenses rose significantly due to workers' compensation costs and acquisitions. Net income from continuing operations decreased in both Q4 and full year 2023. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly in Q4 2023. CEO emphasized growth strategies, acquisitions, and cost control efforts for future profitability. Negative Net income from continuing operations decreased significantly in Q4 and full year 2023. SG&A expenses surged due to workers' compensation costs and acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA declined slightly in Q4 2023. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from HireQuest indicate a mixed performance, with significant revenue growth but a notable decline in net income and adjusted EBITDA. This divergence is primarily attributed to increased SG&A expenses, particularly workers' compensation costs. The company's strategy to manage these expenses going forward will be critical to their financial health. Additionally, the impact of recent acquisitions, such as MRINetwork and TEC Staffing Services, on the company's financials highlights the importance of effective integration and cost control in M&A activities.Investors should pay attention to the company's efforts to mitigate the increased workers' compensation expense, as it has a direct impact on profitability. The company's commitment to a dividend, despite the decreased net income, suggests confidence in future cash flows. However, the sustainability of this policy should be monitored in light of the company's financial performance. Market Research Analyst The staffing industry is sensitive to economic cycles and HireQuest's ability to grow revenue in a challenging economic climate reflects resilience and effective execution of its growth strategy. The company's focus on diversification through acquisitions could bolster its position in the market. However, the general decline in system-wide sales from existing operations suggests underlying industry headwinds that may persist.Investors should consider the long-term viability of HireQuest's growth strategy, particularly how the company adapts to industry trends and economic conditions. The emphasis on earnings per share over absolute earnings is a strategic focus that could appeal to investors looking for efficiency and profitability. Risk Management Expert Workers' compensation is a significant risk factor for staffing companies and HireQuest's increased expenses in this area have adversely affected their bottom line. Their proactive steps to manage this risk could be a critical factor in improving future profitability. The increase in SG&A expenses, even after excluding non-recurring costs, warrants a closer look at the company's operational efficiency and cost management practices.From a risk perspective, the company's liquidity and capital structure remain important. The available line of credit and the reduced total liabilities from the previous year provide some financial flexibility. However, the decrease in cash reserves could be a concern if the company faces unexpected expenses or a downturn in the staffing industry. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM GOOSE CREEK, SC / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2024 / HireQuest, Inc.

The increase in SG&A is primarily due to a $1.2 million net increase in workers' compensation expense, the inclusion of MRINetwork's advertising fund expenses of $515,000, as well as increased expenses to support growth in system-wide sales as a result of organic growth and acquisitions. Excluding workers' compensation, impairment of notes receivable, and MRINetwork's advertising fund, SG&A for the quarter would have increased 2.1% to $4.5 million compared to $4.4 million in the prior year period.Income from operations decreased 12.2% to $2.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period.Net income from continuing operations was $467,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, a decrease of 82.3% compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the prior year period, primarily related to increased SG&A expenses and other miscellaneous expenses related to the resale of TEC Staffing Services' offices to franchisees in the quarter. Net income was $16,000 compared to $2.7 million in the prior year period.Adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million compared to $4.4 million in the prior year period.Full Year 2023 SummaryFranchise royalties increased 23.9% to $35.8 million compared to $28.9 million in the prior year period.Total revenue increased 22.4% to $37.9 million compared to $31.0 million in the prior year period.

As a provider of temporary labor and commercial staffing services, workers compensation insurance is an essential component of our business. While this expense increased in 2023, we have taken steps to reduce its potential impact going forward and expect to see those efforts manifest in 2024.""""We continued our acquisition strategy in 2023 while maintaining our strong balance sheet. The acquisition of TEC Staffing Services in the fourth quarter expanded our Snelling operations in northwest and central Arkansas. As previously mentioned, TEC has been fully integrated and required de minimis additional overhead. We believe TEC royalties will be highly accretive to our results in 2024 and restore some of the operating leverage lost in a challenging staffing economy. Moreover, the integration of MRINetwork is largely complete and the business is demonstrating healthy profitability despite lower revenues as a result of industry headwinds. Overall, we're pleased with the performance of our acquisition strategy, and we continue to monitor the market for accretive M&A opportunities. We are a more diversified company than five years ago, and we will continue on this path to build resilience into the business.""Mr. Hermanns concluded, ""Our performance in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 is a validation of our ability to drive growth and profitability in nearly any economic environment. We're working diligently to grow our business, controlling what we can control, and reducing our expenses to improve our bottom line. Our focus is on increasing earnings per share, over absolute earnings, and we're committed to allocating capital to the highest and best risk adjusted return. We believe that HireQuest is well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders in 2024 and beyond.""Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial ResultsFranchise royalties in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $8.9 million compared to $7.7 million in the prior-year period. Service revenue was $871,000 compared to $378,000 in the prior-year period. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $9.8 million compared to $8.0 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 21.3%. Total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 included $515,000 of pass-through revenue from the MRINetwork advertising fund.SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 were $6.6 million compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily related to a $1.2 million increase in workers' compensation expense, and the inclusion of MRINetwork's advertising fund expenses of $515,000. Workers' compensation expense was approximately $1.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to approximately $166,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022.Excluding workers' compensation, impairment of notes receivable, and MRINetwork's advertising fund, SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023 would have increased 2.1% year-over-year and represented 49.0% of total revenue, excluding the advertising fund pass-through revenue, for the quarter compared to 53.6% of total revenue in the prior year period. SG&A excluding workers' compensation, impairment of notes receivable, and MRINetwork's advertising fund declined both in absolute dollars and relative to total revenue for the third consecutive quarter.Depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter of 2023 was approximately $698,000 compared to $544,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to additional amortization stemming from acquisitions.Other miscellaneous expense for the fourth quarter of 2023 was approximately $2.0 million, compared to other miscellaneous expense of $26,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. This increase is related to the resale of offices acquired in the acquisition of TEC Staffing Services to franchisees.Interest and other financing expense in the fourth quarter of 2023 was approximately $230,000 compared to $112,000 for the fourth quarter of 2022. Interest and other financing expense will fluctuate as the Company utilizes the line of credit for acquisitions or other short-term liquidity needs. Due to the acquisition of MRINetwork in the fourth quarter of 2022, coupled with subsequent working capital needs, and the acquisition of TEC in the fourth quarter of 2023, HireQuest carried a larger balance on its line of credit for the quarter ended December 31, 2023.Net income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2023 decreased 82.3% to $467,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $2.6 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter last year.

The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily related to a $5.6 million net increase in workers' compensation expense throughout the year, increased expenses to support organic and acquired system-wide sales growth, acquisition integration expenses, and the inclusion of MRINetwork's advertising fund expenses of $515,000. Workers' compensation expense was approximately $3.7 million in 2023 compared to a net benefit of $1.9 million in the full year 2022.Excluding workers' compensation, impairment of notes receivable, and MRINetwork's advertising fund, SG&A expenses would have increased 36.3% year-over-year and represented 52.8% of total revenue, excluding the advertising fund pass-through revenue, for 2023 compared to 45.8% for the full year 2022.For the full year of 2023, other miscellaneous expense was approximately $1.7 million, compared to $2.0 million in full year 2022.Income tax expense was approximately $1.3 million, a net effective tax rate of 17.3%, for the year December 31, 2023.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as: ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""goal,"" ""seek,"" ""believe,"" ""project,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""strategy,"" ""future,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""should,"" ""will,"" and similar references to future periods.While the company believes these statements are accurate, forward-looking statements are not historical facts and are inherently uncertain. They are based only on the company's current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future of its business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy, and other future conditions. The company cannot assure you that these expectations will occur, and its actual results may be significantly different. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in any forward-looking statements made by the company include the following: the level of demand and financial performance of the temporary staffing industry; the financial performance of the company's franchisees; changes in customer demand; economic uncertainty caused by macroeconomic trends including potential inflation or a recessionary environment; uncertainty in the supply chain or economy caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the war between Israel and Palestine, or other global conflict; the relative success or failure of acquisitions and new franchised offerings; our success in reducing workers' compensation expenses; the extent to which the company is successful in gaining new long-term relationships with customers or retaining existing ones, and the level of service failures that could lead customers to use competitors' services; significant investigative or legal proceedings including, without limitation, those brought about by the existing regulatory environment or changes in the regulations governing the temporary staffing industry and those arising from the action or inaction of the company's franchisees and temporary employees; strategic actions, including acquisitions and dispositions and the company's success in integrating acquired businesses including, without limitation, successful integration following any of our various acquisitions; success or failure in determining how to allocate capital; disruptions to the company's technology network including computer systems and software; natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods, and earthquakes, or man-made or other disruptions of the company's operating systems; and the factors discussed in the ""Risk Factors"" section and elsewhere in the company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed thereafter.Any forward-looking statement made by the company or its management in this news release is based only on information currently available to the company and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The company and its management disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise, except as required by law.Non-U.S. GAAP Financial MeasuresThis document contains supplemental financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). Management uses these non-U.S. GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for U.S. GAAP basis measures nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes the presentation of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of specified items provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the Company's financial condition and results. Non-U.S. GAAP measures are not formally defined under U.S. GAAP, and other entities may use calculation methods that differ from those used by us. As a complement to U.S. GAAP financial measures, our management believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures assist investors in comparing the financial condition and results of operations of financial institutions due to the industry prevalence of such non-U.S. GAAP measures. See the tables below for a reconciliation of these non-U.S. GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.Company Contact:HireQuest, Inc.David Hartley, Vice President of Corporate Development(800) 835-6755Email: cdhartley@hirequest.comInvestor Relations Contact:IMS Investor RelationsJohn Nesbett/Jennifer Belodeau(203) 972-9200Email: hirequest@imsinvestorrelations.com- Tables Follow -HireQuest, Inc.Consolidated Balance Sheets(in thousands except par value data) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 ASSETS Current assets Cash $1,342 $3,049 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts 44,394 45,728 Notes receivable 1,788 817 Prepaid expenses, deposits, and other assets 3,283 1,833 Prepaid workers' compensation 646 503 Total current assets 51,453 51,930 Property and equipment, net 4,280 4,353 Workers' compensation claim payment deposit 1,469 1,231 Franchise agreements, net 21,440 23,144 Other intangible assets, net 10,162 10,690 Goodwill 5,870 5,870 Deferred tax asset 325 - Other assets 102 325 Notes receivable, net of current portion and reserve 7,834 2,675 Intangible assets held for sale - discontinued operations 891 3,065 Total assets $103,826 $103,283 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $137 $448 Line of credit 14,119 12,543 Term loans payable 514 704 Other current liabilities 2,338 3,408 Accrued payroll, benefits, and payroll taxes 4,286 5,602 Due to franchisees 9,881 9,846 Risk management incentive program liability 565 877 Workers' compensation claims liability 3,871 3,352 Total current liabilities 35,711 36,780 Term loans payable, net of current portion 132 3,291 Workers' compensation claims liability, net of current portion 2,766 2,573 Deferred tax liability - 60 Franchisee deposits 2,485 2,325 Total liabilities 41,094 45,029 Commitments and contingencies (Note 11) Stockholders' equity Preferred stock - $0.001 par value, 1,000 shares authorized; none issued - - Common stock - $0.001 par value, 30,000 shares authorized; 13,997 and 13,918 shares issued, respectively 14 14 Additional paid-in capital 34,527 32,844 Treasury stock, at cost - 43,849 and 33,092 shares, respectively (146) (146)Retained earnings 28,337 25,542 Total stockholders' equity 62,732 58,254 Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $103,826 $103,283 HireQuest, Inc.Consolidated Statement of Income Three months ended (unaudited) Twelve months ended (in thousands, except per share data) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Franchise royalties $8,893 $7,671 $35,813 $28,897 Service revenue 871 378 2,069 2,055 Total revenue 9,764 8,049 37,882 30,952 Selling, general and administrative expenses 6,624 4,723 24,448 12,874 Depreciation and amortization 698 544 2,793 2,040 Income from operations 2,442 2,782 10,641 16,038 Other miscellaneous income (1,997) (26) (1,738) (2,047)Interest income 67 49 263 247 Interest and other financing expense (230) (112) (1,386) (368)Net income before income taxes 282 2,693 7,780 13,870 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (185) 49 1,345 1,895 Net income from continuing operations 467 2,644 6,435 11,975 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax (451) 74 (300) 483 Net income $16 $2,718 $6,135 $12,458 Basic earnings per share Continuing operations $0.03 $0.19 $0.47 $0.87 Discontinued operations (0.03) 0.01 (0.02) 0.04 Total $- $0.20 $0.45 $0.91 Diluted earnings per share Continuing operations $0.03 $0.19 $0.47 $0.87 Discontinued operations (0.03) 0.01 (0.02) 0.04 Total $- $0.20 $0.45 $0.91 Weighted average shares outstanding (in thousands) Basic 13,783 13,676 13,733 13,654 Diluted 13,830 13,741 13,801 13,721 HireQuest, Inc.Non-U.S. GAAP - Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA(unaudited) Three months ended Twelve months ended (in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Net income $16 $2,718 $6,135 $12,458 Interest expense 230 112 1,386 368 Provision for income taxes (185) 49 1,345 1,895 Depreciation and amortization 698 544 2,793 2,040 EBITDA 759 3,423 11,659 16,761 WOTC related costs 122 150 461 601 Non-cash compensation 555 479 1,483 1,673 Acquisition related charges, net 2,618 262 2,344 2,660 Impairment of notes receivable 240 117 540 350 Adjusted EBITDA $4,294 $4,431 $16,487 $22,045 HireQuest, Inc.Supplemental Metrics - SG&A Breakdown(unaudited) Three months ended Twelve months ended (in thousands) December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Core SG&A $4,534 $4,440 $19,715 $14,469 Net workers' compensation expense (benefit) 1,335 166 3,678 (1,945)Impairment of notes receivable 240 117 540 350 MRINetwork advertising fund expenses 515 - 515 - SG&A $6,624 $4,723 $24,448 $12,874 SOURCE: HireQuest Inc.View the original press release on accesswire.com What were the franchise royalties for HireQuest (HQI) in Q4 2023?

The sale aims to reduce debt and leverage, while ensuring the stations continue their mission format. Salem's Today's Christian Music network is unaffected by the sales. The transaction is expected to close in late May or early June. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The divestiture of radio stations by Salem Media Group to Educational Media Foundation (EMF) reflects a strategic financial move aimed at improving the company's balance sheet. By offloading assets in Nashville and Honolulu, Salem is likely to reduce its debt obligations, a move that can be appealing to investors. The focus on debt reduction is a common strategy for media companies looking to streamline operations and improve financial flexibility. The impact on the stock market may be positive if investors interpret this as a sign of prudent financial management and a step towards a more focused business model.However, the sale of assets could also indicate a retreat from certain markets or a shift in strategic focus, which might raise questions about the company's long-term growth prospects in the highly competitive media industry. The retention of the Today's Christian Music (TCM) network suggests that Salem is not exiting the content space entirely but is rather optimizing its portfolio. The transaction's success will be measured by the sale price's adequacy in reducing leverage and the company's ability to reinvest the proceeds into higher growth areas. Market Research Analyst The decision by Salem Media Group to sell its stations to EMF could reflect broader trends in the media and entertainment industry. There's a shift towards digital and streaming platforms, which might be influencing Salem's strategy to divest from traditional broadcast assets. Understanding the company's position in the market requires an analysis of listener trends, advertising revenue streams and the competitive landscape of radio broadcasting.EMF's acquisition could strengthen its national presence in the Christian music format, potentially increasing its market share and bargaining power with advertisers and content providers. For Salem, the strategic refocusing could allow them to concentrate on their remaining assets and perhaps innovate or expand in the digital content domain where there's a growing audience. The long-term impact on Salem's business will depend on how effectively they can capitalize on these emerging opportunities and whether they can maintain audience engagement through their existing content offerings. 03/21/2024 - 04:31 PM CAMARILLO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Salem Media Group, Inc. (OTCQX: SALM) announced today that it entered into an agreement to sell its contemporary Christian music stations in Nashville, Tennessee and Honolulu, Hawaii to Educational Media Foundation (EMF).

The company is advancing late-stage assets for presbyopia treatment, with topline data from Phase 3 CLARITY trials expected in April 2024. LENZ boasts a strong balance sheet with approximately $210 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $53.5 million from a concurrent PIPE financing. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The merger between LENZ Therapeutics and Graphite Bio, coupled with the reverse stock split and special cash dividend, represents a significant restructuring that may affect investor sentiment and stock liquidity. The reverse split could be perceived as a move to stabilize stock price by reducing the number of shares available, which often aims to attract more institutional investors. The special dividend provides immediate, tangible returns to shareholders, potentially increasing investor interest. Financially, the $210 million cash reserve post-merger indicates a robust balance sheet, enhancing LENZ's ability to invest in infrastructure and commercialization efforts without immediate need for further financing. The ownership percentages post-merger are also important as they reflect the new power dynamics within the company, with pre-merger LENZ stockholders retaining majority control, which might reassure investors about the continuity of the company's strategic vision. Market Research Analyst LENZ Therapeutics' focus on presbyopia treatment addresses a significant market need, given the large potential patient population. The 'all eyes, all day' brand mission suggests a universal approach that could disrupt the current standard of care if their product candidates are successful. However, the commercial success will depend on the market's reception of the aceclidine-based therapy, its efficacy compared to existing treatments and the company's ability to execute an effective marketing strategy. The anticipation of Phase 3 trial results and a subsequent NDA submission are pivotal events that will likely influence investor expectations and the company's market valuation. If the results are positive and the FDA approval is granted, LENZ could capture a significant market share, but delays or negative outcomes could adversely affect the stock. Biotech Industry Analyst The therapeutic area of presbyopia that LENZ is targeting is currently under-served, with most treatments being device-based (e.g., glasses, contact lenses) rather than pharmacological. The development of LNZ100 and LNZ101 as once-daily, preservative-free eye drops could represent a significant advancement in the quality of life for patients. The aceclidine mechanism of action and the combination with brimonidine in LNZ101 are noteworthy because they suggest a differentiated approach that could offer benefits over current treatments. The safety profile and efficacy data from the Phase 2 INSIGHT trial are encouraging, but the larger and longer-term Phase 3 CLARITY trials will be more indicative of the drugs' potential. Investors will be closely watching the topline data release in April 2024 as a major milestone that could significantly impact the company's valuation and future prospects. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM – LENZ Therapeutics to debut on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LENZ” as a publicly traded company advancing late clinical-stage assets for the treatment of presbyopia – – Topline data from registration-enabling Phase 3 CLARITY trials for lead assets LNZ100 and LNZ101 expected in April 2024 – – Strong balance sheet with approximately $210 million of cash and cash equivalents, including $53.5 million from a concurrent PIPE financing – SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LENZ Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: LENZ) (LENZ or the Company), a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing the first aceclidine-based eye drop that has been shown to improve near vision in people with presbyopia, today announced the completion of its previously announced merger with Graphite Bio, Inc. (previously trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “GRPH”) (“Graphite Bio”). The new combined company will operate under the name LENZ Therapeutics, Inc. and will commence trading on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LENZ” on March 22, 2024. “Following the close of this transaction, we believe we are well-positioned to bring the opportunity of a once-daily pharmacological eye drop intended to improve near vision throughout the full workday closer to the 128 million people in the United States who are impacted by presbyopia,” said Eef Schimmelpennink, President and CEO of LENZ Therapeutics. “With clinical activities completed in each of the three Phase 3 CLARITY trials evaluating LNZ100 and LNZ101, we look forward to reporting topline results from these trials in April 2024 and, subject to successful completion of such trials, submitting an NDA to the FDA by mid-year. Backed by a strong balance sheet and supported by a proven management team and top-tier investors, we believe it is an exciting time for LENZ as we prepare to execute in a catalyst-rich year and, if approved by the FDA, potentially deliver the first aceclidine-based therapy intended to treat presbyopia.” Topline Data from Pivotal Phase 3 CLARITY Trials for LNZ100 and LNZ101 Expected in April 2024 LENZ’s product candidates, LNZ100 and LNZ101, are preservative-free, single-use, once-daily eye drops containing aceclidine and aceclidine plus brimonidine, respectively. Previously, both LNZ100 and LNZ101 have demonstrated rapid onset and long duration of near vision improvement as well as an ability to be used across a wide age range of presbyopes with a broad refractive range while avoiding blurry distance vision. In the positive Phase 2 INSIGHT trial (NCT05294328), both LZN100 and LNZ101 achieved their primary endpoint of three-lines or greater near vision improvement without losing one or more lines in distance vision at one hour post-treatment, with 71% (p<0.0001) and 56% (p<0.0001) of treated patients achieving this endpoint, respectively, compared to 6% for vehicle. After 10 hours, 37% and 48% of patients treated with LNZ100 and LNZ101, respectively, maintained three-lines or greater improvement compared to vehicle. Both product candidates had a well-tolerated safety profile with no serious drug-related adverse events. Following the completion of the INSIGHT trial, LENZ initiated three pivotal Phase 3 CLARITY trials for LNZ100 and LNZ101. Similar to the INSIGHT trial, the primary efficacy endpoint in the CLARITY-1 and CLARITY-2 trials is the percentage of participants who achieve three-lines or greater improvement in near vision, but at three hours post-treatment rather than one hour post-treatment, comparing to brimonidine and vehicle, respectively. The objective of the CLARITY-3 trial is to confirm the long-term safety profile of LNZ100 and LNZ101 over a six-month period. Participants in the CLARITY trials range in age from 45 to 75 years old, the same age range used in the INSIGHT trial, with a refractive range of -4.0 diopters (D) spherical equivalent (SE) to +1.0D SE. The last visits of the last patients in each CLARITY trial have been completed as of the first quarter of 2024, and LENZ expects to report Phase 3 topline results from the CLARITY trials in April 2024. Planned Approach to Commercialization of LNZ100 or LNZ101 Based on the data generated from the CLARITY trials, LENZ plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in mid-2024. LENZ’s objective is to commercialize the product that the Company believes will most effectively meet the needs of the widest range of presbyopes tested and has the potential to provide the best value based on an “all eyes, all day” brand mission, and expects to share the selected product candidate for NDA submission as part of the topline results in April 2024. LENZ intends to launch either LNZ100 or LNZ101 in the United States with its own commercial organization. To support the projected launch following potential FDA approval, LENZ is actively building out its U.S. commercial capabilities and plans to share additional updates related to its commercialization planning in due course. In addition, LENZ is developing regulatory strategies and intends to opportunistically seek partnerships for Europe, Canada, and other markets to maximize the value of its product candidates. LENZ has already entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Ji Xing for the development and commercialization of LNZ100 and LNZ101 for the treatment of presbyopia in Greater China. Upcoming Milestones Based on its progress to date, LENZ anticipates the following near-term milestones in 2024: Announce topline results from the Phase 3 CLARITY trials and product candidate selection for NDA submission in April 2024 Submit an NDA for the selected product candidate in mid-2024 to seek FDA marketing approval Summary of the Merger Transaction, Reverse Stock Split, Special Cash Dividend and Private Placement In connection with the closing of the merger, Graphite Bio effected a 1 for 7 reverse split of its common stock and issued a special cash dividend of $1.03 per share of such common stock to Graphite Bio stockholders of record as of March 18, 2024 that continue to hold their eligible shares of Graphite Bio until market open on March 22, 2024, the ex-dividend date in respect of such special cash dividend. Following the reverse stock split and closing of the merger, there were approximately 28 million shares of the combined company’s common stock outstanding. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, Graphite Bio completed a private placement of $53.5 million from a syndicate of healthcare investors led by LENZ’s existing investors and including participation from new investors. Following the merger, key healthcare investors in LENZ will include Versant Ventures, RA Capital Management, Alpha Wave Global, Point72, Samsara BioCapital, Sectoral Asset Management, RTW Investments, and others. The projected cash and cash equivalents as of the close of the business combination are expected to be approximately $210 million, which LENZ believes will be sufficient funds to build infrastructure and commercialize LENZ’s selected product candidate, subject to successful completion of the Phase 3 trials, NDA submission, and subsequent FDA approval. Immediately following the merger and the private placement of $53.5 million, pre-merger Graphite Bio stockholders are expected to own approximately 30.8% of the combined company and pre-merger LENZ stockholders are expected to own approximately 56.2% of the combined company. The investors issued shares of common stock in the private placement are expected to own approximately 13.0% of the combined company. All ownership figures are provided on a fully-diluted basis (excluding any additional shares reserved under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan). Leadership Team and Board of Directors Updates The combined company will be led by Eef Schimmelpennink as President and Chief Executive Officer of LENZ. In addition to Mr. Schimmelpennink, the LENZ leadership team includes current members of management Marc Odrich, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer, and Shawn Olsson, as Chief Commercial Officer. In addition, LENZ appointed Dan Chevallard as Chief Financial Officer, effective March 21, 2024. Dan most recently served as Chief Financial Officer at Viracta Therapeutics (Nasdaq: VIRX) and possesses more than 20 years of experience in financial, operational, and strategic planning in the biotechnology and life sciences industry. The Board of Directors of LENZ will be composed of Eef Schimmelpennink, Fred Guerard, Jim McCollum, Zach Scheiner, Shelley Thunen, who join from LENZ’s Board of Directors, Kim Drapkin, who continues from Graphite Bio’s Board of Directors, and Jeff George, who joined as the Chair of the Board of Directors at the closing of the merger. Advisors Leerink Partners acted as exclusive financial advisor to Graphite Bio for the transaction and Goodwin Procter LLP served as its legal counsel. BofA Securities served as lead financial advisor to LENZ for the merger. Citi also served as financial advisor to LENZ for the merger. BofA Securities served as lead placement agent on the PIPE financing. Citi, Piper Sandler & Co., and William Blair & Company, L.L.C. served as co-placement agents for the PIPE financing. Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to the placement agents. Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, P.C. served as legal counsel to LENZ. About Presbyopia Presbyopia is the inevitable loss of near vision associated with aging and impacts the daily lives of nearly all people over 45. In the United States, the estimated addressable population who suffer from this condition, known as presbyopes, is 128 million, almost four times the number of individuals suffering from dry eye disease and three times the number of individuals suffering from childhood myopia, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma combined. Presbyopia is typically self-diagnosed and self-managed with over-the-counter reading glasses, or managed, after evaluation by an ECP, with prescription reading or bifocal glasses or multifocal contact lenses. About LENZ Therapeutics LENZ is a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing the first aceclidine-based eye drop to improve vision in patients diagnosed with presbyopia. LENZ’s product candidates, LNZ100 and LNZ101, are preservative-free, single-use, once-daily eye drops containing aceclidine and aceclidine plus brimonidine, respectively. LNZ100 and LNZ101 are under clinical evaluation in the registration-enabling Phase 3 CLARITY trials as potential therapies for the treatment of presbyopia, a condition impacting an estimated 1.8 billion people globally and 128 million people in the United States.

(NYSE: BROS) announced the pricing of a public offering by certain selling stockholders of 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $34.00 per share. The offering is expected to close soon. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The offering of 8 million shares by selling stockholders at Dutch Bros Inc. represents a significant liquidity event that warrants attention from a financial perspective. The set price of $34.00 per share provides us with a clear reference point to gauge investor sentiment and the perceived value of the company in the current market. One key aspect to consider is the potential impact on share price due to the increase in available shares. Historically, such offerings can lead to a dilution of share value for existing shareholders, although in this case, the sale is by existing stockholders rather than the company issuing new shares.It's also important to analyze the profile of the selling stockholders. In this instance, TSG Consumer Partners is a private equity firm known for investing in growth-stage companies. The decision to sell a portion of their stake might indicate a strategic move to realize gains or reallocate resources for new investments. For current and prospective investors, the motivations behind the sale and the subsequent use of proceeds can provide insights into the company's growth prospects and the confidence level of early backers. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, the sale of Dutch Bros' shares by TSG Consumer Partners provides a noteworthy signal about the coffee chain's market position and competitive landscape. The pricing of the offering at $34.00 per share needs to be contextualized within the broader industry trends, such as consumer spending habits, the rise of specialty coffee and the economic pressures that might affect discretionary spending. Understanding how Dutch Bros stacks up against its competitors in terms of growth, market penetration and brand strength is important for evaluating the long-term viability of the stock at the offered price point.Furthermore, the timing of the offering can be indicative of market conditions and the selling stockholders' assessment of the peak valuation. Analyzing the company's financial health, including revenue growth, profit margins and cash flow, alongside industry benchmarks, can provide a more nuanced view of the stock's potential performance post-offering. 03/21/2024 - 07:24 PM GRANTS PASS, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dutch Bros Inc.

Alcoa Corporation Announces Closing of Inaugural Green Bond Offering,2024-03-21T20:30:00.000Z,Low,Positive,"Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) closes $750 million green bond offering to finance sustainable projects, supporting its transition to a lower carbon economy.","Alcoa Corporation Announces Closing of Inaugural Green Bond Offering Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Alcoa (NYSE:AA) closes $750 million green bond offering to finance sustainable projects, supporting its transition to a lower carbon economy. Positive Alcoa successfully closed a $750 million green bond offering for sustainable projects. The 7.125% senior notes due 2031 are guaranteed by Alcoa and certain subsidiaries. The notes represent Alcoa's inaugural Green Finance Instrument in line with its Green Finance Framework. Proceeds will finance/refinance eligible projects and support Alcoa's cash needs and sustainability efforts. The Framework aligns with international Green Bond Principles and provides a structured approach for green finance initiatives. Negative None. Financial Analyst Alcoa's recent closure of a $750 million senior notes offering at 7.125% due 2031 is a significant move that warrants a close examination of its financial implications. The decision to earmark the proceeds for green projects and to bolster the company’s cash position suggests a strategic pivot towards sustainability, which is increasingly being favored by investors and regulators alike. The relatively high interest rate may reflect current market conditions, signaling a cautious approach from investors demanding higher yields for corporate debt amidst economic uncertainties.Examining the company's balance sheet, the addition of this capital can improve liquidity, potentially enhancing Alcoa's ability to navigate short-term market volatility. However, the long-term debt implications need to be assessed against the backdrop of future cash flows and the potential returns from the green projects financed through this instrument. Investors should monitor the deployment of these funds and the subsequent impact on Alcoa's profitability and return on investment. Sustainability Expert Alcoa's alignment with the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles and the various Green Loan Principles is a testament to the company's commitment to sustainability. This move not only helps in attracting environmentally-conscious investors but also places Alcoa in a position to potentially benefit from favorable financing terms in the future, as the market for green instruments continues to grow. Furthermore, the focus on financing projects that contribute to a lower carbon economy could provide Alcoa with a competitive edge as industries worldwide are pressured to reduce their environmental footprint.It is essential to scrutinize the actual environmental impact of the projects funded by these notes. The transparency and reporting in line with the Framework will be critical for investors to verify that the proceeds are indeed contributing to tangible sustainability improvements. This could further influence Alcoa's reputation and market position, as successful green initiatives can lead to enhanced brand value and customer loyalty. Market Research Analyst The issuance of green bonds is part of a broader trend in the financial markets where companies are increasingly leveraging their sustainability initiatives to access capital. Alcoa’s entry into this market with a sizable offering positions it within a niche that is rapidly growing and gaining traction among institutional investors. This strategic move could potentially open up new avenues for funding and partnerships, especially as the company looks to refinance existing projects under the green criteria.Market response to such offerings can serve as a barometer for investor sentiment towards the company's long-term sustainability goals. It's important for stakeholders to evaluate how this bond issuance compares to similar initiatives by competitors and the potential implications for Alcoa's market share. The success of this green finance instrument may also set a precedent for future offerings, influencing the company's cost of capital and its strategic financial planning. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alcoa Corporation (NYSE:AA) (“Alcoa”) announced today that Alcoa Nederland Holding B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcoa, closed its offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2031 (the “notes”). The notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Alcoa and certain of its subsidiaries. The notes represent Alcoa’s inaugural Green Finance Instrument in alignment with its Green Finance Framework (the “Framework”). Alcoa intends to use an amount equal to the net proceeds of the issuance of the notes to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, new and/or existing projects that meet certain eligibility criteria within the Framework. The net proceeds will also support Alcoa’s cash position and ongoing cash needs, including with respect to its previously announced portfolio actions. Additional details on eligibility criteria and use of proceeds are available in the Framework. ""We are pleased to advance our sustainability efforts by successfully issuing and closing this inaugural green bond offering,” said Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Molly Beerman. “These Green Finance Instruments support our investments and products which enable the transition to a lower carbon economy.” The Framework was developed in alignment with the International Capital Market Association’s 2021 Green Bond Principles, as well as the Loan Market Association, the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s 2023 Green Loan Principles. It provides a structured approach for Alcoa to assess, select, and report on its green finance initiatives, supporting Alcoa in its sustainability efforts by aligning it with its financing strategy.

The company expects its cash reserves to fund operations beyond 2026. Positive None. Negative Net loss per share increased from $8.29 in Q4 2022 to $24.00 in Q4 2023, and from $34.46 in full year 2022 to $24.00 in full year 2023. Restructuring and impairment charges significantly rose from $23.2 million in Q4 2022 to $72.0 million in Q4 2023. Research and development expenses decreased from $141.1 million in full year 2022 to $39.6 million in full year 2023. General and administrative expenses reduced from $62.2 million in full year 2022 to $47.6 million in full year 2023. Financial Analyst Instil Bio's financial results highlight a strategic pivot in their operations, with a significant reduction in research and development (R&D) expenses from $141.1 million in the previous year to $39.6 million. This could suggest a narrowing of focus or a scaling back of their pipeline, which investors typically interpret as a cost-saving measure or a sign of maturing product development stages. The closure of UK manufacturing and cessation of ITIL-306 clinical trial activities may raise concerns about the company's future revenue streams and product portfolio diversification.The company's cash runway projection beyond 2026 indicates a comfortable liquidity position, potentially reducing the immediate risk of dilutive financing rounds. However, the drop in cash and cash equivalents from $43.7 million to $9.2 million year-over-year could be a point of concern, indicating a high burn rate that investors should monitor closely.Instil's use of non-GAAP financial measures can be useful for investors to assess the company's operational performance by excluding non-recurring items. However, it's important for stakeholders to consider these alongside GAAP measures to get a full picture of financial health, as non-GAAP measures can sometimes obscure the impact of significant expenses. Market Research Analyst The strategic collaboration in China to develop an autologous folate receptor α (FRα)-CoStAR enhanced TIL for non-small cell lung cancer is a positive move, tapping into one of the largest pharmaceutical markets. If successful, this collaboration could provide a significant competitive advantage and open up new revenue streams. However, the success of such collaborations is uncertain and the actual impact on the company's bottom line may take time to materialize.Exploring opportunities to in-license or acquire novel therapeutic candidates is a common strategy to bolster a company's pipeline, particularly in areas with unmet medical needs. This approach can lead to rapid portfolio expansion and diversification, but it also comes with the risks associated with clinical development and regulatory hurdles.The financial results also reflect a substantial decrease in net loss per share year-over-year, which may be viewed positively by the market as an indicator of improving operational efficiency. Nonetheless, the long-term impact of these changes on the stock's performance will largely depend on the successful commercialization of their product candidates and the company's ability to manage its operational expenses. Biotech Industry Analyst Instil Bio's decision to discontinue the ITIL-306 clinical trial and close its UK manufacturing operations could signal a strategic refocusing. For stakeholders in the biotech sector, such moves are indicative of a company prioritizing its resources towards more promising avenues or cutting losses on less successful ventures. The biotech industry is known for its high-risk, high-reward nature and Instil's restructuring efforts appear to be an attempt to mitigate risks and conserve capital.While the company's cash runway is expected to extend beyond 2026, the biotech industry is capital-intensive and the ability to sustain operations without additional financing is a critical factor. Instil's current financial position may allow them to weather the high costs associated with clinical trials and the development of their pipeline without the immediate need for additional capital raises, which is generally a positive sign for investors.It's also important to note the potential impact of the announced strategic collaboration in China. The Chinese market has a high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer and a successful trial could lead to significant market penetration. However, regulatory and market access challenges in China should not be underestimated. 03/21/2024 - 05:00 PM DALLAS, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Instil Bio, Inc.

Announces Launch of Secondary Public Offering of Class A Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags offering Rhea-AI Summary Dutch Bros Inc. announces a public offering of 8,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock by certain selling stockholders associated with TSG Consumer Partners, L.P. The offering includes a 30-day option for additional shares and distribution of convertible securities. Dutch Bros will not receive proceeds from the sale. Positive None. Negative Dutch Bros will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders. One of the directors nominated by the Selling Stockholders is expected to resign from the Dutch Bros board of directors upon completion of the offering. Financial Analyst The announcement by Dutch Bros Inc. of a registered underwritten public offering of shares by existing stockholders is a significant event for current and potential investors. The decision by TSG Consumer Partners, L.P. to sell 8 million shares, with an option for the underwriter to purchase an additional 1.2 million, could suggest a realignment of the company's ownership structure. This move may lead to increased liquidity in the market for Dutch Bros' shares, potentially affecting the stock's volatility in the short term.However, investors should note that Dutch Bros will not receive any proceeds from this transaction, which indicates that the capital structure of the company will remain unchanged. The costs associated with the sale, barring underwriting discounts and commissions, will be borne by Dutch Bros, which could marginally impact its financials. The resignation of a director nominated by the Selling Stockholders post-offering could also alter the dynamics within the board, possibly affecting corporate governance and strategic decisions going forward. Market Research Analyst The secondary offering of Dutch Bros' shares by TSG Consumer Partners, L.P. might be interpreted by the market as a signal regarding the valuation or future prospects of the company. Such large transactions can influence investor sentiment and stock price, as market participants analyze the implications of a major shareholder reducing their stake. Additionally, the lock-up restrictions on the distributed in kind securities indicate a structured approach to managing the exit, which could be designed to minimize market disruption.Furthermore, the designation rights alteration for board representation post-offering suggests a shift in influence among shareholders. This change may be closely monitored by investors as it could impact company policy and strategy. The involvement of Morgan Stanley as the sole underwriter adds credibility to the offering, which might reassure investors about the procedural integrity of the transaction. Corporate Governance Expert The upcoming changes in board composition following the offering could have implications for Dutch Bros' governance. The reduction in the number of directors that the Selling Stockholders can nominate may lead to a shift in board dynamics. This shift could influence the company's strategic direction, oversight and risk management. Stakeholders should closely watch how the new board composition will address the company's long-term goals and whether it will bring fresh perspectives that could drive growth or improve operational efficiency.It's also important to consider how the distribution in kind and subsequent lock-up restrictions reflect the Selling Stockholders' commitment to a measured divestment strategy. This approach can help maintain stability in the company's stock by preventing a sudden oversupply in the market. Investors often view such strategic planning positively, as it indicates a thoughtful consideration of the company's and shareholders' interests. 03/21/2024 - 04:36 PM GRANTS PASS, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dutch Bros Inc. (NYSE: BROS; “Dutch Bros” or the “Company”) today announced commencement of a registered underwritten public offering of its Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the “Common Stock”), by certain selling stockholders associated with TSG Consumer Partners, L.P. (the “Selling Stockholders”). The Selling Stockholders intend to offer 8,000,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Selling Stockholders also intend to grant the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock. Substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, the Selling Stockholders expect to distribute in kind securities convertible into 389,823 shares of Common Stock (or 448,298 shares of Common Stock if the option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full) to certain of their indirect members who have elected to maintain their existing interests and to not participate in this offering. The shares distributed in kind will be subject to the lock-up restrictions described in the section titled “Underwriting” in the prospectus supplement. The offering is not conditioned upon the completion of distribution in kind.

(YOU) announced a $100 million increase to its share repurchase program, with $84.9 million already used to repurchase 4.4 million shares at an average price of $19.22. Approximately $141 million remains available for repurchases. Capital allocation is a key focus, with $157 million returned to shareholders in 2024 through repurchases and dividends. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Clear Secure, Inc.'s increase in their share repurchase program signifies a robust capital return policy, which can be interpreted as a sign of self-confidence from the company's management. The repurchase of shares can lead to an earnings per share (EPS) boost, as the reduction in outstanding shares spreads the company's earnings over a smaller share base. This can be particularly attractive to investors as it often leads to a higher stock price.However, it's essential to consider the opportunity cost of such a buyback. The $100 million could alternatively be used for investments in growth opportunities or paying down debt. The decision to opt for a buyback suggests that management believes the stock is undervalued or that there are no better uses for the cash that would provide a higher return. Market Research Analyst The market's reaction to share buyback announcements can vary, but they are generally seen as a positive signal, indicating that a company believes its stock is undervalued. The repurchase program also serves as a tool for adjusting the capital structure and can be a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders compared to dividends.It's important to note that the effectiveness of such programs depends on the timing and the price at which shares are repurchased. If shares are bought back at a price higher than their intrinsic value, it could lead to a destruction of shareholder value. Conversely, repurchasing shares at a lower price can be accretive to shareholder value. Investors will be keeping a close eye on the company's ability to execute the buyback efficiently. Economist From an economic perspective, share buybacks can be indicative of broader economic trends. When companies across the board engage in aggressive buyback programs, it may suggest a mature market environment where growth opportunities are less apparent, pushing companies to return capital to shareholders rather than reinvesting it. This can have implications for the economy's growth prospects.Moreover, the company's decision to allocate a significant amount of capital to share repurchases must be weighed against the backdrop of economic conditions, including interest rates and corporate debt levels. In a low-interest-rate environment, buybacks are more attractive as the cost of borrowing is lower. Conversely, if interest rates rise, the cost of buybacks could increase, potentially making them less favorable. 03/21/2024 - 04:35 PM NEW YORK, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Clear Secure, Inc.

(the ""Company"") (CSE:TOC)(OTCQB:TCVNF)(FSE:TV3), has elected to enter into a joint venture arrangement with Colibri Resources (""Colibri"") for the 51% owned Original Pilar Concessions. The two-concession owned jointly by Tocvan and Colibri account for just 4.6% of the total land area controlled by Tocvan where it has an ongoing 100% interest in the surrounding expansion area (over 2,100 hectares).Why the JV Arrangement is Beneficial to Tocvan Shareholders:Tocvan has Controlling Ownership (51%) in the Original Pilar Area.Tocvan has 100% Interest in a huge land package surrounding Pilar. In 2023, Tocvan was able to successfully expand the Pilar area by acquiring a land package 20 times the size of the Original Pilar Concessions. This expansion allows Tocvan optionality with discoveries to date pointing to greater Pilar-like systems. The two concessions held jointly with Colibri account for a total of 105 hectares, just 4.6% of the total area Tocvan has controlling interest in (2,277.7 hectares). The Company believes 105 hectares is insufficient space to build a significant mine, therefore payment of $2 million CAD for the remaining interest of the small portion of the property is not in the best interest of shareholders.Control on Share Dilution.

Decrease in benchmark price per pound of V2O5 in Europe in Q4 2023. Increase in certain expenses in 2023, including operating costs, finance costs, and exploration costs. Write down of vanadium assets of $4.9 million in 2023. Market Research Analyst The reported financials from Largo Inc. indicate a challenging fiscal period, with a significant 13% year-over-year decline in revenues and a net loss widening from $2.2 million in the previous year to $32.4 million in 2023. This was despite a decrease in operating costs and an increase in V2O5 production in the last quarter. The decline in revenues could be attributed to the drop in vanadium prices, which is a key concern for stakeholders, as it directly impacts the company's profitability. The 22% decrease in the European V2O5 price in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 is particularly noteworthy, as it reflects broader market trends and the health of the steel and aerospace industries, which are major consumers of vanadium.Investors should be aware that the vanadium market is susceptible to cyclical fluctuations and sector-specific challenges, such as the current adverse conditions in the Chinese and European steel industries. The company's efforts to diversify revenue streams through the construction of an ilmenite concentration plant and the potential joint venture with Stryten Energy LLC could mitigate some of the risks associated with vanadium price volatility. However, the success of these initiatives will be key to the company's future financial health. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the increase in finance costs by 506% and the 195% increase in exploration and evaluation costs are significant. These increases, along with the write-down of vanadium assets of $4.9 million, have contributed to the company's net loss. The Adjusted EBITDA improvement in Q4 2023, however, suggests that some of the cost-saving measures and operational improvements may be starting to take effect.It is important to consider the company's cash position and debt levels. The cash balance decreased from $54.5 million to $42.7 million year-over-year, while debt increased from $40 million to $75 million. This could potentially put pressure on the company's liquidity and financial flexibility. The commitment to purchase vanadium from GMR also adds to future cash outflow obligations. Investors should closely monitor how these factors impact the company's ability to fund operations and invest in growth opportunities. Commodity Analyst The dynamics of the vanadium market, as reflected in Largo Inc.'s financial results, demonstrate the impact of global commodity prices on producers. Vanadium, primarily used in steel production and emerging technologies like vanadium redox flow batteries, has been affected by softening demand in key markets, particularly in China and Europe. While the aerospace sector continues to show strong demand, it may not be sufficient to offset the challenges faced in the steel industry.Furthermore, the company's production increase and the validation of Largo Clean Energy's vanadium flow battery deployment signify progress in operational capabilities and entry into the energy storage market. The strategic joint venture with Stryten Energy LLC could position the company to capitalize on the growing demand for energy storage solutions, which could be a long-term positive despite short-term market volatility. Understanding these market trends is essential for stakeholders to assess the potential future performance of Largo Inc. 03/21/2024 - 05:05 PM All dollar amounts expressed are in thousands of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.

In 2023, the Company saw increased direct mine and production costs, primarily due to an increase in total ore mined in 2023, the cost impacts of low ore availability experienced earlier in the year and plant shutdowns for corrective maintenance during 2023. The Company’s direct mine and production costs decreased in Q4 2023 as compared with Q4 2022, reflecting the impact of the cost saving and operational improvement initiatives implemented at the mine, as well as the softening of prices for critical consumables. The Company continues to actively work towards achieve higher levels of operational efficiency to better manage its costs as it navigates lower grades of ore mined as compared with prior years. In Q4 2023, V2O5 equivalent production was 28% higher than the 2,163 tonnes produced in Q3 2023 and 38% higher than the 2,004 tonnes produced in Q4 2022. The global recovery7 achieved in Q4 2023 was 79.4%, an increase of 6.3% from the 74.7% achieved in Q4 2022 and 3.3% higher than the 76.9% achieved in Q3 2023. The total ore mined in Q4 2023 was 473,958 tonnes, an increase of 45% in comparison with Q4 2022. 1,752,982 tonnes of ore were mined in 2023, an increase of 29% as compared with 2022. Actions were taken to increase crushing availability and normal production levels were recovered in Q4 2023. Total ore crushed in Q4 2023 was 8% higher than in Q3 2023 and 35% higher than in Q4 2022. For 2023, total ore crushed was 9% higher than in 2022. For 2023, total professional, consulting and management fees decreased by 9% from 2022 and other general and administrative expenses decreased by 18% from 2022, both as a result of reduced activity and headcount at LCE as a result of the initiation of the strategic review. Additionally, technology start-up costs decreased by 52% in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to a write down of battery components inventory in Q4 2022 of $6.4 million and a decrease in activities at LCE in Q4 2023 as the installation of its battery project nears conclusion. In 2021, the Company signed a 10-year exclusive off-take agreement with Gladieux Metals Recycling (“GMR”) for the purchase of all standard and high purity grade vanadium products GMR produces. The Company is committed to the purchase of a minimum of 360 tonnes of V2O5 in 2024 and its onward distribution to customers. Subsequent to Q4 2023, production in January 2024 was 582 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent with 276 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent produced in February 2024. Lower production achieve in the first two months of Q1 2024 is attributable to the Company’s previously announced kiln refractory maintenance. Subsequent to Q4 2023, sales in January 2024 were 1,072 tonnes of V2O5 equivalent, with 1,065 sold in February 2024.

Cash Operating Costs Excluding Royalties Per Pound The Company’s press release refers to cash operating costs excluding royalties per pound, which are non-GAAP ratios based on cash operating costs and cash operating costs excluding royalties, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in order to provide investors with information about a key measure used by management to monitor performance. This information is used to assess how well the Maracás Menchen Mine is performing compared to plan and prior periods, and also to assess its overall effectiveness and efficiency. Cash operating costs includes mine site operating costs such as mining costs, plant and maintenance costs, sustainability costs, mine and plant administration costs, royalties and sales, general and administrative costs (all for the Mine properties segment), but excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based payments, foreign exchange gains or losses, commissions, reclamation, capital expenditures and exploration and evaluation costs. Operating costs not attributable to the Mine properties segment are also excluded, including conversion costs, product acquisition costs, distribution costs and inventory write-downs. Cash operating costs excluding royalties is calculated as cash operating costs less royalties. Cash operating costs per pound and cash operating costs excluding royalties per pound are obtained by dividing cash operating costs and cash operating costs excluding royalties, respectively, by the pounds of vanadium equivalent sold that were produced by the Maracás Menchen Mine. Cash operating costs, cash operating costs excluding royalties, cash operating costs per pound and cash operating costs excluding royalties per pound, along with revenues, are considered to be key indicators of the Company’s ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its Maracás Menchen Mine. These measures differ from measures determined in accordance with IFRS, and are not necessarily indicative of net earnings or cash flow from operating activities as determined under IFRS. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash operating costs and cash operating costs excluding royalties, cash operating costs per pound and cash operating costs excluding royalties per pound for the Maracás Menchen Mine to operating costs as per the 2023 annual consolidated financial statements.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA The Company’s press release refers to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or ""EBITDA"", and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, in order to provide investors with information about key measures used by management to monitor performance. EBITDA is used as an indicator of the Company's ability to generate liquidity by producing operating cash flow to fund working capital needs, service debt obligations, and fund capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA removes the effect of inventory write-downs, impairment charges (including write-downs of vanadium assets), insurance proceeds received, movements in legal provisions, non-recurring employee settlements and other expense adjustments that are considered to be non-recurring for the Company. The Company believes that by excluding these amounts, which are not indicative of the performance of the core business and do not necessarily reflect the underlying operating results for the periods presented, it will assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company in better understanding the Company's ability to generate liquidity from its core business activities. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders of the Company and do not have any standardized definition under IFRS. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures exclude the impact of depreciation, costs of financing activities and taxes, and the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and therefore are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operating activities as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently. The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) as per the 2023 annual consolidated financial statements.

The company aims to expand its solar portfolio backed by Genie Energy's financial strength. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Examining the acquisition of a late-stage solar development project by Sunlight Energy, it's evident that this strategic move is designed to enhance the company's asset base and diversify its energy portfolio. By entering into fixed-price PPAs with educational institutions, Sunlight Energy secures a predictable revenue stream, which can be appealing to investors seeking stability in future cash flows.The mention of Genie Energy's 'robust balance sheet' providing the capitalization for Sunlight Energy suggests a strong financial backing, which is critical for the execution and expansion of such capital-intensive projects. However, investors should monitor the company's capital structure and debt levels, as excessive leverage could pose risks to the company's financial health.Furthermore, the open invitation to third-party investors to participate as limited partners indicates a potential for fundraising and shared risk. This could be a double-edged sword, as it may dilute existing shareholders' equity but also spread the financial risk and bring additional expertise to the project. Energy Market Analyst The solar energy sector is rapidly expanding and Sunlight Energy's acquisition in Hamilton, Indiana, is a testament to the growing trend of renewable energy investments. The direct PPAs with educational facilities not only provide a green energy solution but also demonstrate a commitment to community engagement and social responsibility.It's important to consider the long-term implications of this acquisition on the energy market. As solar technology becomes more cost-effective, companies like Sunlight Energy could benefit from reduced operational costs and increased competitiveness. However, they must navigate the regulatory environment and potential changes in renewable energy policies that could impact profitability.The mention of scouting for additional solar generation assets indicates an aggressive growth strategy, which could position Sunlight Energy favorably in the renewable energy market. However, the success of such expansions will largely depend on the company's ability to integrate new assets and manage the complexities of scaling operations. Environmental Sustainability Expert The shift towards renewable energy sources, such as solar power, is a critical component in addressing global climate change. Sunlight Energy's investment in solar projects serving educational facilities not only has financial implications but also contributes to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions.Investments in renewable energy projects like these can enhance a company's reputation and align with consumer and investor expectations for corporate responsibility. The environmental benefits of such projects could lead to additional opportunities, such as government incentives or partnerships with other organizations focused on sustainability.While the environmental impact of these investments is positive, it is essential to assess the lifecycle environmental costs, including the manufacturing and disposal of solar panels. Companies that manage these aspects effectively can further strengthen their position in the market as leaders in sustainability. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM NEWARK, NJ, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunlight Energy Investments (Sunlight Energy), a subsidiary of Genie Energy Ltd., (NYSE: GNE), a retail energy and renewable energy solutions provider, today announced that it has purchased a late-stage solar development project in Hamilton, Indiana from the project developer. The array will supply power to the Hamilton Community High and Elementary Schools through direct fixed-price solar power purchase agreements (PPAs). The transaction follows Sunlight Energy’s purchase of a portfolio of 12 operational solar arrays serving educational facilities in Ohio and Michigan with an aggregate rating of 9.4 MW. Nir Ashpiz, CEO of Sunlight Energy, said, “The Hamilton project acquisition fits perfectly with our growing portfolio of solar projects providing long-term, stable cash flows. Backed by Genie Energy’s robust balance sheet, we continue to scout for additional solar generation assets and projects with opportunities for participation from third-party investors.” Sunlight Energy is an equity financing vehicle for commercial and community solar projects. Genie Energy, which serves as the fund's General Partner, has provided Sunlight Energy’s capitalization to date. Third-party investors are invited to participate as limited partners in Sunlight Energy’s project equity.

(TSXV: TORR) (""Torrent Capital"") congratulates Port of Argentia and Hamburg Port Authority on the signing of a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to collaborate on the export and import of green hydrogen from Canada to Germany. The agreement was signed in Hamburg during the Canada-Germany Hydrogen and Ammonia Producer-Offtaker Conference.The conference was being held in support of the Canada-Germany Energy Partnership and Hydrogen Alliance. That Alliance commits the two countries to collaborate on reducing emissions and transitioning to cleaner fuels and a greener economy through the export of clean Canadian hydrogen to Germany. During the conference, Canada and Germany announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (""MOU"") that commits both countries to backing transactions between Canadian hydrogen producers and Germany's industrial manufacturing and energy distribution sectors. The intent of the MOU is to identify pathways which will enable Canadian hydrogen producers to develop commercial scale projects based on reasonable prices contained in long-term commercially binding offtake agreements with German buyers. The Port of Argentia is looking to host the production of a robust supply chain of green hydrogen derivatives for export to Germany. Pattern Renewable Holdings Canada 2 ULC (""Pattern Energy"") is undertaking the feasibility, environmental and permitting work necessary to establish Argentia Renewables, a 300-MW wind energy to green hydrogen production project at the Port of Argentia. Coinciding with the Canada-Germany Hydrogen and Ammonia Producer-Offtaker Conference, Pattern Energy signed a LOI with Mabanaft, an integrated energy company headquartered in Germany. The LOI outlines both company's mutual interest of exploring the possibility of a partnership between Pattern Energy and Mabanaft for equity investment and green ammonia supply from Pattern Energy's Argentia Renewables project.Argentia Capital Inc. (""ACI"") is a 50/50 joint venture between Port of Argentia Inc. (""POA"") and Torrent Capital Ltd. Through the joint venture, Torrent Capital is investing in developmental projects at the Port which will generate opportunities to earn royalty revenues and invest in equity positions. ACI has negotiated an opportunity to invest in Pattern Energy's renewable energy green-fuels project. Negotiated commercial terms will see ACI receiving a royalty calculated as a percentage of gross revenue on sales from the ammonia production facilities, at rates ranging from 1.0% - 3.5% depending on price. In addition, ACI has the right to acquire up to a 12.5% limited partner equity interest in the wind, hydrogen and ammonia project, or any other entities established for maintaining and operating renewable energy green fuels production, storage and exports at the Port. ACI's involvement in this venture highlights its efforts to work with POA in fostering innovative projects with substantial long-term benefits. Pattern Energy's Renewable Green Fuels Project at the Port of ArgentiaPattern Renewable Holdings Canada 2 ULC (""Pattern Energy"") is planning to develop a renewable energy-to-green fuels project at the Port of Argentia, Newfoundland and Labrador. Feasibility and permitting work for a renewable energy-to-green fuels project at the Port is ongoing. The Project involves the installation of 300 MW of wind power on lands privately owned by Port of Argentia Inc. In addition, a hydrogen / ammonia plant will be located at the Port in close proximity to Port of Argentia's marine terminal. These facilities will produce hydrogen through an electrolysis of water using renewable wind energy. It will also produce nitrogen by air separation using renewable energy. Ammonia will be created when the hydrogen and nitrogen gases react, and its energy content is a product of the energy used to produce these gases. The Project is expected to produce 400 metric tonnes per day (MTPD) of green ammonia (146,000 tonnes of ammonia per year). Project commissioning is targeted for 2027. Once the Project is operational, the product will be exported by marine vessels to international markets. Based on the viability of the Project and market conditions, the Project could be scaled up in a second phase to more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy producing approximately 1,400 MTPD of ammonia.About Torrent Capital Ltd.Torrent is a publicly traded investment issuer that invests in the securities of private and publicly traded companies.

TOPGOLF CALLAWAY BRANDS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES DEBT REPRICING,2024-03-21T20:19:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) successfully repriced its $1.24 billion first-lien term loan, reducing interest rates by 60 basis points, resulting in over $7 million in annual interest savings. The company aims to manage leverage, maintain financial flexibility, and fund growth.","TOPGOLF CALLAWAY BRANDS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETES DEBT REPRICING Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. (MODG) successfully repriced its $1.24 billion first-lien term loan, reducing interest rates by 60 basis points, resulting in over $7 million in annual interest savings. The company aims to manage leverage, maintain financial flexibility, and fund growth. Positive Successfully repriced $1.24 billion first-lien term loan due 2030 Lowered interest rate by 50 basis points to SOFR +300 Eliminated 10-basis point credit spread adjustment for total reduction of 60 basis points Expected interest expense savings of over $7 million annually Focus on managing leverage, maintaining financial flexibility, and funding growth Negative None. Financial Analyst The repricing of Topgolf Callaway Brands' term loan is a strategic financial move that will have a tangible impact on the company's balance sheet. By reducing the interest rate by 50 basis points and eliminating the 10-basis point CSA, the company is set to save over $7 million annually in interest expenses. This reduction in costs is significant considering the original loan amount of $1.24 billion and the savings could be allocated towards other strategic investments or directly improve the bottom line.It's important to note that the term 'basis point' refers to one-hundredth of a percentage point. A 60 basis point reduction on a substantial loan like this can result in considerable interest savings. The SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) mentioned is a benchmark interest rate for dollar-denominated derivatives and loans, which replaced LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate). A SOFR +300 basis points would mean the interest rate is 3% above the daily SOFR rate.For investors, this news indicates a proactive approach by Topgolf Callaway Brands' management to strengthen their financial position. It reflects positively on their ability to renegotiate debt terms favorably, which could lead to improved credit ratings and potentially lower costs of capital in the future. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Topgolf Callaway Brands' decision to reprice its term loan may be seen as a response to the current interest rate environment. Given the historical low-interest rates in the past few years, companies have had the opportunity to restructure their debt under more favorable terms. However, as rates begin to rise, locking in lower rates now could be a prudent move.The company's statement regarding positive free cash flow in 2023 and the forecast for 2024 suggests operational efficiency and a strong market position. This could reassure investors about the company's growth prospects and its ability to generate enough cash to meet financial obligations. Additionally, the involvement of major financial institutions as Joint Lead Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, adds credibility to the transaction and could be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Topgolf Callaway Brands' financial health. Debt Capital Markets Analyst Examining the repricing from a debt capital markets standpoint, the move by Topgolf Callaway Brands can be seen as a strategic refinancing effort. In the broader context of corporate finance, such a repricing transaction can impact the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), as debt servicing costs are a component of this calculation. A lower WACC is generally favorable as it indicates that a company can generate greater returns on investment than the cost of capital.The elimination of the credit spread adjustment (CSA) also suggests that the company's credit risk profile has improved, or that market conditions have become more favorable, allowing them to negotiate away this additional cost. For stakeholders, this could signal a positive outlook on the company's risk management and negotiation capabilities.Overall, this repricing could have a ripple effect on the company's future financing activities, possibly allowing for more favorable terms on future debt issuances or refinancings, which is an important consideration for long-term stakeholders and potential investors. 03/21/2024 - 04:19 PM CARLSBAD, Calif., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp.

Evoke is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development of drugs to treat GI disorders and diseases. The company developed, commercialized and markets GIMOTI, a nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults. Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents resulting in serious GI symptoms as well as other systemic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. Prior to FDA approval to commercially market GIMOTI, metoclopramide was only available in oral and injectable formulations and remains the only drug currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis.

Important Safety Information WARNING: TARDIVE DYSKINESIA Metoclopramide can cause tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious movement disorder that is often irreversible. The risk of developing TD increases with duration of treatment and total cumulative dosage.Discontinue GIMOTI in patients who develop signs or symptoms of TD. In some patients, symptoms may lessen or resolve after metoclopramide is stopped.Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks because of the increased risk of developing TD with longer-term use. GIMOTI is not recommended for use in: Pediatric patients due to the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia (TD) and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.Moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/minute), and patients concurrently using strong CYP2D6 inhibitors due to the risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions. GIMOTI is contraindicated: In patients with a history of tardive dyskinesia (TD) or a dystonic reaction to metoclopramide.When stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous (e.g., in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage mechanical obstruction, or perforation).In patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas. Metoclopramide may cause a hypertensive/pheochromocytoma crisis, probably due to release of catecholamines from the tumor.In patients with epilepsy. Metoclopramide may increase the frequency and severity of seizures.In patients with hypersensitivity to metoclopramide. Reactions have included laryngeal and glossal angioedema and bronchospasm. Potential adverse reactions associated with metoclopramide include: Tardive dyskinesia (TD), other extrapyramidal effects (EPS), parkinsonism symptoms, motor restlessness, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), depression, suicidal ideation and suicide, hypertension, fluid retention, hyperprolactinemia, effects on the ability to drive and operate machinery.

"NIKE, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results",2024-03-21T20:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"NIKE, Inc. (NKE) reported fiscal 2024 third-quarter results with revenues slightly up to $12.4 billion. Gross margin increased to 44.8%, but net income and diluted earnings per share decreased. The company returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and continues to invest in growth.","NIKE, Inc. Reports Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary NIKE, Inc. (NKE) reported fiscal 2024 third-quarter results with revenues slightly up to $12.4 billion. Gross margin increased to 44.8%, but net income and diluted earnings per share decreased. The company returned $1.4 billion to shareholders and continues to invest in growth. Positive Revenues for NIKE, Inc. were slightly up on both a reported and currency-neutral basis at $12.4 billion. Gross margin increased to 44.8%, driven by strategic pricing actions and lower costs. NIKE returned $1.4 billion to shareholders in the third quarter, including dividends and share repurchases. The company has a strong track record of consistently increasing dividend payouts for 22 consecutive years. Negative Net income was down 5% to $1.2 billion, and diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $0.77. Revenues for Converse were down 19% on a reported basis and 20% on a currency-neutral basis. Cash and equivalents were down approximately $0.2 billion from the prior year. Financial Analyst The reported increase in NIKE's gross margin to 44.8 percent, a rise of 150 basis points, is a significant indicator of the company's pricing power and cost management effectiveness. The margin expansion, attributed to strategic pricing and lower logistics costs, suggests that NIKE is successfully navigating the inflationary pressures that have hampered many retail and consumer goods companies. However, the increased selling and administrative expenses, including restructuring charges, indicate ongoing investments and potential organizational changes that could affect future profitability.Investors should note the downtrend in net income and diluted earnings per share, which, despite being affected by restructuring charges, could raise concerns about the company's near-term earnings growth trajectory. The reduction in inventories is a positive sign of efficient inventory management, which is important in the retail industry to avoid markdowns and maintain profitability. The continued shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases reflect management's confidence in the company's financial health and commitment to delivering shareholder value. Market Research Analyst The decline in Converse revenues, particularly in North America and Europe, might indicate brand-specific challenges or a broader shift in consumer preferences. This requires close monitoring as it could suggest a need for brand revitalization strategies or product innovation to re-engage with the market. The slight increase in NIKE Brand Digital sales contrasts with the decrease in digital sales, which may point to evolving consumer behavior post-pandemic and the need for NIKE to adapt its digital strategy.Geographically, the currency-neutral growth in North America, Greater China and APLA against declines in EMEA highlights the uneven global economic recovery and the impact of geopolitical factors on consumer spending. This regional performance variance is essential for investors to consider, as it could influence the company's strategic focus and resource allocation. Economist NIKE's financial performance, with its slight revenue increase and gross margin expansion, reflects resilience in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company's strategic pricing actions to counter higher product input costs demonstrate an ability to leverage brand strength to maintain profitability margins. However, the modest decrease in cash and equivalents, driven by share repurchases and other cash outflows, may raise questions about the sustainability of such financial strategies in the face of potential economic headwinds, such as inflation or currency fluctuations.The effective tax rate's slight increase from the previous year could be indicative of changing tax regulations or income mix. While NIKE's overall financial health appears stable, the long-term implications of its current strategies, including the ongoing restructuring, will be critical to observe for future fiscal stability and growth. 03/21/2024 - 04:15 PM BEAVERTON, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NIKE, Inc.

Revenues for Converse were $495 million, down 19 percent on a reported basis and down 20 percent on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to declines in North America and Europe. Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 44.8 percent, primarily driven by strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight and logistics costs, partially offset by higher product input costs and restructuring charges. Selling and administrative expense increased 7 percent to $4.2 billion. Demand creation expense was $1.0 billion, up 10 percent, reflecting an increase in marketing expense.

Positive Strong financial results for Q3 fiscal 2024 with net sales of $805.8 million and net earnings of $49.0 million. Operating income increased to $66.3 million compared to the prior year quarter. Improved direct spreads and higher volume drove gross margin increase of $56.9 million. Recent developments include a licensing agreement with AcerlorMittal Tailored Blanks and a quarterly dividend declaration. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in net sales and net earnings by Worthington Steel, Inc. indicates a solid performance, especially when compared to the previous fiscal year's same quarter. A 3% rise in net sales, coupled with a substantial jump in net earnings from $5.4 million to $49.0 million, may reflect positively on investor sentiment and could potentially influence the company's stock price. The increase in direct and toll selling prices, as well as the growth in tons sold, suggest a robust demand for the company's products and an effective pricing strategy.Additionally, the successful separation from the parent company and the licensing agreement for ablation technology represent strategic moves that could enhance the company's competitive edge and operational capabilities. The declaration of a quarterly dividend could also be seen as a sign of financial health and commitment to shareholder returns, which is often well-received by the market. Financial Analyst Analyzing the financial health of Worthington Steel, the gross margin improvement is noteworthy, indicating efficient management of costs and pricing strategies. The significant increase in operating income from $9.5 million to $66.3 million reflects not only improved sales but also operational efficiencies post-separation. This could be indicative of strong managerial effectiveness post-restructuring, which is a positive sign for investors looking at the company's long-term potential.However, the rise in SG&A expenses due to inflationary pressures and increased headcount post-separation should be monitored as they could impact future margins. The company's ability to manage these expenses will be critical in maintaining profitability. The non-GAAP financial measures provided, such as adjusted net earnings, offer additional transparency and could assist investors in making more informed decisions by providing a clearer picture of the company's core operational performance. Investment Strategist From an investment perspective, the significant year-over-year improvement in earnings per share (EPS) from $0.11 to $0.98 suggests a strong earnings growth trajectory, which is a key metric for investors. The company's performance in its first quarter as a standalone entity appears to be robust, which might reassure investors of its viability post-separation. The licensing agreement for new technology and the positive outlook expressed by the CEO could signal future growth opportunities and might be factored into the company's valuation.However, it is important to consider the broader steel industry trends and economic indicators, as the sector is sensitive to economic cycles. Factors such as global demand for steel, commodity prices and trade policies can significantly impact Worthington Steel's future performance. Investors would do well to consider these external factors in conjunction with the company's internal performance when evaluating the investment potential. 03/21/2024 - 04:10 PM COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Worthington Steel, Inc. (NYSE: WS) today reported financial results for the fiscal 2024 third quarter ended February 29, 2024. The Company reported net sales of $805.8 million and net earnings attributable to controlling interest of $49.0 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, for its fiscal 2024 third quarter. For the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ended February 28, 2023, the Company recorded net sales of $780.7 million and net earnings attributable to controlling interest of $5.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. Results in both the current year quarter and prior year quarter were impacted by certain items, as summarized in the table below and as further discussed in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures / Supplemental Data section later in this release. (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 3Q 2024 3Q 2023 After-Tax Per Share After-Tax Per Share Net earnings attributable to controlling interest $ 49.0 $ 0.98 $ 5.4 $ 0.11 Separation costs 0.6 0.01 3.2 0.06 Adjusted net earnings attributable to controlling interest (Non-GAAP) $ 49.6 $ 0.99 $ 8.6 $ 0.17 Financial highlights for the current and comparative periods are as follows: (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 3Q 2024 3Q 2023 9M 2024 9M 2023 Net sales $ 805.8 $ 780.7 $ 2,519.6 $ 2,723.7 Operating income 66.3 9.5 127.2 30.5 Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliate 2.9 (0.2 ) 15.7 3.5 Net earnings attributable to controlling interest 49.0 5.4 101.5 19.8 Earnings per diluted share attributable to controlling interest $ 0.98 $ 0.11 $ 2.05 $ 0.40 “The Worthington Steel team delivered a strong third quarter and I want to thank and congratulate our employees on their great performance in our first quarter as a standalone company,” said Geoff Gilmore, president and chief executive officer of Worthington Steel. “We saw improvements in sales, operating income and net income over the same quarter in 2023, and our teams are laser-focused on finishing the fiscal year strong.” Consolidated Quarterly Results Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $805.8 million, an increase of $25.1 million, or 3%, compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by a 1% increase in direct selling prices and an 11% increase in toll selling prices. Additionally, there was a 1% increase in direct tons and a 9% increase in toll tons sold in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Correspondingly, the mix of direct tons versus toll tons processed was 55% to 45% in the current year quarter, compared to 56% to 44% in the prior year quarter. Gross margin increased by $56.9 million over the prior year quarter to $120.1 million. The increase was driven primarily by improved direct spreads and higher volume. Direct spreads, up $52.9 million, benefited from a $45.9 million favorable change from an estimated $26.6 million inventory holding loss in the prior year quarter to an estimated $19.3 million inventory holding gain in the current year quarter. Operating income improved by $56.8 million over the prior year quarter to $66.3 million, primarily due to the improved gross margin. Operating income incrementally benefited from a $3.0 million decrease in costs associated with the Company's December 1, 2023, separation from Worthington Enterprises, Inc. (“Separation”) compared to the prior year quarter. These increases were offset by higher selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense, up $3.1 million, primarily due to increased wage and benefit costs resulting from a combination of higher headcount after the Separation as well as continued inflationary pressures. Recent Developments On December 1, 2023, in connection with the Separation of the Company from Worthington Enterprises, Inc. (“Former Parent”), a $150.0 million distribution was paid to the Former Parent. On March 13, 2024, Worthington Steel Joint Venture, TWB Company signed a licensing agreement with AcerlorMittal Tailored Blanks for a patented ablation technology that will expand the organization’s capabilities in North America. On March 21, 2024, Worthington Steel’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share payable on June 28, 2024 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2024. Outlook “Our company is performing well,” Gilmore said. “Our team is aligned and focused on creating value for our shareholders and working with our customers to ensure the products the world uses every day are stronger, better performing and more durable. I’m optimistic about our future and confident in our team, our growth plans and our strategy.” Conference Call The Company will review fiscal 2024 third quarter results during its quarterly conference call on March 22, 2024, beginning at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time.

These non-GAAP financial measures typically exclude impairment and restructuring charges (gains), but may also exclude other items that management believes are not reflective of, and thus should not be included when evaluating the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation and believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they provide additional perspective on the performance of the Company’s ongoing operations. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors because they allow for meaningful comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business and enable investors to evaluate operations and future prospects in the same manner as management. For the purposes of the subsequent tables, the non-GAAP measures have been adjusted for the reasons identified below: Impairment of long-lived assets - impairments are excluded because they do not occur in the ordinary course of the Company's ongoing business operations, are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and are non-cash, so their exclusion facilitates the comparison of historical and current financial results. Restructuring activities - restructuring activities consist of items that are not part of the Company's ongoing operations, such as divestitures, closing or consolidating facilities, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel), and realignment of existing operations (including changes to management structure in response to underlying performance and/or changing market conditions). Separation costs - direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with the Separation from Former Parent, including audit, legal, and other fees paid to third-party advisors as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the separation of shared corporate functions which are not part of the Company's ongoing operations. The following provides a reconciliation to adjusted operating income, adjusted earnings before income taxes, adjusted income tax expense (benefit), adjusted net earnings attributable to controlling interest and adjusted net earnings per diluted share attributable to controlling interest from the most comparable GAAP measures for the three- and nine-month periods ended February 29, 2024 and February 28, 2023.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes measures the Company's ability to generate cash beyond what is required for its business operations and capital expenditures.

Pro forma adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes includes incremental and on-going impacts to the Company's operating results as a stand-alone public company resulting from the Separation from Former Parent. The pro forma financial information assumes the Separation occurred on June 1, 2022, the first day of the Company's 2023 fiscal year. The pro forma financial information has been prepared based upon the best available information and management estimates and is subject to assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying footnotes. It is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Company’s financial position or results of operations had the Separation occurred as of and for the periods indicated. In addition, the pro forma financial information is being provided for informational purposes only, and is not necessarily indicative of the Company’s future results of operations or financial condition had the Separation and related transactions been completed on the dates assumed. Management believes these assumptions and estimates are reasonable, given the information available on the date of this release. There were no incremental pro forma adjustments made for the three months ended February 29, 2024, given this period included the actual results of operating as a stand-alone public company. For the nine months ended February 29, 2024, the adjustments included in the information below represent only the adjustments for the period prior to the Separation.

This level of liquidity is significant as it indicates that the company has sufficient funds to maintain its operations through 2025 without the immediate need for additional financing. This is a positive signal to investors, as it reduces the risk of dilution from future capital raises in the short term.However, the reported net loss of $32.1 million for the fourth quarter and $98.1 million for the full year reflects the high costs associated with R&D in the biotech industry, particularly for companies like CARGO that are in the clinical stage of development. While these losses are not unusual for the sector, investors should monitor the company's burn rate and the progress of its clinical trials to gauge the potential for future return on investment.The addition of CARGO to the Russell 2000® Index could potentially increase its visibility among institutional investors and could lead to increased trading liquidity. The IPO that raised approximately $291.0 million is also an important milestone, providing the necessary capital to advance the company's product pipeline. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of the FIRCE-1 Phase 2 clinical study for firicabtagene autoleucel (firi-cel) is a critical step for CARGO Therapeutics in addressing relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. The fact that the Phase 1 study showed a complete response rate of 52% at Dose Level 1 is promising and suggests that firi-cel could offer a significant therapeutic benefit. Moreover, the 73% maintenance of complete response for at least 12 months is a strong indicator of the potential durability of the treatment.The focus on patients who have progressed after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy, a group with high unmet medical needs, could position CARGO as a leader in this niche if the outcomes are favorable. The interim results expected in the first half of 2025 will be a key inflection point for the company's valuation and future prospects. Market Research Analyst Entering the market with a next-generation therapy for cancer patients, especially in a segment with high unmet need, could position CARGO Therapeutics favorably within the biotech industry. The company's commercial-ready manufacturing process indicates a level of preparedness to transition from clinical stages to market, should the clinical outcomes prove positive.Investors should note the potential market size for treatments of relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, which could drive significant revenue for CARGO if firi-cel is approved. However, the competitive landscape, including alternative treatments and emerging therapies, will also play a important role in determining the company's market share and pricing power. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM – Potentially pivotal Phase 2 clinical study FIRCE-1 of firicabtagene autoleucel (CRG-022) is rapidly recruiting with 20 sites open to date; interim results expected 1H 2025 – SAN MATEO, Calif., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CARGO Therapeutics, Inc.

Financial Analyst The reported financial results from BIOLASE, Inc. indicate a modest revenue growth in a year marked by economic challenges, including higher interest rates which typically dampen capital expenditures in sectors like dental equipment. A notable detail is the divergence between U.S. and international performance, with U.S. laser revenue declining by 10%, while international laser revenue saw a 6% increase. This suggests a potential shift in the company's market dynamics or a difference in market penetration strategies.Furthermore, the increase in consumables revenue by 31% is significant as it points towards a successful strategy in creating recurring revenue streams, which can lead to more predictable and stable future earnings. This is further supported by the introduction of subscription models, which are becoming increasingly popular across various industries as they provide a steady cash flow. The reduction in operating expenses by 16% year-over-year is also a positive sign of cost management and operational efficiency improvements. Market Research Analyst BIOLASE's emphasis on the Waterlase Trial Program resulting in a 45% sales conversion rate showcases an effective sales strategy that could be a model for other medical device companies. The program seems to be a key driver in the increased adoption rate of the company's dental lasers. This is particularly important as product trials can lower the barriers to adoption for new technology in healthcare settings, where practitioners may be hesitant to change established procedures without evidence of clear benefits.Looking ahead, the company's guidance for 2024 suggests confidence in continued revenue growth and a positive adjusted EBITDA. This forward-looking statement may influence investor sentiment positively, provided the company can maintain its cost-saving measures and continue to grow sales effectively in both the U.S. and international markets. Medical Device Industry Expert The dental laser technology market is a niche but growing segment within the broader medical device industry. BIOLASE's focus on in-house manufacturing of critical components to achieve cost savings and improve quality is a strategic move that could provide a competitive edge, as control over the supply chain is a critical factor in maintaining product quality and reducing production costs.The company's ability to grow revenue despite a challenging interest rate environment is indicative of the resilience and potential demand for dental lasers. However, the net loss figures, although improved from the previous year, highlight the ongoing challenges in reaching profitability. The commitment to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in 2024 will be important in evaluating the company's long-term financial health and operational success. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM LAKE FOREST, CA / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2024 / BIOLASE, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIOL), the globally recognized leader in dental laser technology, who previously announced its preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, today reported its financial results for the quarter and full year.2023 Full-Year HighlightsAchieved revenue growth despite industry headwinds and a challenging interest rate environment throughout 2023.Key performance metrics demonstrate continued growth and momentum, including:Record consumable sales, including the introduction of recurring revenue subscriptions.Increased adoption of its industry-leading laser systems.Increased sales conversion rate of 45% due to the continued success of its Waterlase Trial Program.Achieved cost savings goals and improved quality from in-house manufacturing of critical components.""We were operating in a challenging spending environment given higher interest rates. However, our initiatives enabled us to grow full-year 2023 revenue modestly,"" commented John Beaver, President and Chief Executive Officer of BIOLASE. ""Our continuing efforts to heighten the interest in our industry-leading dental lasers are driving greater awareness and interest in our award-winning lasers, which we believe will continue in 2024 and allow us to accelerate our revenue growth as we return to a more normalized business climate. The increased utilization of our installed base is a bullish sentiment, as evidenced by the 20% increase in our consumable sales during the year, so our goal is to accelerate growth while continuing to improve our operations. Greater adoption of our dental lasers, coupled with the expansion of our gross margins and lower operating expenses, will allow us to meet our revenue and profitability objectives for 2024.""2023 Financial ResultsNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, was $49.2 million, an increase of 1% compared to net revenue of $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results and that, in some respects, these non-GAAP financial measures are more indicative of the Company's ongoing core operating performance than their GAAP equivalents.Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, stock-based and other non-cash compensation, severance expense, change in allowance for doubtful accounts, increase in inventory reserves, and other (income) expense, net. Management uses adjusted EBITDA in its evaluation of the Company's core results of operations and trends between fiscal periods and believes that these measures are important components of its internal performance measurement process. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, the non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.BIOLASE, INC.Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA and GAAP Net Loss Per Share to Adjusted EBITDA Per Share(Unaudited, in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders $(5,326) $(9,861) $(37,619) $(28,851)Deemed dividend on convertible preferred stock - - 16,987 217 GAAP net loss $(5,326) $(9,861) $(20,632) $(28,634)Adjustments: Interest expense, net 603 1,462 2,361 2,749 Income tax provision (15) 86 31 109 Depreciation 665 128 2,798 497 Severance expense 6 - 236 - Change in allowance for doubtful accounts 473 (16) 533 40 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation 182 612 1,232 2,303 Increase in inventory reserve and disposals 715 1,066 715 2,798 Other income, net (167) - (48) - Adjusted EBITDA $(2,864) $(6,523) $(12,774) $(20,138) GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders per share, basic and diluted $(1.76) $(128.06) $(29.44) $(418.13)Deemed dividend on convertible preferred stock - - 13.29 3.14 GAAP net loss per share, basic and diluted $(1.76) $(128.06) $(16.15) $(414.99)Adjustments: Interest expense, net 0.20 18.99 1.85 39.84 Income tax provision - 1.12 0.02 1.58 Depreciation 0.22 1.66 2.19 7.20 Severance expense - - 0.18 - Change in allowance for doubtful accounts 0.16 (0.21) 0.42 0.58 Stock-based and other non-cash compensation 0.06 7.95 0.96 33.38 Increase in inventory reserve and disposals 0.24 13.84 0.57 40.55 Other income, net (0.06) - (0.04) - Adjusted EBITDA per share, basic and diluted $(0.94) $(84.71) $(10.00) $(291.86)Other income, net for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 relates to issuance costs from the May 2023 public offering that were allocated to the Series H warrants, and issuance costs from the September 2023 public offering that were allocated to the Series J warrants and immediately expensed due to the liability classification of the warrants.

The company reported a net loss of $278,000 in Q4 2013. Financial Analyst The reported financial results from One Stop Systems, Inc. (OSS) indicate a strategic shift in the company's focus towards high-margin AI and ML markets. Despite a notable decline in revenue due to the discontinuation of lower-margin media sales, OSS has reported an increase in gross margin both for the year and the fourth quarter. This demonstrates a successful reorientation towards more profitable product lines. The reported increase in their sales pipeline, particularly with respect to AI Transportables, suggests potential for future revenue growth. However, investors should be mindful of the current net loss and the decrease in adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous year, which indicates that the company is still in the process of stabilizing its financial position post-transition.The reported partnership with Leidos' Dynetics and the multi-year collaboration with FLYHT Aerospace signal OSS's commitment to diversifying its revenue streams and strengthening its foothold in specialized markets. These developments, coupled with the anticipated return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of 2024, could potentially attract investor interest. Nonetheless, the increase in operating expenses, primarily due to transition costs and the impairment of goodwill are factors that could raise concerns about the company's operational efficiency and asset management. Market Research Analyst The HPC and AI/ML sectors are witnessing significant growth, driven by the need for advanced computing at the edge. OSS's unveiling of the Gen 5 short-depth server at Super Compute 23 responds to this demand, highlighting the company's innovation and potential to capture market share in this expanding industry. The focus on defense and commercial markets for AI Transportables is particularly timely, given the increased investment in defense technology and the growing commercial applications of AI. The strategic pivot and realignment of the company's go-to-market strategy appear to be in line with industry trends towards high-performance, rugged edge processing solutions.However, the reported softer economic conditions and timing delays with certain government programs are reminders of the external challenges that OSS and similar companies face. These factors could impact future revenue streams and should be monitored closely by stakeholders. The company's anticipation of $12.5 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2024 provides a benchmark for investors to gauge the company's progress in achieving its strategic objectives and managing external economic pressures. Defense Industry Analyst OSS's engagement with large prime contractors, such as the multi-million-dollar U.S. government program win with Leidos' Dynetics, positions the company within the lucrative defense sector. The defense industry's reliance on cutting-edge technology for applications like mobile AI signal collection and 360-degree situational awareness aligns with OSS's product offerings. The company's ability to secure and expand its role in government programs is indicative of its competitive edge and technical capabilities in providing rugged compute solutions. Such contracts not only contribute to the company's revenue but also enhance its credibility and reliability as a defense supplier.It is important to consider the long procurement cycles and stringent requirements of the defense industry, which can affect the timing and certainty of revenue recognition for OSS. The company's reported increase in its unfactored pipeline suggests optimism, yet the conversion of this pipeline into concrete orders will be a critical factor in evaluating OSS's future performance in the defense market. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Company to Hold a Conference Call Today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern TimeESCONDIDO, Calif., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- One Stop Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq: OSS), a leader in rugged high-performance compute (HPC) for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and sensor processing at the edge, reported results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. All quarterly and twelve-month comparisons are to the same year-ago period unless otherwise noted. “2023 was a transformative year for OSS, highlighted by a new management team, new board members, and a successful transition away from lower margin media revenues to our strategic plan focused on large and rapidly growing global markets driven by AI and ML,” stated OSS president and CEO, Mike Knowles. “Although revenue for 2023 reflects a $13.7 million year-over-year impact from reduced media revenue, our overall gross margin increased by 130 basis points for the year and 640 basis points for the fourth quarter. This gross margin improvement demonstrates the early success of our focus on higher margin sales supported by our AI Transportables growth strategy.” “During the second half of 2023, we began an extensive review of our go-to-market strategy and sales pipeline to align with our strategic focus on AI Transportables within the commercial and defense markets,” continued Knowles. “After a prudent review and qualification process, our five-year, unfactored pipeline has increased to over $1 billion as compared to $850 million just four months ago. This growth is being driven by increasing interest in AI/ML solutions, our enhanced sales and marketing platform, new collaborative relationships, and our expanding engagements with large prime contractors. As we convert our pipeline to orders, we believe we are well positioned to return to year-over-year sales growth in the second half of 2024, with improved gross margins.” Q4 2023 Operational Highlights Won a multi-million-dollar U.S. government program with Leidos’ Dynetics, a provider of mission-critical solutions, for an emerging specialized mobile AI signal collection application. The award is the first multi-year win OSS has secured with this prime contractor and is valued at approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million over the next three years, with an initial award of $500,000.Unveiled a Gen 5 short-depth server (SDS), at Super Compute 23, the international conference for high performance computing. Powered by four PCIe NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, the OSS Gen 5 SDS addresses the growing demand for more powerful AI compute, storage and latency performance at the edge.Commenced a multi-year design and manufacturing collaboration for FLYHT Aerospace’s automated flight information reporting systems (AFIRS™) Edge family. The design and manufacturing agreement with FLYHT is valued at a minimum of $6 million over the initial five-year term.Booked an additional award from the U.S. Army Ground Vehicle Systems Center for the 360 Degree Situational Awareness program to include sensor processing for video data, increasing OSS scope to all rugged compute and switching for the full system solution.Continued to reprofile the board of directors, including the appointments of Mitchell Herbets and Joseph Manko, Jr. to the company’s board. Outlook The company anticipates revenue of approximately $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2024. Q4 2023 Financial Summary Consolidated revenue decreased 27.9% to $13.2 million due to lower shipments to a former media customer that have now ended, which impacted fourth quarter sales by approximately $3.1 million. The decrease in sales was also due to softer economic conditions and timing delays associated with certain government programs. OSS segment revenue declined 43.5% to $6.4 million due to the factors mentioned above. Bressner segment revenue decreased 2.5% to $6.8 million. Consolidated gross margin percentage increased 640 basis points to 33.7%, from 27.3% in the same year-ago quarter. OSS segment gross margin increased 14.5 percentage points to 45.9%, attributable to the absence of lower margin media revenue and costs, and the higher mix of its rugged edge processing products. Bressner’s gross margin improved 1.6 percentage points to 22.2%, as compared to 20.5% in the year-ago quarter, due to product mix, the sale of higher margin OSS products, and having sought-after products readily sold at a premium. Total operating expenses increased 3% to $4.8 million. This increase was predominantly attributable to approximately $175,000 of transition costs in the quarter. OSS reported a net loss of $278,000, or $(0.01) per share, as compared to a net loss of $3.3 million, or $(0.16) per share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2023, included a provision for income taxes of $42,000 as compared to $4.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting an increase in taxes being attributable to a write-down of the deferred tax asset in 2022. The company reported non-GAAP net income of $177,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $2.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP metric, was $353,000, a decrease from adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. On December 31, 2023, cash and short-term investments totaled $11.8 million. This represents a decrease of $1.4 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to cash deployed in working capital for inventories. Full Year of 2023 Financial Summary For the full year of 2023, consolidated revenue decreased 15.9% to $60.9 million. The decrease in revenue in the full year of 2023 was due to the same reasons for the decline in the fourth quarter. Excluding revenue from the former media customer, revenues were up approximately 4.0%. OSS segment revenue was $28.8 million and Bressner segment revenue was $32.1 million, inclusive of approximately $3.2 million of OSS product offerings. Consolidated gross margin increased 130 basis points to 29.5% from 28.2% in 2022. OSS segment gross margin was 35.6%, compared to 32.7% in 2022. The increase in gross margin was due to the shift from lower margin media sales to higher margin AI transportable product revenue. Bressner segment gross margin was 24.0%, compared to 21.5% in 2022, due to strategic management of inventory and having sought-after products sold at a premium, as well as product mix and increased sales of OSS products. Total operating expenses increased 37.4% to $25.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $5.6 million attributable to an impairment of goodwill write-down, and $1.7 million of one-time CEO and board transition costs. Excluding a goodwill impairment charge of $5.6 million and CEO transition and board reprofiling costs of $1.7 million, OSS operating expenses decreased 1.5% from the prior year. OSS reported a net loss of $6.7 million, or $(0.32) per share, inclusive of the $1.7 million employee retention credit, compared to a net loss of $2.2 million, or $(0.11) per share, in 2022. The company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $415,000, or $(0.02) per share, as compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $175,000, or $(0.01) per diluted share, in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.1 million, compared to $5.2 million in 2022. Both non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA exclude the $5.6 million impairment of goodwill and the $1.7 million employee retention credit. Loss before the provision for income taxes on a proforma basis, excluding the impairment of goodwill, CEO transition and board reprofiling costs and the benefit of the employee retention credit resulted in a proforma loss of $165,000 as compared to income before taxes of $2.2 million in 2022.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that the use of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, is helpful for an investor to assess the performance of the Company. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, acquisition expense, impairment of long-lived assets, financing costs, government funded programs, fair value adjustments from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation expense and expenses related to discontinued operations. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and non-recurring expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time. Our adjusted EBITDA measure may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual items. Our adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.

We believe that exclusion of certain selected items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends and allows for comparability with our peer company index and industry. We use this measure along with the corresponding GAAP financial measures to manage our business and to evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace. The Company defines non-GAAP income (loss) as income or (loss) before amortization, government funded programs, impairment of long lived assets, stock-based compensation, expenses related to discontinued operations, and acquisition costs. Adjusted EPS expresses adjusted income (loss) on a per share basis using weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted EPS financial adjustments described above, and investors should not infer from our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.

Conservative approach to leverage and focus on growth opportunities. Regular quarterly cash distribution declared for stockholders. Negative Reported GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Public offering of 64.4 million shares of common stock leading to dilution for existing shareholders. Interest expense savings on an annualized basis may not fully offset debt repayment costs. Uncertainty in predicting the impact of non-GAAP measures on reported measures. Potential risks associated with maintaining a low net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA range. Financial Analyst The financial results of American Healthcare REIT, Inc., particularly the reported GAAP net loss and Normalized Funds from Operations (NFFO), are indicative of the company's operational efficiency and fiscal health. The NFFO, a key metric for REIT investors, reflects the company's ability to generate cash flow from its operations. The reported growth in Same-Store revenue and Net Operating Income (NOI) suggests an upward trajectory in the company's core operations, driven by occupancy gains, which is an encouraging sign for investors. The strategic disposal of Non-Core Properties and the subsequent debt reduction with proceeds from a public offering demonstrate a proactive approach to balance sheet management. This could be perceived positively by the market as it improves the company's leverage metrics, potentially leading to a re-rating of the stock by analysts.The guidance for 2024, with projected mid-point NAREIT FFO per share and Normalized FFO per share, provides investors with a benchmark for future performance. While these figures show a conservative outlook compared to the actual figures from 2023, they still signal confidence in the company's ability to maintain growth in a challenging healthcare real estate market. The company's capital market activities, including the swap agreement and the public offering, reflect a strategic move to manage interest rate risk and strengthen the balance sheet. The significant interest expense savings anticipated from these activities could enhance the company's profitability and shareholder value in the long term. Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Analyst From a REIT-specific perspective, American Healthcare REIT's focus on its Integrated Senior Health Campuses (ISHC) and the SHOP (Senior Housing Operating Properties) segment suggests a strategic emphasis on high growth potential areas within the healthcare real estate sector. The reported NOI growth rates, particularly the strong performance in the SHOP and ISHC segments, highlight the company's ability to capitalize on the increasing demand for senior housing and healthcare facilities. This could attract investors who are looking for exposure to a niche within the broader real estate market that has demographic tailwinds.The company's transactional activity, including acquisitions and disposals, is a critical aspect of its operational strategy. The acquisition of a senior housing portfolio and the management agreement with Compass Senior Living could expand the company's operational footprint and diversify its income streams. The yield on cost for these acquisitions, projected at around 9%, is a significant figure that might catch the eye of investors seeking high-yield opportunities within the REIT sector. Furthermore, the company's reduction in debt and improvement in leverage metrics could lead to increased financial stability and flexibility, which is vital for sustaining growth and weathering potential market downturns. Market Research Analyst The healthcare real estate market, in which American Healthcare REIT operates, is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as demographic shifts, healthcare policy changes and economic cycles. The company's performance, particularly its Same-Store revenue growth and NOI improvements, reflects a robust demand for healthcare-related real estate, which is likely to continue given the aging population. The REIT's strategic focus on RIDEA-operated assets and SHOP facilities aligns with the broader industry trend towards more integrated and operationally efficient senior healthcare services.The listing of the company's common stock on the NYSE is a significant milestone that could enhance liquidity and attract a broader investor base. The entry into a swap agreement to manage interest rate exposure is a prudent step in the current environment of interest rate uncertainty. The company's forward-looking statements regarding occupancy gains and NOI growth in 2024 suggest a positive outlook, but these projections should be weighed against potential market risks, including changes in healthcare legislation, shifts in consumer preferences and broader economic headwinds that could impact the healthcare real estate sector. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM IRVINE, Calif., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- American Healthcare REIT, Inc. (the ""Company"") (NYSE: AHR) announced today its fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Further, the Company reported various subsequent-to-quarter-end items. Key Highlights: Reported GAAP net loss attributable to stockholders of $(0.42) and $(1.08) per basic and diluted share for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023.Reported Normalized Funds from Operations attributable to stockholders (""NFFO"") of $0.38 and $1.40 per basic and diluted share for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023, respectively.Achieved 5.2% and 7.7% total portfolio Same-Store (""SS"") revenue growth for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022 largely driven by occupancy gains in the Company's RIDEA-operated assets.Achieved year-over-year total portfolio Same-Store Net Operating Income (""NOI"") growth of 8.6%, highlighted by 27.2% and 14.0% Same-Store NOI growth from our SHOP and Integrated Senior Health Campuses (""ISHC""), respectively.Disposed of approximately $195 million of Non-Core Properties across the Company's Outpatient Medical and SHOP segments during the 12 months ended December 31, 2023.Subsequent to year end, completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of our common stock priced at $12.00 per share and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") under the symbol ""AHR"".Subsequent to year end, paid down approximately $721 million of outstanding debt obligations carrying a weighted average interest rate of approximately 7.53% using the net proceeds from the public offering, meaningfully improving leverage metrics and providing the Company with additional capacity and flexibility.""We are proud of our 2023 operating results and have begun 2024 with a successful common stock offering and the listing of our common stock on the NYSE. As a publicly listed company, we are committed to being responsible stewards of capital for all our stockholders. The entire team at American Healthcare REIT is working diligently to ensure optimal performance across our entire portfolio,"" said Danny Prosky, American Healthcare REIT's President and CEO. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2023 Results ""Our portfolio continues to recover since the onset of the pandemic, with the trajectory of revenue growth drivers all heading in the right direction. We have continued to see occupancy gains since the end of 2023. Our unique investment in Integrated Senior Health Campuses remains the most attractive part of our portfolio with operating performance metrics such as occupancy already surpassing pre-pandemic levels,"" said Gabe Willhite, the Company's Chief Operating Officer. SS NOI Growth Rates: Quarter Ended December 31, 2023 Relative to Quarter Ended December 31, 2022 Metric 4Q 2023 Actual ISHC Outpatient Medical SHOP Triple-Net Leased Total Portfolio 13.9% 2.3% 44.9% 3.5% 9.5% SS NOI Growth Rates: Year Ended December 31, 2023 Relative to Year Ended December 31, 2022 Metric FY 2023 Actual ISHC Outpatient Medical SHOP Triple-Net Leased Total Portfolio 14.0% 3.2% 27.2% 2.0% 8.6% Same-Store revenue for our RIDEA-operated assets grew by 6.0% and 8.9% during the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2022. Expense growth across our SHOP assets has moderated, partially due to recent operator transitions and normalizing compensation expenses as a result of less agency-labor usage across the portfolio. In aggregate, NOI growth remains well above historical levels across the portfolio, as margin and occupancy continue to recover from pandemic-era troughs. Full Year 2024 Guidance The Company has established the following guidance ranges for the year ending December 31, 2024: Full Year 2024 Guidance Metric FY 2023Actual FY 2024 Range FY 2024 Midpoint NAREIT FFO per share Normalized FFO per share Total Portfolio SS NOI Growth: $0.99 $1.40 8.6% $1.13 to $1.19 $1.18 to $1.24 5.0% to 7.0% $1.16 $1.21 6.0% Certain of the assumptions underlying the Company's 2024 outlook can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release and in the appendix of the Company's Fourth Quarter 2023 Supplemental Financial Information (""Supplemental""). A reconciliation of Net Loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to NAREIT FFO and NFFO can be found within the Non-GAAP reconciliations in this earnings release. Non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, as used in this earnings release, are also defined and further explained in the Supplemental. Within this release, we provide certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information, which management uses for planning and measuring performance. We are not able to reconcile forward-looking non-GAAP measures to reported measures without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact or exact timing of items that may impact comparability throughout the year. ""We believe 2024 should be another year of occupancy gains within our SHOP segment that should support NOI growth and margin expansion. Looking at our ISHC segment, we expect occupancy to remain at or above pre-pandemic levels over the course of the year. In aggregate, our guidance estimates another year of mid-single-digit NOI growth across our entire diversified healthcare portfolio,"" said Prosky. Transactional Activity During full year 2023, the Company completed a campus acquisition and three lease buyouts within its ISHC segment for total consideration of approximately $43.9 million, plus closing costs. We expect these acquisitions to generate a yield on cost of approximately 9.0%. During 2023, the Company sold 16 Non-Core outpatient medical facilities and six Non-Core SHOP facilities generating approximately $195 million in gross proceeds. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company continued to opportunistically dispose of Non-Core assets, and has sold an outpatient medical building in Marietta, Georgia and a SHOP facility in Menlo Park, California for approximately $11 million in aggregate gross proceeds. Additionally, as previously announced, on February 1, 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of a senior housing portfolio in Oregon consisting of 856 beds across 12 facilities. The total consideration consisted of $94.5 million of assumed debt, plus closing costs, reflecting a price per bed of approximately $110,000. The assumed debt has a fixed interest rate of 4.54% and matures on January 1, 2028. The portfolio will be managed by Compass Senior Living through a RIDEA structure. The Company has a longstanding relationship with Compass Senior Living as a tenant in our triple-net leased segment and recognized the strength of the operator through the COVID-19 pandemic. The management agreement will be the Company's first with Compass Senior Living expanding the Company's high-quality operator relationships. Capital Markets and Balance Sheet Activity On December 21, 2023, the Company entered into a $200 million swap agreement relating to debt at the ISHC portfolio, swapping SOFR for a fixed rate of 4.40% on its variable-rate debt. This agreement was effective as of January 5, 2024. The Company now carries $750 million of interest rate swap agreements fixing SOFR at a weighted average interest rate of 4.16%. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company completed a public offering of 64.4 million shares of its common stock, raising gross proceeds of $772.8 million, and listed its common stock on the NYSE under the symbol ""AHR"". This represented the largest REIT offering and listing event in the US since 2018[1]. Net offering proceeds were used to pay down approximately $721 million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 7.53%. As previously announced, as of February 16, 2024, the Company had $747 million of outstanding balances on its lines of credit and term loan, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.91% (taking into account the effect of swap instruments), and $803 million of undrawn capacity under its lines of credit and term loan. This significant reduction in outstanding debt has resulted in an improvement in the Company's leverage by meaningfully reducing near-term maturities and high-interest floating-rate debt. In aggregate, the pay downs will result in approximately $54 million in interest expense savings on an annualized basis. ""After repaying approximately $721 million of indebtedness with the net proceeds from our January 2024 public equity offering, we estimate that we will be in the low 6x net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA range at March 31, 2024. As we look ahead, we will maintain a conservative approach to leverage, while being selective regarding external growth opportunities. The offering and debt repayment were transformative for our capital structure, and we believe that the embedded growth within our SHOP and ISHC segments will allow our leverage profile to continue to improve,"" said Brian Peay, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Distribution As previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash distribution for the quarter ending March 31, 2024 of $0.25 per share of its common stock, Class T common stock and Class I common stock. The distribution is payable on or about April 19, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2024.

The Company does not provide guidance for the most comparable GAAP financial measures of total revenues and property operating and maintenance expenses. Additionally, a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of Same-Store NOI growth to the comparable GAAP financial measures cannot be provided without unreasonable effort because the Company is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations. Such items include, but are not limited to, impairment on depreciated real estate assets, net (gain)/loss on sale of previously depreciated real estate assets, stock-based compensation, casualty loss, non-Same-Store revenues, and non-Same-Store operating expenses. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on the Company's GAAP results for the guidance period. Definitions Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and pursuit costs, gain (loss) on sales of real estate, unrealized foreign currency gain (loss), change in fair value of financial instruments, impairment of real estate assets, lease termination revenue, non-recurring items, and adjusted for non-controlling interest.Affiliated: means an OM (as defined on the next page) that, as of a specified date, has 25.0% or more of its square footage occupied by at least one healthcare system.AL: refers to assisted living units.Annualized Adjusted EBITDA: current period (shown as quarterly) EBITDA multiplied by 4.Annualized Base Rent or ABR: contractual base rent for the last month of the applicable period multiplied by 12.Cash NOI: Cash NOI is defined as NOI but excluding the impact of, without duplication, (1) non-cash items such as straight-line rent and the amortization of lease intangibles, (2) third party facility rent payments and (3) other items set forth in the Cash NOI reconciliation included herein. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.EBITDA: EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.EBITDAR: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and facilities rent. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate EBITDAR and have not independently verified the information.EBITDAR Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDAR to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDAR Coverage is a measure of a property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations.EBITDARM: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees. We use unaudited, periodic financial information provided solely by tenants to calculate EBITDARM and have not independently verified the information.EBITDARM Coverage: represents the ratio of EBITDARM to contractual rent for leases or interest and principal payments for loans. EBITDARM coverage is a measure of a property's ability to generate sufficient cash flows for the operator/borrower to pay rent and meet other obligations, assuming that management fees are not paid.GAAP revenue: revenue recognized in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (""GAAP""), which includes straight line rent and other non-cash adjustments.GLA: gross leasable area.Grant Income: stimulus funds granted to us through various federal and state government programs, such as the CARES Act, established for eligible healthcare providers to preserve liquidity in response to lost revenues and/or increased healthcare expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; such grants are not loans and, as such, are not required to be repaid, subject to certain conditions.Hospital: hospital properties typically will include acute care, long term acute care, specialty and rehabilitation hospitals and generally will be leased to single tenants or operators under triple-net lease structures.IL: refers to independent living units.Integrated senior health campuses or ISHC: Integrated senior health campuses include a range of senior care, including independent living, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing services, and certain ancillary businesses. Integrated Senior Health Campuses are predominantly operated utilizing a RIDEA structure.Maintenance Capex: AHR-invested capital expenditures, whether routine or non-routine (including second generation tenant incentives and leasing commissions), that extend the useful life of a property but are not expected to generate incremental income for the Company.MC: refers to memory-care units.NAREIT FFO or FFO: funds from operations attributable to controlling interest is a non-GAAP financial measure, consistent with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT (the ""White Paper""). The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets, gains or losses upon consolidation of a previously held equity interest, and impairment write downs of certain real estate assets and investments, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that impairments are based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.NAV: Net asset value.Net Debt: Total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash pertaining to debt.NOI: Net operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that is defined as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, generated from properties before general and administrative expenses, business acquisition expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, gain or loss on dispositions, impairment of real estate investments, impairment of goodwill, income or loss from unconsolidated entities, gain on re-measurement of previously held equity interest, foreign currency gain or loss, other income, and income tax benefit or expense.Non-Core Properties: assets that have been deemed not essential to generating future economic benefit or values to our day-to-day operations and/or are scheduled for closure or to be sold.Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest or NFFO: Normalized FFO attributable to controlling interest is defined as FFO further adjusted for the following items included in the determination of GAAP net income (loss): expensed acquisition fees and costs, which we refer to as business acquisition expenses; amounts relating to changes in deferred rent and amortization of above and below-market leases (which are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis); the non-cash impact of changes to our equity instruments; non-cash or non-recurring income or expense; the noncash effect of income tax benefits or expenses; capitalized interest; impairment of goodwill; amortization of closing costs on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income (loss); gains or losses included in net income (loss) from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect Normalized FFO on the same basis.Occupancy: OM occupancy represents the percentage of total rentable square feet leased and occupied, including month-to-month leases, as of the date reported.

Because we have a controlling interest in these entities, these entities and the properties these entities own are consolidated in our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. However, while such properties are presented in our financial statements on a consolidated basis, we are only entitled to our pro rata share of the net cash flows generated by such properties. As a result, we have presented certain property information in this supplemental presentation based on our pro rata ownership interest as of the applicable date in properties included in these entities and not on a consolidated basis. In such instances, information is noted as being presented on a ""pro-rata share"" basis.RevPOR: Revenue per occupied room. RevPOR is calculated as total revenue generated by occupied rooms divided by the number of occupied rooms.RIDEA: used to describe properties within the portfolio that utilize the RIDEA structure as described in ""RIDEA structure"".RIDEA structure: a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, pursuant to which we lease certain healthcare real estate properties to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS), which in turn contracts with an eligible independent contractor (EIK) to operate such properties for a fee. Under this structure, the EIK receives management fees, and the TRS receives revenue from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and retains, as profit, any revenue remaining after payment of expenses (including intercompany rent paid to us and any taxes at the TRS level) necessary to operate the property. Through the RIDEA structure, in addition to receiving rental revenue from the TRS, we retain any after-tax profit from the operation of the healthcare real estate properties and benefit from any improved operational performance while bearing the risk of any decline in operating performance at the properties.Same-Store or SS: Properties owned and consolidated the full period in both comparison periods and that are not otherwise excluded.

Same-Store NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. Both Cash NOI and Same-Store NOI include ownership and other adjustments.Senior Housing-Leased: Senior housing facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs, and include assisted living, memory care, and independent living. Residents of assisted living facilities typically require limited medical care and need assistance with eating, bathing, dressing, and/or medication management and those services can be provided by staff at the facility. Resident programs offered at such facilities may include transportation, social activities, and exercise and fitness programs. Our Senior Housing-Leased properties are triple-net leased.SHOP: senior housing operating properties.SNFs: skilled nursing facilities.SOFR: The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities.

Revenue in Fiscal 2023 grew to $16.40 million, up 28% from $12.84 million in Fiscal 2022. The increases are due to revenue growth from new customer acquisition as well as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar. The Company completed December 31, 2023 with $18.0 million of software ARR and $18.1 million of Total ARR, growing 22% and 23% over December 31, 2022, respectively. However, this reflects a significant slowdown in our rate of ARR growth, generating just $0.6 million of Software ARR from new and existing customers in the three months ended December 31, 2023, down 45% from the $1.1 million in the three month period ended December 31, 2022 and a 43% sequential decline from $1.1 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Gross margins remained strong at 83% ($3.61 million) in Q4'23 compared to 80% ($2.88 million) in Q4'22 and 81% ($3.34 million) in Q3'23. Gross Margins in Fiscal 2023 of 81% ($13.33 million), remained steady from 81% ($10.43 million) in Fiscal 2022. Incurred Adjusted Operating Costs of $4.44 million in Q4'23, a 14% decrease from $5.17 million in Q4'22, and remained steady from $4.46 million incurred in Q3'23. Adjusted operating costs in Fiscal 2023 were $19.18 million, a 5% decrease from $20.11 million in Fiscal 2022. Reported a Q4'23 Adjusted EBITDA loss of $0.83 million, an improvement of 64% from $2.30 million in Q4'22, and an improvement of 26% sequentially from Q3'23. EBITDA loss in Fiscal 2023 was $5.84 million, a decrease of 40% from $9.69 million in Fiscal 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA loss is evidence of the Company's plan to reduce Adjusted Operating Costs while growing Revenue in line with the Company's long-term strategy. Ended Fiscal 2023 with modified working capital (excluding contract acquisition assets, deferred revenue, lease liabilities and debt) of $0.78 million (December 2022: $2.31 million), total lease liabilities and debt of $3.77 million (Fiscal 2022: total lease liabilities and debt of $1.07 million). For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company increased $3.00 million of bank indebtedness, collected proceeds of $3.50 million from a private placement and increased its Revolving Credit Facility to $9.00 million, with $3.46 million drawn.1 Adjusted Operating Costs, Adjusted EBITDA Loss, and Modified Working Capital are non-IFRS measures. See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" section of the Company's MD&A for further discussion, the ""Results of Operations"" section and the ""Liquidity and Capital Resources"" section of the MD&A for reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure. Adjusted Operating Costs includes Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, and General and Administrative expenses, and excludes share-based compensation, depreciation, and certain non-recurring expenses. The Company considers Restructuring Costs, as defined in the Company's MD&A, to be non-recurring in nature and not indicative of continuing operations. We use this metric as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance and assess our ability to generate cash flow. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA Loss provides a meaningful measure for assessment of Company performance as it removes non-cash and non-operating expenses such as financing costs, and non-recurring expenses. Modified Working Capital is a non-IFRS measure that represents current assets less current liabilities and adjusted to exclude contract acquisition assets, deferred revenue, lease liabilities and debt. We use this metric as a supplemental measure to assess financial sustainability and sufficient liquidity to preserve the Company's capacity to continue operating, in providing benefits to our stakeholders and in providing an adequate return on investment to our shareholders by selling our services at a price commensurate with the level of operating risk assumed by the Company.2Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) provides an indication of future revenue and billings from customers as of the reporting date. ARR represents the sum of the annualized recurring software and managed service fees from existing customer contracts or commitments as of the reporting period end date, and as such management believes ARR to be a meaningful measure for assessment of Company performance. ARR is recorded as deferred revenue when it is invoiced and is recognized in revenue evenly on a monthly basis over the contract term at the US dollar exchange rate in effect at the time of invoicing. Substantially all of the Company's ARR is denominated in USD. The average US dollar exchange rate of ARR was C$1.3437 at December 31, 2023 and C$1.3141 at December 31, 2022.

Financial Analyst Upon reviewing Suncor Energy's recent filings, including the 2023 Annual Report and 2024 Management Proxy Circular, we can dissect the potential implications for investors and stakeholders. These documents provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial health, operational strategies and future outlook, which are pivotal for assessing investment viability.One key aspect to consider is the performance metrics such as revenue, profit margins and capital expenditures. These indicators help in evaluating the company's efficiency and potential for growth. Additionally, the strategic focus on transitioning to a low-emissions future and investing in renewable fuels may signal a long-term growth trajectory aligned with global energy trends. However, the capital intensity of such transitions must be weighed against the potential for regulatory changes and market demand for cleaner energy.Furthermore, the energy trading activities and their contribution to the overall revenue stream should be scrutinized. Volatility in commodity markets often impacts the profitability of trading operations and hence, the stability of earnings for companies like Suncor Energy. Investors should consider the company's risk management strategies around such activities. Environmental Policy Expert Suncor Energy's commitment to advancing the transition to a low-emissions future is a significant move within the energy sector. The emphasis on developing petroleum resources while also investing in power and renewable fuels addresses the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions.Investors are increasingly looking at environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. Suncor's efforts, such as the Electric HighwayTM, could position the company favorably in an industry facing pressure to reduce carbon footprints. It is essential to analyze the company's sustainability reports to understand the effectiveness of their environmental strategies and the potential impact of environmental regulations on their operations and profitability.While these initiatives may present long-term benefits, they also require substantial upfront investments. The balance between maintaining profitability and investing in sustainable projects is delicate and requires careful analysis of the company's financial allocation towards these efforts. Energy Market Analyst Analyzing Suncor Energy's operations, such as oil sands development and petroleum refining, provides insight into the company's positioning within the broader energy market. The diversification across upstream (oil production) and downstream (refining and distribution) operations could offer resilience against market fluctuations.However, the energy sector is subject to geopolitical risks, changes in global oil prices and shifts in consumer behavior towards alternative energy sources. It's beneficial to compare Suncor's performance and strategies with industry peers to gauge its competitive edge. Additionally, the company's investments in renewable energy resources need to be assessed in terms of market readiness and potential returns, considering the long gestation period for such investments to become profitable.Understanding the market dynamics and Suncor's adaptability to changing energy demands is important for stakeholders. The company's ability to balance traditional energy operations with emerging renewable investments will likely be a determining factor in its future market performance. 03/21/2024 - 06:57 PM Calgary, Alberta--(Newsfile Corp. - March 21, 2024) - Suncor Energy (TSX: SU) (NYSE: SU) has filed its 2023 Annual Report, 2023 Annual Information Form and 2024 Management Proxy Circular.

Announces Upsizing and Pricing of $1.0 Billion of Senior Notes Due 2032 Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (RHP) announces successful upsizing and pricing of $1.0 billion senior notes due 2032. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries. The net proceeds are expected to be approximately $983 million, with plans to repay existing debts and expenses. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Ryman Hospitality Properties' decision to upsize their senior notes offering from $800 million to $1 billion is a significant move that reflects the company's capital raising strategy and confidence in its ability to service debt. The 6.500% interest rate on the new notes, due in 2032, is notably higher than the rates on their existing notes, which could indicate a strategic response to current market conditions. The increased interest rate may attract investors looking for higher yield opportunities amidst a potentially rising interest rate environment.The use of proceeds to prepay existing debt and related expenses shows a proactive approach to debt management. The prepayment of the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center's loan and the repayment of the term loan B suggests a targeted strategy to improve the company's debt profile and reduce interest expenses in the long term. However, the higher interest rate of the new issuance could offset some of these savings, depending on the difference in rates between the new and existing debt. Debt Market Analyst The private placement of senior notes is a common tool for companies like Ryman Hospitality Properties to access capital without diluting shareholder equity. The guarantee by the company and its subsidiaries provides an additional layer of security for investors, which may make the notes more appealing despite the lack of public registration. This move suggests that the company is leveraging its creditworthiness and existing assets to secure favorable terms, even in a private market setting.However, the exclusivity to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons indicates a targeted fundraising approach, potentially limiting the pool of investors but also simplifying the compliance requirements. The successful closure of this offering will be a testament to institutional confidence in the company's financial stability and growth prospects. Investors should note the potential risks associated with the lack of liquidity due to the absence of a public market for these securities. 03/21/2024 - 06:27 PM NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. (NYSE: RHP) (the “Company”) announced today that its subsidiaries, RHP Hotel Properties, LP (the “Operating Partnership”) and RHP Finance Corporation (together, with the Operating Partnership, the “Issuers”), successfully upsized and priced the private placement of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.500% senior notes due 2032 (the “Notes”). The aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be issued in the offering was increased to $1.0 billion from the previously announced $800.0 million. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and guaranteed by the Company and its subsidiaries that guarantee its existing credit facility, 4.750% senior unsecured notes due 2027, 7.250% senior unsecured notes due 2028 and 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2029. Subject to customary closing conditions, the Issuers expect the private placement of the Notes to close on March 28, 2024. The aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the notes are expected to be approximately $983 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The Operating Partnership intends to contribute a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to its subsidiaries that own the Gaylord Rockies Resort & Convention Center, and such subsidiaries intend to use such net proceeds to prepay the indebtedness outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of July 2, 2019, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, as amended from time to time, and to pay related fees and expenses. The Operating Partnership intends to use the remaining net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay, as soon as practicable, approximately $200 million of indebtedness outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s term loan B pursuant to its existing credit facility. There can be no assurance that the offering of the notes will be consummated.

The reverse split aims to increase the price per share by approximately twenty times. CEO to gain significant voting power post-split. Stock options and restricted shares to be adjusted. Shareholders to receive new share certificates. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of ETAO International Co., Ltd.'s 1 for 20 reverse stock split, increase in authorized shares and alteration to share capital is a strategic move that could have several financial implications. From a liquidity standpoint, reverse splits are often employed by companies to elevate their stock price, thereby potentially avoiding delisting from major exchanges that have minimum share price requirements. Although the company states that the post-split share price may not maintain its proportional increase, the short-term effect could still provide a temporary boost in share price perception.Additionally, the reclassification of shares and the resulting shift in voting power to the CEO, Mr. Wensheng Liu, is noteworthy. This consolidation of voting power could lead to concerns about corporate governance and shareholder influence, particularly for minority investors. The adjustment of stock options and restricted shares to reflect the reverse split is a routine procedure to maintain the value and incentives for employees and investors holding these instruments. However, the impact on market perception and the company's governance structure could influence investor confidence and the stock's long-term performance. Corporate Governance Expert The re-designation of shares resulting in ETAO's CEO, Mr. Wensheng Liu, increasing his total voting power from 48.5% to 86.7% represents a significant shift in the company's power dynamics. Such a change raises questions about the balance of power within the company and the potential impact on decision-making processes. While concentrated control can lead to swift strategic decisions, it can also lead to increased risks if the interests of the majority shareholder diverge from those of the company or its minority shareholders.Investors should be aware of the implications of such a governance structure, as it could affect the company's agility in adapting to market changes or pursuing new opportunities. The concentration of voting power may also influence the company's ability to attract new investors who might be wary of limited influence over corporate affairs. This change underscores the importance of understanding the corporate governance practices of a company and how they can affect investment risk and shareholder value. Market Research Analyst ETAO's reverse stock split and subsequent trading on a split-adjusted basis may result in a higher per-share price, which could alter the stock's marketability. A higher share price might make the stock more appealing to institutional investors and reduce volatility due to lower trading by retail investors. However, the market's reception to such corporate actions can be mixed, as they may be perceived as a cosmetic change rather than an improvement in the company's fundamental value.Market participants will closely monitor the stock's performance post-split to gauge the effectiveness of the reverse split. It is essential to consider that while the reverse split aims to increase the stock price, it does not inherently change the company's market capitalization or its underlying financial health. Investors and analysts will likely scrutinize the company's future financial performance and strategic direction to determine if the reverse split aligns with positive business developments or if it serves as a temporary measure to meet exchange listing requirements. 03/21/2024 - 05:20 PM This press release has been corrected to include further details regarding the reverse stock split of ETAO International Co., Ltd.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst KKR's announcement of a substantial sum in realized performance income and realized investment income is indicative of a robust monetization strategy for the first quarter of 2024. The composition of 70% performance income suggests a strong alignment with the company's investment outcomes, which is a positive signal for investors looking for performance-based returns. The 30% from investment income, likely including dividends and interest, reflects a diversified income stream, which could mitigate risk for shareholders.The disclosure of secondary sales and strategic transactions as primary drivers provides insight into KKR's active management approach. However, investors should note that these figures are not final and do not account for total revenues or potential expenses that could affect net income. The caution against using these preliminary figures as a predictor for the full quarter or the year-end results is a reminder of the inherent uncertainties in the investment business. Market Research Analyst The update from KKR sheds light on the company's interim financial health and could influence market sentiment. The emphasis on a mix of secondary sales and strategic transactions suggests KKR is leveraging its assets and partnerships effectively. Despite the positive news, stakeholders should consider the broader economic context, including market volatility and interest rates, which could impact the valuation of KKR's portfolio and the sustainability of dividend and interest income.Furthermore, the lack of full-quarter data and the exclusion of other income sources and expenses in the announcement should prompt a cautious interpretation. Market analysts would recommend a holistic view, taking into account KKR's historical performance, industry trends and the performance of comparable firms to contextualize these preliminary figures. Economist The financial update from KKR provides an early indication of economic activity within the private equity sector. The significant amount of realized income points to active markets and possibly favorable exit conditions for investments. This could reflect broader economic trends, such as market liquidity and investor confidence, which are essential for such transactions.However, the reliance on secondary sales and strategic transactions could be influenced by macroeconomic factors, including regulatory changes or shifts in investor sentiment. While the present data is promising, it is important to analyze subsequent reports for a fuller picture of the economic impact. An economist would also consider the potential implications of this performance on employment, market competition and the overall health of the sectors in which KKR is invested. 03/21/2024 - 05:37 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- KKR today announced a monetization activity update for the period from January 1, 2024 to March 21, 2024.

Analyzing the audited financial statements, which adhere to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), is essential for understanding the company's performance and strategic direction. A key factor to consider is the company's revenue streams, including growth in local and long-distance telephony, cellular, data transmission and pay TV and internet services. Investors should also assess the impact of Telecom Argentina's operations in Paraguay and Uruguay on its overall financial results.It's important to evaluate the company's operational efficiency and cost management, as well as its capital expenditure, which can influence future revenue and earnings potential. The debt levels and liquidity position detailed in the report will provide insights into the company's financial stability and ability to sustain growth. Additionally, comparing year-over-year financial metrics can reveal trends and potential areas of concern or opportunity. Investors should also be aware of the competitive landscape in the telecommunications sector in Argentina and neighboring countries, as it can affect market share and profitability. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Telecom Argentina's performance is influenced by the regulatory environment, technological advancements and consumer behavior trends in the telecommunications industry. Understanding how these factors interact with the company's strategy and financial outcomes is crucial. For instance, regulatory changes can affect the cost structure or revenue potential in different service areas. Technological investments that improve service quality or expand coverage can attract more subscribers and increase customer loyalty, thus impacting the company's market position.Consumer trends, such as the adoption of streaming services or the transition to mobile broadband, can also play a significant role in shaping demand for Telecom Argentina's offerings.

The Company's Common Shares will be quoted on OTCQB starting on March 22, 2024, under the symbol GBNHF. The Company is also announcing that following the suspension of the Common Shares from trading on Nasdaq Capital Market (""Nasdaq"") on February 26, 2024, the Company plans to provide formal notice to Nasdaq of its intention to formally delist the Common Shares from Nasdaq on a voluntary basis, in advance of the anticipated filing by Nasdaq of a Form 25 (Notification of Removal of Listing) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""). As previously disclosed, the Common Shares were suspended pursuant to a final delisting notice sent to the Company by the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq due to the continued failure of the Company to satisfy either the $1.00 minimum bid price listing requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) or the minimum stockholders' equity requirements in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b). The Company currently anticipates that it will file its own Form 25 with the SEC on or about April 1, 2024, which would complete the process for delisting its Common Shares from Nasdaq when the Form 25 becomes effective no earlier than ten days thereafter. The Form 25 will also serve to deregister the Common Shares under Section 12(b) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), effective 90 days thereafter. The Company has determined to file its own Form 25 in advance of the anticipated Nasdaq filing of a Form 25 in order to accelerate the timeline for deregistration under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, which will reduce certain SEC reporting compliance burdens, and therefore lower the Company's administrative expenses and free up management time to operate the business and further develop its strategy. Neither the filing of the Form 25 nor the official delisting of the Common Shares will impact the quotation of the Common Shares on the OTCQB. About Greenbrook TMS Inc.

Negative Decrease in net operating revenues for Q4 and FY 2023 compared to the previous year Net loss recorded for Q4 and FY 2023, with a decrease in net income compared to the previous year Basic net loss per share increased for Q4 and FY 2023 compared to the previous year Financial Analyst The reported financials by Avalon Holdings Corporation indicate a contraction in net operating revenues from $21.6 million in Q4 2022 to $17.6 million in Q4 2023, alongside a year-over-year decrease from $81.2 million to $80.5 million. This decline reflects a possible reduction in demand for their services or increased competition. The net loss of $0.8 million in Q4 2023, albeit improved from the $1.0 million loss in the corresponding period of the previous year, suggests cost management efforts may be underway, yet the company still faces challenges to achieving profitability. From a stock market perspective, investors might react to these figures with caution. The shift from a net income of $0.6 million in 2022 to a net loss of $1.8 million for the full year of 2023 could lead to a negative sentiment, potentially impacting the stock's performance. However, the reduced loss per share in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 might be seen as a positive signal of management's ability to control expenses in a difficult environment. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the sector-specific performance, waste management services, which is a core operation of Avalon Holdings, saw a significant drop in revenues, from nearly $14.7 million in Q4 2022 to about $9.9 million in Q4 2023. This is a substantial decrease and could be indicative of operational challenges or shifts in the industry landscape, such as increased regulatory pressures or shifts in industrial output affecting demand. On the other hand, the golf and related operations have shown an increase, which might suggest a diversification strategy that could stabilize revenue streams. Understanding the market dynamics within the waste management and leisure sectors could provide further insights into the long-term viability of Avalon's business model. This information would be particularly relevant for investors considering the potential for growth in the environmental services industry and the leisure market, especially considering the current economic climate and consumer spending habits. Environmental and Regulatory Affairs Analyst Given Avalon's involvement in waste management and salt water injection well operations, environmental regulations and sustainability trends are likely to have a significant impact on its operations and financial performance. The observed revenue decline in their waste management segment could be partially attributed to stricter environmental regulations or shifts towards more sustainable practices that reduce waste generation. It is essential to monitor regulatory developments, as they can present both risks and opportunities for companies in this sector. The long-term implications for stakeholders include the need to invest in cleaner technologies and practices, which may incur additional costs but could also open up new revenue streams. For instance, increased investment in recycling and waste-to-energy solutions could provide Avalon with a competitive edge. As investors become more environmentally conscious, companies that proactively adapt to regulatory changes and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability may also benefit from enhanced investor confidence and potentially higher valuations. 03/21/2024 - 05:05 PM WARREN, Ohio, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Avalon Holdings Corporation (NYSE Amex:AWX) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.

The company has until September 16, 2024, to meet the requirement, with no immediate impact on trading. Electra also issued shares to satisfy interest on convertible notes. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The extension granted by Nasdaq to Electra Battery Materials Corporation for compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement allows the company additional time to improve its stock performance without the immediate threat of delisting. This is significant for current and potential investors as it provides a window of opportunity for Electra to execute its business strategies and potentially increase shareholder value.From a market perspective, the issuance of additional shares to service debt interest could dilute current shareholders' equity. However, it also indicates the company's proactive approach to managing its debt obligations without resorting to cash payments. The choice of payment in shares at a discounted rate may reflect the company's cash flow management strategy and its efforts to conserve cash for operational needs.Investors might interpret these developments with caution, considering both the risks associated with dilution and the benefits of maintaining liquidity. The company's ability to navigate these challenges and the market's response to these strategies will be key factors in determining the stock's future trajectory. Financial Analyst The issuance of shares at a discount to service debt indicates a strategic financial maneuver by Electra to manage its liabilities. This action suggests that Electra is utilizing its equity as a currency to fulfill its interest obligations, which could be a reflection of its current capital structure and liquidity status.Investors should closely monitor the company's future financial disclosures for insights into its cash flow situation and the impact of this debt management strategy on its balance sheet. The decision to issue shares below market value might be necessary to avoid cash outflows, but it comes at the cost of existing shareholders' value.Long-term, the company's ability to regain compliance with Nasdaq's Minimum Bid Requirement will be critical to its ability to raise capital in the future. Meeting this requirement would be an indicator of financial stability and could help restore investor confidence. 03/21/2024 - 04:40 PM TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Electra Battery Materials Corporation (NASDAQ: ELBM; TSX-V: ELBM) (“Electra” or the “Company”) announced today it has received an additional 180-days notice (the “Extension”) from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement (""Minimum Bid Requirement"") of US$1.00 per share under Nasdaq’s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).

The company must submit a plan to regain compliance within 60 days. Nasdaq may grant an extension of up to 180 days for compliance. SunPower is working to finalize the Form 10-K for filing. Positive None. Negative SunPower (SPWR) received a notice from Nasdaq indicating non-compliance with timely financial report filings, potentially affecting the company's stock performance. Market Analyst SunPower's notification from Nasdaq regarding non-compliance with the Listing Rule due to a delay in filing its Form 10-K is a matter of concern for investors and stakeholders. The ability to meet filing deadlines is often seen as a reflection of a company's internal processes and financial health. This development may lead to increased scrutiny from investors and analysts alike. The market often reacts to such news with caution, as delays in financial reporting can sometimes be indicative of underlying issues, such as potential financial restatements or operational inefficiencies.Moreover, while the notice does not immediately affect the stock's listing or trading, the uncertainty surrounding the company's ability to submit a compliance plan and the potential for an extended deadline to regain compliance could introduce volatility in the stock's performance. Investors typically prefer stability and transparency and any deviation from standard regulatory practices can be perceived negatively. The market's response will likely be tied to the company's forthcoming actions and communications regarding the resolution of this issue. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the delay in filing the Form 10-K could have several implications. The Form 10-K is a comprehensive report of a company's financial performance and is highly anticipated by investors for its detailed insights into the company's operations, including revenue, expenses and profitability. The lack of timely information could impede investors' ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, it may affect analysts' projections and the company's creditworthiness in the eyes of lenders and credit rating agencies.Investors will be closely monitoring the company's next steps, particularly how quickly SunPower can address the filing delay. The company's ability to provide a robust plan to regain compliance and avoid further regulatory sanctions will be critical in maintaining investor confidence. The financial ramifications of this event could be mitigated if the company demonstrates transparency and efficiency in resolving the issue and communicates effectively with its stakeholders. Compliance Expert Compliance with Nasdaq's Listing Rules is essential for maintaining investor trust and access to capital markets. The notice received by SunPower serves as a warning and initiates a process that the company must navigate carefully. The requirement to submit a plan to regain compliance is a standard procedure, but it also serves as a test of the company's governance and responsiveness to regulatory requirements.The company's statement that it is working diligently to finalize the Form 10-K is positive, but stakeholders will expect a clear timeline and explanation for the delay. Should SunPower fail to meet the extended deadline, it risks further regulatory actions, including potential delisting. Such consequences would be detrimental not only to the company's reputation but also to its financial standing and ability to attract investment. The market will be watching for signs of the company's commitment to resolving this issue and adhering to high standards of corporate governance. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM RICHMOND, Calif., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) received on March 20, 2024, a notice (the ""Notice"") from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (""Nasdaq"") indicating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the ""Listing Rule""), which requires timely filing of all required periodic financial reports with the SEC, as a result of not having timely filed the Form 10-K with the SEC, as described more fully in the Company's Notification of Late Filing on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024.

(Pink Sheets: MCRAA and MCRAB) reported consolidated net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 of $25,815,000 as compared to $30,769,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 amounted to $1,636,000, or $.72 per diluted Class A common share as compared to $1,729,000, or $0.76 per diluted Class A common share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Consolidated net revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2024 totaled $58,641,000 as compared to $64,552,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2023. Net earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2024 amounted to $4,858,000, or $2.15 per diluted Class A common share, as compared to net earnings of $4,586,000, or $2.02 per diluted Class A common share, for the first six months of fiscal 2023. SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2023 Consolidated net revenues totaled $25.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $30.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales related to our western/lifestyle boot products for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $18.2 million as compared to $22.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This decrease in net revenues was spread across several western product lines and offset by an increase in our Dingo fashion brand. Revenues from our work boot products decreased from $8.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $7.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This was primarily a result of decreased sales for our Dan Post work boots. Consolidated gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 amounted to approximately $7.0 million as compared to $8.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. However, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was up from 25.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to 27.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This is primarily because of increased margins on military boot sales driven by increased efficiency in our manufacturing facility, as well as newer military boot contracts with updated pricing. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $5.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $6.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from decreased sales commissions. As a result of the above, the consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 amounted to $1.4 million as compared to $1.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. FIRST SIX MONTHS FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS FISCAL 2023 Consolidated net revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2024 totaled $58.6 million as compared to $64.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023. Our western and lifestyle product sales totaled $40.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 as compared to $49.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023. While demand for the Laredo, Dan Post, and Eldorado brands has softened, we also missed some sales during the first six months of our fiscal year due to inventory shortages on select styles. Net revenues from our work boot business increased from $15.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023 to $17.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. This was primarily a result of increased military boot sales. Consolidated gross profit totaled $16.9 million, or 28.8%, for the first six months of fiscal 2024 as compared to $18.3 million, or 28.3%, for the first six months of fiscal 2023. This is primarily due to the improved margins on military boot sales as discussed above. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses totaled approximately $11.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 as compared to $12.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023. This decrease is mainly attributable to lower commissions because of the decrease in sales. As a result of the above, the consolidated operating profit amounted to $5.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024 as compared to $6.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023. On December 23, 2023, the company, through our affiliate American Mortgage and Investment Company and wholly owned subsidiary Hoke Development Company, signed a purchase sale agreement to sell approximately 262 acres in Berkeley Country Club located in Berkeley County, South Carolina to Berkeley Conservation Group LLC. The terms of the agreement provide for a sales price of $2,650,000 and a maximum due diligence period of 180 days prior to closing. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial condition remained strong as cash and cash equivalents remained consistent at $18.3 million for January 27, 2024 and July 29, 2023. Our working capital increased from $75.8 million at July 29, 2023 to $79.0 million at January 27, 2024. We currently have two lines of credit totaling $6.75 million, all of which was fully available at January 27, 2024. One credit line totaling $1.75 million (which is restricted to one hundred percent of the outstanding receivables due from the Government) expires in January 2025. Our $5.0 million line of credit, which also expires in January 2025, is secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of our Dan Post Boot Company subsidiary. For the first six months of fiscal 2024, operating activities provided approximately $8.4 million of cash. Net earnings contributed approximately $4.8 million of cash. Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided in operating activities totaled approximately $3.6 million. These adjustments were driven significantly by decreased inventory and accounts receivable. Net cash used by investing activities totaled approximately $6.5 million, primarily due to the purchase and sale of securities. Net cash used in financing activities totaled $2.0 million, which was used primarily for dividend payments. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit lines will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes certain forward-looking statements.

About IMUNON IMUNON is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on advancing a portfolio of innovative treatments that harness the body’s natural mechanisms to generate safe, effective and durable responses across a broad array of human diseases, constituting a differentiating approach from conventional therapies. IMUNON is developing its non-viral DNA technology across its modalities. The first modality, TheraPlas®, is developed for the coding of proteins and cytokines in the treatment of solid tumors where an immunological approach is deemed promising. The second modality, PlaCCine®, is developed for the coding of viral antigens that can elicit a strong immunological response. This technology may represent a promising platform for the development of vaccines in infectious diseases. The Company’s lead clinical program, IMNN-001, is a DNA-based immunotherapy for the localized treatment of advanced ovarian cancer currently in Phase 2 development. IMNN-001 works by instructing the body to produce safe and durable levels of powerful cancer-fighting molecules, such as interleukin-12 and interferon gamma, at the tumor site. Additionally, the Company is entering a first-in-human study of its COVID-19 booster vaccine (IMNN-101). We will continue to leverage these modalities and to advance the technological frontier of plasmid DNA to better serve patients with difficult-to-treat conditions.

The inclusion of an over-subscription right also allows for potentially greater capital raise but introduces dilution concerns. Investors should monitor the final terms in the prospectus, as the pricing of the new equity shares or ADSs will be critical in determining the attractiveness of the rights offering and its impact on the stock price. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Sify Technologies is positioning itself to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for ICT services in India. The emphasis on expanding network-centric services aligns with the country's digital transformation initiatives and the increasing need for robust data infrastructure. The company's strategic partnerships with global technology majors could provide a competitive edge in the market.However, the success of this rights offering and subsequent business expansion will hinge on the company's ability to effectively deploy the raised capital. Investors should consider the company's track record in managing growth and the potential risks associated with the sectors targeted for expansion. It's also important to note that the rights offering is subject to regulatory approval, which adds a layer of uncertainty to the timeline and outcome of these plans. Legal Expert The registration statement on Form F-1 signifies a compliance with U.S. securities law, which is a necessary step for Sify Technologies as it seeks to offer securities to the public. The legal process involves scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to ensure adequate disclosure of the company's operations, financials and risks involved for the investors. The effectiveness of the Registration Statement will be a key milestone, as no securities can be sold until it is declared effective.Prospective and current investors should be aware of the legal framework governing the rights offering, including the implications of the over-subscription right and the regulatory conditions that must be met. It is also important for investors to understand that this announcement is not an offer to sell securities and that the rights offering will only proceed once all legal and regulatory requirements have been satisfied. 03/21/2024 - 06:35 PM CHENNAI, India, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Sify Technologies Ltd.

TIDAL-01's unique approach to isolating and expanding tumor-reactive TILs could potentially offer a new treatment paradigm for solid tumors, which historically have been challenging to treat with first-generation TILs. The focus on a broader range of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, indicates an attempt to address areas of high unmet medical need. The preclinical data presented at SITC 2023 adds credibility to the therapeutic potential of TIDAL-01, suggesting a possible positive impact on Turnstone's valuation if the clinical data expected in mid-2024 is favorable.From an R&D perspective, the reported decrease in expenses is noteworthy. This decrease is attributed to the termination of a collaboration with Takeda Oncology, which seems to have allowed for a reallocation of resources towards the TIDAL-01 program. The financial runway extending into the second quarter of 2025 provides a reasonable buffer for Turnstone to reach key milestones without immediate dilutive financing concerns. Financial Analyst Turnstone Biologics' financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 reflect a strategic shift in the company's operations. The reduction in R&D expenses year-over-year, despite the ramp-up of TIDAL-01 activities, could be seen as a positive indicator of management's ability to control costs effectively. However, investors should consider the increase in net loss for the full year when evaluating the company's performance. This increase in net loss may raise questions about the scalability of Turnstone's business model and the potential need for additional funding, especially as the company approaches the critical data release in mid-2024.It is also important to monitor the company's cash burn rate in relation to the anticipated clinical trial milestones. While the current cash position is expected to last into Q2 2025, the outcome of the TIDAL-01 trials will likely influence future financing needs and partnership opportunities. Any delays or negative results could have a substantial impact on the company's financial health and stock price. Market Research Analyst The landscape of cancer immunotherapy is highly competitive, with many companies vying for a share of a growing market. Turnstone's decision to diversify its trial indications to include additional solid tumor types suggests an attempt to capture a larger market segment. The company's strategic positioning, with a focus on solid tumors that have not responded well to first-generation TILs, could differentiate it from competitors if successful. This differentiation is critical as it may lead to partnerships, licensing deals, or even acquisition interest from larger pharmaceutical companies looking to expand their oncology portfolios.Turnstone's engagement and expansion of its Scientific Advisory Board with experts like Dr. Jeffrey S. Weber can also be seen as a move to bolster the company's scientific credibility and networking within the oncology community. This could potentially facilitate future collaborations and enhance the company's reputation in the eyes of investors and industry peers. 03/21/2024 - 05:06 PM Lead program, TIDAL-01, advancing in Phase 1 trials with initial clinical data expected in mid-2024 Promising preclinical data highlighting Turnstone’s novel Selected TIL programs for solid tumors presented at SITC 2023 Further strengthened Scientific Advisory Board with appointment of internationally recognized cancer immunotherapy expert, Dr. Jeffrey S. Weber SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Turnstone Biologics Corp. (“Turnstone” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: TSBX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a differentiated approach to treat and cure patients with solid tumors by pioneering selected tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (Selected TIL) therapy, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided recent business highlights. “2023 marked a transformative year for Turnstone Biologics in which we transitioned into a publicly traded company and continued to advance our pipeline through clinical development. We are encouraged by the increasing momentum in the TIL landscape that paves the way for next-generation approaches like our Selected TIL therapy, which is designed to create a TIL product with a significantly greater population of potent tumor-reactive T cells, which we believe is the key to extending their therapeutic potential to high unmet medical needs in solid tumors beyond melanoma,” said Sammy Farah, M.B.A., Ph.D., Turnstone’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “In 2024, we look forward to generating clinical data that potentially highlights the differentiation of our platform and supports further development of our lead asset, TIDAL-01, which is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies in patients with colorectal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer, uveal melanoma, and cutaneous melanoma. We remain on-track to share initial clinical data for TIDAL-01 in mid-2024 and we believe we are well-positioned for another year of meaningful progress for our organization.” Fourth Quarter and Recent Business Highlights Advancing TIDAL-01 in Multiple Phase 1 Clinical Trials and Expanding of Targeted Solid Tumor Indications. TIDAL-01 employs an unbiased identification and functional screening process to isolate and selectively expand the greatest breadth of tumor-reactive TILs from the patient’s tumor. Turnstone believes TIDAL-01 can expand the utility of TIL therapy to solid tumor types where first-generation TILs have not to date shown objective responses in clinical trials and is pursuing several indications with critical unmet need, potentially enabling meaningful therapeutic differentiation. Recently, Turnstone expanded their trials to evaluate additional solid tumor types in addition to the existing indications of breast cancer and uveal melanoma. The multi-site STARLING trial protocol has been amended to cover head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute sponsored trial has been expanded to include colorectal cancer (CRC) and HNSCC. Turnstone expects to provide an initial clinical update across these trials in mid-2024. Preclinical Data Presentations at the 2023 Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) Annual Meeting Support Ongoing Clinical and Preclinical Efforts. In November 2023, Turnstone presented preclinical data on its Selected TIL therapies, including the demonstration of the feasibility of selecting and expanding tumor-reactive TIL as further evidence for the potential of TIDAL-01 as a treatment option for patients with colorectal and gastric cancers. Turnstone also presented on its next Selected TIL program from its development pipeline, TIDAL-02, which seeks to utilize a novel direct selection method, genetically engineered to rapidly select for the greatest breadth of tumor-reactive T cells. Strengthened Company’s Scientific Advisory Board. In October 2023, Turnstone appointed Jeffrey S. Weber, M.D., Ph.D., to its Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Weber, a world-renowned thought leader with extensive experience in innovative immunotherapies for solid tumors, currently serves as Deputy Director of the Perlmutter Cancer Center and Co-Director of the Melanoma Research Program at the New York University-Langone Cancer Center. Fourth Quarter 2023 Financial Results Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments: As of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $94.8 million. The Company expects that the combined cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second quarter of 2025. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $13.6 million, compared to $20.2 million for the same period in 2022. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in pre-clinical and regulatory costs, personnel-related costs, and manufacturing expenses due to the termination of the discovery, collaboration and license agreement entered into on November 7, 2019, with Takeda Oncology for certain viral immunotherapy candidates offset by an increase due to ramp up of TIDAL-01 activities. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023, were $4.4 million, compared to $4.4 million for the same period in 2022. Net Loss: Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was $16.5 million, compared to net loss of $13.7 million for the same period in 2022. Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments: For the full year ended December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $94.8 million. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023, were $60.5 million, compared to $86.7 million for the prior year period. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in pre-clinical and regulatory and manufacturing expenses due to the termination of the discovery, collaboration and license agreement entered into on November 7, 2019, with Takeda Oncology for certain viral immunotherapy candidates offset by an increase in personnel-related costs and costs due to ramp up of TIDAL-01 activities. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023, were $17.8 million, compared to $18.2 million for the prior year period. We anticipate that G&A expenses will remain stable as we support public company operations. Net Loss: Net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2023, was $55.2 million, compared to net loss of $30.8 million for the prior year period.

The silver proceeds complement the Department of Defense funding for permitting and construction readiness activities. Silver represents less than 0.3% of projected revenue, enhancing liquidity and reducing equity dilution for Perpetua. Positive Perpetua received an $8.5 million upfront cash payment from Franco-Nevada for a silver royalty on future production from the Stibnite Gold Project. The silver royalty proceeds complement the funding received from the Department of Defense for permitting and construction readiness activities. Silver represents less than 0.3% of projected revenue in the 2020 Feasibility Study, reducing equity dilution and enhancing liquidity for Perpetua. The transaction with Franco-Nevada provides over $80 million in non-dilutive capital when combined with the Department of Defense funding. Perpetua aims to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and to advance the construction readiness of the Stibnite Gold Project. The Stibnite Gold Project is designed to re-establish a U.S. source of the critical mineral antimony, supporting national and economic security. Negative None. Financial Analyst The agreement between Perpetua Resources and Franco-Nevada represents a strategic financial maneuver to bolster Perpetua's liquidity without resorting to equity financing, which could dilute existing shareholders' value. The $8.5 million upfront cash payment is a significant infusion of capital, particularly when considering that the silver by-product constitutes a mere fraction of the project's total projected revenue. This move is indicative of Perpetua's broader strategy to secure non-dilutive funding, a positive signal to investors who may be concerned about the preservation of shareholder equity.Furthermore, the involvement of the Department of Defense in funding indicates governmental support for the project, which could be seen as an endorsement of its strategic importance. This factor, combined with the royalty agreement, suggests a strong confidence in the project's viability and potential profitability. Investors should note, however, that the success of such projects is not guaranteed and is subject to various risks, including environmental, regulatory and market-related uncertainties. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, the transaction underscores the increasing importance of critical minerals like antimony in the context of national security and economic stability. The Stibnite Gold Project's ability to provide a domestic source for antimony may position Perpetua Resources favorably within the market, especially as geopolitical tensions heighten the need for secure supply chains. The long-term implications for Perpetua could include strengthened partnerships and potential for increased market share within the critical minerals sector.It is also worth noting that the royalty sale to Franco-Nevada, a company with a robust portfolio of mining assets, reflects a vote of confidence in the Stibnite Gold Project's prospects. This could potentially attract additional investment and partnerships in the future, as the project progresses through the NEPA review process and closer to construction commencement. Mining Industry Analyst The decision to sell a royalty on a non-core asset, such as the silver by-product, is a common practice in the mining industry, allowing companies to unlock immediate value from assets that may otherwise contribute minimally to the overall project economics. In the case of Perpetua Resources, the revenue from silver was projected to be less than 0.3% of the life-of-mine revenue, which suggests that the impact on the company's revenue stream from this transaction will be negligible in comparison to the potential upside from the gold and antimony production.Investors should be aware that the success of the Stibnite Gold Project hinges on the successful navigation through environmental permitting processes, which can be lengthy and unpredictable. The NEPA review process, in particular, is a critical step that will likely influence the project's timeline and, consequently, the timeline for realizing returns on investment. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM Silver royalty proceeds complement the funding Perpetua has received through the Department of Defense to continue advancing permitting and construction readiness activities.

(“we,” “UpHealth,” or the “Company”) (OTC: UPHL) today provided a corporate update and announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023. “In short, 2023 was a challenging, yet transformative, year for UpHealth, as we continued to take steps to stabilize the business,” said Martin Beck, Chief Executive Officer. “We have recently closed the sale of our Cloudbreak Health, LLC (“Cloudbreak”) business and will use the proceeds to significantly de-lever our balance sheet, giving us the financial flexibility to pursue a more simplified, profitable strategy that focuses on our growing, cash flow positive, behavioral health business, TTC Healthcare, Inc. (“TTC Healthcare”). Mr. Beck continued, “I once again want to thank our stakeholders, employees and constituents of UpHealth who continue on this path with us. I can assure you that the UpHealth leadership team is more dedicated and focused than ever on its newly defined and simplified strategy to profitably scale TTC Healthcare.” Glocal Ruling from Arbitral Tribunal Regarding Glocal Yesterday, the Company provided an update on the arbitration brought by UpHealth Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of UpHealth, against Glocal Healthcare Systems (“Glocal”) and several of Glocal’s officers and shareholders (together with Glocal, the “Respondents”). On March 18, 2024, the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICA”) transmitted the Final Award to the parties. In the Final Award, the arbitral tribunal (“Tribunal”) found the Respondents liable for breach of contract and directed them to pay Holdings up to $110.2 million in damages, as well as most of the legal costs and other expenses that Holdings incurred in the arbitration. The $110.2 million damages are apportioned based on the shareholders percentage of each of the Indian directors and shareholders of Glocal: 34.38% to be paid by Dr. Syed Sabahat Azim, 34.38% by Richa Sana Azim, 4.69% by Mr. Gautam Chowdhury, 22.54% by Mr. Meleveetil Damodaran, and 4.02% by Kimberlite Social India Private Limited. The dispute arose out of Holdings’ acquisition of Glocal pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated October 30, 2020, and the subsequent breach by Respondents of their contractual obligations to relinquish control of Glocal to Holdings. In particular, the Tribunal found that the Respondents “failed to give [Holdings] control of [Glocal]” after the closing of the acquisition, despite the payment in full of the acquisition consideration. The Respondents were held personally liable. The Company remains steadfast in its determination to hold fully accountable the Respondents in the ICA proceeding, who sold us Glocal and then refused to relinquish control of it, using misleading and baseless claims, for their indefensible conduct and the resulting harm caused to UpHealth and its stockholders. We appreciate the unanimous decision from the arbitrators and we thank them for a thorough and impartial elaboration and ruling. Cloudbreak Sale Transaction On March 15, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary Cloudbreak and its MarttiTM translation offering to a newly formed entity controlled by GTCR LLC for $180 million in gross cash proceeds. The proceeds of the Cloudbreak sale, after transaction-related fees and expenses, have been deposited into three escrow accounts: a Notes escrow ($139 million), a Tax escrow ($27 million), and a Working Capital escrow ($3 million). Funds in the Notes escrow will be released on June 3, 2024, but no later than June 15, 2024, and will be used to satisfy in full, plus accrued interest, the Company’s 2026 notes and to repurchase approximately $20 million of the Company’s 2025 Notes, plus accrued interest, leaving approximately $37 million of 2025 Notes outstanding, which will constitute the Company’s entire long term debt. Funds in the Tax escrow will be used to satisfy the Company’s 2024 tax liability and any funds not required for this purpose will be used to repurchase additional 2025 Notes. Funds in the Working Capital escrow will be used to satisfy any obligations of the Company resulting from a difference between Cloudbreak’s targeted and actual working capital as of the closing of the transaction, and any funds not used for this purpose will be used to repurchase additional 2025 Notes. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights As previously reported, Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection on September 19, 2023, and its Thrasys, Inc. (“Thrasys”) and Behavioral Health Services (“BHS”) subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection on October 20, 2023, in response to an unexpected judgment in favor of a contract counterparty. These bankruptcy cases continue and the operations of Thrasys and BHS have largely ceased. It is expected that Holdings could emerge from bankruptcy protection in the second half of 2024. It is important to note that the Company and TTC Healthcare are not part of the bankruptcy proceedings. As a result of the Company’s previously announced deconsolidation of Holdings and its subsidiaries, Thrasys, BHS, and TTC Healthcare, the Company’s GAAP revenues and earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2023 only include results from UpHealth, Inc. and Cloudbreak and its subsidiaries. Revenues totaled $17.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $130.0 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $40.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $158.8 million for the full year of 2022;Gross margin was 54% for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2023: compared to 45% for the fourth quarter of 2022 and 44% for the full year of 2022;Net loss attributable to UpHealth was $10.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $57.8 million for the full year of 2023, compared to a net loss attributable to UpHealth of $27.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $223.0 million for the full year of 2022;Net loss per share attributable to UpHealth was $(0.54) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $(3.26) for the full year of 2023, compared to a net loss per share attributable to UpHealth of $(1.82) for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $(15.17) for the full year of 2022;Adjusted EBITDA, which includes the performance of Cloudbreak, was $2.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $19.6 million for the full year of 2023, compared to $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2022 and $3.2 million for the full year of 2022. Proforma results, which include the results of all business units, including Holdings and its subsidiaries, for the full year of 2023, and Innovations Group, Inc. (“IGI”) through the date of its sale on May 11, 2023, are as follows: Proforma fourth quarter 2023 revenues were $38.6 million, compared to $40.5 million in revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022. Growth in proforma revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by top line growth at TTC Healthcare and Cloudbreak and by certain non-recurring revenues associated with the cessation of operations at Thrasys;Proforma fourth quarter 2023 gross margins were 62%, compared to 45% for the fourth quarter of 2022. Proforma margin improvement in the fourth quarter was largely driven by an improved payor mix at TTC Healthcare;Proforma fourth quarter 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was $11.1 million, compared with $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Proforma Adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by strong revenue growth and margin expansion coupled with reduced corporate expenses;Proforma full-year 2023 revenues were $151.2 million, compared to $158.8 million for the full year of 2022;Proforma full-year 2023 gross margins were 56%, compared to 44% for the full year of 2022; andProforma full-year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA was $28.3 million, compared to $3.2 million for the full year of 2022. UpHealth Will Focus on Expanding Our Profitable TTC Healthcare Business TTC Healthcare currently offers its patients a full continuum of evidence-based mental health and substance use disorder services in four facilities in Florida and continues to show strong census growth, with an attractive payor mix, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. TTC Healthcare’s financial results were previously reported as part of UpHealth’s Services segment. TTC Healthcare’s revenues were $12.1 million, gross margins were 60%, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 million, before the allocation of corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $7.9 million in revenues, gross margins of 43%, and $1.3 million in adjusted EBITDA, before the allocation of corporate expenses for the fourth quarter of 2022.TTC Healthcare’s revenues were $44.1 million, gross margins were 57%, and adjusted EBITDA was $15.9 million, before the allocation of corporate expenses for the full year of 2023, compared to $31.0 million in revenues, gross margins of 45%, and $4.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, before the allocation of corporate expenses for the full year of 2022.TTC Healthcare’s performance in 2023, and in particular the fourth quarter 2023, was driven by strong volumes and a significantly improved payor mix. We expect future volumes to remain robust and for gross margins to revert over the course of 2024 to historical norms in the range of 50%. TTC Healthcare serves the large and growing market in the United States for mental health and substance use disorder services. The business is an excellent platform from which to drive future growth. TTC Healthcare’s core strengths of high-quality care, strict regulatory compliance and efficient back-office operations can be leveraged across a larger asset base and UpHealth will aggressively pursue geographic and service line expansion of TTC Healthcare via partnerships, joint ventures, acquisitions, and de novo projects. TTC Healthcare has a demonstrated track record of denovo growth, having opened a residential treatment facility near Ocala, Florida in January 2021, which enabled the business to increase its offering of mental health services, and a new facility in Delray Beach, Florida in July 2021, which enabled the business to increase its volumes under in-network contracts. The UpHealth team is excited to focus its energies on growing TTC Healthcare and looks forward to reporting its progress in the coming quarters. About UpHealth, Inc.

Moreover, the threat of infringement litigation against parties using other platforms for Tau measurement could act as a deterrent, pushing more laboratories towards Quanterix's licensed technology. Healthcare Market Analyst The healthcare industry is closely watching the development of diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease, especially with the FDA's approval of new AD therapies. Quanterix's emphasis on building global infrastructure for AD testing speaks to the market demand for accessible and reliable blood biomarker assays. The company's established collaborations with health system entities suggest a focused strategy to integrate their products into clinical practice.Investors should note the potential for growth in this sector, as early and accurate diagnosis of AD can lead to better disease management and improved patient outcomes. Quanterix's position in this market, backed by a strong patent portfolio, presents an opportunity for the company to capitalize on the expanding need for diagnostic services in neurology. Legal Expert in Intellectual Property Intellectual property protection is a cornerstone for innovation in the biotech industry. Quanterix's portfolio of patents, particularly U.S. Patent No. 11,275,092, provides them with a legal framework to control the use of their novel Tau protein measurement technique. This control is important for maintaining a competitive edge and justifies their significant investment in research and development over the past decade.The announcement of potential partnership opportunities and the warning against infringement highlight Quanterix's proactive approach to intellectual property management. By offering licensing options, Quanterix not only safeguards their technology but also encourages its adoption, balancing exclusivity with market penetration. The implications for stakeholders include a clear legal pathway for utilizing Quanterix's technology and the assurance of support from a company with a robust legal standing. 03/21/2024 - 05:30 PM BILLERICA, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quanterix Corporation (NASDAQ: QTRX), a leading provider of ultra-sensitive research products and high-definition diagnostics, today announced a specific partnership path for laboratories interested in offering Tau based research and diagnostic testing services.

The Company's expansion in operations and go-to-market strategy are driving this growth, focusing on AI education courses and acceleration offerings. Positive Genius Group's 2024 revenue guidance is now $105 million - $110 million, an 83% increase from the previous guidance. Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 is projected to be $6.0 million - $7.0 million, a 133% increase from earlier estimates. The number of students and users is expected to reach 11.5 million to 12 million. CEO Roger Hamilton highlights the strong demand for AI-powered education and the Company's focus on preparing students for the future workforce and entrepreneurship in the Age of AI. Negative None. Financial Analyst The substantial upward revision in financial guidance by Genius Group Limited is a notable development that merits a closer examination of the underlying factors contributing to this optimistic outlook. A projected annual revenue increase of 83% and an Adjusted EBITDA increase of 133% suggest that the company's recent transactions and expansion strategy are yielding significant results. The Genius City Model, which focuses on scaling AI education offerings to various stakeholders, appears to be a key driver in this growth trajectory.From a financial perspective, the surge in guidance figures may lead to a positive reevaluation of the company's stock by the market. Investors typically respond favorably to upward revisions in guidance, which can serve as a catalyst for stock price appreciation. However, it is essential to scrutinize the sustainability of this growth, particularly in the context of the education sector's competitive landscape and potential market saturation. Additionally, the actual conversion of increased guidance into realized revenue and EBITDA will be critical to watch in the upcoming fiscal reports. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on AI-powered education and the Genius City Model underscores a strategic pivot towards personalized and scalable learning solutions. The reported increase in student and user numbers to between 11.5 and 12 million is indicative of a strong market demand for such educational technology services. It is essential to analyze the broader market trends driving this demand, including the growing necessity for AI literacy and the integration of technology in educational curricula.When assessing the potential long-term viability of Genius Group's strategy, one must consider the evolving nature of the global education market. Factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes and competitive dynamics play a important role in shaping the industry. The company's focus on not just students but also entrepreneurs, enterprises and government indicates a diversified approach that could mitigate risks associated with reliance on a single customer segment. Economist The AI education sector's growth is closely tied to broader economic trends, particularly those related to the workforce's future needs. The CEO's statement about preparing for the 'economy of tomorrow' highlights the importance of aligning educational services with anticipated shifts in labor market demands. The Genius Group's strategy to expand city-by-city aligns with economic principles of market penetration and localized growth, which can be more sustainable than broad, unfocused expansion.Furthermore, the company's performance and its projections should be contextualized within the macroeconomic environment. Factors such as economic cycles, employment rates and public and private investment in education technology will all influence the company's ability to meet its ambitious targets. While the guidance suggests confidence, it is also necessary for investors to consider external economic risks that could affect the company's growth, such as economic downturns or shifts in educational funding. 03/21/2024 - 05:00 PM SINGAPORE, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genius Group Limited (NYSE American: GNS) (“Genius Group” or the “Company”), a leading AI-powered education group, announces updated financial guidance for the financial year ending December 31, 2024.

Energy Sector Analyst The announcement of Ameren Missouri's approval to build or acquire 400 megawatts of solar energy represents a significant step in the company's energy portfolio diversification. The shift towards renewable energy not only aligns with global sustainability trends but also offers the potential to tap into federal tax credits, which can provide a financial buffer and contribute to keeping customer rates affordable. This strategy may enhance Ameren's competitive position in the energy market, as consumers and businesses increasingly prioritize green energy solutions.From an investor's perspective, the investment in solar projects could signal long-term cost savings and a stable revenue stream, given the subscription-based nature of the Renewable Solutions Program. However, the confidential terms of the agreements indicate a lack of transparency that could be a point of concern for stakeholders seeking detailed financial implications of these projects. Environmental Policy Expert Ameren Missouri's commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 is an ambitious target that reflects a growing industry norm among energy companies. The adherence to the Paris Agreement and the setting of interim targets are positive indicators of the company's dedication to environmental responsibility. However, the success of these goals is contingent upon advancements in clean energy technology and supportive energy policies. Stakeholders should monitor the regulatory landscape and technological developments, as these factors will be critical in determining the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of Ameren's environmental strategy. Renewable Energy Market Analyst The introduction of Ameren Missouri's Renewable Solutions Program could be a game-changer for businesses looking to achieve sustainability goals. By providing a subscription-based model for renewable energy, Ameren is tapping into a niche market of corporate clients seeking to mitigate market risks associated with energy prices. The program's ability to offer price certainty and meet 100% of a company's energy needs with renewables could be a strong selling point. The market response to this program and its scalability will be key factors in evaluating its impact on Ameren's business model and revenue growth. 03/21/2024 - 04:40 PM Today's approval includes projects capable of powering approximately 73,000 homes and an additional opportunity to deliver more renewable energy to businesses ST.

Lifezone Metals Signs Binding Subscription Agreement for US$50 Million of Unsecured Convertible Debentures with Consortium of Marquee Mining Investors,2024-03-21T20:30:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,Lifezone Metals  (NYSE: LZM) secures US$50 million through convertible debentures for Kabanga Nickel Project in Tanzania. The funds will support ongoing activities and feasibility study completion by Q3 2024.,"Lifezone Metals Signs Binding Subscription Agreement for US$50 Million of Unsecured Convertible Debentures with Consortium of Marquee Mining Investors Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Lifezone Metals (NYSE: LZM) secures US$50 million through convertible debentures for Kabanga Nickel Project in Tanzania. The funds will support ongoing activities and feasibility study completion by Q3 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The issuance of US$50 million in convertible debentures by Lifezone Metals Limited represents a strategic financial maneuver to support its flagship Kabanga Nickel Project. The involvement of notable mining investors like Harry Lundin and Rick Rule signals a strong vote of confidence in the project's potential. The terms of the debenture, particularly the interest rate pegged to SOFR plus 4%, with a SOFR floor of 3%, show a competitive but cautious approach, balancing investor returns with corporate debt management. The optionality for early redemption at 105% plus interest and the conversion terms into common shares, provide flexibility for both the company and investors, aligning interests towards the company's stock performance. Investors should note that the mandatory conversion clause could potentially lead to dilution of shares, but also reflects a scenario where the share price is performing well. The allocation of funds towards the further development of the nickel project, which is poised to be a significant player in the nickel sulfide market, indicates a clear use of proceeds. This move could potentially enhance the company's market position and investor appeal, considering the growing demand for nickel in various industries, including electric vehicle batteries. Market Research Analyst Nickel sulfide deposits, such as Lifezone's Kabanga project, are of particular interest due to their high-grade quality and the increasing demand for nickel in battery production. The market for electric vehicles, which rely heavily on nickel for their batteries, is expanding rapidly. This growth trajectory suggests a positive long-term outlook for nickel producers. The feasibility study set for completion in Q3 2024 will be a critical milestone for the company, providing investors with concrete data on the project's viability and potential return on investment. Given the project's status as one of the largest undeveloped nickel sulfide deposits, the study's results could significantly impact the company's valuation and future financing options. Legal Expert It is important to note the regulatory aspect of the convertible debentures, which have not been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933. This limits their sale and offer to the United States, barring an exemption from registration requirements. This legal nuance could affect the liquidity and marketability of these financial instruments, potentially influencing investor decisions. Additionally, the closing conditions and customary adjustments mentioned suggest that there are still procedural steps to be taken, which could introduce delays or changes to the terms based on regulatory compliance and market conditions at the time of closing. 03/21/2024 - 04:30 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lifezone Metals Limited’s (NYSE: LZM) Chief Executive Officer, Chris Showalter, is pleased to announce the signing of a binding subscription agreement for the issuance of US$50 million of convertible debentures with a consortium of marquee mining investors, led by Harry Lundin (Bromma Asset Management Inc.) and Rick Rule. Proceeds will be used to continue activities at Lifezone’s flagship Kabanga Nickel Project, located in north-west Tanzania. Kabanga is believed to be one of the world’s largest and highest-grade undeveloped nickel sulfide deposits. The Kabanga Definitive Feasibility Study is on-track for completion in Q3 2024. Key Terms: US$50 million of unsecured convertible debentures. The debentures bear interest at a rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus 4.0% per annum, subject to a SOFR floor of 3.0%. Current SOFR is approximately 5.3%. During the 48-month term, the debentures can be redeemed early by Lifezone, subject to the achievement of certain conditions, at a price of 105% plus interest otherwise payable to the maturity date. Interest is payable quarterly via a mix of cash and shares during the first two years and all in cash during the last two years. The debentures are convertible into common shares of Lifezone at the option of the holder. The conversion price will be determined on the closing date based on the lesser of a 30% premium to a trailing period VWAP and US$8.00 per share, and is subject to customary adjustments. Mandatory conversion can occur if Lifezone’s share price is greater than 50% above the conversion price for any 15 trading days within a 30 consecutive trading days period. Proceeds will be used to advance the Kabanga Nickel Project and for general corporate and administrative purposes. Closing and issuance of the convertible debentures is subject to customary closing conditions. Mr. Showalter stated: “The proceeds from the issuance of these convertible debentures enables us to maintain the momentum of ongoing work streams at our Kabanga Nickel Project and provides us with optionality to accelerate other opportunities.” The convertible debentures referred to in this notice have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933 or with any securities regulatory authority of any state of the United States and may not be offered or sold within the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

Despite a GAAP net loss in Q4 due to non-cash expenses, the company remains optimistic about sustained growth and value creation for stockholders. Positive Total revenue for Q4 2023 grew 25% year-over-year to $23.6 million. Originations capital deployment increased by 92% year-over-year to $68.3 million in Q4 2023. Full year 2023 total revenues were $79.6 million, a 14% increase from the prior year. GAAP net loss in Q4 was $6.2 million, primarily due to non-cash expenses. Adjusted net income for full year 2023 was $29.4 million. Abacus authorized a $15 million stock repurchase program and completed a public bond offering to reduce debt and lower interest rates. The company launched ABL Tech and raised an additional $25 million via 9.875% Notes in 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $25.6 million. Negative GAAP net loss in Q4 2023 was $6.2 million. Operating expenses for Q4 2023 were significantly higher compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 46.7% in Q4 2023 from 52.4% in the prior-year period. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total revenue and originations capital deployment by Abacus Life indicates a significant expansion in their core business activities. The growth in revenue, particularly from active management and direct policy sales to third parties, suggests a robust demand for their specialty insurance products. However, the observed decrease in net income from the previous year raises questions about the sustainability of profit margins and the efficiency of the company's cost management strategies. The authorization of a $15 million stock repurchase program reflects confidence in the company's valuation, signaling to the market a potential undervaluation of the stock, while the successful public bond offering and reduction in interest payments by 275 basis points demonstrate a proactive approach to capital structure optimization.From an investor's perspective, the adjusted EBITDA margin contraction from 50.0% to 49.4% year-over-year could be a point of concern, indicating potential pressure on operational efficiency. Nonetheless, the strong ROIC and ROE figures suggest that the company is still generating value from its investments and equity, which is a positive sign for long-term growth. The increase in operating expenses, primarily due to non-cash employee stock compensation, indicates an investment in human capital, which could yield future productivity gains but may also dilute shareholder value in the short term. Market Research Analyst Abacus Life's strategic move to launch ABL Tech, a technology subdivision, aligns with the broader industry trend of leveraging innovative technology to create efficiencies and new revenue streams. The additional capital raised through 9.875% Notes provides the company with more liquidity to pursue its strategic initiatives. The growth in policy originations by 30% and the 46% increase in originations capital deployment year-over-year reflect an aggressive growth strategy that is resonating with the market.Investors should note the company's agility in adapting to market conditions and expanding its service offerings. However, the significant increase in operating expenses and the GAAP net loss reported for the fourth quarter may raise concerns about the company's ability to manage costs in line with revenue growth. The stock repurchase program and its impact on the share price should be monitored closely, as it could indicate management's confidence in the company's future prospects and potentially lead to increased investor confidence. Insurance Industry Analyst Abacus Life's performance in the life insurance policy buying market is indicative of the growing interest in life settlements as an alternative asset class. The increase in originations capital deployment suggests that Abacus is actively purchasing more policies, which could be a response to a higher volume of life insurance policyholders seeking to liquidate their policies in the current economic climate. The decrease in total revenue from the portfolio servicing segment could be attributed to a strategic shift towards more lucrative segments or a reflection of market dynamics within the life settlement industry.It is important to examine the long-term debt levels in relation to the company's ability to generate cash flow to service this debt, especially in light of the new public bond offering. The reduction in interest rate payments indicates a strong financial management strategy. However, stakeholders should assess the impact of the non-cash expenses and one-time charges on the company's reported GAAP net loss to understand the underlying operational performance. 03/21/2024 - 04:15 PM - Fourth Quarter 2023 Total Revenue Grew 25% Year-over-Year to $23.6 Million - - Increased Originations Capital Deployment by 92% Year-over-Year to $68.3 Million - - Increased Originations Capital Deployment for Full Year 2023 by 46% to $218.9 Million - ORLANDO, Fla., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abacus Life, Inc.

Non-GAAP Financial Information Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Abacus adjusted for non-controlling interest income, amortization, change in fair value of warrants and non-cash stock-based compensation and the related tax effect of those adjustments. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to business performance. A reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income to Net income attributable to Abacus, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, appears below. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to Abacus adjusted for depreciation expense, amortization, interest expense, income tax and other non-cash and certain non-recurring items that in our judgement significantly impact the period-over-period assessment of performance and operating results that do not directly relate to business performance within Abacus’ control. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to Abacus Life, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, appears below. Adjusted EBITDA margin, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Total revenues. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA margin to Net income margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, appears below. Annualized return on invested capital (ROIC), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Adjusted net income for the quarter divided by the result of Total Assets less Intangible assets, net, Goodwill and Current Liabilities multiplied by four. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We believe ROIC should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement line items reported in accordance with GAAP. Annualized return on equity (ROE), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as [Adjusted net income divided by total shareholder equity multiplied by four.

We believe ROE should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement line items reported in accordance with GAAP. The below table presents our calculation of ROE.

The documents are available on SEDAR, EDGAR, and the company's website. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Upon review of New Found Gold Corp's announcement on the filing of their annual financial statements, several key considerations emerge from a financial analysis perspective. Firstly, the timely disclosure of financial results is a positive signal to investors, indicating transparency and adherence to regulatory requirements. It's essential to scrutinize the performance indicators such as revenue, profit margins and cash flow positions to understand the company's financial health.Moreover, the mining sector is capital-intensive with significant investment in exploration and development. Therefore, the capital expenditure figures and funding sources detailed in the annual documents will be of interest. These factors can influence the company's ability to sustain operations and expand. Additionally, the cost of production and commodity prices play a pivotal role in the profitability of mining companies. A comparison of these figures against industry benchmarks can provide insights into the company's competitive positioning.Lastly, it is worth noting the potential impact of macroeconomic factors such as inflation, currency exchange rates and regulatory changes on the company's financials. These elements can affect operational costs and net earnings, thus influencing investor sentiment and the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst From a market research standpoint, the release of New Found Gold Corp's annual financial statements offers a fresh dataset for evaluating the company's market performance. The mining industry is subject to volatility due to fluctuating commodity prices and investors will be keen to understand how New Found has navigated this environment over the past year.Investor relations are also a subtle yet integral aspect of a company's market image. By offering hard copies of financial documents upon request, New Found is demonstrating a commitment to accessibility and shareholder engagement, which can positively influence investor perception and, potentially, the stock's desirability.Furthermore, the geographic location of mining operations can present unique opportunities and risks. Analysis of the company's operations in relation to geopolitical stability, local taxation and environmental regulations can provide a comprehensive view of potential market risks and opportunities that may not be immediately apparent from the financial statements alone. 03/21/2024 - 04:15 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- New Found Gold Corp.

Announces 2023 PFIC Annual Information Statement Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary FTAI Aviation (NASDAQ: FTAI) is classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) for the taxable year 2023, requiring U.S. Holders to file Form 8621. Investors are advised to consider a Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) election and review the 'PFIC Annual Information Statement' on FTAI's website for tax implications. Positive None. Negative None. Tax Advisor The designation of FTAI Aviation Ltd. as a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) is significant for U.S. investors due to the complex tax regulations that govern PFICs. A PFIC is a foreign corporation with a high level of passive income or passive assets and the U.S. tax implications for shareholders can be onerous without proper elections. The necessity for U.S. Holders to file a Form 8621 is an administrative burden that requires careful consideration of the tax consequences associated with PFIC investments.One potential strategy to mitigate the adverse tax implications is making a Qualified Electing Fund (QEF) election. This allows U.S. investors to include their pro-rata share of the company's income in their gross income annually, thus converting potential future tax liabilities into a more favorable tax treatment. However, the decision to make a QEF election is not one-size-fits-all and depends on individual circumstances, including the investor's tax bracket, the expected return on the investment and the potential growth of FTAI.FTAI's decision to post the PFIC Annual Information Statement online simplifies the process for U.S. Holders who wish to make a QEF election, providing them with the necessary information to comply with the IRS requirements. Nonetheless, the need for investors to consult their tax advisors underscores the complexity of PFIC rules and the importance of understanding the tax implications before making investment decisions. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the PFIC status can influence investor behavior and, consequently, the stock's liquidity and price. Investors may perceive PFICs as less attractive due to the additional tax burden and reporting requirements, potentially leading to a decrease in demand for FTAI's shares. This could impact the company's cost of capital and its ability to raise funds in the U.S. market.On the other hand, the availability of the QEF election may mitigate some of these concerns for investors who are willing to comply with the additional reporting. In the long term, if FTAI manages to demonstrate strong performance and provides clear and accessible tax information, it might offset the initial negative sentiment associated with the PFIC designation.It's also important to monitor whether the PFIC status is a transient issue or indicative of a broader trend in the company's income structure. Should the latter be the case, it could signal a strategic shift in FTAI's business model that warrants closer scrutiny from investors. 03/21/2024 - 04:15 PM NEW YORK, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTAI Aviation Ltd.

The company completed the third cohort enrollment and anticipates data in mid-2024. A Type D Meeting with the FDA discussed an accelerated approval pathway for RGLS8429. Positive Positive topline data from the Phase 1b MAD Clinical Trial of RGLS8429 for ADPKD Oversubscribed $100 million private placement to extend cash runway Completed enrollment of the third cohort in the MAD study with data expected in mid-2024 Successful Type D Meeting with FDA for accelerated approval pathway for RGLS8429 Negative None. Biopharmaceutical Financial Analyst The recent announcement by Regulus Therapeutics Inc. regarding the positive topline data from their Phase 1b MAD study of RGLS8429 presents a significant milestone for investors to consider. The biopharmaceutical sector is highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes, as they are strong indicators of a drug's potential market success. The positive data suggest that RGLS8429 could be a viable treatment for ADPKD, a disease with limited therapeutic options. This could translate into a competitive advantage and a new revenue stream for Regulus if the drug reaches the market.From a financial perspective, the oversubscribed private placement is a strong vote of confidence from institutional investors, signaling a robust interest in the company's growth prospects. The $100 million capital infusion extends the company's operational runway, which is important for sustaining long-term R&D efforts without the immediate need for further dilutive financing. This financial stability is likely to be viewed favorably by the market, as it reduces short-term financial risk and underlines the company's potential for growth.However, it is important to note that the drug is still in early stages of development and there are several regulatory hurdles ahead. The FDA's willingness to consider an accelerated approval pathway is promising, yet investors should remain cautious until more substantial efficacy and safety data are available. Furthermore, the increase in R&D expenses year-over-year reflects the company's investment in advancing their pipeline, which could pressure short-term financials but is necessary for long-term value creation. Medical Research Analyst The clinical progress of RGLS8429, as reported by Regulus Therapeutics, is noteworthy for stakeholders within the medical research community. The observed dose response and the correlation with improvements in kidney volume and function are particularly significant, as they provide evidence of the drug's biological activity and potential therapeutic impact. The use of urinary polycystin levels as a biomarker is a strategic approach in demonstrating the drug's mechanism of action in ADPKD, a complex renal disorder characterized by cyst formation and progressive kidney enlargement.Moreover, the exploratory results regarding reductions in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) and total kidney cyst volume (TKCV) in patients are encouraging. These parameters are critical in assessing the progression of ADPKD and could serve as surrogate endpoints in future clinical trials. The decision to increase the sample size in cohort 4 is a prudent step to enhance the robustness of the data. As the company progresses towards higher dosing in upcoming cohorts, the medical research community will be closely monitoring the safety profile of RGLS8429, as well as its efficacy in a larger patient population.It is also essential to consider the implications of the Type D meeting with the FDA, which suggests a pathway for expedited approval based on TKV reduction. While this accelerates the drug's potential time to market, the requirement for a post-approval Phase 3 trial to demonstrate improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) introduces an additional layer of complexity and risk. The outcome of these trials will be pivotal in determining the drug's long-term viability and its ability to meet the unmet needs of the ADPKD patient population. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Positive topline data from the second cohort of patients in Phase 1b Multiple-Ascending Dose (MAD) Clinical Trial of RGLS8429 for the Treatment of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Oversubscribed $100 million private placement; expected to extend cash runway into H1 2026 Completed enrollment of the third cohort of patients in the MAD study; Data anticipated mid-2024 Completed Type D Meeting with FDA to Discuss Pathway for Accelerated Approval of RGLS8429 SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs (the ""Company"" or ""Regulus""), today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. ""2023 was a productive year for Regulus, and the growing momentum in our Phase 1b MAD study of RGLS8429 is further emphasized by our announcement of key milestones and data readouts, including the recent positive topline data from the second cohort of patients. In the topline data, we saw evidence of a mechanistic dose response at a 2 mg/kg dose level based on urinary polycystin levels and in particular their potential correlation with improvements in kidney volume and function"" said Jay Hagan, CEO of Regulus. ""Thanks to the strong data we've seen to date and the ongoing support of our shareholders, we completed an oversubscribed $100 million private placement this month, which is expected to extend our cash runway into the first half of 2026. We look forward to a busy 2024, including sharing top-line data from our third cohort, expected in mid-2024, and the initiation of our fourth and final cohort of the MAD study next quarter."" Program Updates RGLS8429 for ADPKD: In March 2024, the Company shared positive topline data from the second cohort of patients in the Phase 1b MAD study of RGLS8429 for the treatment of ADPKD. In the second cohort, 14 patients were randomized 3:1 to receive either 2 mg/kg of RGLS8429 or placebo every other week for three months. RGLS8429 was well tolerated with no safety findings of concern. Greater biological activity of RGLS8429 was observed at 2 mg/kg based on urinary polycystin levels compared to 1mg/kg and placebo, which was most evident after 3 months of dosing. Exploratory results of imaging-based biomarkers were encouraging with 3 patients with the highest increases in PC1 and PC2 having reductions in height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) >4%, with corresponding reductions in total kidney cyst volume (TKCV). These data suggest that targeting miR-17 may have a potential impact on htTKV and TKCV in patients with ADPKD, which the Company will further explore at higher doses in cohorts 3 and 4. The Phase 1b MAD study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of RGLS8429 in adult patients with ADPKD. The study is evaluating RGLS8429 treatment across three different weight-based dose levels, including measuring changes in urinary polycystins 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2), htTKV, cyst architecture, and overall kidney function. In November 2023, Regulus announced it had dosed the first patient in the third cohort of the Phase 1b MAD study. This cohort is receiving 3 mg/kg of RGLS8429 or placebo every other week for three months. In January, the Company announced that it had completed enrollment in cohort 3 with top-line data expected in mid-2024. In late 2023, Regulus amended the protocol for the Phase 1b MAD study to include a fourth cohort that will receive an open label fixed dose of 300 mg of RGLS8429 that will provide higher exposure in a larger number of patients based on anticipated body weight in order to compare biomarker and safety data to the weight-based dosing, with initiation of screening planned for Q2 2024. Based on the results from the second cohort, the Company plans to amend the protocol to increase the sample size to up to 30 patients in cohort 4. In December 2023, the Company held a successful Type D meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the accelerated approval pathway. The meeting was constructive and confirmed the potential for an accelerated approval pathway based on a single pivotal Phase 2 study of RGLS8429 for the treatment of ADPKD. The FDA has adopted an accelerated approval pathway for ADPKD based on a single pivotal trial demonstrating statistically significant reduction in TKV growth compared to placebo, with completion of a post approval Phase 3 trial as a post-marketing requirement, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) compared to placebo. Corporate Highlights Closed Oversubscribed $100 Million Private Placement: On March 12, 2024, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement in connection with a private placement to certain institutional and other accredited investors. The financing included participation from new and existing institutional investors, including Adage Capital Partners L.P., Deep Track Capital, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Octagon Capital, RA Capital Management, and Vivo Capital. Financial Results Cash and Cash Equivalents: As of December 31, 2023, Regulus had $23.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Combined with the $100 million private placement equity financing in March, the Company expects its cash runway to extend into H1 2026. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: Research and development expenses were $5.8 million and $21.2 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $4.7 million and $18.4 million for the same periods in 2022, respectively. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $2.5 million and $10.0 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, compared to $2.2 million and $9.8 million for the same periods in 2022, respectively. Net Loss: Net loss was $8.1 million, or $0.40 per share (basic and diluted), and $30.0 million, or $1.58 per share (basic and diluted), for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $6.8 million, or $0.40 per share (basic and diluted), and $28.3 million, or $1.86 per share (basic and diluted), for the same periods in 2022. About ADPKD Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), caused by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes, is among the most common human monogenic disorders and a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. The disease is characterized by the development of multiple fluid filled cysts primarily in the kidneys, and to a lesser extent in the liver and other organs. Excessive kidney cyst cell proliferation, a central pathological feature, ultimately leads to end-stage renal disease in approximately 50% of ADPKD patients by age 60. Approximately 160,000 individuals are diagnosed with the disease in the United States alone, with an estimated global prevalence of 4 to 7 million. About RGLS8429 RGLS8429 is a novel, next generation oligonucleotide for the treatment of ADPKD designed to inhibit miR-17 and to preferentially target the kidney. Administration of RGLS8429 has shown robust data in preclinical models, where clear improvements in kidney function, size, and other measures of disease severity have been demonstrated along with a superior pharmacologic profile in preclinical studies compared to Regulus' first-generation compound, RGLS4326. Regulus announced completion of the Phase 1 SAD study in September 2022. The Phase 1 SAD study demonstrated that RGLS8429 has a favorable safety and PK profile.

(AIR) reports record third-quarter sales of $567 million, up 9% from the previous year, with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.39. The company also closed the acquisition of Triumph Group's Product Support business for $725 million, driving 18% sales growth in the commercial business. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in third quarter sales of 9% indicates a robust performance by AAR CORP, particularly in the context of a challenging economic environment. The growth driven by the Parts Supply offerings and MRO services aligns with industry trends where airlines continue to invest in maintenance and efficiency to optimize costs. The acquisition of Triumph Group's Product Support business is a strategic expansion, likely to enhance AAR's service offerings and geographical reach, especially in the Asia-Pacific market. This move should be observed for its potential to generate synergies and contribute to future earnings growth.However, the increase in net interest expense to $11.3 million, primarily due to the bridge financing costs, raises concerns about the cost of capital and its impact on net earnings. While the company's strategy to prioritize debt repayment is prudent, investors should monitor the balance between leveraging for growth and maintaining financial stability. The net leverage ratio of 0.95x suggests a moderate level of debt, which if managed well, may not be a significant risk factor. Market Research Analyst AAR CORP's focus on the commercial sector, which now accounts for 70% of consolidated sales, reflects a strategic decision to capitalize on the more dynamic commercial aviation market. The 18% increase in sales to commercial customers underscores the demand for aviation services post-pandemic. This growth trajectory is expected to continue as the industry recovers and evolves. The reported decrease in government sales by 7% may suggest a shift in market dynamics or a strategic realignment of the company's focus, which could have implications for future revenue streams.Furthermore, the company's emphasis on operating margin improvement, despite rising labor costs, demonstrates a commitment to efficiency and profitability. The 50% increase in adjusted operating margins since pre-COVID levels is a testament to the company's operational resilience. Stakeholders should consider the potential for continued margin expansion as a positive indicator of management's effectiveness in controlling costs. Aerospace Industry Consultant The strategic acquisition of Triumph Group's Product Support business is a significant milestone for AAR CORP, indicating an aggressive pursuit of growth through inorganic means. The addition of over 700 team members and enhanced repair capabilities could provide AAR with a competitive edge in the MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) space, which is important in the highly competitive aerospace industry. The expansion into the Asia-Pacific region is particularly noteworthy, as it is one of the fastest-growing aviation markets globally.Investors should note the company's focus on used serviceable material (USM) and new parts distribution, which are key areas in the cost-sensitive aviation industry. The ability to provide a diverse range of services, from airframe MRO to component repair, positions AAR to meet varying customer needs and could drive market share gains. The emphasis on cash generation and portfolio optimization further indicates a strategic approach to capital allocation that could enhance long-term shareholder value. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Record third quarter sales of $567 million, up 9% over the prior yearThird quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.39, compared to $0.62 in Q3 FY2023Record third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.85, up 13% from $0.75 in Q3 FY2023Third quarter cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations of $20 millionClosed on the acquisition of Triumph Group's Product Support business for $725 millionWOOD DALE, Ill., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- AAR CORP. (NYSE: AIR), a leading provider of aviation services to commercial and government operators, MROs, and OEMs, today reported third quarter fiscal year 2024 consolidated sales of $567.3 million and income from continuing operations of $14.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share. For the third quarter of the prior year, the Company reported sales of $521.1 million and income from continuing operations of $21.8 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $0.85, compared to $0.75 in the third quarter of the prior year. Consolidated third quarter sales increased 9% over the prior year quarter. Our consolidated sales to commercial customers increased 18% over the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong demand for our Parts Supply offerings, MRO services, and increased volumes in our commercial programs activities while our sales to government customers decreased 7%. Sales to commercial customers were 70% of consolidated sales, compared to 65% in the prior year quarter. On March 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Triumph Group's Product Support business for $725 million, which was financed using the proceeds from our issuance of $550 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2029 and borrowings from our Amended Revolving Credit Facility, which was upsized from $620 million to $825 million. The acquisition of the Product Support business scales our repair capabilities, expands our footprint in the Asia-Pacific region and adds more than 700 talented team members. ""During the quarter, we drove 18% sales growth in our commercial business capitalizing on the continued strong demand for both our parts supply activities and MRO services. We expect commercial demand to remain elevated as the life and high utilization of current generation aircraft continue to extend,"" said John M. Holmes, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AAR CORP. Gross profit margin increased from 18.1% in the prior year quarter to 19.4% in the current quarter, primarily due to the favorable impact of our operating efficiency on increased sales volumes. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $77.0 million in the current quarter, which included $12.2 million related to acquisition and amortization expenses and $2.0 million related to investigation costs. Operating margins were 5.8% in the current quarter, compared to 6.5% in the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased from 7.6% in the prior year quarter to 8.3% in the current year quarter, primarily as a result of the growth in commercial sales. Sequentially, our adjusted operating margin increased from 8.1% to 8.3%, driven by improved profitability in our Parts Supply and Repair & Engineering segments. During and subsequent to the quarter, we announced multiple new contract awards, including: Multi-year contract extension and expansion for flight-hour component support services with ASL AirlinesAgreements with Singapore Airlines and Archer Aviation to provide Trax's software solutionsNew multi-year distribution agreement with Ontic to supply a strategic selection of military products to the U.S. governmentMulti-year extension with Philippine Airlines for Airinmar's full suite of support services covering both aircraft warranty and value engineeringMulti-year agreement with Cebu Pacific to supply CFM56-5B engine surplus materialHolmes continued, ""We have expanded our operating margins every quarter for the last three years and our adjusted operating margins are now 50% higher than they were before COVID. We are especially proud to have made this progress in an inflationary environment where labor costs, in particular, have been rising. We believe as we grow our business and integrate the Product Support acquisition, our margins will continue to expand."" Net interest expense for the quarter was $11.3 million, compared to $3.5 million last year. Net interest expense in the current period included $6.1 million related to bridge financing costs for the acquisition of the Product Support business. Average diluted share count increased from 34.6 million shares in the prior year quarter to 35.2 million shares in the current year quarter. We repurchased 0.1 million shares for $5.1 million during the current year quarter and have $52.5 million remaining on our $150 million share repurchase program. From a capital deployment perspective, we are prioritizing debt repayment but will evaluate share repurchases along with other attractive investment opportunities to deploy our capital. Cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $20.4 million during the current quarter. As of February 29, 2024, our net debt was $207.8 million and our net leverage was 0.95x. Holmes concluded, ""I am exceptionally proud of the results our team continues to deliver, and we expect the acquisition of the Product Support business to accelerate our growth trajectory. We will leverage our leadership positions in used serviceable material (USM), new parts distribution, airframe MRO and now, with Product Support, component repair services to drive even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Additionally, we will maintain our focus on cash generation and portfolio optimization to ensure we maintain a strong balance sheet to enable both organic and inorganic investments.""

Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments for certain items including, but not limited to, the following: Investigation and remediation compliance costs comprised of legal and professional fees related to addressing potential violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which we self-reported to the U.S. Department of Justice and other agencies.Contract termination/restructuring costs comprised of gains and losses that are recognized at the time of modifying, terminating, or restructuring certain customer and vendor contracts, including forward loss provisions on long-term contracts.Customer bankruptcy and credit charges (recoveries) reflecting the impact of bankruptcies and other credit charges primarily resulting from the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aviation industry.Losses related to the sale and exit from our Composites manufacturing business, including legal fees for the performance guarantee associated with the Composites' A220 aircraft contract.Expenses associated with recent acquisition activity including professional fees for legal, due diligence, and other acquisition activities, bridge financing fees, intangible asset amortization, and compensation expense related to contingent consideration and retention agreements.Pension settlement charges associated with the settlement and termination of our frozen defined benefit pension plan.Legal judgments related to or impacted by the Russian/Ukraine conflict.Adjusted EBITDA is income from continuing operations before interest income (expense), other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and items of an unusual nature including but not limited to business divestitures and acquisitions, workforce actions, COVID-related subsidies and costs, impairment and exit charges, facility consolidation and repositioning costs, investigation and remediation compliance costs, equity investment gains and losses, pension settlement charges, legal judgments, acquisition and amortization expenses from recent acquisition activity, and significant customer events such as early terminations, contract restructurings, forward loss provisions, and bankruptcies.

The company anticipates continued growth driven by new partnerships and revenue generators. Operating expenses decreased by 15%, leading to improved adjusted EBITDA of $1,169,000 for Q4 2023. Positive Strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results reported by Intellicheck, Inc. (IDN). Net income for the fourth quarter reached $757,000, a significant improvement from a net loss of ($869,000) in the same period in 2022. SaaS revenues grew by 18% year over year, totaling $18,595,000 for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Operating expenses decreased by 15% to $4,291,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $5,054,000 in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA improved to $1,169,000 for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $389,000 in the same period in 2022. Negative None. Financial Analyst An examination of Intellicheck's financial results reveals a company in the midst of a positive transformation, underscored by a 14% year-over-year growth in total revenue and an impressive 18% increase in SaaS revenues. The significance of these figures lies in the scalability and predictability of SaaS models, which are highly valued by investors for their recurring revenue streams. The reported net income of $757,000, compared to a net loss in the previous year, indicates a successful turnaround in profitability, which could be a signal of effective cost management and operational efficiency.The company's gross profit margin remains robust at 94.9%, a slight increase from the previous year, highlighting the high-margin nature of the business. However, the full-year net loss of $1,980,000, an improvement from the prior year, suggests that while the company is moving in the right direction, it still faces challenges in achieving consistent profitability. The reduction in operating expenses, down by 15% for the quarter, could reflect a strategic realignment or cost-cutting measures that may have long-term implications for the company's growth trajectory. Market Research Analyst Intellicheck's strategic expansion into new verticals such as cryptocurrency suggests an agility to adapt to emerging markets. The entry into this high-growth sector could potentially open up significant revenue streams, but it also exposes the company to the volatility and regulatory uncertainties inherent in the crypto space. Furthermore, the appointment of new leadership in key positions such as CTO and Vice President of Marketing indicates an investment in innovation and market positioning, which could enhance the company's competitive edge and drive future growth.Investors should note the company's strong cash position, with $9.0 million in cash and short-term investments, providing a solid foundation for continued investment in growth initiatives. However, the reliance on equity-based compensation, as seen in the non-cash equity compensation expenses, should be monitored for its potential dilutive effect on shareholder value. Legal Expert While the financial results are promising, the disclosure that the results are preliminary and subject to adjustments post-audit introduces an element of uncertainty. Investors should exercise due diligence and consider the potential for revisions that could materially affect the reported figures. The company's adherence to regulatory requirements, particularly in light of its expansion into the cryptocurrency sector, will be important in maintaining investor confidence and avoiding legal and compliance risks. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Achieved Fourth Quarter Net Income of $757,000 SaaS Revenues Grew 18% Year Over Year MELVILLE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intellicheck, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net loss for certain reductions such as interest and other income and certain addbacks such as income taxes, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, sales tax accrual, depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our financial results with other companies that also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, sales tax accrual, amortization, depreciation, and stock-based compensation, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate our operations and can compare the results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures management uses to monitor and evaluate financial and operating results. We consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a useful measure of our historical operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest and other income, impairments of long-lived assets and goodwill, sales tax accrual, stock-based compensation expense, all of which impact our profitability, as well as depreciation and amortization related to the use of long-term assets which benefit multiple periods. We believe that these limitations are compensated by providing Adjusted EBITDA only with GAAP net loss and clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net loss presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by us may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities.

Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results and corporate updates from Armata Pharmaceuticals are of significant interest to current and potential investors, as they provide insights into the company's operational progress and strategic direction. The advancement of clinical trials, particularly the Phase 2a diSArm study and the Phase 2 Tailwind study, is an indication of the company's commitment to addressing antibiotic-resistant infections, a pressing medical issue with substantial market demand. The financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the U.S. Department of Defense not only validates the potential of Armata's phage therapeutics but also helps mitigate financial risks associated with the costly drug development process.Furthermore, the nearing completion of the advanced biologics manufacturing facility, which includes cGMP suites and an automated fill and finish suite, is pivotal for the transition from clinical trials to commercial production. This expansion suggests that Armata is preparing for the anticipated regulatory approval and market entry of its phage therapeutics. Investors should monitor the outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials, as positive results could significantly impact the company's valuation and stock performance, particularly if the therapeutics demonstrate a competitive edge in safety and efficacy over existing treatments. Medical Research Analyst The data presented by Armata Pharmaceuticals indicates a potentially groundbreaking approach in treating antibiotic-resistant infections with high-purity bacteriophage therapeutics. The ability to escalate doses due to phage purity and the observed similar biologic impact of phage therapy alone compared to phage plus antibiotics are promising signs. These findings could lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of bacterial infections, especially given the specificity of phage therapy in preserving the normal microbiome and reducing opportunistic infections.From a research perspective, the completion of the Phase 2 diSArm study within the year and the progression of the Phase 2 Tailwind study are critical milestones that could pave the way for Phase 3 trials and eventual FDA approval. The manufacturing advancements mentioned are equally crucial, as they will ensure the capacity to produce phage therapeutics at scale, which is a significant hurdle for biologics. The clinical and manufacturing milestones achieved by Armata demonstrate a robust pipeline that could lead to a new class of treatments for patients with limited options due to antibiotic resistance. Market Research Analyst Armata Pharmaceuticals' focus on bacteriophage therapeutics places it within a niche yet growing segment of the pharmaceutical market that addresses antibiotic resistance. The recent developments reported by the company, including the advancement of its clinical trials and the expansion of its manufacturing capabilities, are likely to capture the attention of healthcare providers and patients looking for alternative treatments. The financial and clinical support from notable organizations underscores the market's recognition of the need for innovative solutions in this space.As the company prepares for pivotal studies and commercial production, it is important to assess the potential market size for its phage therapeutics and the competitive landscape. If Armata's products can demonstrate superior safety profiles and efficacy, there could be significant market penetration and adoption, leading to a positive impact on the company's financial performance. The preservation of the microbiome and the reduction in opportunistic infections are key differentiators that could influence prescribing behaviors and patient preference, especially in the context of rising antibiotic resistance. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM LOS ANGELES, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Armata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE American: ARMP) (""Armata"" or the ""Company""), a biotechnology company focused on high-purity, pathogen-specific bacteriophage therapeutics for antibiotic-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a corporate update. Fourth Quarter 2023 and Recent Developments: Continued to advance the Phase 2a portion of the Company's diSArm study of AP-SA02 as a potential treatment for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with continued ability to dose escalate due to phage purity, as well as its Phase 2 Tailwind study of AP-PA02 in patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB).Reported that analysis of data from the SWARM-P.a. clinical trial of AP-PA02 in cystic fibrosis patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infections, together with blinded trends from the ongoing Tailwind NCFB study, indicate that treatment with phage alone compared to phage plus antibiotics results in a similar biologic impact.Additionally, similar phage distribution and phage kinetics have been observed across both patient populations.The specificity of phage for their bacterial targets preserves the normal microbiome compared to subjects receiving standard-of-care antibiotic treatment, diminishing the risk to opportunistic infections.Continued to advance bacteriophage science through multiple data presentations and publications:Presented topline data from the Company's Phase 1b/2a SWARM-P.a. clinical trial evaluating AP-PA02, a novel, inhaled multi-phage therapeutic for the treatment of chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in people with cystic fibrosis, at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Plenary II session in November 2023.Delivered a presentation on the Company's phage development programs at the 6th Annual Bacteriophage Therapy Summit in February 2024.Plans to submit a manuscript detailing results from the SWARM-P.a. trial to a peer-reviewed journal in the first half of 2024.Progressed the build-out of its advanced biologics manufacturing facility, including completion of R&D labs and administrative space during the fourth quarter of 2023. In the first half of 2024, Armata expects to complete the construction of five large cGMP suites, including a state-of-the-art automated fill and finish suite.""Since our last quarterly update, we continued to progress toward our mission of addressing the global challenge of antibiotic resistance through the development of high-impact phage therapeutics with best-in-class purity,"" stated Dr. Deborah Birx, Chief Executive Officer of Armata. ""Notably, we have maintained our strategic commitment to investing in rigorous yet efficiently designed randomized studies that, if successful, will support future registration of our high purity phage candidates in areas of significant unmet need."" ""Regarding AP-PA02, which we are developing with financial and clinical support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as a potential treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, analysis of results from trials to date confirm similarities in phage distribution and phage kinetics across both patient populations and strongly validate our phage 'cocktail' approach. Additionally, treatment with phage alone and treatment with phage plus standard-of-care antibiotics appears to have a similar biologic impact. Our Phase 2 Tailwind study in subjects with NCFB is progressing according to plan following an acceleration in enrollment trends that we observed last quarter."" ""Regarding our second clinical candidate, AP-SA02, which we are developing with financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Defense as a potential treatment for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, we continue to see a high level of patient tolerance, and plan to continue to escalate our dose to optimally define the Phase 3 dose. We remain on track to complete our Phase 2 diSArm study this year."" ""Also, during the fourth quarter, we further optimized our production capabilities to enhance the purity of our phage candidates, which is a key differentiator for us. It is the purity of our candidates that we believe contributes to their favorable safety profile, allowing us to explore higher doses and longer durations of treatment as we prepare for pivotal studies, likely to commence in the first half of 2025. Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facility is nearing completion and will enable us to support both late-stage trials as well as commercial production."" ""We continue to achieve important clinical and manufacturing milestones while prudently managing our expenses, and I am excited about what we are poised to achieve this year and next,"" Dr. Birx concluded.

Full-year 2024 revenue guidance of $10.700 billion to $10.800 billion and diluted EPS of $14.00 to $14.20. Positive outlook for growth and business development in 2024. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The reported increase in lululemon's net revenue by 19% to $9.6 billion and the rise in diluted EPS from $6.68 to $12.20 for the fiscal year suggest robust growth for the company. Particularly noteworthy is the international net revenue jump of 54%, indicating successful expansion efforts. The gross margin improvement of 290 basis points to 58.3% reflects effective cost management and could signal a competitive advantage in the athletic apparel industry, where margins are often squeezed by promotional activities and manufacturing costs.Moreover, the opening of 56 new stores and a share repurchase program indicate a proactive strategy for growth and shareholder value enhancement. It's essential to monitor how these expansions impact operating costs and whether the company can maintain its gross margins with a larger retail footprint. The share repurchase program also suggests confidence in the company's valuation and future performance. The repurchase of 1.5 million shares for $554.6 million could be a sign of under-valuation or a strategic move to reduce share dilution. Financial Analyst An operating margin increase to 22.2% from the previous year's figure demonstrates strong operational efficiency and financial discipline. This performance is particularly impressive considering the challenges faced by many retailers, including increased competition and shifting consumer preferences. The effective tax rate reduction to 28.8% from 35.9% also contributed to the bottom line, highlighting the impact of fiscal management on profitability.The company's liquidity position, with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, provides financial flexibility and the ability to weather potential market downturns. This strong balance sheet position, coupled with the decreased inventory levels by 9%, suggests that lululemon is effectively managing its stock to align with demand, mitigating the risk of overstocking which can lead to markdowns and margin erosion. Retail Industry Analyst The reported comparable sales increase of 13% reflects a solid consumer demand for lululemon's products. The differentiation in the marketplace mentioned by the CFO, likely referring to the brand's premium positioning and community engagement, is a critical factor in driving these sales. The omni operating model, which integrates in-store and online sales channels, appears to be effectively capturing customer engagement across different platforms.Looking ahead, the projected net revenue growth of 11% to 12% for 2024, with diluted EPS in the range of $14.00 to $14.20, sets a positive tone for the upcoming fiscal year. However, the guidance does not account for share repurchases, which could further affect EPS calculations. It's important to assess whether the growth momentum can be sustained amid economic uncertainties and increased competition in the athleisure market. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Fourth quarter revenue increased 16% to $3.2 billion.

A constant dollar basis assumes the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period remained constant with the average foreign currency exchange rates for the same period of the prior year. The Company provides constant dollar changes in its results to help investors understand the underlying growth rate of net revenue excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Adjusted gross profit, gross margin, income from operations, operating margin, income tax expense, effective tax rates, net income, and diluted earnings per share exclude certain inventory provisions, goodwill and other asset impairments, and restructuring costs recognized in relation to lululemon Studio, the gain on disposal of assets for the sale of an administrative office building, and the related income tax effects of these items. The Company believes these adjusted financial measures are useful to investors as they provide supplemental information that enable evaluation of the underlying trend in its operating performance, and enable a comparison to its historical financial information. Further, due to the finite and discrete nature of these items, it does not consider them to be normal operating expenses that are necessary to run the business, or impairments or disposal gains that are expected to arise in the normal course of its operations. Management uses these adjusted financial measures and constant currency metrics internally when reviewing and assessing financial performance. The Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to January 31st of the following year, typically resulting in a 52-week year, but occasionally giving rise to an additional week, resulting in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2023 and 2022 were each 52-week years while 2024 will be a 53-week year. The expected net revenue increase excluding the 53rd week excludes the expected net revenue for the 53rd week of 2024. This enables an evaluation of the expected year-over-year increase in net revenue based on 52 weeks in each year. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or with greater prominence to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the section captioned ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" included in the accompanying financial tables, which includes more detail on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to each non-GAAP financial measure, and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.

Positive Successful advancement in Phase 2 studies for BDC-1001 (trastuzumab imbotolimod) across four HER2-positive tumor types. BDC-3042 Phase 1 study clears safety assessments in the first three dose level cohorts. Cash balance of $128.6 million as of December 31, 2023, expected to fund key milestones through late 2025.

Medical Research Analyst The progress of Bolt Biotherapeutics in advancing their Phase 2 studies for BDC-1001, now known as trastuzumab imbotolimod, marks a pivotal stage in the clinical development of new cancer treatments. The reported objective response rate (ORR) of 29% at the ESMO 2023 Congress, including one complete response and three partial responses, suggests a potentially promising efficacy profile for this novel immunotherapy. However, the impact on the company's valuation will depend on the consistency of these results across a larger patient population and longer-term data on survival outcomes. Moreover, the successful clearance of safety assessments for the Phase 1 study of BDC-3042 is a important step forward in the drug's development pathway. As it targets Dectin-2, a receptor on tumor-associated macrophages, this therapy could represent a novel mechanism of action in the immunotherapy landscape. The absence of dose-limiting toxicities thus far is encouraging for its safety profile. Investors should note that the combination therapy with a PD-1 inhibitor could enhance the therapeutic potential of BDC-3042, but combination studies are yet to be reported. From a financial perspective, the cash balance of $128.6 million provides the company with a runway through late 2025, which is relatively strong for a biotech firm in clinical development stages. The decrease in R&D expenses reflects efficient capital allocation and cost containment, which is often appreciated by investors. However, the true value inflection points will be the clinical trial outcomes, which have the potential to significantly affect the stock's performance. Financial Analyst Investors should consider the financial health and operational efficiency of Bolt Biotherapeutics as reflected in their latest earnings report. A year-over-year increase in collaboration revenue from $5.7 million to $7.9 million indicates a growing confidence in the company's research capabilities and potential for future partnerships, which can be a positive signal for future revenue streams. The reported decrease in R&D expenses, from $73.1 million to $61.5 million, alongside a reduction in G&A expenses, suggests disciplined spending and could be viewed favorably in terms of long-term sustainability. However, the company's operational loss has decreased from $90.3 million to $76.2 million, which, while still significant, indicates an improvement in managing operational costs. Strategic partnerships, such as the one with Roche providing pertuzumab, could also be a lever for risk-sharing and capital efficiency. The financial runway extending into late 2025 allows for continued investment in key clinical milestones without the immediate need for additional capital raises, which could dilute existing shareholders' stakes. Oncology Doctor Trastuzumab imbotolimod's advancement into later-stage clinical trials is noteworthy, particularly for the treatment of HER2-positive cancers. HER2 is a protein that can promote the growth of cancer cells. Inhibiting this protein can be an effective treatment strategy, as seen with other HER2-targeted therapies. The combination of trastuzumab imbotolimod with pertuzumab could potentially offer a more comprehensive blockade of HER2 signaling pathways, which may translate to better clinical outcomes for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The use of a Simon two-stage design in the Phase 2 cohorts is a strategic approach to clinical trial design, enabling an early stop for futility if the treatment does not show promise. This can save time and resources while focusing on the most promising therapeutic avenues. The reported safety profile, with mostly low-grade infusion-related reactions, is also encouraging, as it suggests the treatment may be well-tolerated, which is always a significant consideration in cancer therapy. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM – BDC-1001 (trastuzumab imbotolimod) Phase 2 studies in four HER2-positive tumor types advancing toward 2024 milestones– BDC-3042 Phase 1 study successfully cleared safety assessments in the first three dose level cohorts – Cash balance of $128.6 million as of December 31, 2023, anticipated to fund key milestones through late 2025 REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bolt Biotherapeutics (Nasdaq: BOLT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. “We made substantial progress advancing our two proprietary clinical-stage development programs in 2023,” said Randall Schatzman, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer. “We have now administered BDC-1001, which we have renamed trastuzumab imbotolimod, to patients in all five of the Phase 2 cohorts. BDC-3042 also continues to advance, and has now entered the fourth dose escalation cohort without a dose-limiting toxicity. Both clinical programs are on track and we look forward to providing updates later this year.” Recent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones Trastuzumab imbotolimod (BDC-1001) Phase 2 program continues to advance. Trastuzumab imbotolimod is a Boltbody™ ISAC that is currently in Phase 2 clinical development across five distinct cohorts treating patients with HER2-positive cancer. The first three cohorts evaluate monotherapy trastuzumab imbotolimod in colorectal, endometrial, and gastroesophageal cancer, and the fourth and fifth cohorts evaluate trastuzumab imbotolimod with or without pertuzumab for the treatment of HER-2 positive metastatic breast cancer. All cohorts utilize a Simon two-stage design. Roche is providing pertuzumab in support of the trial. The most recent update on trastuzumab imbotolimod was presented at the ESMO 2023 Congress in October 2023, noting a 29% objective response rate (ORR) comprising 1 complete response (CR) and 3 partial responses (PRs) in evaluable patients with HER2-positive tumors at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). BDC-1001 was well tolerated. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) was Grade 1 or 2 infusion-related reactions, which were seen in 30% of patients in the study.BDC-3042 Phase 1 dose escalation study continues to advance. BDC-3042 is a proprietary agonist antibody that targets Dectin-2, an immune-activating receptor expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This dose-escalation Phase 1 clinical study will initially evaluate BDC-3042 as monotherapy in patients with a variety of solid tumors, and will then evaluate the combination of BDC-3042 with a PD-1 inhibitor. Bolt has completed the first three dosing cohorts without observing any dose-limiting toxicities and the trial is enrolling well.Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $128.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash on hand is expected to fund multiple clinical milestones in 2024 and operations through late 2025. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Collaboration Revenue – Collaboration revenue was $2.1 million for the quarter and $7.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.4 million and $5.7 million for the same quarter and year in 2022. Revenue in the comparative periods was generated from the services performed under our R&D collaborations as we fulfill our performance obligations. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses – R&D expenses were $16.3 million for the quarter and $61.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $16.8 million and $73.1 million for the same quarter and year ended 2022. The decrease in R&D expenses was due to lower manufacturing expenses related to the timing of batch production, offset by higher clinical expenses related to the advancement of trastuzumab imbotolimod clinical trial into Phase 2. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses – G&A expenses were $5.5 million for the quarter and $22.5 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $5.6 million and $22.9 million for the same quarter and year in 2022. Loss from Operations – Loss from operations was $19.8 million for the quarter and $76.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $21.0 million and $90.3 million for the same quarter and year in 2022. This is in part a reflection of proactive cost-containment measures taken in June 2022. About the Boltbody™ Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugate (ISAC) Platform Bolt Biotherapeutics’ Boltbody ISAC platform harnesses the precision of antibodies with the power of the innate and adaptive immune system to reprogram the tumor microenvironment to generate a productive anti-cancer response. Each Boltbody ISAC candidate comprises a tumor-targeting antibody, a non-cleavable linker, and a proprietary immune stimulant. The antibody is designed to target one or more markers on the surface of a tumor cell and the immune stimulant is designed to recruit and activate myeloid cells. Activated myeloid cells initiate a positive feedback loop by releasing cytokines and chemokines, chemical signals that attract other immune cells and lower the activation threshold for an immune response. This increases the population of activated immune system cells in the tumor microenvironment and promotes a robust immune response with the goal of generating durable therapeutic responses for patients with cancer. About Bolt Biotherapeutics, Inc. Bolt Biotherapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Bolt Biotherapeutics’ pipeline candidates are built on the Company’s deep expertise in myeloid biology and cancer drug development. The Company’s pipeline includes trastuzumab imbotolimod (formerly BDC-1001), a HER2-targeting Boltbody™ Immune-Stimulating Antibody Conjugate (ISAC), BDC-3042, a myeloid-modulating antibody, and multiple Boltbody ISAC collaboration programs. Trastuzumab imbotolimod is currently in Phase 2 clinical development following the successful completion of a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial that demonstrated tolerability and early clinical efficacy. BDC-3042, an agonist antibody targeting Dectin-2, is currently in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial. In preclinical development, BDC-3042 demonstrated the ability to convert tumor-supportive macrophages to tumor-destructive macrophages.

(Nasdaq: SPRY) is progressing towards submitting a response to the FDA's Complete Response Letter (CRL) for neffy® nasal spray for Type I allergic reactions, with successful Phase 2 trials and a well-capitalized position. The company aims for an anticipated FDA approval in the second half of 2024. Positive Successful completion of neffy repeat dose nasal allergen challenge study and nitrosamine assessments Positive Phase 2 urticaria clinical trial results with rapid symptom control Cash position of $228.4 million with at least three years of operating runway Expectation of neffy launch in the U.S. in H2 2024 Favorable topline results from repeat dosing study of neffy in seasonal allergic rhinitis Initiation of outpatient urticaria study planned for later in 2024 Anticipated FDA action date and potential launch in the second half of 2024 Negative None. Pharmaceutical Market Analyst The announcement of ARS Pharmaceuticals' progress with neffy, an epinephrine nasal spray, represents a significant development in the allergic reaction treatment market. With the successful completion of the repeat dose study and nitrosamine assessments, ARS Pharmaceuticals is addressing the FDA's concerns raised in the Complete Response Letter (CRL). The potential approval and launch of neffy in H2 2024 could disrupt the current market for emergency allergic reaction treatments, which is dominated by injectable epinephrine products.The company's cash position, with over $200 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, indicates a strong financial standing that can support the commercial launch of neffy without the immediate need for additional funding. This financial health is important for investors as it suggests ARS Pharmaceuticals can sustain its operations and invest in marketing efforts upon approval. The positive clinical trial results may also position neffy as a preferred alternative due to its non-invasive administration method, which could lead to widespread adoption and increased sales revenue. Clinical Research Analyst The clinical data presented for neffy in the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria is noteworthy. Chronic spontaneous urticaria is a condition with limited community use treatments and neffy's rapid symptom control could offer a significant quality of life improvement for patients. The drug's ability to provide episodic relief without the need for systemic biologics or immunosuppressants, which carry more severe side effects, is a major advantage. This could lead to a paradigm shift in the management of urticaria exacerbations.Furthermore, the 100% response rate in pediatric subjects following oral food challenges suggests that neffy could become a critical rescue medication in pediatric anaphylaxis management. The pediatric market is particularly sensitive to the method of drug delivery and a nasal spray could see better compliance compared to injections. The implications for healthcare providers and payers could include reduced emergency room visits and overall healthcare costs, which is a significant consideration for the adoption of new treatments. Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy Consultant The issuance of a new U.S. patent covering a range of dosages for intranasal epinephrine formulations is a strategic win for ARS Pharmaceuticals. It not only extends the exclusivity period for neffy but also potentially blocks competitors from entering the market with similar intranasal formulations. This IP strength could be a key factor in investor confidence, as it provides a clearer path for neffy to capture market share without immediate generic competition. The patent recognition of neffy's novel delivery system and dosing could also enhance its marketability and justify a premium pricing strategy.Investors should note that the strength of a company's patent portfolio can be as critical as its product pipeline. It can prevent revenue erosion from generic competition, allowing the company to maximize the commercial potential of its products. The new patent could also open opportunities for licensing deals or partnerships, providing additional revenue streams beyond direct sales. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Preparing to submit response to the FDA’s CRL for neffy® (epinephrine nasal spray) in Type I allergic reactions in early Q2 2024, following successful completion of neffy repeat dose nasal allergen challenge study and nitrosamine assessments, with expected up to six-month review period In Phase 2 urticaria clinical trial, neffy met primary endpoints and showed rapid symptom control; planning to initiate outpatient study later in 2024, potentially followed by initiation of a single pivotal efficacy study Ended fourth quarter with $228.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with an expected operating runway of at least three years; well-capitalized to support anticipated H2 2024 launch of neffy in the U.S. SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today reported business updates and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. “We started the year by turning the page and quickly addressing the two deficiencies identified in the FDA’s CRL for neffy late last year and are now working to finalize our response to the CRL, which we expect to submit in early Q2 2024. We want to deliver this needle-free, safe, effective, and easy to carry epinephrine solution to patients in need as quickly as possible. To do so, we remain well capitalized with anticipated cash and equivalents greater than $200 million at the time of the anticipated FDA approval of neffy, expected in the second half of 2024,” said Richard Lowenthal, Co-founder, President and CEO of ARS Pharma. Mr. Lowenthal further stated, “At the recent American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) annual meeting in February 2024, six posters and oral presentations on neffy were presented, including efficacy data showing a 100% response rate with a single dose of neffy in the 15 enrolled pediatric subjects experiencing anaphylaxis symptoms following oral food challenge, further increasing our confidence in neffy’s commercial ramp and potential. At AAAAI, we also presented positive topline data from our Phase 2 inpatient, randomized, controlled study of neffy in patients with refractory chronic spontaneous urticaria. neffy met all primary endpoints and showed rapid symptom control, supporting advancement to an outpatient study in chronic spontaneous urticaria patients who experience acute exacerbations of symptoms, which we plan to initiate later in 2024, followed by a potential pivotal study in 2025.” U.S. Regulatory Status of neffy (epinephrine nasal spray) for Type I Allergic Reactions In September 2023, ARS Pharma announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding its New Drug Application (NDA) for neffy. In the CRL, the FDA requested completion of a pharmacokinetic (PK) / pharmacodynamic (PD) study assessing repeat doses of neffy compared to repeat doses of an epinephrine injection product under allergen-induced allergic rhinitis conditions to support approval.In February 2024, ARS Pharma announced the successful completion of the repeat dosing study of neffy in seasonal allergic rhinitis under nasal allergen challenge conditions. ARS Pharma also completed the nitrosamine testing requested in the CRL per the FDA’s draft guidance issued in August 2023, with no measurable levels of nitrosamines detected.The favorable topline results from this repeat dose study, meant to represent a challenging nasal scenario that is potentially relevant to less than 0.5% of patients, showed repeat doses of neffy demonstrated a PK profile greater than or similar to repeat doses of intramuscular injection of epinephrine, and a PD profile greater than injection. In particular, repeat dosing in the same nostril was greater in exposure than dosing once in each nostril and greater than injection on both PK exposures and PD response at all time points, which may help inform labeling and instructions for use.Having addressed the deficiencies identified by the FDA, ARS Pharma is finalizing its response to the CRL, which it expects to submit in early Q2 2024. Following an expected up to six-month review period, ARS Pharma anticipates an FDA action date and potential launch in the second half of 2024. Clinical Status of neffy for Urticaria In late-February, ARS Pharma announced positive clinical data from a Phase 2 trial evaluating neffy in adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria.There are currently no approved community use treatments for acute flares experienced by urticaria patients on chronic regimens of antihistamines or biologics. neffy may provide episodic symptomatic relief of these acute flares or exacerbations to improve the quality of life of urticaria patients. Patients would have the option to quickly resolve exacerbations or flares at home without escalating to chronic use of systemic biologics or immunosuppressants that may have more serious side effects and benefit-risk considerations, or having to visit the emergency room for further treatment.The Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 18 adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were treated at the clinical site, met its primary endpoints with both 1 mg and 2 mg neffy demonstrating statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pruritus, hives, body surface area and erythema from baseline as early as 5 minutes after dosing. These data were presented in an oral session at the 2024 AAAAI annual meeting.ARS Pharma plans to initiate an outpatient urticaria study in patients treated with antihistamines who experience frequent acute flares later in 2024, potentially followed by initiation of a single pivotal efficacy study. Additional Business Updates and Anticipated Milestones Marketing authorization application (MAA) for neffy is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) with a decision now expected in mid-2024. Submissions to other regulatory authorities in additional countries are planned for 2024.On March 7, 2024, ARS Pharma held a virtual neffy Investor Day. The ARS Pharma management team was joined by two leading allergists, Dr. Jonathan Spergel, M.D., Ph.D. and Dr. Thomas B. Casale, M.D. A replay of the event can be accessed here.In March 2024, a new U.S. patent was issued (US 11,918,655) by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that covers methods of treating Type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, with intranasal epinephrine formulations having a wider dose range of 0.1 to 4.0 mg epinephrine with or without absorption enhancing agents. This newly issued patent recognizes the novelty of neffy and its ability to safely deliver low potent doses of epinephrine with comparable PK and PD to marketed epinephrine injectables.In February 2024, ARS Pharma presented six posters and oral presentations at the 2024 AAAAI Annual Meeting, including efficacy data for neffy from two distinct clinical studies in oral food challenge induced anaphylaxis and chronic spontaneous urticaria patients. The chronic urticaria data are discussed above, and the oral food challenge induced anaphylaxis efficacy data demonstrated that 100% of the 15 enrolled pediatric patients responded to a single dose of neffy with a 16-minute median time to complete resolution of symptoms. The Company expects this data will support post-marketing promotion of neffy, if approved.In November 2023, ARS Pharma presented positive results during the 2023 American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology meeting supporting that neffy is expected to be a safe and effective treatment option for severe allergic reactions in sub-populations including patients with upper respiratory tract infections, pediatric patients weighing greater than or equal to 30 kg and patients with varying body mass index or body weight.In October 2023, ARS Pharma announced that results from the single and repeat dose clinical study of neffy were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. The clinical study evaluated single and repeat doses of neffy compared to single and repeat doses of approved injection products in healthy subjects. In November 2023, the results from the self-administration clinical study of neffy were also published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $228.4 million as of December 31, 2023, which ARS Pharma believes is sufficient to fund its current operating plan for at least three years.R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $3.4 million and $20.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Total research and development expenses in 2023 increased from $18.4 million in 2022 primarily due to higher payroll costs and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in license milestone expenses.G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $6.8 million and $47.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. Total general and administrative expenses in 2023 increased from $18.5 million in 2022 primarily due to an increase in pre-commercial launch activities, payroll costs, consulting and stock-based compensation expenses.Net Loss: Net loss was $7.2 million and $54.4 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively. About Type I Allergic Reactions including Anaphylaxis Type I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions. Of those, only 3.2 million have an active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency. About UrticariaUrticaria is a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedema with an annualized incidence of 5 million in the US, with about 40% becoming chronic urticaria; 50% of chronic urticaria cases are non-responsive to first-line antihistamine therapy. These non-responsive patients on stable therapy regimens can experience exacerbations or flares several times a year among acute cases, and even several times a week, including up to three or four emergency room visits per year, among chronic urticaria cases. Angioedema is also a co-occurring symptom in about 33 to 67% of these patients. There are currently no approved community use treatments for acute flares experienced by urticaria patients on chronic regimens of antihistamines. neffy may provide episodic symptomatic relief of these acute flares or exacerbations to improve the quality of life of urticaria patients. Patients would have the option to quickly resolve exacerbations or flares at home without escalating to chronic use of systemic biologics that may have more serious side effects and benefit-risk considerations or visiting the emergency room for further treatment. About ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.ARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is developing neffy® (also referred to as ARS-1), an intranasal epinephrine product in clinical development for patients and their caregivers with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Words such as “anticipate,” “believes,” “expects,” “plans,” “potential,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based upon ARS Pharma’s current expectations and involve assumptions that may never materialize or may prove to be incorrect. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks and uncertainties, which include, without limitation, the ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for neffy; even though the FDA has stated that completion of the repeat-dose study under allergen-induced allergic rhinitis conditions for neffy will sufficiently address the agency’s outstanding questions, there is no guarantee that new issues will not be identified which could delay or prevent the approval of neffy; whether the FDA will view the results from ARS Pharma’s repeat dose study under allergen induced allergic rhinitis conditions for neffy as successful and sufficient to support approval; the PDUFA target action date may be further delayed due to various factors outside ARS Pharma’s control; results from clinical trials may not be indicative of results that may be observed in the future; potential safety and other complications from neffy; the labelling for neffy, if approved; the scope, progress and expansion of developing and commercializing neffy; the size and growth of the market therefor and the rate and degree of market acceptance thereof vis-à-vis intramuscular injectable products; ARS Pharma’s ability to protect its intellectual property position; uncertainties related to capital requirements; and the impact of government laws and regulations. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption “Risk Factors” in ARS Pharma’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on November 9, 2023, and in ARS Pharma’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, being filed with the SEC later today. This and other documents ARS Pharma files with the SEC can also be accessed on ARS Pharma’s website at ir.ars-pharma.com by clicking on the link “Financials & Filings” under the “Investors & Media” tab.

Negative Net loss of $44.24 million for the full year 2023, equating to a net loss of $0.62 per share. Reduction in cash burn from $71 million in 2022 to $42 million in 2023, indicating high expenses. Sales, marketing, general, and administrative expenses for the full year 2023 were $30.38 million. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $10.68 million, with a net loss of $0.15 per share. Financial Analyst Hyperfine, Inc.'s announcement of its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 shows a company experiencing robust growth, with revenues increasing by 89% and 62% respectively. The sale of 37 commercial Swoop® systems in 2023 indicates a solid product uptake, which is a positive sign for the company's market penetration. However, the continued net losses, although reduced from the previous year, highlight that the company is still in a growth phase and has not yet achieved profitability. The reduction in cash burn from $71 million to $42 million is a significant improvement, showcasing better financial discipline. The extended cash runway into early 2026 gives Hyperfine a cushion to continue its operations and growth strategies without immediate need for additional capital.The gross margin increase is indicative of improved cost management or pricing strategies, but it's important to monitor whether this trend can be sustained as they scale up. The guidance for 2024 suggests a conservative revenue increase, which might reflect a realistic approach by management considering the current economic climate. Investors should consider the potential of Hyperfine's technology in the healthcare sector against the backdrop of its current financial health and future prospects. Medical Technology Market Analyst The strategic focus on expanding use cases for the Swoop® system, particularly in critical care and pediatrics, demonstrates Hyperfine's commitment to penetrating niche markets that could benefit from portable MR imaging. The initiation of clinical studies, such as the ACTION PMR for stroke and a utility study for Alzheimer's disease, indicates a forward-thinking approach to validate and expand the clinical applications of their technology. The FDA clearances and CE certifications for their AI-powered software upgrades signify a competitive edge in innovation and regulatory compliance, which could enhance their marketability in both the US and European markets.However, the high R&D and SG&A expenses, despite a decrease from the previous year, show the company's significant investment in its growth initiatives. The market for portable MR imaging is still emerging and Hyperfine's success will depend on the clinical adoption and evidence supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of their technology. The company's efforts in low- and middle-income countries, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, could open up new markets and opportunities for growth, but the financial returns on these investments may take time to materialize. Healthcare Industry Analyst Hyperfine's business update underscores the importance of clinical evidence in driving technology adoption in healthcare. The completion of enrollment in the HOPE PMR study and the various clinical evidence milestones reached are critical in establishing the Swoop® system's credibility among healthcare providers. The company's strategic pillars for 2024, including a focus on Alzheimer's disease, align with current healthcare trends emphasizing early diagnosis and intervention. The reorganization and establishment of a seasoned executive team could streamline operations and enhance decision-making processes.However, the healthcare industry is known for its long sales cycles and stringent regulatory requirements, which could affect Hyperfine's speed of growth and market expansion. The collaboration with flagship institutions and the stroke advisory board could be instrumental in gaining thought leadership and credibility, but the tangible impact on sales and clinical adoption needs to be closely monitored. The financial guidance for 2024, with expected revenue of $12 to $15 million, seems conservative and may reflect the challenges of market penetration in a competitive and regulated environment. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM GUILFORD, Conn., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hyperfine, Inc.

About Hyperfine, Inc. and the Swoop® Portable MR Imaging® System Hyperfine, Inc. (Nasdaq: HYPR) is the groundbreaking health technology company that has redefined brain imaging with the Swoop® system—the first FDA-cleared, portable, ultra-low-field, magnetic resonance brain imaging system capable of providing imaging at multiple points of care. The Swoop® system received initial U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2020 as a portable magnetic resonance brain imaging device for producing images that display the internal structure of the head where a full diagnostic examination is not clinically practical. When interpreted by a trained physician, these images provide information that can be useful in determining a diagnosis. The Swoop® system has been approved for brain imaging in several countries, including Canada and Australia, has UKCA certification in the United Kingdom, CE certification in the European Union, and is also available in New Zealand. The mission of Hyperfine, Inc. is to revolutionize patient care globally through transformational, accessible, clinically relevant diagnostic imaging and data solutions. Founded by Dr. Jonathan Rothberg in a technology-based incubator called 4Catalyzer, Hyperfine, Inc. scientists, engineers, and physicists developed the Swoop® system out of a passion for redefining brain imaging methodology and how clinicians can apply accessible diagnostic imaging to patient care. Traditionally, access to costly, stationary, conventional MRI technology can be inconvenient or not available when needed most. With the portable, ultra-low-field Swoop® system, Hyperfine, Inc. is redefining the neuroimaging workflow by bringing brain imaging to the patient’s bedside. For more information, visit hyperfine.io.

(ANRO) reported positive Phase 2a results for ALTO-100 and ALTO-300, highlighting response prediction using their Precision Psychiatry Platform™. The company is on track with patient enrollment for Phase 2b MDD studies. They successfully completed an oversubscribed IPO, with a cash position of $210 million as of February 29, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The financial results and corporate progress reported by Alto Neuroscience are indicative of a company positioning itself for significant growth within the neuropsychiatric treatment market. With a cash position of approximately $210 million as of February 29, 2024, following an oversubscribed initial public offering (IPO), the company appears to have a solid runway to support its operations into 2027. This is a substantial buffer that can underpin ongoing Phase 2b studies for ALTO-100 and ALTO-300, as well as other pipeline developments, without immediate concern for additional capital raising.Investors should note the increase in research and development (R&D) expenses, which grew from $23.7 million in 2022 to $30.3 million in 2023. This uptick reflects the company's investment in clinical trials, a critical step in bringing their products to market. However, the resulting net loss of $36.3 million for 2023, up from $27.7 million in 2022, underscores the high costs associated with pharmaceutical development and the inherent risks for investors during the pre-revenue stage of a biotech company. Medical Research Analyst Alto Neuroscience's focus on developing treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) using biomarker-based approaches represents a cutting-edge shift towards precision psychiatry. The positive Phase 2a results for ALTO-100 and ALTO-300, which are linked to specific cognitive and EEG biomarkers, could pave the way for more targeted and effective treatments for MDD. This strategy may enhance the clinical success rate and reduce the trial-and-error approach commonly associated with psychiatric medication prescription.Moreover, the development of ALTO-101, a PDE4 inhibitor for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (CIAS) and ALTO-203, a histamine H3 inverse agonist for MDD with anhedonia, highlights the company's commitment to addressing unmet needs in mental health. The industry should pay attention to the novel transdermal formulation of ALTO-101, which could mitigate the significant adverse events typically associated with PDE4 inhibitors, potentially offering a more tolerable treatment option for patients. Pharmacoeconomic Expert Alto Neuroscience's pipeline, including ALTO-202, an NMDAr antagonist for depression, reflects a strategic effort to diversify within the neuropsychiatric space. This diversification is critical from a pharmacoeconomic perspective, as it may reduce the risk profile of the company's portfolio and increase the likelihood of a successful product reaching the market.Additionally, the $15 million grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) for a proposed Phase 2b study of ALTO-100 in patients with bipolar depression not only provides non-dilutive funding but also validates the therapeutic potential of Alto's approach. The grant's impact on reducing overall R&D costs cannot be overstated, as it allows the company to allocate resources more efficiently across its development pipeline.From a cost-effectiveness standpoint, targeting biomarker-characterized patients could lead to more successful outcomes, reducing the long-term healthcare burden associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This precision approach could be particularly cost-saving for healthcare systems if it leads to a reduction in the trial-and-error prescribing patterns that currently dominate the field. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM – Reported positive results from ALTO-100 and ALTO-300 Phase 2a studies demonstrating prospective replication of response prediction using Alto’s Precision Psychiatry Platform™ – – Patient enrollment on track across Phase 2b MDD studies for two lead product candidates – – Successful completion of oversubscribed initial public offering; cash position of approximately $210 million as of February 29, 2024 – LOS ALTOS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alto Neuroscience, Inc. (“Alto”) (NYSE: ANRO) today reported financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023, and highlighted recent corporate progress. “2024 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Alto as we advance our mission of redefining the treatment paradigm for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders,” said Amit Etkin, M.D., Ph.D., founder and CEO of Alto Neuroscience. “Our lead product candidates, ALTO-100 and ALTO-300, have demonstrated positive Phase 2a results and we remain focused on clinical execution to deliver value to patients and our shareholders. Looking ahead, we are on track to report data from the Phase 2b depression studies of ALTO-100 and ALTO-300 in the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025, respectively, in biomarker characterized patients.” Nick Smith, CFO of Alto Neuroscience, added, “As we begin 2024, Alto is in its strongest financial position to date. With the proceeds from our IPO, combined with our existing cash balance, we are well-positioned to read out data from at least four important studies across our clinical-stage pipeline over the next two years.” Full Year 2023 and Recent Business Highlights ALTO-100: Ongoing Phase 2b Study in MDD ALTO-100, a first-in-class, oral small molecule believed to work through enhancing neural plasticity, is in development in Phase 2b for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). In January 2023, Alto reported positive results from a Phase 2a study in which patients with MDD and a cognitive biomarker signature were identified as more responsive to ALTO-100. This signal was prospectively replicated to predict clinical response in an independent, locked, and blinded data set of patients from the same study. Alto is currently evaluating ALTO-100 in a 266-patient Phase 2b study in MDD patients characterized by the cognitive biomarker. The study is evaluating ALTO-100 compared to placebo over a 6-week double blind treatment period. The primary endpoint is the change from baseline on the standard regulatory clinical endpoint in depression, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Enrollment is ongoing and the Company expects to report topline data in the second half of 2024. ALTO-300: Ongoing Phase 2b Study in MDD ALTO-300 (agomelatine), an oral small molecule that is believed to act as a melatonin agonist and 5HT2C antagonist, is being developed as a new treatment for patients with MDD as an adjunctive treatment to a standard antidepressant. ALTO-300 has demonstrated positive results in Phase 2a in patients with MDD in which patients with an EEG biomarker signature were discovered to have more robust response to ALTO-300 compared to those without the biomarker signature. The biomarker signature was prospectively replicated to predict clinical response in an independent, locked, and blinded data set. The Company initiated a Phase 2b study in 200 patients with MDD. In the Phase 2b study ALTO-300 will be evaluated compared to placebo over a 6-week treatment period, and the primary outcome will be the change from baseline in MADRS score. Enrollment is ongoing and the Company expects to report topline data in the first half of 2025. ALTO-101: PDE4 Inhibitor in Development for Cognitive Impairment in Schizophrenia (CIAS) ALTO-101 is a novel PDE4 inhibitor currently in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of CIAS. In December 2023, the Company reported positive results from a Phase 1 study in which ALTO-101 was shown to positively impact key brain pharmacodynamic markers relevant to cognition that are indicative of potential clinical benefit. PDE4 inhibitors have demonstrated, as a class, a propensity to induce significant adverse events, historically limiting their development in CNS disorders. Alto is developing ALTO-101 as a novel transdermal formulation in partnership with MedRx Co., Ltd. to potentially enhance the pharmacokinetic profile and improve the overall tolerability profile relative to other PDE4 inhibitors. The Company expects to report data from a Phase 1 study evaluating the PK properties of the transdermal formulation in the first half of 2024, and subsequently initiate a proof-of-concept study in patients with CIAS. ALTO-203: Histamine H3 Inverse Agonist in Development for MDD with Anhedonia ALTO-203 is a novel, oral small molecule that uniquely acts as a histamine H3 inverse agonist, a histamine receptor primarily expressed in the brain. The Company is developing ALTO-203 as a novel treatment for patients with MDD and increased levels of anhedonia given the demonstrated effects of ALTO-203 on subjective affective clinical measures. ALTO-203 was previously studied in a Phase 1 study and demonstrated significant acute benefits on a scale of subjective positive emotion, compared to placebo. The magnitude of this effect was shown to be equivalent to, or better than modafinil, an active comparator with demonstrated antidepressant activity in clinical trials. In January 2024, Alto received IND clearance for ALTO-203 and expects to initiate a proof-of-concept study in the first half of 2024 in patients with MDD and increased levels of anhedonia. ALTO-202: NMDAr Antagonist in Development for Depression ALTO-202 is a novel, oral small molecule believed to specifically target the GluN2b subunit of NMDA receptors, acting as a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. Alto plans to develop ALTO-202 for patients with depression. Recent Business Highlights Maha Radhakrishnan, M.D., former Group SVP and Chief Medical Officer at Biogen, was appointed to the Company's board of directors in March 2024. Husseini Manji, M.D., Ph.D., former Global Therapeutic Head for Neuroscience at Johnson & Johnson, was appointed to the Company’s board of directors in February 2024. The Company successfully completed its upsized initial public offering in February 2024, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $133 million. In January 2024 the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) voted to approve a $15 million grant to Alto in support of a proposed Phase 2b study of ALTO-100 in patients with bipolar depression. The Company is evaluating the terms and conditions of the grant and, if accepted, the Company plans to initiate the Phase 2b study in 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst TELA Bio's recent financial report highlights a significant year-over-year growth, with the fourth quarter showing a 46% increase in revenue and the full year boasting a 41% increase compared to 2022. This consistent growth trajectory, marked by 12 quarters and three consecutive years of at least 35% growth, is indicative of strong market demand and effective execution of business strategies. The revenue growth is particularly notable for OviTex® and OviTex PRS products, which have seen an increase in demand leading to revenue increases of 36% and 51%, respectively.The strategic decision to sell distribution rights of the NIVIS® product for a cash consideration of $8 to $12 million to MiMedx Group is a savvy financial move. This influx of non-dilutive capital strengthens TELA Bio's cash position without the need to raise funds through equity that could potentially dilute existing shareholders' value. Furthermore, the provided revenue guidance for the full year 2024 forecasts continued growth, albeit at a slightly slower pace of 27% to 30%. This guidance is an important indicator for investors, as it sets expectations for the company's performance in the coming year. Medical Device Market Analyst The full U.S. commercial launch of LIQUIFIX FIX8™ Laparoscopic and LIQUIFIX Precision™ Open Hernia Mesh Fixation Devices represents a significant milestone for TELA Bio. As the only FDA-Approved liquid adhesive for internal use in hernia surgeries, these products have the potential to disrupt the hernia repair market. The novel, atraumatic approach of LIQUIFIX devices could lead to increased adoption and preference among surgeons, especially given the trend towards minimally invasive procedures.Additionally, the upcoming Q2 2024 launch of the OviTex IHR Reinforced Tissue Matrix is strategically timed to capture a segment of the inguinal hernia repair market, which is a common surgical procedure. The emphasis on robotic and laparoscopic utility aligns with industry trends towards such advanced surgical techniques. TELA Bio's focus on product innovation and market penetration is likely to bolster its competitive position and drive future revenue growth, which is important for maintaining investor interest and confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Healthcare Industry Analyst The strategic moves by TELA Bio, including the recalibration of its sales force and the sale of its NIVIS® product distribution rights, demonstrate a proactive approach to capitalizing on market opportunities and optimizing resource allocation. The increased sales productivity and improved mix across the product portfolio suggest that the company is not only growing but also refining its go-to-market strategies to enhance profitability.Investors should note that the healthcare and medical device industry can be heavily influenced by regulatory changes, reimbursement policies and competitive dynamics. TELA Bio's ability to secure FDA approval for its products and to innovate in the soft-tissue reconstruction space is a testament to its commitment to compliance and technological advancement. However, it is essential to monitor how the company navigates these regulatory landscapes and responds to competitive pressures, as these factors can have a significant impact on the company's performance and stock valuation. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM MALVERN, Pa., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TELA Bio, Inc.

Gross profit was $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, or 68% of revenue, compared to $8.2 million, or 70% of revenue, in the same period in 2022. The slight decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in our excess and obsolete inventory adjustments. Operating expenses were $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $17.6 million in the same period in 2022. The increase was due to higher compensation costs and employee-related expenses from additional headcount as we continue to expand our organization, as well as increased travel, consulting and professional fees.

Gross profit was $40.1 million in the full year 2023, or 69% of revenue, compared to $27.0 million, or 65% of revenue, in 2022. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved inventory management processes and lower amortization of intangible assets. Operating expenses were $84.2 million in the full year of 2023, compared to $66.1 million in 2022. The increase was due to higher compensation costs and employee-related expenses from additional headcount as we continue to expand our organization, as well as increased travel, consulting and professional fees.

Positive Revenue for Q4 2023 was $49.5 million, full-year 2023 revenue reached $212.4 million Cash and marketable securities were $143.6 million as of December 31, 2023 Successful completion of corporate restructuring program for improved cost structure and organizational alignment North American commercial release of enhanced AviClear product during Q4 2023 Gross profit for Q4 2023 was $6.2 million, non-GAAP gross profit was $9.9 million Operating expenses for Q4 2023 were $50.6 million Revenue related to capital equipment systems declined 32% in Q4 2023 Full-year 2023 revenue decreased by 16% compared to 2022 2024 outlook projects annual revenue in the range of $160 million to $170 million Conference call scheduled to discuss financial results and related matters Negative Revenue declines in Q4 and full-year 2023 compared to previous periods Gross profit decrease in Q4 2023 compared to Q4 2022 Non-GAAP operating income loss in Q4 2023 Cash and marketable securities decreased from 2022 to 2023 Operating expenses increased in full-year 2023 compared to the prior year Market Research Analyst The reported financial results for Cutera, Inc. reflect a significant revenue decline of 26% for the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year compared to the previous year. This downturn is primarily attributed to a decrease in capital equipment systems sales, which plummeted by 32% and a lesser yet notable decline in recurring revenue streams, which fell by 16%. These figures are concerning as they may indicate a shrinking demand for Cutera's products or potential saturation in the aesthetic and dermatology market segments.The company's gross profit margins have also taken a substantial hit, dropping from over 55% to approximately 28% for the full year. This reduction in profitability could be due to several factors such as increased production costs, pricing pressures, or inventory write-downs. The latter is evidenced by the reported non-cash expense related to excess and obsolete inventory, which negatively impacted gross profit by approximately $8.4 million, or 16.9% of revenue, for the fourth quarter.Investors should note the company's operational restructuring, which, while potentially beneficial in the long run, has likely contributed to short-term financial stress. The restructuring includes a reduction in workforce, bringing manufacturing operations in-house and transitioning the Skincare business. These changes could result in cost savings and improved operational efficiency in future periods. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, Cutera's cash and marketable securities position decreased notably from $317.3 million at the end of 2022 to $143.6 million at the end of 2023. This reduction in liquidity could raise concerns about the company's cash burn rate and its ability to sustain operations without additional financing, especially in light of the projected revenue decline for 2024.The company forecasts a further decrease in annual revenue for 2024, with expectations ranging from $160 million to $170 million. This outlook suggests that management anticipates continued challenges in the market or within the company's operational framework. The projected ending cash and marketable securities for 2024 between $55 million to $60 million may also indicate significant cash usage, which could be a red flag for investors regarding the company's financial stability.Despite these challenges, the limited commercial release of the enhanced AviClear product could represent a potential growth opportunity. However, with only $3.9 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, it remains to be seen whether this product can significantly contribute to a turnaround in the company's financial performance. Medical Device Industry Analyst The financial results for Cutera, Inc. suggest potential strategic misalignments or market pressures within the medical aesthetics industry. The substantial decline in capital equipment sales could be indicative of increased competition or a shift in consumer preferences towards non-invasive procedures that do not require costly equipment. Additionally, the decline in recurring revenue streams might hint at a saturation of after-sales service contracts or consumables, which are typically stable revenue sources for medical device companies.The restructuring efforts, including the in-house transition of critical manufacturing operations, may be an attempt to regain control over production costs and improve profit margins. However, such transitions can be complex and may not yield immediate financial benefits. The decrease in gross profit margin is particularly stark and suggests that the company's cost of goods sold has risen or that it has had to offer substantial discounts to maintain sales volumes.With the medical device industry being highly regulated and competitive, Cutera's ability to navigate these challenges while investing in innovation, such as the AviClear product, will be important to its long-term success. Stakeholders should closely monitor the company's strategic initiatives and market response to new product offerings. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM BRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cutera, Inc.

Non-GAAP adjustments include depreciation and amortization including contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) implementation costs, certain legal and litigation costs, executive and other non-recurring severance costs, retention plan costs, expenses related to manufacturing agreement termination, and Board of Director legal and advisory fees. From time to time in the future, there may be other items that the Company may exclude if the Company believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management. The Company has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure used in this earnings release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The Company defines non-GAAP financial measure, also commonly known as adjusted EBITDA, as operating income before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, ERP implementation costs, costs related to certain litigation, executive and non-recurring severance costs, retention plan costs, expenses related to manufacturing agreement termination, and legal and advisory fees related to litigation and shareholder activism. Company management uses non-GAAP measures as aids in monitoring the Company’s ongoing financial performance from quarter to quarter, and year to year, and for benchmarking against other similar companies. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, the operating performance measure as prescribed by GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures for the statement of operations and net income per share exclude the following: Depreciation and amortization, including contract acquisition costs. The Company has excluded depreciation and amortization expense in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges to current operations; Stock-based compensation. The Company has excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and net income measures. Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to the Company's employees, the Company continues to evaluate its business performance excluding stock-based compensation expenses. The Company records stock-based compensation expenses related to grants of options, employee stock purchase plans, and performance and restricted stock. Depending upon the size, timing, and terms of the grants, this expense may vary significantly but will recur in future periods. The Company believes that excluding stock-based compensation better allows for comparisons to its peer companies; ERP implementation costs. The Company has excluded ERP system costs related to direct and incremental costs incurred in connection with its multi-phase implementation of a new ERP solution and the related technology infrastructure costs. The Company excludes these costs because it believes that these items do not reflect future operating expenses and will be inconsistent in amounts and frequency making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s operating performance; Certain legal and litigation costs. The Company has excluded costs incurred related to its litigation against Lutronic Aesthetics, which is not part of the Company’s ordinary course of business. The Company’s complaint against Lutronic alleges misappropriation of trade secrets, violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), interference with contractual relations and other claims. The Company excludes these costs because this litigation is a result of a discrete event that was not part of the Company’s business strategy, but has a significant effect on the results of operations. Its costs are incidental to and do not reflect the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Company’s core operations; Executive and other non-recurring severance costs. The Company has excluded costs associated with restructuring activities and the separation of its officers and other executives in calculating its non-GAAP operating expenses and non-GAAP Operating Income. The Company has excluded restructuring costs because a restructuring represents a discrete event that signifies a change in the Company’s strategy, but its costs are not indicative of the ongoing financial performance of the business. The Company excludes executive separation costs because executive separations are unpredictable and not part of the Company’s business strategy but could have a significant impact on the results of operation; Retention plan costs. The Company has excluded the expense related to a retention plan implemented in April 2023. Approximately $11 million was made available to sales personnel and key employees and will be paid in quarterly installments through October 2024. The Company has excluded expense related to this retention plan as such costs are not considered part of ongoing operations; Expenses related to manufacturing agreement termination. The Company has excluded expenses related to a manufacturing agreement termination incurred as part of a settlement agreement related to the non-renewal of a manufacturing service agreement with Jabil Inc., a third-party manufacturing provider that manufactured excel V+ and AviClear devices for the Company. The Company excluded these costs because it believes that these items do not reflect future operating expenses and will be inconsistent in amounts and frequency making it difficult to contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the Company’s operating performance; and Board of Director legal and advisory fees. The Company has excluded costs associated with the litigation and shareholder activism related to its 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. The Company excluded these costs as the costs do not relate to ongoing operations. The Company believes that excluding all of the items above allows users of its financial statements to better review and assess both current and historical results of operations.

(Nasdaq: FVCB) extends its share repurchase program, allowing for the buyback of up to 1,300,000 shares of common stock by March 31, 2025. The Company repurchased 115,750 shares in 2023. Repurchases may be made through various methods and are subject to market conditions and legal considerations. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The extension of FVCBankcorp, Inc.'s share repurchase program may signal a confident outlook by the company's management regarding its financial stability and future performance. By repurchasing up to 7% of its outstanding shares, the company is effectively reducing the number of shares available in the market, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS) and potentially enhance shareholder value. However, this strategy may also indicate that the company views its stock as undervalued or that it lacks more profitable reinvestment opportunities.Investors should consider the impact of such buybacks on the company's capital structure. While a reduced share count can improve financial ratios, it also uses up cash reserves that could be allocated towards growth initiatives or debt reduction. Moreover, the discretionary nature of the program and its dependency on market conditions suggest that buybacks are not guaranteed and will be conducted opportunistically. Market Research Analyst Share repurchase programs are often interpreted by the market as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable reaction in the stock's price. It's important to monitor the actual execution of the repurchase plan, as the quantity of shares bought back and the timing can provide insights into management's confidence in the company's valuation and market conditions. Additionally, the program's extension until 2025 offers a prolonged period during which the stock may be supported by these buyback activities.However, investors should also be aware of the broader economic context. In a market where interest rates are rising, the opportunity cost of deploying cash for share repurchases could be higher. It's critical to analyze the company's financial health, including its cash flow generation capability and debt levels, to assess whether the share repurchase program is a prudent use of capital in the current economic environment. Legal Expert The adherence to SEC Rule 10b-18 and the potential adoption of a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan are important legal considerations in the execution of the repurchase program. Rule 10b-18 provides a safe harbor for companies, allowing them to repurchase their own stock without being considered as manipulating the market, as long as certain conditions are met. The use of a 10b5-1 plan can also protect the company from accusations of insider trading, as it allows buybacks to occur according to a predetermined plan, even if the company possesses material non-public information.Investors should recognize that while these regulations provide a framework for legal repurchases, they also impose limitations on the volume and timing of the transactions. This could affect the pace at which the repurchases are made and ultimately the program's impact on the market. The fact that shares will be cancelled and revert to authorized but unissued status is a standard procedure that reduces the share count without affecting the company's authorized capital structure. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM FAIRFAX, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- FVCBankcorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: FVCB) (the “Company”) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended its share repurchase program that was initiated in 2020. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 1,300,000 shares of its common stock, or approximately 7% of its outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2023. The repurchase program will expire on March 31, 2025, subject to earlier termination of the program by the Board of Directors. During 2023, the Company repurchased 115,750 shares of its common stock during open trading window periods. Repurchases may be made in open market purchases, block trades or in privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases, if any, under the program will be made at the discretion of management, and will depend upon market pricing and conditions, business, legal, accounting and other considerations. Open market purchases will be conducted in accordance with the limitation of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Repurchases may be made pursuant to any trading plan that may be adopted in accordance with SEC Rule 10b5-1, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. Under applicable law, repurchased shares will be cancelled and revert to the status of authorized but unissued shares. The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time without notice, in the Company’s discretion, based upon a number of factors, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, the need for capital in the Company’s operations and other factors deemed appropriate. These factors may also affect the timing and amount of share repurchases. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares. About FVCBankcorp Inc.

(ASXC) reported its operating and financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, showcasing growth in surgical procedures and revenue. The company completed evaluations of its LUNA Surgical System and saw an increase in Senhance Surgical System usage globally. With a revenue of $8.6 million for 2023 and cash reserves of $21.1 million, Asensus Surgical aims for significant milestones in 2024. Positive Completed in vivo evaluation of the LUNA Surgical System by nine independent surgeons through thirteen procedures Over 3,550 surgical procedures performed globally using the Senhance Surgical System, a growth of over 13% compared to 2022 8 Senhance Surgical Programs initiated in 2023, aligning with guidance Full year 2023 revenue of $8.6 million Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $21.1 million at December 31, 2023 Over 835 surgical procedures performed globally using the Senhance Surgical System in Q4 Five Senhance Surgical Programs initiated in Q4 Fourth quarter unaudited revenue of $5.4 million Negative None. Medical Technology Analyst The performance of Asensus Surgical in 2023, particularly the growth in procedures using the Senhance Surgical System, indicates a positive trajectory in the adoption of their technology. A 13% increase in surgical procedures year-over-year suggests that the system is gaining traction within the medical community. The initiation of eight new Senhance Surgical Programs aligns with the company's guidance, reflecting a strategic consistency in their expansion efforts.Furthermore, the financial results, with a full-year revenue of $8.6 million and a cash reserve of approximately $21.1 million, provide a snapshot of the company's fiscal health. These figures are essential for stakeholders in assessing the company's ability to fund ongoing operations and invest in future growth opportunities. The financial stability, inferred from the cash reserves, may also offer the company some buffer against market fluctuations and investment in R&D. Healthcare Industry Analyst Asensus Surgical's focus on digitizing the interface between surgeon and patient through the Senhance Surgical System is indicative of broader industry trends towards digitalization and automation in healthcare. The in vivo evaluation of the LUNA Surgical System by independent surgeons is a critical step towards regulatory approval and commercialization. This indicates the company's commitment to innovation and could be a significant driver for future growth, pending regulatory outcomes.Moreover, the international expansion with new programs across Germany, Romania, the CIS region and Japan suggests that Asensus Surgical is strategically positioning itself in diverse markets. This geographic diversification can potentially mitigate risks associated with market-specific regulatory hurdles or economic downturns. The fourth quarter revenue spike is also noteworthy, as it may signal an accelerating adoption rate or successful entry into new markets. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the unaudited fourth quarter revenue of $5.4 million deserves attention. It represents a significant portion of the annual revenue and could imply a strong finish to the year, possibly due to strategic sales initiatives or an increase in market demand for their products. Investors should monitor subsequent quarters to see if this uptrend is sustainable and indicative of a solid growth pattern.It's also important to consider the company's cash position in relation to its burn rate and future investment needs. The $21.1 million in cash and equivalents provides a cushion, but for a med-tech company heavily investing in R&D and regulatory approvals, this runway might be shorter than it appears. A detailed analysis of the company's cash flow projections and anticipated capital requirements would be prudent for a comprehensive understanding of its financial stability. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asensus Surgical, Inc. (NYSE American: ASXC), a medical device company that is digitizing the interface between the surgeon and the patient, announced its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. Full Year Highlights Completed in vivo evaluation of the LUNA™ Surgical System by nine independent surgeons through thirteen procedures across gynecology, urology, and general surgeryOver 3,550 surgical procedures were performed globally using the Senhance Surgical System, representing growth of over 13% compared to 2022In 2023, 8 Senhance Surgical Programs were initiated, which is in line with guidance of 8-10 systemsFull year 2023 revenue of $8.6 millionThe Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding restricted cash, of approximately $21.1 million at December 31, 2023 Fourth Quarter Highlights Over 835 surgical procedures were performed globally using the Senhance® Surgical SystemFive Senhance Surgical Programs were initiated, including one in Germany, one in Romania, two in the CIS region and one in JapanFourth quarter unaudited revenue of $5.4 million ""Reflecting on our progress in 2023, I'm pleased with the solid groundwork we continue to lay for the future,” said Anthony Fernando, Asensus Surgical President and CEO. “As we look at 2024, there's a sense of optimism as we aim to hit significant milestones in the coming quarters. Our main focus right now is on the thorough testing and evaluation phase of the LUNA Surgical System, as we prepare for regulatory submissions. Additionally, I'm particularly excited about the progress we're making in pediatric applications, highlighting our commitment to advancing surgical technology for all patients through the unique features of the Senhance System.” 2024 Milestones For the full year 2024, the Company expects: To initiate 8 - 10 new Senhance programs.Procedure volume growth of 15% to 20% over 2023.Freezing the system's design for the LUNA Surgical SystemVerification and validation testing, and pilot manufacturing for the LUNA Surgical System Market Development 2023 Senhance Program InitiationsDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company initiated five new Senhance Surgical System placements, one in Germany, one in Romania, two in the CIS region and one in Japan at Nagoya University Hospital. In 2023, the Company initiated eight new Senhance Surgical System placements: one in the United States, one in Germany, three in Japan, one in Romania, and two in the CIS region. Procedure VolumesIn 2023, surgeons performed over 3,550 procedures utilizing the Senhance System, representing a 13% increase over the previous year. These procedures included general surgery, gynecology, urology, colorectal, pediatric, and bariatric surgical cases. Pediatric UpdateIn 2023, the Company made notable progress in improving pediatric care. A key milestone was the FDA's clearance for use of the Senhance System in pediatric cases, marking it as the first approved digital laparoscopic surgery solution for pediatric patients in the U.S. This clearance, alongside existing approvals in the EU and Japan, highlights the Senhance System's unique features, including 3mm instrumentation, a 5mm camera scope, haptic feedback, and advanced clinical intelligence from the Intelligent Surgical Unit™(ISU™). These features work together to contribute to a less invasive approach in pediatric robotic surgery. In addition to regulatory milestones, the Company has introduced four Senhance System programs dedicated to pediatric departments in the U.S. and internationally. Clinical Registry (TRUST)The Company continues to leverage its growing body of real-world clinical data through the utilization of its TRUST™ clinical registry. The Company believes TRUST is the largest multi-specialty robotic-assisted laparoscopic registry in the industry, with approximately 3,200 patients enrolled to date, a 45% increase from 2022. Clinical ValidationDuring the year, there were nine peer-reviewed clinical papers published providing further support for the clinical utility of the Senhance System across a variety of surgical specialties. These papers, along with a library of similar papers, can be found on the Company’s website: https://www.asensus.com/resources/clinical-publications. LUNA™ Surgical Robotic System LUNA DevelopmentThe LUNA Surgical System's development is in progress and is now in the testing and evaluation phase before regulatory submissions. In December 2023, the Company hosted a Surgeon Lab in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, to conduct an in vivo evaluation of LUNA’s hardware, software, and instruments in porcine models. The lab allowed nine participating surgeons to evaluate the LUNA system's functionality through thirteen procedures across gynecology, urology, and general surgery. For a closer look at the Surgeon Lab and insights from the participating surgeons, a video is available at https://ir.asensus.com/events-and-presentations. The video provides an overview of the LUNA system's features, demonstrating its range of motion, instrument strength, and ergonomic benefits. Future milestones include freezing the system's design in the second half of 2024, followed by verification and validation testing, and pilot manufacturing. The Company is confident in the regulatory pathway for the LUNA System. Ongoing communication with the FDA, along with strong in-house regulatory expertise and past successful submissions for the Senhance System, lead the Company to anticipate using a traditional 510(k) submission pathway in the U.S., rather than the more complex de novo pathway. This streamlined approach is expected to apply globally, offering a quicker market entry compared to new entrants. LUNA is currently under development and has not been submitted to, or cleared by, the U.S. FDA or other global regulators, and is not available for sale in any market. Agreement with Flex for LUNA Surgical System Design and Advanced Manufacturing ServicesIn November, the Company announced an agreement with Flex for design and manufacturing support for the LUNA Surgical System. This collaboration aims to facilitate the efficient market entry of LUNA by leveraging Flex's expertise in electromechanical systems. The agreement underscores a joint commitment to advancing surgical technology for improved patient care.

Contingent consideration is measured at fair value using a Monte-Carlo simulation utilizing significant unobservable inputs including the probability of achieving each of the potential milestones, revenue volatility, EURO to USD exchange rate, and an estimated discount rate associated with the risks of the expected cash flows attributable to the various milestones. Significant increases or decreases in any of the probabilities of success or changes in expected timelines for achievement of any of these milestones would result in a significantly higher or lower fair value of these milestones, respectively, and commensurate changes to the associated liability. The contingent consideration is revalued at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. c) Property and equipment impairment associated with Senhance Systems under operating leases that are not expected to generate future cash flows sufficient to recover their net book value. d) During 2023, the Company recorded warrant liabilities related to common stock warrants issued in the registered direct offering in July 2023. Warrant liabilities were recorded at their initial estimated fair value. Adjustments associated with changes in fair value of the warrant liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

Biotechnology Analyst The report from Cibus, Inc. regarding the successful transfer of gene-edited germplasm and collaboration with major seed companies such as Bayer and Nutrien Ltd's subsidiary, Loveland Products, indicates a significant stride in agricultural biotechnology. The partnerships with these industry giants not only validate Cibus' gene editing technology but also suggest potential market penetration and revenue growth opportunities. Furthermore, the positive vote in the EU Parliament for new genomic techniques could catalyze the adoption of gene editing technologies in European markets, potentially expanding Cibus' operational landscape.The opening of the high-throughput gene editing production facility marks a milestone for Cibus, indicating an increase in production capabilities, which is essential for meeting commercial demand. This expansion could lead to economies of scale and contribute to a more competitive cost structure for the company's products. However, investors should monitor the company's expenditure on this facility to ensure it aligns with projected revenue growth. Agricultural Economist The advancements in productivity traits such as Pod Shatter Reduction and Herbicide Tolerance by Cibus are poised to address critical agricultural challenges like crop yield and resistance to herbicides. The direct benefit to farmers can translate into increased adoption rates, which in turn could drive demand for Cibus' seeds. The successful field trials and the development of Sclerotinia resistance traits are particularly noteworthy as they address a common and devastating pathogen in Canola, potentially offering a competitive advantage in the market.However, the long-term impact on the company's financials will depend on the adoption rate of these traits by farmers and the regulatory environment, especially considering the varying global stances on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and gene-edited crops. The recent capital raise of $20.3 million suggests a solid financial footing for near-term operations, but it's important to consider how this influx of capital will be allocated to sustain growth and innovation. Market Research Analyst The reported collaboration with major seed companies and the achievement of successful greenhouse and field trial results for Cibus' productivity traits indicate a robust product pipeline with potential for market disruption. The company's focus on addressing farmers' productivity and yield challenges through its RTDS platform positions it well within the agricultural biotech sector, which is increasingly seeking sustainable and efficient solutions.Investors should note the positive developments in the EU regarding the regulatory stance on gene editing, as this could lead to new market opportunities for Cibus. Nonetheless, the market's response to these regulatory changes will be important to watch, as it will affect the speed and extent of market penetration for Cibus' technologies. The company's strategic positioning and technological edge could make it an attractive partner or acquisition target for larger agribusiness firms looking to enhance their product offerings with advanced biotech solutions. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM Completed successful transfers of gene edited elite germplasm back to customers for commercialization for each of its three developed productivity traits: Pod Shatter Reduction (PSR) in Canola and Herbicide Tolerance (HT1 and HT3) in Rice Signed collaboration agreements for trait development with multiple major seed companies, including Bayer, Loveland Products (subsidiary of Nutrien Ltd), Nuseed, and Interoc Reported achievement of successful greenhouse results for two different modes of action for Sclerotinia (White Mold) Resistance in Canola Reported achievement of successful 2023 field trial results for each of its developed productivity traits Opened industry's first standardized high-throughput end-to-end gene editing production facility to support the scaling and commercialization of Cibus' growing RTDS® crop and trait pipeline Positive vote in the EU Parliament to support new genomic techniques (NGTs) advances the gene editing era in the European Union Achieved major industry breakthrough with world's first successful regeneration of Wheat plants from single cells Raised $20.3 million of gross proceeds via registered direct offering in the fourth quarter SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cibus, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBUS) (the ""Company""), a leading agricultural biotechnology company that uses proprietary gene editing technologies to develop plant traits (or specific genetic characteristics) in seeds, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, and provided a business update. Management will host a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. ET. Management Commentary ""2023 was a pivotal year for Cibus, both in terms of our evolution as a public company following the merger with Calyxt and the implementation of our commercial strategy as we transformed from our research and development origins,"" stated Rory Riggs, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Cibus. ""The centerpiece of our commercialization goals are the commercial advancement of each of our three developed traits — Pod Shatter Reduction in Canola, and our two herbicide tolerance traits in Rice, HT1 and HT3. We've made significant progress on the commercial front with several advancements of these developed traits, including transfers to customers. We also continued the progression of our advanced traits — Sclerotinia resistance, and our HT2 trait in Canola and Winter Oilseed Rape — and our efforts to extend our proprietary RTDS platform to the world's major crops. Furthermore, we celebrated a key catalyst for our industry in February when the EU Parliament voted to advance new regulations that, when adopted, will treat the applications of gene editing technology like ours in a similar fashion as conventional hybridization techniques that have been in existence for centuries. This vote was a significant milestone for our entire industry and is a crucial step that will help Cibus usher in the gene editing era."" Mr. Riggs added, ""At Cibus, we are building a leading agricultural biotech company that uses proprietary gene editing technologies to develop complex plant traits in customers' seeds to address farmers' most pressing productivity and yield challenges. We develop these productivity traits using our gene editing platform – the Rapid Trait Development System™ or RTDS, which is the core technology driving our Trait Machine™ process. Our technologies enable us to efficiently and directly edit traits into our customers' elite germplasm and form the cornerstone of our strategy to revolutionize the speed, precision, scale and range of new trait development. This is how we are leading the charge into the gene editing era. The incredible commercial momentum we have achieved so far is as strong an endorsement of our technology as it is of our ability to partner with the breeding operations of some of the largest seed companies in the world. We truly believe Cibus is at the forefront of agriculture's analog to digital moment and we are excited about our continued commercial progress in the months and quarters to come.""

The Company believes cash and cash equivalents will enable Cibus to fund planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into early in the third quarter of 2024.Research and development (R&D) Expense: R&D expense was $14.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.3 million in the year-ago period. The increase of $11.9 million is primarily related to increased lab supply and facility expenses, an increase in employee headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock award grants.Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense: SG&A expense was $6.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $1.0 million in the year-ago period. The increase of $5.8 million is primarily related to an increase in headcount, increased consulting and legal fees, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock award grants.Goodwill and intangible assets impairment: Goodwill and intangible assets impairment was $249.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The non-cash expense is due to the impairment of goodwill and in-process R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired in the merger with Cibus Global, LLC completed on May 31, 2023. The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of November 1 each year. The annual assessment resulted in a partial goodwill impairment of $150.4 million and a full impairment of the in-process R&D indefinite-lived intangible assets of $99.0 million.Royalty liability interest expense - related parties: Royalty liability interest expense - related parties was $8.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. This is a non-cash expense.Non-operating income (expenses): Non-operating income (expenses) was income of $0.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to income of $0.5 million in the year-ago period. The decrease of $0.4 million in non-operating income is due to $0.8 million received in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to a settlement with one of its technology vendors regarding alleged intellectual property infringement partially offset by a $0.4 million of merger transaction costs in the fourth quarter of 2022.Net loss: Net loss was $277.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.8 million in the year-ago period. The increase of $274.4 million in net loss was driven by the $249.4 million non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment. The remaining increase in net loss is described above.Net loss per share of Class A common stock: Net loss per share of Class A common stock was $12.59 for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.93 in the year-ago period. The increase of $9.66 in net loss per share of Class A common stock is primarily driven by the non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment which accounted for approximately $11.32 in net loss per share of Class A common stock. This is partially offset by a year-over-year increase in weighted average shares outstanding.

About Cibus Cibus is a leader in gene edited productivity traits that address critical productivity and sustainability challenges for farmers such as diseases and pests which the United Nations estimates cost the global economy approximately $300 billion annually. Cibus is not a seed company. It is a technology company that uses gene editing to develop and license traits to seed companies in exchange for royalties on seed sales. Cibus' focus is productivity traits for the major global crops such as canola, corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. Cibus is a technology leader in high throughput gene editing technology that enables Cibus to develop and commercialize plant traits at a fraction of the time and cost of conventional breeding. Cibus has developed a pipeline of five productivity traits including important traits for Pod Shatter Reduction, Sclerotinia resistance, and weed management. Its initial traits for Pod Shatter Reduction and weed management are developed in collaborations with leading seed companies. Its other pipeline traits including Sclerotinia resistance are in advanced greenhouse and field trial stages. About the Cibus Trait Machine™ process and Rapid Trait Development System™ A key element of Cibus' technology breakthrough is its high-throughput breeding process (referred to as the Trait Machine™ process). The Trait Machine process is a crop specific application of Cibus' patented Rapid Trait Development System™ (RTDS®). The proprietary technologies in RTDS integrate crop specific cell biology platforms with a series of gene editing technologies to enable a system of end-to-end crop specific precision breeding. It is the core technology platform for Cibus' Trait Machine process: the first standardized end-to-end semi-automated crop specific gene editing system that directly edits a seed company's elite germplasm. Each Trait Machine process requires a crop specific cell biology platform that enables Cibus to edit a single cell from a customer's elite germplasm and grow that edited cell into a plant with the Cibus edits. Cibus has a Trait Machine process developed for canola and rice and has already begun transferring their elite germplasm with Cibus edits back to customers. The traits from Cibus' RTDS-based high-throughput breeding system are indistinguishable from traits developed using conventional breeding or from nature. RTDS does not use any foreign DNA or transgenes. Under the European Commission's current proposals, it is expected that products from Cibus' RTDS gene editing platform such as its Pod Shatter Reduction trait and Sclerotinia resistance traits for Canola and Winter Oilseed Rape would be considered 'Conventional-like'. Cibus believes that RTDS and the Trait Machine process represent the technological breakthrough in plant breeding that is the ultimate promise of plant gene editing: ""high-throughput gene editing systems operating as an extension of seed company breeding programs."" Because the Trait Machine process is intended to be integrated into seed companies' breeding operations, the customer relationship between Cibus and seed companies with which it engages is a progressive relationship. Typically, the customer relationship is initiated with Cibus through the entry into a material transfer agreement pursuant to which seed companies transfer elite germplasm lines to Cibus for gene editing and delivery back to the seed company for pre-commercialization testing and validation. Accordingly, Cibus refers to seed company ""customers"" in its disclosure once such a customer relationship has been initiated. At present, all of the Company's customers discussed in this press release are at this initial stage of a relationship. While this initial stage of such customer relationships is a necessary prerequisite to the entry into a revenue generating commercial contract with such seed companies, currently, Cibus has certain customer relationships which include commercial contract terms, as well as others that are in various stages of development, including some in trait evaluation and/or field testing, however these have not yet generated revenue. Forward Looking Statements This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of present or historical fact included herein, including statements regarding Cibus' operational and financial performance, Cibus' strategy, future operations, prospects, and plans, including the anticipated regulatory environment are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""intend,"" ""expect,"" ""plan,"" ""scheduled,"" ""could,"" ""would"" and ""will,"" or the negative of these and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on the current expectations and assumptions of Cibus' management about future events, which are based on currently available information. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond the control of Cibus. Cibus' actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements could be materially different than those expressed, implied, or anticipated by forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to: Cibus' need for additional near-term funding to finance its activities and challenges in obtaining additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all; changes in expected or existing competition; challenges to Cibus' intellectual property protection and unexpected costs associated with defending intellectual property rights; increased or unanticipated time and resources required for Cibus' platform or trait product development efforts; Cibus' reliance on third parties in connection with its development activities; challenges associated with Cibus' ability to effectively license its productivity traits and sustainable ingredient products; the risk that farmers do not recognize the value in germplasm containing Cibus' traits or that farmers and processors fail to work effectively with crops containing Cibus' traits; challenges that arise in respect of Cibus' production of high-quality plants and seeds cost effectively on a large scale; Cibus' dependence on distributions from Cibus Global, LLC to pay taxes and cover its corporate and overhead expenses; regulatory developments that disfavor or impose significant burdens on gene-editing processes or products; Cibus' ability to achieve commercial success; commodity prices and other market risks facing the agricultural sector; technological developments that could render Cibus' technologies obsolete; changes in macroeconomic and market conditions, including inflation, supply chain constraints, and rising interest rates; dislocations in the capital markets and challenges in accessing liquidity and the impact of such liquidity challenges on Cibus' ability to execute on its business plan; risks associated with the possible failure to realize certain anticipated benefits of the Merger Transactions; the effect of the completion of the Merger Transactions on the Company's business relationships, operating results, and business generally; the outcome of any litigation related to the Merger Transactions; the Company's assessment of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support operations; and other important factors discussed in the ""Risk Factors"" section of Cibus' Annual Report on Form 10-K which is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 21, 2024. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Cibus' assessment of the period of time through which its financial resources will be adequate to support its operations is a forward-looking statement and involves such risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects.

(Nasdaq: LPLA), reported total advisory and brokerage assets of $1.40 trillion in February 2024, with $6.8 billion in net new assets. The company saw a 3.0% increase in total assets compared to January 2024, with a 6.0% annualized growth rate. Client cash balances decreased to $46.5 billion, while net buying totaled $13.0 billion. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported increase in total advisory and brokerage assets for LPL Financial indicates a positive trajectory for the firm's asset management sector. The 3.0% month-over-month growth reflects not only client confidence but also potentially favorable market conditions that have enabled asset appreciation. The distinction between advisory and brokerage assets' growth rates, with advisory assets growing at a higher rate (3.7%) compared to brokerage assets (2.2%), suggests a trend towards advisory services, which may be due to a shift in investor preference for more personalized investment advice and management.The reported annualized growth rates, particularly the 10.4% for net new advisory assets, are significant as they hint at the firm's ability to attract and retain advisory clients at a rate that exceeds industry benchmarks, which typically hover around 5-7%. This could be indicative of competitive service offerings or effective client acquisition strategies.However, the decrease in total client cash balances could signal a propensity for clients to invest their cash rather than hold it, possibly due to low interest rates on cash balances as suggested by the static Fed Funds effective rate. The net buying activity remains robust, which may reflect investor optimism or a strategic asset allocation shift towards equities, as evidenced by the growth in the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices. Market Research Analyst Observing the broader market context, the performance of indices like the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, which have shown considerable growth, is in alignment with the asset growth reported by LPL Financial. This correlation implies that LPL's asset base is, to some extent, riding the wave of the overall market performance. The firm's ability to capitalize on market movements is important for its continued growth and competitiveness.The reduction in client cash balances and the net buying activity could also suggest a shift in client sentiment towards equities, which might be driven by a bullish outlook on the market or a response to inflationary pressures where clients seek better returns than what cash accounts can offer.It's important to note that the financial advisory and brokerage industry is highly sensitive to market conditions and while the current report is favorable, it is imperative for stakeholders to consider the potential for market volatility which could impact future asset values and client behaviors. Economist The stability of the Fed Funds effective rate, as reported, indicates a steady monetary policy environment which can have mixed implications for financial services firms like LPL Financial. On one hand, it provides a predictable environment for investment strategies; on the other, it may pressure firms to seek higher yields for their clients amid potentially low-interest rates on cash balances.The year-over-year comparisons show a substantial increase in assets, which is reflective of both the firm's successful asset accumulation strategies and the recovery and growth of the broader economy from any prior downturns. The growth in net new assets, particularly in advisory services, suggests a robust demand for financial advice, which may be driven by the complex financial landscape individuals and businesses are navigating in the current economic climate.While the current data presents a snapshot of growth, it is essential to consider the cyclical nature of financial markets. The firm's future performance will depend not only on its operational strategies but also on external economic factors such as inflation, interest rates and geopolitical events that could affect market confidence and investment behaviors. 03/21/2024 - 04:05 PM SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LPL Financial LLC (“LPL Financial”), a wholly owned subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings Inc.

(LYRA) anticipates topline results from ENLIGHTEN I Phase 3 trial of LYR-210 in Q2 2024. LYR-220 demonstrates positive results in the BEACON Phase 2 clinical trial for CRS patients. The Company's financials show a steady growth with cash reserves to fund operations till Q1 2025. Negative The increase in research and development expenses for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. The impairment charges related to long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The net loss for the full year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. Medical Research Analyst The release of Phase 3 clinical trial results is a significant event for biotechnology companies, particularly for those like Lyra Therapeutics, which are focused on innovative treatments for chronic conditions such as CRS. The anticipation of the ENLIGHTEN I trial data for LYR-210 is a pivotal moment that could potentially shift the company's trajectory. Positive results could lead to FDA approval and eventual market entry, addressing a significant patient population. Conversely, unfavorable outcomes could impact the company's valuation and future funding needs.From a research and development perspective, the company's increased investment in clinical trials is a strategic move to advance its product pipeline. However, it is also a considerable risk, as the success of these trials is not guaranteed. The mentioned cash runway into the first quarter of 2025 suggests the company has sufficient funds to complete its current trials, which is important for investor confidence. Nonetheless, the net loss widening compared to the previous year indicates that the company is still in a heavy investment phase with no product revenue to offset R&D and administrative expenses. Financial Analyst Lyra Therapeutics' financial health, as indicated by their cash reserves, is stable in the short term, which is reassuring for investors concerned about the company's ability to fund ongoing clinical trials. The flat cash balance, despite increased R&D spending, may reflect prudent cash management or successful fundraising efforts. However, the increase in net loss year-over-year suggests that the company's burn rate is accelerating, which is not uncommon for a clinical-stage biotech firm but warrants monitoring as it approaches the commercialization phase.The impairment charge recorded for long-lived assets, although not substantially different from the previous year, indicates potential overestimation of asset values or a change in the expected utility of these assets. Investors should consider how these charges might affect the company's balance sheet and future financial statements. Additionally, the specific details of the impairment could provide insight into management's expectations for certain assets. Market Research Analyst The CRS treatment market is one that is underserved and presents a sizeable opportunity for companies like Lyra Therapeutics. The company's focus on long-acting, anti-inflammatory nasal inserts could meet a significant unmet need for patients who fail current medical management. With an estimated four million potential patients in the U.S. alone, the market potential for LYR-210 and LYR-220 is substantial. The clinical trial results will not only affect Lyra's stock but could also influence the competitive landscape of CRS treatments.Moreover, the differentiation of LYR-210 and LYR-220 based on patient anatomy and surgical history demonstrates a tailored approach to treatment, which could be favorable in terms of market adoption and physician preference. The company's strategic focus on delivering a steady dose of corticosteroid for six months with a single administration could be a strong selling point if the efficacy and safety profiles are confirmed in Phase 3 trials. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM -- Data from ENLIGHTEN I Pivotal Phase 3 Trial of LYR-210 in Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) Anticipated Q2 2024 -- WATERTOWN, Mass., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lyra Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: LYRA) (“Lyra” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing long-acting, anti-inflammatory nasal inserts for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a corporate update. “We look forward to reporting topline results from our ENLIGHTEN I pivotal Phase 3 trial of our lead product candidate, LYR-210, in CRS patients in the second quarter of this year,” said Maria Palasis, Ph.D., President and CEO of Lyra. “We believe the positive findings from our Phase 2 studies, including the recent BEACON trial results of our next product candidate, LYR-220, de-risk our pivotal program and validate the potential of our nasal insert to treat CRS.” Dr. Palasis continued, “By maintaining a steady dose of corticosteroid at the site of disease for six months with a single administration of LYR-210 or LYR-220, we believe our product candidates have the potential to address the needs of up to four million CRS patients who fail current medical management in the United States.” LYR-210 and LYR-220 are bioabsorbable nasal inserts designed to be administered in a simple, in-office procedure and are intended to deliver six months of continuous mometasone furoate drug therapy (7500µg MF) to the sinonasal passages for the treatment of CRS with a single administration. LYR-210 has a smaller dimension and is intended for patients with narrow anatomy, primarily those who have not undergone ethmoid sinus surgery (ESS). LYR-220, a larger insert, is designed for CRS patients whose nasal cavity is enlarged due to previous ESS. Upcoming 2024 Milestones Report topline results from ENLIGHTEN I pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of LYR-210 in Q2 2024Complete enrollment in ENLIGHTEN II, the second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of LYR-210, in the second half of 2024Report results from ENLIGHTEN I 52-week extension study in Q4 2024End of Phase 2 meeting for LYR-220 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second half of 2024 Program Highlights BEACON Phase 2 Clinical Trial of LYR-220 in CRS Patients who Have Had Prior Ethmoid Sinus Surgery In September 2023, Lyra announced positive topline results from the BEACON Phase 2 clinical trial of LYR-220 in adult patients with CRS who have recurrent symptoms despite prior ESS: LYR-220 demonstrated statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) score (-16.8; p=0.007) and in a composite of the 3 cardinal symptoms of CRS (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure; 3CS) (-1.50; p=0.02) compared to sham control at 24 weeks, with statistically significant improvement observed as early as week 2 in SNOT-22 and at week 4 in 3CS.Patients with impaired smell at baseline showed statistically significant improvement in their sense of smell compared to control at week 24 (-0.87; p=0.026).LYR-220 demonstrated statistically significant improvement in ethmoid sinus opacification as measured by computed tomography (CT) scans at week 24 (p=0.035). These data provide objective radiological evidence of improvement with LYR-220 treatment.At End of Study, Week 28, patients receiving LYR-220 showed continued symptomatic improvement compared to sham control in both SNOT-22 (-17.6; p=0.007) and in 3CS (-1.28; p=0.063).The study met its primary safety endpoint, with no serious adverse events observed. The most commonly reported adverse events included sinusitis, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and COVID-19. The Phase 2 BEACON trial was a randomized, controlled, parallel-group study intended to evaluate the safety and placement feasibility of the LYR-220 (7500µg MF) matrix, over a 28-week period, in symptomatic CRS patients who have had prior ESS. The study consisted of two parts: Part 1 was designed primarily to assess the feasibility and tolerability of two 7500µg MF matrix designs; in Part 2, 42 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive LYR-220 or sham control. ENLIGHTEN Pivotal Program of LYR-210 in CRS Patients who have not had Ethmoid Sinus Surgery The ENLIGHTEN program consists of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, ENLIGHTEN I and ENLIGHTEN II, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LYR-210 for the treatment of CRS. The Company designed each trial to evaluate 180 CRS patients who have failed medical management and have not had prior ESS, randomized 2:1 to either LYR-210 (7500µg mometasone furoate (MF)) or control over 24 weeks. The ENLIGHTEN I trial also includes an extension phase to further assess the safety and repeat use of LYR-210 through 52 weeks. The goal of the two pivotal trials is to support a New Drug Application to the FDA for LYR-210.

The company's cash position stands at $389 million, providing runway into 2027. Positive Successful completion of a $230 million PIPE financing in January 2024. DNTH103, a potential best-in-class complement inhibitor, undergoing Phase 2 MaGic trial in gMG. Planned Phase 2 trials in MMN and CIDP for DNTH103 in 2024. Cash position of $389 million as of December 31, 2023, providing runway into 2027. Negative Increase in R&D expenses driven by higher clinical costs and headcount. Significant rise in G&A expenses due to costs related to the reverse merger and higher headcount. Net loss of $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Medical Research Analyst The initiation of the Phase 2 MaGic trial by Dianthus Therapeutics for generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) represents a significant milestone in the clinical development of DNTH103. As an investigational monoclonal antibody with a targeted mechanism of action, DNTH103's potential as a best-in-class complement inhibitor is underscored by its selective inhibition of the C1s protein, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. The extended half-life provided by YTE technology could enhance patient compliance with less frequent dosages. For stakeholders, the successful completion of the $230 million PIPE financing extends the company's cash runway, thereby reducing immediate financial risk and supporting continued investment in R&D.From a medical research perspective, the top-line results anticipated in 2H’25 will be a critical indicator of DNTH103's efficacy and safety profile. Given the high unmet need in autoimmune disorders, a positive outcome could position DNTH103 favorably in the market. However, the long timeline to results and the inherent risks of clinical trials present a degree of uncertainty for investors. The company's strategic focus on building a neuromuscular franchise could diversify its portfolio and potentially mitigate risk across multiple indications. Financial Analyst The financial results reported by Dianthus Therapeutics reflect a proactive approach to funding, with a solid pro forma cash position of $389 million. This figure includes a substantial net proceeds contribution from the PIPE financing, which is indicative of strong investor confidence. The increased R&D expenses align with the company's developmental milestones, particularly the progression of DNTH103 into Phase 2 trials. While the rise in G&A expenses may raise some eyebrows, it is not uncommon for a company in a growth phase, especially post-merger, to experience such increases as it scales operations.Investors should note the net loss widening year-over-year, which is typical for clinical-stage biotech firms prioritizing product development. However, the cash runway extending into 2H 2027 provides a buffer against the need for near-term additional financing, which could dilute existing shares. The company's strategic allocation of funds towards advancing DNTH103's clinical development, if successful, could lead to significant long-term value creation. Biotech Market Analyst The landscape for autoimmune disorder treatments is competitive, with many players aiming to introduce novel therapies. Dianthus Therapeutics' strategy to establish DNTH103 as a pipeline-in-a-product positions the company to potentially capture market share across several autoimmune indications. The upcoming oral presentation at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting is an opportunity to increase visibility among healthcare professionals and may influence future adoption rates if clinical outcomes are favorable.The company's plans to initiate additional Phase 2 trials for Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) indicate an aggressive development timeline that could expedite market entry upon successful trials. However, the market's response to these developments will hinge on the trial outcomes and the ability of DNTH103 to differentiate itself from existing treatments. Dianthus' approach of targeting diseases with high unmet needs may enable them to command premium pricing and reimbursement if their treatments are approved, but this is contingent upon demonstrating clear clinical benefits and safety. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM Phase 2 MaGic trial in generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) initiated in Q1’24 with top-line results anticipated in 2H’25 $389 million of pro forma cash, including $216 million of net proceeds from a successful PIPE financing completed in January 2024, provides runway into 2H 2027 Building a neuromuscular franchise with DNTH103 through additional planned Phase 2 trials in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) starting in 2024 NEW YORK and WALTHAM, Mass., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dianthus Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: DNTH), a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to advancing the next generation of antibody complement therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune diseases, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending December 31, 2023, and provided an update on recent business achievements. “2023 was a transformative year for Dianthus, highlighted by becoming a public company, closing on a financing, and reporting out positive top-line data from our Phase 1 study that supports DNTH103 as a potentially best-in-class complement inhibitor,” said Marino Garcia, Chief Executive Officer of Dianthus Therapeutics. “DNTH103 is an investigational potent active C1s inhibitor of the classical pathway with an extended half-life that has the potential to offer a more convenient, safer treatment option for patients with infrequent, subcutaneous self-administration. With our Phase 2 MaGic trial now underway in patients with generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) and cash runway into the second half of 2027 following successful completion of a $230 million PIPE financing in January, we are very well positioned to build a neuromuscular franchise around DNTH103 and reach key data readouts in our three initial indications of gMG, Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).” Recent Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones DNTH103 DNTH103 is an investigational, clinical-stage, potent monoclonal antibody engineered to selectively target the classical pathway by inhibiting only the active form of the C1s protein, a clinically validated complement target. DNTH103 is enhanced with YTE half-life extension technology designed to enable a more convenient subcutaneous, self-administered injection dosed as infrequently as once every two weeks. DNTH103 has the potential to be a best-in-class pipeline-in-a-product across a range of autoimmune disorders with high unmet need. Phase 2 MaGic gMG trial initiated in February: The MaGic trial is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in up to 60 patients with gMG who are acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibody positive. Initial top-line results from this trial are anticipated to be available in the second half of 2025.Oral presentation at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2024 Annual Meeting on April 15, 2024: An oral presentation describing key attributes of DNTH103 and its differentiation in gMG will be presented by Sankalp Gokhale, M.D., Dianthus Therapeutics’ Head of Clinical Development, Neurology, at the AAN 2024 Annual Meeting, being held April 13-18, 2024, in Denver and online. (Program number S15.001)Planning for MMN and CIDP Phase 2 trials ongoing: Dianthus expects to initiate additional Phase 2 trials of DNTH103 in Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) in the second quarter of 2024 and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) in the second half of 2024. Corporate Dianthus successfully completed a private investment in public equity (“PIPE”) financing in January 2024 that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $230 million. This PIPE financing included participation from both new and existing investors, including Bain Capital Life Sciences, RA Capital Management, Avidity Partners, Fairmount, Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners, RTW Investments, Great Point Partners LLC, Octagon Capital, Janus Henderson Investors, Vestal Point Capital, Logos Capital, Catalio Capital Management, Woodline Partners LP, Ally Bridge Group, Tellus BioVentures, StemPoint Capital LP and a large investment management firm. Jeffrey Stavenhagen, Ph.D., was appointed as Chief Scientific Officer in November 2023 to lead the Company’s discovery and preclinical research and translational science initiatives. Full-Year 2023 Financial Results Cash Position – $389 million of pro forma cash includes cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023 of $173.7 million plus estimated net proceeds of approximately $216 million from the PIPE offering, which closed in January 2024. Net proceeds from the PIPE are unaudited and preliminary.R&D Expenses – Research and development (R&D) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $32.8 million, inclusive of $0.9 million of stock-based compensation, compared to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included $0.4 million of stock-based compensation. This increase in R&D expenses was primarily driven by increased clinical costs and higher headcount to support DNTH103 Phase 1 and Phase 2 development partially offset by lower chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) costs.G&A Expenses – General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $18.2 million, inclusive of stock-based compensation of $2.0 million, compared to $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included $1.1 million of stock-based compensation. This increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to costs related to the reverse merger with Magenta and higher headcount and professional fees.Net Loss – Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $43.6 million or $8.45 net loss per share (basic and diluted) compared to $28.5 million or $32.57 net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022.Additional Information – For additional information on the Company’s financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, please refer to the Form 10-K filed with the SEC. About DNTH103DNTH103 is an investigational, clinical-stage, potent monoclonal antibody engineered to selectively target the classical pathway by inhibiting only the active form of the C1s protein, a clinically validated complement target.

Financial highlights show decreased cash position. Positive Positive results in VISTA-101 trial with stable disease reported in both monotherapy and combination cohorts No dose limiting toxicities observed in the trial Exploration of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value Positive safety and efficacy data from Phase 1/2 VISTA-101 clinical trial Significant corporate restructuring to reduce expenses and preserve cash Negative Cash position decreased from $13.1 million in 2022 to $5.8 million in 2023 Investors not fulfilling funding obligation leading to suspension of new patient enrollment Workforce reduction of approximately 64% due to restructuring Financial Analyst The financial results and strategic decisions of Kineta, Inc. have a direct influence on the company's valuation and investor sentiment. The reported decrease in cash from $13.1 million to $5.8 million year-over-year reflects a significant burn rate, primarily driven by clinical trial expenses. The receipt of $8.6 million from investors and a $5.0 million milestone payment from Merck mitigated this outflow, but with the cessation of new patient enrollment and workforce reduction, the company is signaling cash preservation in response to funding challenges. This situation could impact the stock's liquidity and future financing opportunities, as investors may perceive increased risk due to the funding shortfall and strategic uncertainty.Moreover, the announcement of exploring strategic alternatives often indicates a potential sale, merger, or partnership, which can lead to stock price volatility as the market speculates on possible outcomes. However, the lack of fulfillment of funding obligations by certain investors raises concerns about the company's ability to continue operations without significant restructuring or external intervention. This could lead to short-term pressure on the stock price as the market reacts to the uncertainty surrounding the company's financial stability. Oncology Doctor The clinical progress reported in the VISTA-101 trial, including partial responses and stable disease in various cohorts, is a positive sign for the potential efficacy of KVA12123, particularly in treatment-resistant cases like non-small cell lung cancer. The absence of dose-limiting toxicities is also encouraging, as it suggests a favorable safety profile, which is a critical factor in the success of new oncology drugs. However, the suspension of new patient enrollment could slow down the trial's progress and delay potential FDA approval timelines.For patients and healthcare providers, the continuation of treatment for currently enrolled patients is a relief, but the uncertainty around the company's financial health may cast doubt on the long-term availability of KVA12123. This could influence the decisions of healthcare providers when considering future treatment options and clinical trial participation. Market Research Analyst Kineta's restructuring and the strategic exploration to maximize shareholder value are indicative of a pivot in corporate strategy in response to financial stress and investor behavior. The biotechnology sector is highly sensitive to clinical trial outcomes and funding availability, making Kineta's current position precarious. The reported clinical data, while promising, must be weighed against the operational challenges the company faces.From a market perspective, the company's ability to navigate through financial difficulties and successfully execute a strategic alternative will be key to maintaining investor confidence. The biotech industry often sees companies with promising therapies struggle due to financial constraints and Kineta's situation may serve as a cautionary tale for investors evaluating risk in early-stage clinical companies. 03/21/2024 - 04:02 PM Partial response and stable disease reported in combination cohort, and durable stable disease observed in monotherapy cohorts in the VISTA-101 trial No dose limiting toxicities observed at any dose level in the VISTA-101 trial Cleared fifth of six monotherapy cohorts and second of four combination cohorts in the VISTA-101 trial Kineta is actively exploring strategic alternatives to maximize value for all stakeholders SEATTLE, March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kineta, Inc. (Nasdaq: KA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to develop next-generation immunotherapies that transform patients’ lives, announced today financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2023 and provided a corporate update. In February 2024, the Company announced a significant corporate restructuring to substantially reduce expenses and preserve cash. The restructuring included a significant workforce reduction and the suspension of enrollment of new patients in its ongoing VISTA-101 Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating KVA12123 in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients currently enrolled in the trial will be permitted to continue to participate. The Company announced the restructuring as a result of certain investors indicating that they will not fulfill their April 2024 funding obligation in the previously disclosed private placement financing. In connection with the restructuring, the Company announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. “2023 was a productive year for Kineta where we initiated the Phase 1/2 VISTA-101 trial of KVA12123 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in cancer patients, and saw promising results, underscoring the potential of KVA12123 as a next-generation immunotherapy. We truly appreciate the efforts of the healthcare professionals, the patients and their caregivers, and the Kineta employees involved in this trial. We look forward to sharing the clinical update in the second quarter and we will continue to explore strategic alternatives that will allow us to continue to pursue our mission of developing transformative immunotherapies for patients with cancer,” said Craig Philips, President of Kineta.

EXPLORATION OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES In February 2024, the Company announced that it is pursuing strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value due to certain investors indicating they will not fulfill their April 2024 funding obligation in the previously disclosed private placement financing. As a result, the Company has suspended new patient enrollment into the Phase 1/2 VISTA-101 trial and will not be recruiting patients into either the sixth cohort in the monotherapy arm or the third cohort in the combination therapy arm. Patients currently enrolled in the trial will be permitted to continue to participate. In connection with the restructuring, the Company implemented a workforce reduction of the Company’s workforce of approximately 64% of the Company’s then-current employee base. 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Cash position: As of December 31, 2023, cash was $5.8 million, compared to $13.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to cash used for clinical trial development of KVA12123 as well as general corporate purposes, partially offset by $8.6 million net proceeds received from institutional and individual investors and $5.0 million in cash received from the Merck milestone payment in July 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had $5.8 million in cash, and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Based on our current operating plans, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which we expect to file on March 21, 2024. Revenues: Total revenues were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Revenues in 2023 were primarily due to our achievement of a development milestone under the Merck Exclusive License and Research Collaboration Agreement, which triggered a $5.0 million milestone payment. Revenues in 2022 were due to research and development services from the Genentech Option and License Agreement, which was terminated in December 2022, and also due to services provided under a grant that was concluded in December 2022. Research and development (R&D) expense: R&D expenses were $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decreases in R&D expenses were primarily due to lower activities for KVA12123 manufacturing and clinical study start up as the Company began enrolling the first patient in the study, which occurred in April 2023. General and administrative expense: General and administrative expenses were $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs of $2.3 million and insurance and other company expenses of $1.1 million. Personnel costs increased due to higher salaries and benefits of $1.2 million from increased headcount to support public company responsibilities and higher stock-based compensation of $1.0 million, which increased due to options granted during 2023. Insurance and other company expenses increased primarily due to public company directors and officers insurance premiums of $601,000 and board fees of $270,000. Net loss: Net loss was $14.1 million, or $1.28 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to a net loss of $63.4 million, or $12.87 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022.

(NKTX) reports financial results for Q4 and full year 2023, with cash position of $250.9 million. The company focuses on NKX019 in autoimmune diseases and deprioritizes NKX101. NKX019 shows promise in lupus nephritis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with positive clinical data. NKX101 in AML shows lower response rates, leading to deprioritization. Nkarta's cash runway is expected to fund operations into 2026. Positive Nkarta reports strong financials with $250.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2023. NKX019 in autoimmune diseases, particularly lupus nephritis and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, shows promising clinical data with plans for further development. NKX101 in AML experiences lower response rates, leading to deprioritization and realignment of resources towards NKX019. Nkarta's cash runway is anticipated to fund operations into 2026, providing financial stability for the company's pipeline development. Negative NKX101 in AML shows lower response rates compared to initial data, leading to deprioritization and potential future optimization. Deprioritization of NKX101 may impact investor sentiment and confidence in the company's pipeline diversity. Nkarta's significant R&D expenses in 2023 indicate high costs of drug development that could impact future financial performance. Financial Analyst The financial results disclosed by Nkarta, Inc. indicate a strategic pivot towards prioritizing NKX019 for autoimmune diseases, specifically lupus nephritis (LN) and deprioritizing NKX101 for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This decision comes after evaluating clinical data and response rates from NKX101 trials. The company's cash position, with $250.9 million as of year-end 2023, is projected to sustain operations into 2026, which is a positive indicator for financial stability and continued investment in R&D. However, the reported net loss of $117.5 million for the full year and $27.8 million for the fourth quarter, reflects the high costs associated with clinical development. Investors should consider the risks inherent in clinical-stage companies, such as trial outcomes and regulatory hurdles, alongside the potential for significant returns if NKX019 proves successful and reaches commercialization. Medical Research Analyst The clinical advancement of NKX019 in lupus nephritis represents a significant step for Nkarta, with the potential to address a substantial unmet medical need. The mechanism of disease-tailored lymphodepletion, which avoids the use of fludarabine, could offer a safer profile and better patient outcomes. The multi-center, dose escalation trial for NKX019 is designed to validate safety and efficacy and the first dosing planned for the first half of 2024 is a critical milestone. The preliminary success in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with a 70% complete response rate at higher doses suggests a robust therapeutic potential. However, the deprioritization of NKX101 due to lower response rates in AML highlights the challenges in drug development and the necessity to pivot resources towards more promising candidates. For stakeholders, the focus on NKX019's progress in autoimmune diseases and the potential expansion into other B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases, could represent a significant market opportunity given the prevalence of these conditions. Biotech Market Analyst Nkarta's strategic realignment to focus on NKX019 reflects a broader industry trend of targeting therapies for autoimmune diseases, which are a growing segment due to high prevalence and the need for more effective treatments. The company's early-mover advantage in utilizing engineered NK cells could position it favorably in a competitive market. The anticipation of a cash runway into 2026 suggests that Nkarta is managing its burn rate effectively, which is a key consideration for investors. However, the long-term success and impact on the stock market will largely depend on clinical trial outcomes and the ability to navigate the regulatory environment. The decision to deprioritize NKX101, while financially prudent, signals the inherent volatility and risk in the biotech sector, where investment in R&D does not always lead to commercial success. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM First patient dosing on track for first half of 2024 in clinical trial of NKX019 in lupus nephritis using disease-tailored lymphodepletionAdditional B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases under consideration for broader clinical investigation of NKX019Pipeline realignment focuses resources on rapid advancement of NKX019 in autoimmune diseases and deprioritizes development of NKX1012023 year-end cash, cash equivalents and investments of $250.9 million Cash runway anticipated to fund operations into 2026 SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nkarta, Inc. (Nasdaq: NKTX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing engineered natural killer (NK) cell therapies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2023. “Patients with severe autoimmune diseases deserve novel, effective treatments,” noted Paul J. Hastings, President and CEO of Nkarta. “Recent academic studies have shown that CD19-directed cell therapy has the promise to be truly transformative, and we believe that NKX019 may replicate these early results with superior safety and accessibility. Our approach leverages the potential advantages of NK cells, including fludarabine-free lymphodepletion, deep and rapid B-cell depletion, and the added utility of on-demand dosing. Work with investigators, sites and patients is advancing rapidly, and we remain on track to initiate dosing in our clinical trial of NKX019 in refractory lupus nephritis in the first half of 2024.” Hastings continued, “The potential of NKX019 to transform the treatment landscape in autoimmune disease demands our focus. To support our early-mover advantage and advance this program, Nkarta has deprioritized the development of NKX101. This follows a planned interim evaluation of Phase 1 data from NKX101 that included 14 new patients with AML. While the safety profile remained encouraging, the response rate was meaningfully lower than that from the first 6 previously reported patients. We see promise in NKX101, but before pursuing further development or significant investment, we will evaluate options for optimizing future study design, dosing schedule and manufacturing. We are grateful for the support of the NKX101 investigators as well as their patients for their commitment and trust.” NKX019 in autoimmune disease In October 2023, Nkarta announced the expansion of its pipeline to include autoimmune disease following the clearance by FDA of the IND application for NKX019 in lupus nephritis (LN).The multi-center, open label, dose escalation clinical trial will assess the safety and clinical activity of NKX019 in up to 12 patients with refractory LN. Patients will receive a three-dose cycle of NKX019 at 1 billion or 1.5 billion cells per dose following lymphodepletion (LD) with single agent cyclophosphamide (cy), an agent with an established safety profile in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and LN.Nkarta plans to dose the first patient in the LN study in the first half of 2024.NKX019 is highly active against B cells from patients with multiple autoimmune diseases, and Nkarta is evaluating additional indications for potential clinical investigation with NKX019. NKX019 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) In October 2023, Nkarta announced a new cohort in its Phase 1 study of NKX019 in relapsed/refractory (r/r) NHL. The cohort (n=6) introduces a compressed dosing schedule, where patients receive NKX019 doses on Days 0, 3 and 7 following LD with fludarabine (flu) and cy. This regimen is designed to intensify exposure of NKX019 by dosing closer to LD. In addition, patients with ongoing cytopenias have the potential to receive NKX019 following LD with cy alone.Nkarta expects to announce preliminary data from the NKX019 compressed dosing cohort in mid-2024.Nkarta is no longer enrolling patients in the cohorts in which NKX019 was being administered on Days 0, 7 and 14 following LD. Future development of NKX019 in the NHL indication will be contingent on favorable outcomes from the compressed dosing cohort.In June 2023, Nkarta presented preliminary clinical data based on a November 2022 data cut-off from its Phase 1 clinical trial of NKX019 in patients with r/r NHL at the annual meeting of the European Hematology Association and the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma. 7 of 10 patients achieved complete response (70% CR rate) following treatment with NKX019 monotherapy at highest dose levels.In January 2024, Nkarta reported that 4 of 4 patients with r/r NHL that relapsed after achieving CR following treatment with NKX019 were again able to achieve CR after re-treatment with NKX019. These outcomes suggest that relapse, when it occurs, may be attributable to mechanisms of NKX019 exposure and not resistance to NKX019. NKX101 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Nkarta announced today that it has closed patient enrollment in its clinical trial of NKX101 and deprioritized the program as part of a pipeline realignment that directs primary resources to its lead pipeline program, NKX019, for the treatment of autoimmune disease. This follows a recent review of preliminary safety and response data from patients with r/r AML that received NKX101 after LD comprising fludarabine and cytarabine (flu/Ara-C). The aggregate CR/CRi rate (5 of 20 patients) was lower than what had been observed in the first 6 patients in the cohort. The safety profile of NKX101 was consistent with previously reported data.This announcement reflects the NKX101 clinical update that Nkarta had planned to report in the first half of 2024. Nkarta plans to present these data at a future medical conference.In June 2023, Nkarta reported updated clinical data from its Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating NKX101 in patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) AML. In the first 6 patients that received NKX101 after flu/Ara-C LD, 4 of 6 achieved CR/CRi as of the data cut-off on June 10, 2023. In a follow-up report on these 6 patients presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology, of those patients who achieved CR/CRi, 3 of 4 remained in CR/CRi at 4 months as of the data cut off on October 31, 2023. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Highlights As of December 31, 2023, Nkarta had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $250.9 million, including restricted cash of $2.7 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses were $96.8 million for the full year 2023 and $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in R&D expense was $8.0 million for the full year 2023 and $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were $34.9 million for the full year 2023 and $7.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense included in G&A expense was $9.2 million for the full year 2023 and $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.Net loss was $117.5 million, or $2.40 per basic and diluted share, for the full year 2023. This net loss includes non-cash charges of $26.5 million that consisted primarily of share-based compensation, depreciation, and an impairment charge against right-of-use assets that Nkarta plans to sublease. Net loss was $27.8 million, or $0.57 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2023. Financial Guidance Nkarta expects its current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan into 2026.

With a debt-free balance sheet and upcoming property deliveries, Comstock is well-positioned for future growth and success. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The report from Comstock Holding Companies indicates a robust financial performance, particularly noting an 18% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenue and a 14% increase in year-to-date (YTD) revenue. The growth in recurring fee-based revenue by 12% and 13% for Q4 and YTD respectively, suggests a stable revenue stream which is a positive indicator for investor confidence. Moreover, the 22% increase in Q4 operating income and a significant 43% increase in Q4 net income highlight improved operational efficiency and profitability.However, it is important to note that while the YTD net income remained flat compared to the previous year, the Adjusted EBITDA saw a 16% increase, which suggests that non-operating factors have influenced net income. The flat net income could be a point of concern for investors looking for growth in profitability. Additionally, the cash flow generation of $9.0 million from operations underscores the company's ability to convert earnings into cash, which is critical for sustaining growth and funding future projects.The high leased percentages in both commercial and residential portfolios signal strong demand for Comstock's properties and effective asset management. This is further supported by the in-place rent growth reported in the residential and commercial segments. The strategic acquisition and expansion of the parking management portfolio also demonstrate a forward-looking approach to diversifying revenue streams. Real Estate Market Analyst Comstock's performance in the real estate market, especially in the Washington, D.C. region, reflects a thriving sector with their managed commercial portfolio's leased percentage rising to 92% from 87% in the previous fiscal year. The 2% in-place rent growth for commercial spaces and an 8% increase for residential units indicate a competitive market with potential for revenue growth through rent escalations.The acquisition of Comstock 41 investment property in Q4 and the overall expansion of their development assets position the company well for capitalizing on the demand in the mixed-use and transit-oriented development space. The parking management portfolio's exponential growth could be a response to urbanization trends and a shift in mobility patterns. These strategic moves imply that Comstock is not only strengthening its core business but also adapting to market dynamics, which can be a significant factor in long-term value creation. Corporate Governance Analyst From a governance perspective, the appointment of Thomas Holly and David Paul to the Board of Directors is a strategic move that could bring fresh perspectives and strengthen oversight. While the news release does not detail their backgrounds, such appointments can often enhance a company's governance structure and strategic planning.Additionally, the company's mention of a streamlined, debt-free balance sheet is not only a testament to Comstock's fiscal prudence but also potentially reduces financial risk for the company and its investors. This financial position could afford the company greater flexibility in pursuing growth opportunities and weathering economic downturns. 03/21/2024 - 04:00 PM Q4 2023 Q4 revenue increased 18% to $11.0 million, including 12% increase in recurring fee-based revenue Q4 operating income increased 22% to $1.9 million; Q4 net income increased 43% to $1.9 million Q4 Adjusted EBITDA increased 17% to $2.2 million Fiscal Year 2023 YTD revenue increased 14% to $44.7 million, including 13% increase in recurring fee-based revenue YTD operating income increased 15% to $9.2 million; YTD net income of $7.8 million flat vs. prior year YTD Adjusted EBITDA of $10.4 million, up 16% vs. prior year Generated $9.0 million of cash flow from operations Maintained well above-average leased percentages in both Commercial and Residential portfolios (90+%) RESTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Comstock Holding Companies, Inc.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate financial performance, analyze the underlying trends in our business and establish operational goals and forecasts that are used when allocating resources. We expect to compute Adjusted EBITDA consistently using the same methods each period. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure because it permits investors to better understand changes over comparative periods by providing financial results that are unaffected by certain non-cash items that are not considered by management to be indicative of our operational performance. While we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors when evaluating our business, it is not prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should be considered supplemental in nature. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute, for other financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.

United Makes it Easier to Share Award Miles with Family and Friends,2024-03-21T20:00:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"United Airlines introduces MileagePlus miles pooling, allowing members to combine miles with family and friends for joint account use. This feature enhances flexibility for award travel and group redemption on United.com.","United Makes it Easier to Share Award Miles with Family and Friends Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary United Airlines introduces MileagePlus miles pooling, allowing members to combine miles with family and friends for joint account use. This feature enhances flexibility for award travel and group redemption on United.com. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of MileagePlus miles pooling by United Airlines represents a strategic move to enhance customer loyalty and differentiate its offerings in a competitive market. From a market research perspective, this initiative can potentially increase customer retention and attract new customers who value collaborative consumption and shared experiences. The airline industry is highly competitive and loyalty programs are a key factor in customer decision-making. By being the first major U.S. airline to implement such a feature, United could gain a competitive edge.It's important to note that customer loyalty programs are not just about rewards; they are also about the perceived value and convenience they offer. By enabling miles pooling, United is addressing a common pain point for groups who travel together but struggle to use individual miles effectively. This could lead to an increase in customer engagement with the MileagePlus program, potentially boosting revenue as pooled miles may lead to more frequent redemptions for flights. This feature could also encourage more spending on United's co-branded credit cards, which often serve as a significant source of revenue for airlines through the sale of miles to credit card companies. Consumer Behavior Specialist United's decision to allow miles pooling taps into the broader trend of collaborative consumption and the sharing economy. Consumers today, especially millennials and younger generations, show a preference for services that offer flexibility and collective benefits. This new feature aligns with those values, potentially increasing the appeal of the MileagePlus program to these demographics. Additionally, the social aspect of miles pooling could lead to organic marketing benefits through word-of-mouth and social sharing as friends and family discuss travel plans and benefits.From a behavioral standpoint, the ability to pool miles may also create a sense of community among participants, which can be a powerful motivator for consumer actions. The psychological effect of pooling resources for a common goal, such as a family vacation or group trip, can create a positive association with the United brand. However, it's essential to monitor customer feedback and usage patterns to ensure that the program's implementation meets user expectations and does not introduce unforeseen complexities or dissatisfaction. Financial Analyst When evaluating the financial implications of United's MileagePlus miles pooling, it's important to consider both the potential revenue increase from boosted engagement and the costs associated with offering more accessible rewards. The program could lead to more redeemed flights, which, while reducing the liability of unused miles on United's balance sheet, could also increase the airline's passenger service costs. However, the incremental revenue from additional bookings and the sale of miles to credit card partners may outweigh these costs.Furthermore, the timing of this release, just before the summer travel season, suggests a strategic move to capitalize on the high travel demand period. If successful, this could result in a positive impact on United's quarterly earnings following the launch. Investors should look for changes in MileagePlus program engagement metrics and redemption rates in subsequent earnings reports to assess the financial impact of this initiative. 03/21/2024 - 04:00 PM United becomes first major U.S. airline to allow members of its loyalty program, MileagePlus®, to pool their miles with family and friends into a joint account This new feature makes it easier for family members of all ages -- and groups to share and use miles for award travel MileagePlus miles pooling is now available on United.com CHICAGO, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Just in time for summer travel planning, United today launched MileagePlus miles pooling – a new way for MileagePlus members to contribute and combine their miles into a joint account. Available on United.com, groups of up to five members can now share and redeem miles in one linked account. United allows any MileagePlus member – whether relatives or close friends – to be in a pool with other members. United is the first and only major U.S. airline to offer this feature. ""We're always looking for new ways to provide the most value to all of our loyalty members and are proud to be the first major U.S. airline to allow our members to pool their miles with their loved ones and friends,"" said Luc Bondar, Chief Operating Officer of MileagePlus. ""MileagePlus miles pooling further reinforces United's position as the leader in family and group travel and gives our members more flexibility to use their miles while making it easier to connect to the destinations and moments that matter most, with the people that matter most."" As 81% of parents report intent to travel with their children in the next year and nearly 60% report concern about travel affordability, according to a 2023 U.S. Family Travel Survey conducted by the Family Travel Association, the introduction of MileagePlus miles pooling aims to make travel even easier for families or groups looking to get away; even the youngest family members can contribute as there's no minimum age to become a MileagePlus member. MileagePlus miles pooling is now available to all MileagePlus members by logging in to their account on United.com. For those not already MileagePlus members, the program is free to join here. How MileagePlus miles pooling works Any MileagePlus member over 18 years old can become the pool leader and create a pool for free when logged in to their account on United.com. Pool leaders can invite up to four of their family, friends, or close travel companions of any age to join the pool if they have an active MileagePlus account. There is no minimum age to join MileagePlus.When logged in to their MileagePlus account on United.com, members will be instructed on how to contribute miles to the group pool as well as how to redeem pooled miles for award flights on United and United Express*.There are no limits to the number of miles that may be contributed to an active miles pool.Pooled miles can be used when booking a ticket on United.com or in the United mobile app. For example, if a group of friends is planning an upcoming summer getaway and each friend has their own individual MileagePlus accounts with their respective number of miles, they can combine all, or a select amount of their personal miles into one central 'pool' that can be used to purchase flights and offset the cost of ticket prices. Contributing miles to a MileagePlus miles pool will not affect an individual member's Premier® status. Only members who travel on a ticket using pooled miles will earn any eligible Premier qualifying points (PQP), not the member who contributed them. Members cannot pool PQP, Premier qualifying flights (PQF), PlusPoints, or TravelBank cash. The MileagePlus program provides the most ways to earn and use miles of any other U.S. airline. Members earn miles that never expire with every flight purchased, through spending on the United Family of Cards from Chase, by making purchases on MileagePlus ShoppingSM and more. Members can opt to fully cover a trip with their MileagePlus miles or use a combination of money and miles to save on the out-of-pocket cost of their next flight**. *For full terms, restrictions, and conditions, see here.**MileagePlus miles pooling is excluded from money and miles at this time.

For shareholders, this investment represents a forward-looking approach to diversifying assets and creating new growth avenues, which is essential in the dynamic media landscape.The return of over $60 million to shareholders in the form of dividends or share buybacks is a strong signal of Scholastic's financial health and its commitment to delivering shareholder value. This level of capital return can be attractive to income-focused investors and may support the stock price by effectively reducing the number of shares outstanding, thus potentially increasing earnings per share. Market Research Analyst Success in Trade Publishing, highlighted by Scholastic's presence on bestseller lists, underscores the company's adeptness at identifying and promoting titles that resonate with its target demographic. Popular series such as 'Heartstopper', 'Wings of Fire' and 'The Baby-Sitters Club' not only contribute to immediate sales but also help in establishing a loyal customer base and brand recognition. The sustained performance of these franchises is important for long-term revenue stability and can be leveraged for cross-selling opportunities.Furthermore, the partnership with 9 Story Media Group suggests that Scholastic is actively seeking synergies that can enhance its content distribution capabilities. This strategic move should be monitored for its potential to scale Scholastic's existing intellectual property and for the introduction of new, innovative content that can capture additional market segments. The ability to build and monetize global children's intellectual property is a key differentiator in the competitive landscape of children's media and publishing. Economist The reported financial outcomes for Scholastic Corporation must be contextualized within the broader economic environment. A 7% increase in sales during the fiscal third quarter may reflect not only company-specific factors but also market-wide trends such as consumer spending patterns and the state of the economy. If the economic conditions are favorable, with rising disposable incomes and strong consumer confidence, Scholastic's growth could be seen as part of a larger positive trend in the consumer discretionary sector.On the flip side, if the economy faces headwinds such as inflation or recessionary pressures, Scholastic's performance might be interpreted differently. In such a scenario, the company's ability to maintain sales growth would be particularly impressive and could indicate strong brand loyalty and product demand that is somewhat insulated from macroeconomic fluctuations.Additionally, the strategic investment in 9 Story Media Group and the return of capital to shareholders should be evaluated in light of interest rates and investment opportunities. If interest rates are low, the investment could be seen as a good use of capital, especially if it yields higher returns than other available options. Conversely, if interest rates are high, the opportunity cost of the investment increases and the decision to return capital to shareholders might be driven by a lack of more lucrative investment opportunities. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM Consolidated Trade Sales Increased 7% Announced Agreement to Invest in 9 Story Media Group, Expanding Opportunities to Build and Monetize Global Children's IP Over $60 Million Returned to Shareholders in Third Quarter NEW YORK, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Scholastic Corporation (NASDAQ: SCHL), the global children's publishing, education and media company, today reported financial results for the Company's fiscal third quarter ended February 29, 2024. Peter Warwick, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Last quarter Scholastic's continued successes in children's book publishing and entertainment demonstrated our leadership in building beloved children's franchises and brands. In Trade Publishing, multiple new releases expanded Scholastic's presence on bestseller lists, including Heroes: A Novel of Pearl Harbor by Alan Gratz and the latest titles in our popular graphic novel series HeartstopperTM by Alice Oseman, Wings of FireTM by Tui Sutherland, Amulet by Kazi Kibuishi and The Baby-Sitters Club® by Ann Martin. Looking ahead, we are excited about the next title in Dav Pilkey's Dog Man® series, as well as other frontlist titles publishing this year. Following the success of the live-action Goosebumps® TV debut last fall, based upon R.L. Stine's worldwide bestselling Scholastic book series and co-produced by Scholastic Entertainment, Disney announced it has greenlit a second season of the hit series for Disney+®. ""We are thrilled to significantly broaden the scope of our 360° content creation strategy, which taps the virtuous circle from page to screen back to page, with our recently announced agreement to invest in 9 Story Media Group, acquiring 100% of the economic interest in the company. This strategic investment in a leading creator, producer and distributor of premium animated and live-action children's content significantly grows Scholastic's footprint in children's media as well as opportunities to build and monetize Scholastic's trusted global brand, best-selling publishing and unique distribution channels, reaching kids where they are and creating more value for our shareholders. ""In line with our expectations, Scholastic experienced modest revenue declines and higher losses in our seasonally small third quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the currently complex environment in U.S. schools on our School Reading Events and Education divisions. During the quarter, Scholastic returned over $60 million to shareholders through repurchases and our regular dividend, demonstrating our confidence in the business. As we begin our largest and most profitable quarter of the year with strong expectations, we are affirming our revised fiscal 2024 guidance. Scholastic remains committed to executing on our long-term strategy, investing in content and capabilities to drive growth, maintaining a strong, efficient balance sheet, and returning capital to shareholders, as we build on our unique strengths as the world's largest and most trusted publisher and distributor of children's books and media."" Fiscal 2024 Q3 Review In $ millions (except per share data) Third Quarter Change Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 $ % Revenues $ 323.7 $ 324.9 $ (1.2) 0 % Operating income (loss) $ (34.9) $ (27.7) $ (7.2) (26) % Earnings (loss) before taxes $ (34.6) $ (26.2) $ (8.4) (32) % Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.91) $ (0.57) $ (0.34) (60) % Operating income (loss), ex one-time items * $ (30.6) $ (27.7) $ (2.9) (10) % Diluted earnings (loss) per share, ex. one-time items * $ (0.80) $ (0.57) $ (0.23) (40) % Adjusted EBITDA * $ (7.2) $ (5.4) $ (1.8) (33) % * Please refer to the non-GAAP financial tables attached Revenues were approximately level in the quarter at $323.7 million, a decrease of $1.2 million from $324.9 million in the prior year. Lower U.S. Book Clubs revenues of approximately $14.4 million related to the strategic repositioning of the business, were offset by strong trade publishing revenues in the U.S., Canada and the UK, which benefited from the sales of popular book series titles. Operating loss increased 26.0% to $34.9 million in the quarter, including one-time items of $4.3 million, compared to $27.7 million a year ago, as anticipated. Excluding one-time items in the current period, operating loss increased 10%, reflecting higher spending on growth initiatives, partly offset by increased profitability from higher trade revenues, favorable freight costs in the U.S. markets and lower promotion costs in book clubs. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure of operations explained in the accompanying tables) decreased $1.8 million to a loss of $7.2 million. Quarterly Results Children's Book Publishing and Distribution In the fiscal third quarter, the Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment's revenues decreased 5% to $193.6 million. Book Fairs revenues were $102.7 million, down slightly from the prior year period. The third fiscal quarter is a seasonally smaller quarter for the U.S. school channels.Book Clubs revenues were $13.3 million, a decline of 52% from the prior year period reflecting the impact of lower planned promotional spending on unprofitable offers.Consolidated Trade revenues were $77.6 million, up 7% from the prior year period primarily due to the continued positive impact from backlist sales from bestselling series like Hunger Games® and Five Nights at Freddy'sTM. New releases in popular graphic novel series as well as new titles from proven Scholastic authors drove improved frontlist sales. This was partially offset by lower revenues from the prior year delivery of the animated TV show ""Eva the Owlet""TM based on the Owl DiariesTM book series.Adjusted segment operating income was $2.7 million, excluding $3.5 million in one-time charges, compared to $1.9 million in the prior period, primarily related to lower freight costs and promotional spending. Education Solutions Education Solutions revenues were $68.5 million, a slight decrease from the prior year period, reflecting lower sales of supplemental instructional materials partially offset by higher state-sponsored program revenues. Segment operating loss was $0.8 million, compared to operating income of $0.7 million in the prior period. The decrease was primarily due the on-going impact of increased spending on growth initiatives, partially offset by lower promotional spending. International Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, which on a net basis was insignificant for the quarter, International revenues increased 16% or $8.2 million as trade channel revenues in Canada and the U.K. improved on the strong performance of series titles including Hunger Games, Heartstopper, Five Nights at Freddy's and Dog Man. Canada's Book Fairs channel experienced increased fair count and improved revenue per fair, and India continued to experience modest growth. Segment operating loss was $5.9 million, compared to $9.0 million in the prior period. The improvement was primarily driven by higher sales. Overhead Adjusted overhead costs were $26.6 million, excluding $0.8 million in one-time charges, compared to $21.3 million in the prior period. This increase primarily reflects favorable litigation settlements and certain legacy sales tax items, both of which benefited the prior year, partially offset by higher rental income. Capital Position and Liquidity In $ millions Third Quarter Change Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2023 $ % Net cash (used) provided by operating activities $ 13.1 $ 7.6 $ 5.5 72 % Additions to property, plant and equipment and prepublication expenditures (20.2) (19.5) 0.7 4 % Free cash flow (use)* $ (7.1) $ (11.9) $ 4.8 40 % Net cash (debt)* $ 78.9 $ 193.6 $ (114.7) (59) % * Please refer to the non-GAAP financial tables attached Net cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million compared to the prior period, primarily driven by lower inventory purchasing and working capital usage, partially offset by lower customer remittances. Lower inventory spend reflects lower freight and manufacturing costs in addition to lower purchased quantities. Free cash flow use (a non-GAAP measure of operations explained in the accompanying tables) was $7.1 million in fiscal 2024, compared to free cash flow use of $11.9 million in the prior period, reflecting the lower working capital usage. The Company distributed $6.1 million in dividends and repurchased 1,404,716 shares of its common stock for $54.2 million in the third quarter. The Company's Board of Directors has authorized an additional $54.6 million for repurchases of its common stock under the Company's stock repurchase program, increasing the authorization to $100.0 million. The Company expects to continue purchasing shares, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions for the foreseeable future.

Revenues were also impacted by the strategic plan to reposition Book Clubs to a smaller, more profitable core. Operating loss was $32.7 million year-to-date, including $10.6 million in one-time charges related to restructuring, cost-savings activities and acquisition costs, compared to operating income of $14.3 million a year ago, which did not include any one-time charges. Excluding one-time charges in the current period, operating loss in the year-to-date period increased $36.4 million from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure of operations explained in the accompanying tables) decreased $35.1 million to $46.2 million. As expected, the continued shift in the overall seasonality of the Education Solutions segment sales, which significantly impacted the first quarter performance of this segment, coupled with continued investment in strategic initiatives and increased spending in the Book Fairs business to facilitate increased fair count resulted in the reduction in operating income.

Negative Total net product revenues decreased by 16% to $71.0 million in 2023 due to lower unit volumes from legacy products. Net loss was $(3.9) million for 2023, compared to $(29.6) million in 2022. Decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $32.0 million in 2022 to $27.4 million in 2023. Financial Analyst The reported 7% revenue growth and $15.6 million in operating cost savings for Journey Medical Corporation signify a strategic turning point for the company's financial health. The revenue increase, primarily from the licensing agreement with Maruho, indicates a successful expansion into new markets. However, this must be balanced against the 16% decrease in net product revenues, largely due to competitive pressures on legacy products. The company's ability to manage these pressures will be critical for sustaining growth.The cost reduction initiative, resulting in a significant drop in SG&A expenses, reflects strong management's commitment to improving operational efficiency. Investors should note the potential for improved operating leverage, which could enhance profitability as revenues grow. The company's strategic financial maneuvers, including the new credit facility with SWK, provide flexible capital that could support the launch of DFD-29, should it gain FDA approval.Lastly, the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA turning positive is a notable improvement, but stakeholders should remain cautious and evaluate the sustainability of these measures and the company's long-term profitability prospects. Medical Research Analyst The acceptance of the New Drug Application for DFD-29 by the FDA is a pivotal milestone for Journey Medical, positioning the company to potentially address a significant unmet medical need in rosacea treatment. The clinical data suggesting DFD-29's potential as a best-in-class solution for inflammatory lesions and erythema could differentiate it in the competitive landscape of dermatological treatments.Investors should consider the implications of the PDUFA goal date, as FDA approval could open a substantial market opportunity for Journey Medical. The anticipation of DFD-29 as the lowest-dose oral minocycline on the market could also be a unique selling point, potentially leading to favorable adoption rates post-launch.However, the long-term success of DFD-29 will depend on the drug's efficacy, safety profile and the company's ability to effectively market the product against existing treatments. The positive Phase 3 trial results are promising, but the real test will come with market acceptance and physician prescribing habits. Market Research Analyst The licensing agreement with Maruho not only contributed significantly to Journey Medical's revenue but also suggests a strong strategic move into the Asian market, recognizing the increasing demand for dermatological treatments in this region. The diversification of revenue streams through such partnerships is a prudent approach in mitigating risks associated with domestic market volatility and generic competition.Despite the decline in net product revenues due to generic competition, the company's focus on developing and commercializing innovative treatments like DFD-29 could potentially revitalize its product portfolio. The market for rosacea treatments is evolving and the entry of a new oral systemic therapy could capture a sizeable share if it demonstrates a superior value proposition to patients and providers.Long-term growth will likely hinge on the company's ability to maintain strategic partnerships, manage competition and successfully commercialize new products. The anticipated early 2025 launch of DFD-29, if approved, may serve as a catalyst for significant growth, but it is essential to monitor the execution of the launch strategy and market reception. 03/21/2024 - 04:01 PM Company generated total revenues of $79.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2023, a 7% increase from the $73.7 million reported in 2022 Achieved $15.6 million in operating cost savings in 2023, ahead of initial guidance of $12.0 million New Drug Application for rosacea treatment candidate DFD-29 accepted for U.S. FDA review; PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024 Company to hold conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss the financial results and provide a business update SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Journey Medical Corporation (Nasdaq: DERM) (“Journey Medical” or “the Company”), a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company that primarily focuses on the selling and marketing of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)-approved prescription pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Claude Maraoui, Journey Medical’s Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “2023 was a year of growth and development for Journey Medical. Our full-year revenue reflected a record high for the Company, attributed primarily to our efforts to expand the reach of Qbrexza® in additional territories in Asia through a licensing agreement with Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”), as well as continued sales of our four core dermatology branded products. We also significantly streamlined our cost infrastructure, positioning the Company to realize improved operating leverage from our future sales and anticipated growth. Another key highlight of the year was the progress that we made in advancing DFD-29 (Minocycline Hydrochloride Modified Release Capsules, 40 mg) through late-stage clinical development. Based on the results of our two Phase 3 trials, DFD-29 has the potential to become the only oral, systemic therapy to address inflammatory lesions and erythema (redness) from rosacea, differentiating it as a potential best-in-class solution. Based on the positive results, we submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2024 for the potential approval of DFD-29. The FDA accepted the NDA this month and has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date of November 4, 2024. Given our portfolio of recognized dermatology brands, our proven sales force and streamlined cost infrastructure, and the potential to launch DFD-29 in early 2025, we believe Journey is well-positioned for growth and to bring significant value to patients, our physician customers, and our shareholders.” Financial Results: Total revenues were $79.2 million for the full year 2023, representing 7% growth compared to total revenues of $73.7 million for the full year of 2022. The increase is primarily due to the Company’s entry into a license agreement with Maruho resulting in $19.0 million of revenue in 2023. Total net product revenues decreased $11.3 million, or 16%, compared to $71.0 million for 2022, mainly due to lower unit volumes from our legacy products, Targadox®, Ximino® and Exelderm® specifically due to continued generic competition for Targadox and the discontinuation of Ximino during the third quarter of 2023.Cost of goods sold decreased by $4.1 million, or 13%, to $26.7 million for the full year 2023, from $30.8 million for the full year 2022. The decrease is mainly due to lower-than-prior-year product royalties driven by lower sales of products from period-to-period, and a permanent contractual decrease in the Qbrexza royalty percentage from the prior-year period.Selling, general and administrative expenses were $43.9 million for the full year 2023, compared to $59.5 million for 2022. The decrease is mainly due to our expense reduction efforts primarily in sales and marketing and other SG&A areas. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we began the implementation of a cost reduction initiative designed to improve operational efficiencies, optimize expenses and reduce overall costs.Research and development costs were $7.5 million for the full year 2023, compared to $10.9 million for the full year 2022. The decrease is due to lower clinical trial expenses for DFD-29 given the completion of the Phase 3 clinical trial program.Net loss was $(3.9) million, or $(0.21) per share basic and diluted for the full year 2023, compared to net loss of $(29.6) million or $(1.69) per share basic and diluted for the full year 2022. The $25.8 million decrease in net loss from period-to-period was driven by our expense optimization efforts and the Maruho upfront payment. The Company’s non-GAAP results in the table below reflect Adjusted EBITDA of $15.6 million, or $0.85 per share basic and $0.75 per share diluted for the full year 2023. This compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $(7.3 million), or $(0.42) per share basic and diluted for the full year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are non-GAAP financial measures, each of which are reconciled to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP below under “Use of Non-GAAP Measures.” At December 31, 2023, Journey Medical’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $27.4 million, compared to $24.8 million on September 30, 2023, and $32.0 million on December 31, 2022, an increase of $2.6 million for the quarter and a decrease of $4.6 million from the prior-year period.In December 2023, Journey Medical entered into a $20.0 million credit facility with SWK Holdings Corporation (“SWK”), a specialized finance company with a focus on the global healthcare sector. The credit facility provides for an initial term loan of $15.0 million that the Company intends to use for general corporate purposes, including to support the potential launch of DFD-29. The Company also has the option to draw an additional tranche of $5.0 million under the credit facility within one year. FY 2023 and Recent Corporate Highlights: In March 2024, the FDA accepted the NDA for DFD-29 (Minocycline Hydrochloride Modified Release Capsules, 40 mg) and set a PDUFA goal date of November 4, 2024. If approved, DFD-29 will be the lowest-dose oral minocycline on the market and has the potential to be the new treatment paradigm for the millions of patients suffering from rosacea. The Company had submitted the NDA to the FDA seeking approval for DFD-29 for the treatment of inflammatory lesions and erythema of rosacea in adults in January 2024.In October 2023, Journey Medical announced data from a comparative bioavailability (bridging) study of DFD-29 vs. Solodyn® (Minocycline Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, 105 mg), which were presented at the 43rd Annual Fall Clinical Dermatology Conference. The data demonstrated that systemic exposure of DFD-29 was significantly lower than that of Solodyn and that DFD-29 was safe and well tolerated throughout the study.In September 2023, Journey Medical entered into an exclusive license agreement with Maruho. Under the terms of the Agreement, Journey Medical received a $19.0 million non-refundable upfront payment and granted Maruho an exclusive license to develop and commercialize Qbrexza (glycopyrronium tosylate hydrate) for the treatment of hyperhidrosis in South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos (the “Territory”). Maruho is responsible for all development and commercialization costs for the product throughout the Territory.In July 2023, Journey Medical announced positive topline results from the two DFD-29 Phase 3 clinical trials (MVOR-1 & MVOR-2) for the treatment of rosacea. Both randomized controlled trials achieved their co-primary and all secondary endpoints with subjects completing the 16-week treatment with no significant safety issues. DFD-29 demonstrated statistical superiority compared to both Oracea capsules and placebo for Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) treatment success and the reduction in the total inflammatory lesion count in both clinical trials. The Company also announced results from the DFD-29 Phase 3 studies on a secondary endpoint related to erythema (redness) assessment. DFD-29 showed significantly superior reduction in Clinicians Erythema Assessment (CEA) compared to placebo in both of the Phase 3 clinical trials. In June 2023, Journey Medical announced positive topline results from the Phase 1 clinical trial assessing the impact of DFD-29 on the microbial flora of healthy adults and also evaluated the safety and tolerability of DFD-29. The study achieved all primary objectives and no significant safety issues were noted during the study. The results indicate that DFD-29 can be safely used for up to 16 weeks with no significant risk of microbiota suppression or development of resistance.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) excluding interest, taxes and depreciation, less certain other non-cash and infrequent items not considered to be normal, recurring operating expenses, including, share-based compensation expense, amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets, inventory step-ups from the purchases of intangibles assets and products, severance and foreign exchange transaction losses. In particular, we exclude the following matters for the reasons more fully described below: Share-Based Compensation Expense: We exclude share-based compensation from our adjusted financial results because share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, fluctuates from period to period based on factors that are not within our control, such as our stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued.Non-core and Short-term Research and Development Expense: We exclude research and development costs incurred in connection with our DFD-29 product candidate, which is the only product in our portfolio not currently approved for marketing and sale, because we do not consider such costs to be normal, recurring operating expenses that are core to our long-term strategy. Instead, our long-term strategy is focused on the marketing and sale of our core FDA-approved dermatological products and the out licensing our intellectual property and related technologies.Amortization and impairments of Acquired Intangible assets: We exclude the impact of certain amounts recorded in connection with the acquisitions of intangible assets that are either non-cash or not normal, recurring operating expenses due to their nature, variability of amounts, and lack of predictability as to occurrence and/or timing. These amounts may include non-cash items such as the amortization impairments of acquired intangible assets and amortization of step-ups of acquisition accounting adjustments to inventories. Adjusted EBITDA per share basic and Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted are determined by dividing the resulting Adjusted EBITDA by the number of shares outstanding on an actual and fully diluted basis. Management believes the use of these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance because (i) it allows for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, (ii) it excludes the impact of non-cash or, when specified, non-recurring items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s core operating performance and that may obscure trends in the Company’s core operating performance and (iii) it is used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the Company's results. However, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA per share basic, Adjusted EBITDA per share diluted and any other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company and the manner in which they are calculated may differ from the non-GAAP financial measures or the calculations of the same non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, including the Company’s competitors.

The company improved revenue to $44.5 million in 2023, reduced operating expenses by 43%, and strengthened its position in the EV stepvan market. Positive Full-year revenue increased by 22% year-over-year. Positive gross margins were reported in the third and fourth quarters of 2023. Xos entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ElectraMeccanica. Revenue improved significantly to $44.5 million in 2023 from $36.4 million in 2022. Reduced quarterly operating expenses by 43% in two years. Announced the updated Xos Hub, a rapidly deployable charging unit. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable debt securities stood at $11.6 million. Deliveries of 283 units to major fleets in North America were made, including FedEx Ground, UPS, and others. Negative Non-GAAP gross profit showed a loss in the fourth quarter and full year. Net loss increased to $75.8 million in 2023. Loss from operations was $65.0 million in 2023. Inventories decreased from $48.9 million to $37.8 million. Gross profit showed a loss of $1.3 million in the fourth quarter. Market Research Analyst The reported 22% year-over-year revenue increase for Xos, Inc. reflects a positive trend in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, particularly within the electric truck segment. This growth trajectory is indicative of the rising demand for eco-friendly transportation solutions, which is bolstered by both environmental regulations and an increasing societal push towards sustainability. The achievement of positive gross margins in the latter half of the year suggests operational efficiency improvements, likely through economies of scale as the company expands its production and delivery capabilities.Additionally, the strategic acquisition of ElectraMeccanica could signal a consolidation trend in the EV space, which may result in enhanced market share and competitive positioning for Xos. The inclusion of over $45 million in cash as part of the transaction could provide a buffer for Xos, potentially improving its operational runway and enabling further investment in technology and market expansion. Financial Analyst Xos' ability to reduce operating expenses by 43% in two years demonstrates a commitment to financial discipline and operational efficiency. This is a significant factor for investors, as it may lead to improved profitability in the long term. However, despite the revenue growth and cost-cutting measures, the company still reported a substantial net loss of $75.8 million for the year. This highlights the challenges faced by emerging companies in the capital-intensive EV industry, where upfront investments are often necessary to achieve scale and long-term viability.Investors should also consider the liquidity position of Xos, with cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable debt securities totaling $11.6 million, down from $89.3 million the previous year. This decrease raises concerns about the company's cash burn rate and the necessity for the cash infusion from the ElectraMeccanica acquisition to sustain operations. Automotive Industry Analyst The release of an updated stepvan platform and the subsequent market leadership claim in the EV stepvan segment is a testament to Xos' innovation and product development capabilities. Delivering 283 units to major fleets like FedEx Ground and UPS indicates a strong product-market fit and the potential for recurring revenue streams from fleet contracts. However, the EV market is rapidly evolving, with increasing competition from established automotive manufacturers and new entrants. Xos will need to continuously innovate and possibly diversify its product offerings to maintain its market position.The introduction of the Xos Hub™ charging unit also highlights the company's holistic approach to fleet electrification, addressing not just vehicle manufacturing but also the infrastructure required for deployment.

For more information, please visit www.xostrucks.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe financial information in this press release has been presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") as well as on a non-GAAP basis to supplement Xos' consolidated financial results. Xos' non-GAAP financial measures include operating cash flow less CapEx (Free Cash Flow), non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP gross profit (loss), which are defined below.""Operating cash flow less CapEx (Free Cash Flow)"" is defined as net cash used in operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment.""Non-GAAP operating loss"" is defined as loss from operations adjusted for stock-based compensation, inventory write-downs, physical inventory and other adjustments, and ElectraMeccanica transaction costs and operating losses from before the close of the acquisition by Xos.""Non-GAAP gross profit (loss)"" is defined as gross profit (loss) minus inventory write-downs and physical inventory and other adjustments.Xos believes that the use of operating cash flow less CapEx (Free Cash Flow), non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP gross profit (loss) reflects additional means of evaluating Xos' ongoing operating results and trends. The presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that Xos' future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. It is important to note Xos' computation of operating cash flow less CapEx (Free Cash Flow), non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP gross profit (loss) may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because not all companies may calculate operating cash flow less CapEx (Free Cash Flow), non-GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP gross profit (loss) in the same fashion. Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported under GAAP when understanding Xos' operating performance. A reconciliation between historical GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is provided in this press release.This release includes a forward-looking outlook for non-GAAP operating loss. The Company is not able to provide, without unreasonable effort, a reconciliation of the outlook for non-GAAP operating loss because the Company does not currently have sufficient data to accurately estimate the variables and individual adjustments included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure that would be necessary for such reconciliations, including (a) stock-based compensation, (b) total operating expenses and (c) other nonrecurring expenses that cannot reasonably be estimated in advance. These adjustments are inherently variable and uncertain and depend on various factors that are beyond Xos' control and as a result Xos is also unable to predict their probable significance. Therefore, because management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort the impact these variables and individual adjustments will have on its reported results in accordance with GAAP, it is unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures included in its outlook for 2024.Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding projected financial and performance information for 2024; expectations and timing related to product deliveries and customer demand; sufficiency of existing cash reserves; customer acquisition and order metrics; ability to access additional capital and Xos' long-term strategy and future growth.

Forward-looking statements are predictions, projections and other statements about future events that are based on current expectations and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this press release, including but not limited to: (i) Xos' ability to implement business plans, forecasts, and other expectations, and identify and realize additional opportunities, (ii) Xos' limited operating history, (iii) cost increases and delays in production due to supply chain shortages in the components needed for the production of Xos' vehicle chassis and battery system, (iv) Xos' ability to meet production milestones and fulfill backlog orders, (v) changes in the industries in which Xos operates, (vi) variations in operating performance across competitors, (vii) changes in laws and regulations affecting Xos' business, (viii) Xos' ability to implement its business plan or meet or exceed its financial projections, (ix) Xos' ability to retain key personnel and hire additional personnel, particularly in light of current and potential labor shortages, (x) the risk of downturns and a changing regulatory landscape in the highly competitive electric vehicle industry, (xi) Xos' ability to service its indebtedness, (xii) macroeconomic and political conditions, and (xiii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against Xos. All forward-looking statements included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by, and you should carefully consider, the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties described under the heading ""Risk Factors"" included in Xos' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") on March 31, 2023 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 9, 2023, and Xos' other filings with the SEC, copies of which may be obtained by visiting Xos' Investors Relations website at https://investors.xostrucks.com/ or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.

These centers will stock large merchandise to better serve pro customers and reduce congestion in stores. The company is also enhancing its pro offerings with localized product assortment, digital tools, trade credit, tiered pricing, and the recent acquisition of Construction Resources. Positive None. Negative None. Supply Chain Management Expert The expansion of distribution centers by The Home Depot represents a strategic move to enhance its supply chain capabilities, particularly in serving professional customers. The addition of these centers is a response to the evolving demands of the pro segment, which requires quick and efficient access to larger quantities of building materials. By stocking items like lumber and roofing shingles in bulk, The Home Depot is positioning itself to offer more competitive delivery options directly to job sites, which could potentially reduce lead times and improve customer satisfaction.From a supply chain perspective, the geographical spread of these new centers is also significant. By choosing locations such as Detroit and Toronto, the company is not only expanding its North American footprint but also optimizing its logistics network to cater to both U.S. and Canadian markets. This could lead to cost savings in transportation and a stronger market presence in these regions. However, the success of this expansion will largely depend on the company's ability to manage the increased complexity of its supply chain and integrate these new facilities seamlessly into its existing network. Financial Analyst The opening of new distribution centers by The Home Depot is likely to have a notable impact on the company's financials. Initially, this expansion will require a substantial capital outlay, which may affect short-term profitability. Investors should monitor how this capital expenditure is balanced with the expected benefits of increased sales and market share, particularly within the professional customer segment.In the long term, the investment in distribution infrastructure is intended to drive sales growth by improving service levels for pro customers. If successful, this could lead to a stronger competitive position and potentially higher margins due to economies of scale. However, investors should consider the risks associated with large-scale investments, such as potential delays in opening the facilities or challenges in operational execution. Additionally, it's important to observe how these investments align with The Home Depot's overall financial strategy and whether they support sustainable growth. Market Research Analyst The Home Depot's decision to focus on the pro customer segment through enhanced distribution capabilities reflects an understanding of market trends. The professional segment in the home improvement industry is growing, driven by an increase in construction and renovation projects. By tailoring its offerings and creating a more efficient supply chain, The Home Depot is likely aiming to capture a larger share of this lucrative market.Furthermore, the acquisition of Construction Resources indicates a strategic move to integrate vertically and offer a wider range of products and services. This could help The Home Depot differentiate itself from competitors by providing a one-stop-shop experience for professional contractors. It will be important to track how this acquisition is integrated into The Home Depot's overall offerings and how it resonates with the pro customer base. Market research will be important in evaluating customer response to these new capabilities and the impact on The Home Depot's market position. 03/21/2024 - 03:00 PM Originally published on Built From ScratchATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2024 / The Home Depot is opening four new distribution centers, expanding its pro ecosystem to Detroit, southern Los Angeles, San Antonio and Toronto in 2024.

In addition, when jobsite deliveries are fulfilled directly from a distribution center, there is less congestion in local Home Depot stores from staged products in aisles and more inventory on hand to satisfy the needs of its in-store pro customers.""Pros need a partner with the right product, depth of product, fulfillment capabilities, sales support and management tools to help them get their jobs done,"" said Chip Devine, senior vice president of outside sales for The Home Depot. ""Over the last several years, we have been investing to deliver a faster, more convenient, differentiated experience for our pros. Our distribution network is one piece of the comprehensive pro ecosystem we're building to better meet the needs of this important customer.""The company has already opened similar pro-focused hubs across the U.S., and by the end of 2024, expects to have 17 of its top pro markets equipped with new capabilities for pros. In addition to the new supply chain facilities, The Home Depot is building out its comprehensive pro offerings and capabilities, including:Localized product assortment specially tailored for each priority market;A dedicated sales force in each of its priority markets;Digital tools and personalized experiences, including new order management capabilities to better manage complex pro orders;Trade credit, which is currently in pilot with a small number of pro customers; andTiered pro pricing.Adding to its pro capabilities, The Home Depot recently acquired Construction Resources, a leading distributor of design-oriented surfaces, appliances and architectural specialty products for pro contractors focused on renovation, remodeling and residential home building.

U.S. Patent Office rejects Axonics' latest challenge to Medtronic patents,2024-03-21T18:51:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Medtronic (MDT) wins PTAB affirmation of patent claims in ongoing infringement lawsuit against Axonics, plans to proceed to trial on five upheld patents.","U.S. Patent Office rejects Axonics' latest challenge to Medtronic patents Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Medtronic (MDT) wins PTAB affirmation of patent claims in ongoing infringement lawsuit against Axonics, plans to proceed to trial on five upheld patents. Positive None. Negative None. Legal Expert The affirmation of patent claims by the PTAB in Medtronic's favor is a pivotal development in the healthcare technology industry, especially in the specialized field of sacral neuromodulation (SNM) technologies. The legal process surrounding patent infringement is complex, involving multiple stages of litigation. The PTAB's role is to evaluate the validity of patents and their decision to uphold Medtronic's patents enhances the company's legal standing in the upcoming trial.The resumption of litigation could have significant financial implications for both Medtronic and Axonics. If Medtronic prevails, they may be entitled to monetary damages or an injunction against Axonics, which could limit their ability to compete in the SNM market. Conversely, for Axonics, a negative outcome could mean a substantial financial setback and a need to redesign products or license technology from Medtronic, affecting their market share and revenue.Furthermore, the additional complaint filed with the ITC indicates Medtronic's aggressive stance on protecting its intellectual property (IP) related to MRI-compatible devices. The outcome of this could set a precedent for future IP disputes in the medical device industry and influence the strategies of other companies regarding patent portfolios and litigation readiness. Financial Analyst Medtronic's push to resume patent infringement litigation could have a tangible impact on investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. Patent litigation can be a double-edged sword, potentially offering competitive advantages and financial gains while also incurring significant legal expenses and creating market uncertainty.Investors should monitor the progression of this case closely, as a victory for Medtronic could enhance its competitive moat and lead to increased royalty streams or settlements. On the other hand, prolonged litigation may lead to increased operational costs and distract management from other strategic initiatives. It's important to note that market reactions to such legal developments can be mixed, as the potential for future earnings must be weighed against the immediate costs and risks associated with the litigation process.The stock market often favors companies with strong IP portfolios, viewing them as better positioned to defend their market share and sustain long-term profitability. In this context, Medtronic's proactive defense of its patents could be seen as reinforcing its market leadership in the SNM sector. Medical Technology Analyst The field of sacral neuromodulation is gaining traction as a treatment for various conditions like overactive bladder and fecal incontinence. Medtronic's patents in this area are central to their strategic positioning within the market. The PTAB's decision to uphold these patents confirms the company's innovation capacity and technical leadership.From a technology standpoint, patents serve as a barrier to entry for competitors and can lead to a form of monopoly power within certain segments. Medtronic's ability to defend its patents successfully could discourage potential competitors from entering the market or force them to innovate around existing patents, which could slow down the pace of innovation in the short term.The MRI compatibility of implantable medical devices is another critical area of focus, as it directly impacts patient safety and the versatility of treatment options. Medtronic's actions to protect its patents in this domain underscore the importance of compatibility features in the competitive landscape of medical devices. This could push other companies to prioritize R&D in MRI-safe technologies, shaping the future direction of medical device development. 03/21/2024 - 02:51 PM Medtronic moves for patent infringement litigation to resume DUBLIN, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in healthcare technology, today announced that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has affirmed the validity of claims in two of its patents in an ongoing patent infringement lawsuit filed by Medtronic against Axonics over sacral neuromodulation (SNM) technologies. Cumulatively, the PTAB has now upheld the validity of five of the Medtronic patents at issue in this lawsuit. Medtronic will now ask the federal court in the Central District of California, where Medtronic's patent infringement lawsuit is pending, to lift its stay on the lawsuit and proceed to trial on the five valid and affirmed patents so Medtronic can present its case in front of a jury. ""It's now past time for Axonics to stand up in a court of law and take responsibility for its unauthorized use and infringement of Medtronic's intellectual property,"" said Mira Sahney, president of the pelvic health business in the neuroscience portfolio at Medtronic. ""We respect the intellectual property of innovators, and our patent system exists to benefit society by encouraging the kind of innovation that Medtronic invests in. We are pleased with the PTAB's decision, and we are confident that the evidence at trial will show that Axonics improperly used and profited from Medtronic's patented technology."" Medtronic also filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) along with a parallel action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware to block Axonics from improperly importing and selling products that infringe two additional Medtronic patents related to the MRI compatibility of implantable medical devices.

Positive None. Negative None. Labor Relations Expert Southwest Airlines' ratification of the collective bargaining agreement with Transport Workers Union Local 555 is a significant development in the labor relations landscape of the aviation industry. The contract, covering a substantial portion of the airline's workforce, is indicative of Southwest's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in employee relations.

Moreover, the inclusion of company-paid maternity and parental leaves reflects a growing trend in employee benefits that can attract and retain talent in a competitive labor market.From a financial perspective, the compensation increases and bonuses could result in higher operational costs in the short term. However, the potential for increased efficiency and employee satisfaction may offset these costs in the long term through reduced turnover and improved operational performance. Stakeholders should monitor the company's quarterly financials to assess the impact of these increased labor costs on Southwest's profitability. Financial Analyst The announcement by Southwest Airlines regarding the new labor contract is a strategic move that could impact the company's financial health. Investors should note that while immediate costs in terms of increased compensation and bonuses may impact earnings, the long-term benefits could include enhanced productivity and reduced employee turnover. Additionally, the contract's provisions for efficiency investments signal a forward-looking approach to operational management. This could lead to cost savings and improved service delivery, which are key drivers of revenue growth in the airline industry.It is also important to consider the broader economic context. In a period of potential inflationary pressures, increased labor costs might affect the company's pricing strategies and fare competitiveness. As a result, the balance between managing labor costs and maintaining market share will be important for Southwest's financial performance going forward. Market Research Analyst The ratification of the collective bargaining agreement by Southwest Airlines has broader implications for the competitive dynamics of the airline industry. It sets a benchmark for labor contracts that other carriers may need to match to stay competitive in attracting and retaining skilled workers. This could lead to a ripple effect across the industry, potentially increasing overall labor costs.Furthermore, the agreement's emphasis on customer service and operational efficiency aligns with key industry trends that prioritize the customer experience. As airlines recover from the impacts of global events such as the pandemic, they are increasingly focusing on operational excellence to regain customer trust and loyalty.

Through collaborative efforts, PGE expects significant cost savings and improved energy efficiency, benefiting both the company and its customers. Positive Portland General Electric (POR) announced plans to join CAISO's Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) to provide more affordable, reliable, and clean energy. PGE anticipates gross cost savings between $6 million and $18 million annually by participating in the EDAM. The EDAM is expected to optimize generation resources and energy needs, offering the least costly and cleanest energy for participants. The market leverages PGE's existing technology and transmission system to connect regional resources and enhance energy efficiency. Negative None. Energy Market Analyst The integration of Portland General Electric (PGE) into the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) is a strategic move that could reshape the energy procurement landscape for PGE and its customers. By tapping into a broader energy market, PGE is positioning itself to leverage economies of scale and increased operational efficiencies. The projected gross cost savings of $6 million to $18 million annually are non-trivial, indicating a tangible bottom-line benefit. However, these savings are contingent on the final number of participants, which introduces a variable that investors should monitor.From a market dynamics perspective, the EDAM's optimization of generation resources could lead to more competitive pricing and resource allocation. This could, in turn, impact the profitability of PGE's generating assets and their market value. Moreover, the emphasis on clean energy within the EDAM aligns with increasing regulatory pressures and public demand for sustainable energy solutions, potentially offering PGE a reputational boost and aligning with long-term investment trends in renewable energy. Environmental Policy Analyst PGE's decision to join the EDAM is not only a business decision but also a reflection of a broader shift towards sustainable energy practices. By emphasizing access to cleaner power, PGE is acknowledging the importance of environmental stewardship in its business model. The EDAM's ability to facilitate access to renewable energy sources like hydropower, wind and solar aligns with state and federal mandates for carbon reduction. This strategic alignment may improve PGE's positioning for future regulatory compliance and could serve as a hedge against the risks associated with carbon-intensive energy production.Furthermore, the collaborative approach taken by PGE and CAISO in developing the EDAM signals a proactive stance in shaping energy policy and market structures. This could enhance PGE's influence in regional energy discussions and policy-making, potentially leading to favorable regulatory outcomes. Investors should consider the long-term implications of PGE's environmental policy alignment on its market position and the potential for enhanced regulatory relationships. Financial Analyst The financial implications of PGE's participation in the EDAM are multifaceted. While the anticipated cost savings are a clear positive, the impact on PGE's financials will depend on the market's operational success and adoption rate. The initial investment in technology and systems to facilitate participation in the EDAM and the associated integration costs, should be weighed against the projected savings. Investors should seek clarity on the capital expenditures involved and the timeline for cost recovery through market operations.Additionally, the announcement may have implications for PGE's stock performance. Investors often react favorably to initiatives that promise operational efficiencies and cost reductions. However, the market's reaction will also depend on the perceived execution risk and the potential for unforeseen challenges as the EDAM becomes operational. The long-term financial health of PGE may benefit from the diversification of energy sources and the increased market access provided by the EDAM, but these benefits must be balanced against the risks inherent in any significant market transition. 03/21/2024 - 02:50 PM Participation in California Independent System Operator (CAISO) Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) to enhance affordability, reliability and access to clean power. PORTLAND, Ore., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Portland General Electric (NYSE:POR) announced plans to join the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM) to help provide Portland General Electric (PGE) and the customers it serves with access to more affordable, reliable and clean energy. ""Joining the CAISO Extended Day-Ahead Market is a significant next step toward an integrated regional system that will deliver cost savings and enhanced reliability for PGE customers,"" said Maria Pope, PGE president and CEO. ""Together with CAISO and multiple stakeholders, PGE worked extensively to help develop this market to lower power costs, increase resilience and access more clean energy sources across the West."" Broader footprint helps reduce power costs for customers PGE's decision involved years of collaborative work shaping regional market options, and followed months of engagement in the stakeholder process to develop the EDAM and an alternative offering. Cost benefit analysis research commissioned by PGE concluded the EDAM is likely to provide the greatest economic benefit compared to alternative market options. By joining the EDAM, PGE anticipates gross cost savings between $6 million and $18 million annually based on current modeling, depending on the final number of EDAM participants. The EDAM is expected to begin operating in 2026. Utilities that participate in the market will bid their anticipated energy demand and generating resources into the market a day ahead of expected usage. The market will then optimize generation resources and the energy needed for all market participants, allowing them to receive the least costly and cleanest energy to meet their growing energy needs. The EDAM takes advantage of existing technology and systems PGE has deployed and leverages PGE's transmission system to connect regional resources across a common market, such as hydropower and wind facilities in the Pacific Northwest and solar facilities in California and the desert Southwest. EDAM builds on proven platform The EDAM extends the success of CAISO's Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), a real-time, wholesale energy market that PGE joined in 2017 and that produces cost savings for PGE customers. The WEIM has enabled more integration of renewable power and improved grid reliability by increasing operational visibility across the market footprint and coordinating transmission dispatch. In addition to PGE, other utilities that have signaled intent to pursue participation in the EDAM are PacifiCorp, which serves customers in California and five other Western states, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Balancing Area of Northern California, which includes the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.

SmartMetric is nearing commercialization with mass production capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. 03/21/2024 - 02:10 PM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SmartMetric, Inc. (OTC: SMME): Up to 80% of all credit cards in circulation have been compromised. Studies suggest that as many as eight in ten credit cards that are currently issued have already been compromised by some sort of hack or data breach.1 SmartMetric leads the world in biometric credit card technology in having developed a biometric credit card that has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the fingerprint scanning of the card user independent of card reading terminals and ATMs. This allows the SmartMetric biometric card to be able to used “anywhere and anytime” a card holder wants to use their new biometric card. “With so many credit card data breaches leaving a card holders credit card information in the hands of card fraud criminals, the use of on card biometric identity validation security, has become a necessity,"" said SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick. The advanced SmartMetric biometric card has many other features not least is its hardware-based detection of a live finger. This provides the card with added security against fake fingerprint replicas making the SmartMetric biometric card the most secure card developed. SmartMetric’s card enrolls a user’s fingerprint easily and as frictionless as experienced when enrolling a fingerprint on a smart phone. On receipt of the card, the user simply touches the card's fingerprint sensor four times. This stores the user's fingerprint permanently in the card making the card only useable when the owner of the card touches the sensor to turn on the card at the time they wish to make a payment. In Q4 2022, credit card users reached a total of 166 million according to TransUnion, up from the prior three years. Among those users, new card accounts are growing, too. Over the past year, nearly half the population (47.5%) opened at least one new account, bringing the total number of accounts to over 518 million by the end of 2022 in the United States. 2 Market research has shown that 70% of current credit card users are willing to pay $70.00 for a biometric fingerprint secured credit card. The single largest motivation is wanting to be more secure and better protected against credit card fraud. SmartMetric will soon be offering its biometric credit card product with an inbuilt inside the card fingerprint scanner. The SmartMetric biometric credit card is in the final stages of the card's lamination process. The credit card lamination is where the card's circuit board and electronics are encased in credit card plastic. This is the last stage of the manufacturing process which will allow SmartMetric to start to present its completed biometric GEN4 card to credit card issuers. SmartMetric has set up its production to allow for mass card production. The company is now able to manufacture over a million cards per month with this being able to be increased substantially over the next 6 months. “We are excited to have finally reached the stage of commercialization of our one of a kind advanced fingerprint activated biometric credit card,"" said SmartMetric’s President and CEO, Chaya Hendrick.

Average monthly apartment rents have increased by $6 in 2024, reversing previous mild rent cuts. Vacancy rate remains steady at 5.9%, showing positive results despite high product completion. National vacancy among stabilized Class A communities remains unchanged, signaling resilience. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent report by Marcus & Millichap on multifamily performance statistics provides insights that are pertinent to investors and stakeholders in the real estate sector. The observed increase in average monthly apartment rents, albeit modest, is a reversal from the downward trend in the latter half of the previous year. This change suggests a potential stabilization in the rental market, which could be indicative of broader economic trends such as increased demand or a decrease in new construction completions. Furthermore, the steadiness in national vacancy rates, despite a significant influx of new properties, could signal a robust absorption rate. This is particularly noteworthy in markets like the San Francisco Bay Area and Nashville, where the dynamics of supply and demand are visibly at play.From an investment perspective, these metrics are valuable for identifying regions with growth potential. The highlighted markets with significant momentum may attract investor attention due to their stronger performance indicators. However, it's also important to consider the broader economic context, including employment rates, population growth and local regulatory environments, which can all impact multifamily market dynamics. The fact that Class A communities are maintaining occupancy levels even with rent concessions could suggest a market preference for higher-end units, which may influence investment strategies. Real Estate Economist The details provided in the Markets with Momentum report have implications for the economic outlook of the real estate market. A $6 increase in rent, while seemingly insignificant, can accumulate to a considerable revenue boost across a large portfolio of properties. This increment might reflect an uptick in inflation or a recovering job market, enabling renters to afford slightly higher rates. The vacancy rate holding steady at 5.9% aligns with historical norms, suggesting that the market is neither oversupplied nor undersupplied. This balance is important for maintaining healthy market conditions and avoiding the pitfalls of either a glut or a shortage of housing.For metro areas like Nashville, where there is aggressive delivery volume, the slight increase in pricing despite a large supply indicates a strong local economy and possibly a growing population that's absorbing the new inventory. These factors are vital for real estate investors and developers who look for signals of where to allocate capital. Investors may find opportunities in markets showing unexpected momentum, but should proceed with caution and thorough market analysis to understand the unique factors driving each local economy. Financial Analyst The report from Marcus & Millichap has implications for the financial performance of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other investment vehicles focused on the multifamily sector. The positive rent growth and stable vacancy rates are indicators of a healthy market, which could lead to strong revenue and profitability for companies within this space. Investors should monitor these trends closely as they can affect the valuations and dividend payouts of REITs.Moreover, the specific markets identified as having significant momentum could be of particular interest. For instance, REITs with exposure to the San Francisco Bay Area or Nashville may experience enhanced performance relative to the broader market. It's essential, however, to analyze the underlying fundamentals of each market, as well as the specific assets and management strategies of the REITs in question. While the report is optimistic, investors should also be wary of potential headwinds such as interest rate hikes, which could increase borrowing costs and dampen investment returns. 03/21/2024 - 02:35 PM CALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marcus & Millichap (NYSE:MMI), a leading commercial real estate brokerage firm specializing in investment sales, financing, research and advisory services, announced today it has released its Markets with Momentum report. The report cites key national multifamily performance statistics from February on rent growth, lease renewals, and vacancy. Five select markets with significant momentum are highlighted. “While markets that registered the most performance momentum early this year are mostly in areas where solid results were anticipated, a handful of markets showed unexpected performance momentum in early 2024,” said John Sebree, national director of Multi Housing Division, Marcus & Millichap and IPA. Highlights of the report include: Nationally, average monthly apartment rents have climbed $6 so far in 2024. This small improvement reverses the trend of mild rent cuts seen during the last half of 2023. Vacancy in the nation is holding steady with the end-of-2023 performance at 5.9%, an encouraging result given the big block of product completed in what is normally a slow leasing period. Select metros with significant momentum so far in 2024 are the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Seattle-Tacoma, and Washington, D.C. Metro Nashville is also noteworthy in that pricing is inching up in the face of one of the country’s most aggressive delivery volumes. “In a particularly encouraging result, national vacancy among stabilized Class A communities was unchanged during the first two months of 2024, even when sizable rent concessions were offered at the newest luxury properties still going through the initial lease-up process,” said Greg Willett, national director, research services, IPA.

Negative None. 03/21/2024 - 01:44 PM Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 21, 2024) - Pacific Empire Minerals Corp. (TSXV: PEMC) (""Pacific Empire"", ""PEMC"" or the ""Company""), a British Columbia copper-gold explorer, announces Expert Geophysics Ltd. (""Expert"") will be conducting an airborne MobileMT™ survey at its 100% owned Trident and Pinnacle copper-gold projects in the South Hogem Copper-Gold Belt prior to the end of March.HighlightsMagnetoTelluric (MT) survey is scheduled to begin March 27, 2024.MagnetoTelluric (MT) survey method capable of detecting basement electromagnetic (EM) conductors and anomalous resistivity zones which are indicative of potential copper-gold porphyry systems.Planned surveying totals 164 line-kilometres to provide coverage of primary target area (historical assays at Trident which include DDH-1971-13: 70.07m @ 0.69% Cu, DDH 2007-2: 100.00m @ 0.59% Cu and 0.18 g/t Au including 2.00m @ 2.73% Cu and 0.36 g/t Au).The MT survey will also cover an additional target located on PEMC's 100% owned Pinnacle Property situated directly west and adjacent to the Trident. Utilization of this modern geophysical dataset will facilitate the identification and prioritization of target areas for drilling currently anticipated during the Summer/Fall 2024 exploration season.Brad Peters, President, CEO & Director, commented: ""We are excited to begin the survey and are looking forward to being able to see to depths of over one kilometre beneath the surface at our 100% owned Trident and Pinnacle projects, west of Centerra Gold's operating Mount Milligan copper-gold mine. The objective is to identify potential ""plumbing systems ""because if you are looking for large copper deposits you need a large plumbing system to deliver the necessary fluids and metals. Our goal is simple, discover the next gold-enriched copper porphyry deposit within this district. Once results are received and analyzed for this MT survey, we currently anticipate drilling these targets during the Summer/Fall 2024 field season. Trident for the very first time is 100% owned by a public company with an updated porphyry geological model established by our skilled technical team.""Planned SurveyThe purpose of the survey is to identify conductivity/resistivity anomalies that may represent conduits for hydrothermal fluids critical in the formation of porphyry copper-gold deposits. These conduits have the potential to represent critical plumbing systems responsible for the formation of copper porphyry deposits. The gathering of both resistivity and conductivity imaging of the surface to a depth of 1 km through deploying an airborne MobileMT (Mobile MagnetoTellurics) system will provide key information pertaining to source fluid conduits and structures. This important step will provide valuable insights and aid to further both known and unknown exploration targets destined for follow up diamond drilling programs.In addition, complimentary VLF (Very Low Frequency) data will be collected and interpreted to provide valuable near surface EM (Electromagnetic) information. The survey design plan is to conduct approximately 164 line-km's using a 200 m line spacing grid.The survey will be performed with an Astar 350 B2 helicopter provided by Heli Source Ltd. Expert Geophysics Ltd. (""EGL"") will provide all necessary instrumentation for installation on the helicopter, as well as base stations and field workstations (data processing system) to be used for quality control and processing management during the collection of the airborne data in the field.The final data processing, colour imaging and mapping will be performed at EGL's offices in Toronto, Canada. The final results and resulting products are expected to be available to the PEMC exploration team within 3 weeks after the completion of the survey. Surveying is planned to commence on or around March 27, 2024 and expected to take 3 to 5 days to complete.About Mobile MagnetoTelluric Surveys The latest development in the airborne MobileMT system, provides a depth of investigation from the near-surface to over 1 km and detects resistivity variations across a wide range, encompassing conductive targets and structures as well as highly resistive ones. Porphyry and epithermal mineralization systems develop in conditions of active subduction and they are characterized by a wide variety of structural, lithological, and alteration patterns, which, at least partially, can be depicted in geoelectrical images.The following two examples demonstrate the effectiveness of resistivity mapping and sounding using the MobileMT system. Both examples from MobileMT surveys are presented over areas with known porphyry and epithermal mineralization systems and mineralization-controlling structures. The recovered resistivity-depth images are compared with actual geology or conceptual geological models of the mineralization systems, which illustrate the system's capabilities in imaging the mineralization systems and their diverse geometries and wide resistivity range.Poplar Cu-Mo porphyry Deposit (BC, Canada)Figure 1 - Example of calc-alkaline porphyry deposit from British Columbia characterized by elevated conductivity flanked by elevated resistivity.

The property is located approximately 50 km to the southeast of NorthWest Copper Corp.'s Kwanika Deposit and 50 km to the northwest of Centerra Gold's Mt. Milligan Mine. The property covers 6,618 hectares endowed with well-established logging roads providing important efficient access for exploration programs.Copper mineralization on the property was first discovered in 1969, while exploration crews were following up on anomalous stream sediment samples. The following year, Falconbridge optioned the property and over the next two years completed IP and magnetic surveys, geological mapping, soil sampling and diamond drilling. This work led to the discovery of the A Zone.Additional exploration programs were completed by Kookaburra Gold Corp. from 1988 through 1991, Solomon Resources Ltd., from 2006 through 2008. In 2013, PEMC optioned the property and in 2014, in turn, PEMC optioned the property to Oz Minerals which completed that same year an IP survey and completed a two drillhole, diamond drill program at Trident.In 2022, Pacific Empire acquired a 100% interest in the property in exchange for granting the vendors a 2% net smelter return royalty (""NSR""). One-half (1%) of the 2% NSR may be purchased for $500,000 by Pacific Empire.Prior to 2014, known mineralization on the property was believed to be associated with fracture and/or shear zones structures striking 120 degrees and dipping 75 degrees towards the northeast. A review of historical drill core by the Pacific Empire exploration team has led to a much different interpretation with respect to the nature of known mineralization on the property. The most important observation was the determination of the presence of hornblende-feldspar monzonite porphyry intrusions detected within drill core obtained from the A Zone. These types of porphyry intrusions are typically characterized by sheeted quartz sulphide veins and disseminated chalcopyrite and bornite residing immediately adjacent to and within the porphyry dikes. Other observations include; The highest grades noted in historical drilling can be seen to be directly associated with intervals where such porphyry intrusions occur.Figure 3 - Regional Land Position and Significant CompaniesTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5412/202348_e44ba46bd413ebcc_004full.jpgFigure 4 - Location of planned MagnetoTelluric SurveyTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5412/202348_e44ba46bd413ebcc_005full.jpgFigure 5 - Soth Hogem Copper-Gold BeltTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5412/202348_e44ba46bd413ebcc_006full.jpg""Between our 100% owned Trident and Pinnacle projects runs the Klawli river. The gold flakes and nuggets in the vial displayed on the map were collected from that location on the Klawli river. It is this and other geochemical evidence gathered by the PEMC exploration team which leads us to postulate the potential for a gold-enriched copper system nearby on either Trident, Pinnacle, or possibly both projects. To date, visible gold has been observed in outcrop at Trident, placer gold discovered in the nearby Klawli river gravels, and as well gold detected in drill core from Pinnacle. All three of these known occurrences of gold and their respective locations suggests there may be a shallow buried, large scale, gold-enriched, copper porphyry deposit within our district scale land package,"" commented Brad Peters, President, CEO and Director of Pacific Empire.Table 1 - Highlights from Historical Drilling at TridentTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5412/202348_e44ba46bd413ebcc_007full.jpgAbout PinnacleThe Pinnacle project is located 60 km to the west of Centerra Gold's Mt.

A Definitive Feasibility Study for the Kabanga Nickel Project is expected to be completed by Q3 2024. Negative None. Metallurgical Engineer The granting of the Multi-Metal Processing Facility Licence to Lifezone Metals Limited for their Kabanga Nickel Project represents a significant technological and economic milestone. The use of Hydromet Technology, as opposed to traditional pyrometallurgical smelting, is poised to revolutionize the metals recovery process. This technology not only has the potential to reduce emissions and energy consumption but also to lower operational costs by eliminating the need to transport concentrates for offshore processing.From a metallurgical standpoint, the ability to refine nickel, copper and cobalt in-country through hydrometallurgy could set a new industry standard, particularly for regions rich in these resources but lacking the infrastructure for full beneficiation. The environmental benefits, coupled with the economic advantages of local processing, are likely to attract further investment and could position Tanzania as a hub for cleaner metal production, especially for electric vehicle batteries, which are increasingly in demand. Environmental Economist The establishment of the Kahama Special Economic Zone (SEZ) as a site for Lifezone Metals' refinery is a strategic move that can be expected to yield numerous economic advantages. SEZs typically offer tax incentives, streamlined regulations and other support measures that can significantly enhance the profitability and viability of large-scale projects. The localization of the entire value chain within the SEZ is likely to stimulate the regional economy through job creation and infrastructure development.Moreover, the transition from a mining-focused economy to one that includes processing and refining adds value locally and can lead to a more diversified economic base. The potential for increased formal and informal employment opportunities, as highlighted by the Shinyanga Regional Commissioner, further underscores the socioeconomic impact of this project. However, it is important to monitor the long-term sustainability of such developments, ensuring that economic growth does not come at the expense of environmental degradation or social inequality. Market Research Analyst The announcement of Lifezone Metals Limited's progress in Tanzania is likely to be received favorably by the market, especially by investors interested in the mining and metals sector. The ability to refine multiple metals within the country is a significant differentiator that could enhance the company's competitive edge. Additionally, the project's alignment with global trends, such as the push for lower emissions and the growth of the electric vehicle market, positions Lifezone Metals to capitalize on these expanding industries.Investors should note the potential for reduced capital and operating costs due to the 'plug-and-play' nature of the infrastructure at the Kahama Refinery site. The reuse of legacy infrastructure from the Buzwagi Gold Mine is a strategic cost-saving measure that could lead to higher margins and lower risk for the project. Furthermore, the company's decision to avoid taking on legacy liabilities from the Buzwagi Gold Mine's closure is a prudent one that may reassure investors looking for a sustainable and responsible mining operation. 03/21/2024 - 12:51 PM Kahama Area Formally Declared a Special Economic Zone Marks Another Important Step for Tanzania Towards Establishing Transformational Method of Metals Recovery and Full In-Country Beneficiation NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lifezone Metals Limited’s (NYSE: LZM) Chief Executive Officer, Chris Showalter, is pleased to announce that the Company has received a Multi-Metal Processing Facility Licence from the Government of Tanzania to refine nickel, copper and cobalt from its Kabanga Nickel Project at Kahama, located beside Barrick Gold’s former Buzwagi Gold Mine. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240321815251/en/Lifezone’s CEO, Chris Showalter, receives the Kahama Refinery Licence with a handshake from the Minister of Minerals, Hon. Anthony Mavunde. (Photo: Business Wire) The Kabanga Nickel Project is located in the north-west Tanzania and is believed to be one of the world’s largest and highest-grade undeveloped nickel sulfide deposits. The Kahama Multi-Metal Processing Facility (“the Kahama Refinery”) site is located approximately 340 kilometers south-west of Kabanga. Lifezone’s subsidiary, Tembo Nickel Corporation Ltd. (“Tembo Nickel”) is the operating entity for Kabanga and Kahama, and is 16% owned by the Government of Tanzania. Notably, through the application of Lifezone’s Hydromet Technology, Kabanga and Kahama will be able to produce finished metals in-country, potentially reducing capital and operating costs, as well as reducing costs associated with transport of concentrate or other intermediate products. Full in-country beneficiation will contribute towards local content optimization and eventually national development through the principle of equitable sharing of economic benefits. A Definitive Feasibility Study for the Kabanga Nickel Project remains on track for completion by Q3 2024. Lifezone Metals’ Hydromet Technology is a transformational method of metals recovery that has the potential to replace smelting for base and precious metals refining. Pyrometallurgical smelting is one of the largest contributors to pollutive gas emissions, greenhouse gases and energy inefficiency in the production of metals products and the use of Hydromet Technology will help to unlock nickel, copper and cobalt from Kabanga, providing lower cost, lower emissions (relative to smelting) and traceable metals for Electric Vehicles batteries and to support the global energy transition. Mr. Showalter stated: “The ongoing level of commitment and support that we have received from the Government of Tanzania in the advancement of our Kabanga Nickel Project is exemplary. With the receipt of our Kabanga Special Mining Licence, and now the Kahama Refinery Licence, we have a clear path to delivering a direct-to-metal solution and enabling the production of nickel, copper and cobalt in Tanzania and by Tanzanians.” Speaking at the ceremony, Minister of Minerals, Hon. Anthony Mavunde stated (translated from Swahili): “The construction of a multi-metals refinery will be a solution to metals mining companies in country that are forced to export concentrates to refineries abroad. I urge all miners who have been experiencing this challenge to work closely with the Government to ensure that we all succeed in ensuring full in-country beneficiation is achieved in the mining sector, by processing in-country and exporting finished products. […] Today’s event is a historical one for our country, as we progress to having a large multi-metal refinery that will use hydrometallurgy technology.” In addition, the Shinyanga Regional Commissioner, Hon. Anamringi Macha said (translated from Swahili): “The investment by Tembo Nickel’s Multi-Metals Refinery will help change the face of the Kahama district and the Shinyanga Region by increasing formal and informal employment opportunities for citizens, but it is also another step in the history of Shinyanga region; where the mining sector has played a major role in the economic development of our region.” The issuance of the Kahama Refinery License follows the formal gazettement of the Special Economic Zone (Declaration) Notice, 2024 which declared the Buzwagi Mining Area, within Kahama District in Shinyanga Region, a Special Economic Zone. The Kahama Refinery will be located within the Special Economic Zone, which will provide certain tax and other economic benefits for the Project. In addition, the Kahama Refinery stands to benefit from access to a highly trained workforce and legacy infrastructure from the Buzwagi Gold Mine, including existing camp and office buildings, regional power connections, airstrip, road connections and railway in near proximity. This “plug-and-play” industrial hub brings significant project execution and capital cost benefits, as well as turning a past-producing mine liability into a long-term asset. Lifezone will not be taking on any legacy liabilities in relation to the closure of the Buzwagi Gold Mine. If you would like to sign up for Lifezone Metals news alerts, please register here.

(NYSE: AGR), joined SUNY Broome today to celebrate the grand reopening of the college’s Hornet Hope Center, a newly upgraded on-campus food pantry and clothing closet. This new student resource center was made possible thanks to a $100,000 grant from the Avangrid Foundation, continuing the Foundation’s commitment to supporting food security. Last year, the Avangrid Foundation, New York State Electric & Gas (NYSEG), and Rochester Gas and Electric (RG&E) donated in total more than $300,000 to nonprofits addressing food insecurity across New York state. “Today’s college students face serious financial challenges—the cost of education is on the rise, as is rent, food, and textbooks,” said Pedro Azagra, Avangrid CEO. “Food insecurity can be detrimental to a student’s academic performance and their health. We’re very proud to support the expansion of the Hornet Hope Center at SUNY Broome so that students have a safe space on campus to access support when they need it. A student’s focus should be on their schoolwork, not worrying about where their next meal will come from.” SUNY Broome’s Hornet Hope Center provides students in need with access to nutritious and heart-healthy food, clothing, and personal hygiene products for men, women, infants, and children. The clothing bank includes essential seasonal items, like winter coats, and professional clothing and footwear for students to wear for interviews, job fairs, and internships. The Avangrid Foundation grant allowed the Center to move to a larger, newly renovated space on campus with energy-efficient lighting. SUNY Broome is proud to partner with Community Hunger Outreach Warehouse (CHOW), a network of food pantries in Broome County, to assist in stocking the food pantry, open to students during regular daytime hours and by appointment. The pantry is staffed by students and other campus volunteers. “Our role as a community college is to support our students not only in their educational pursuits but in every aspect of their lives. Students cannot thrive academically if their basic needs, such as food and clothing, are not met,” said Dr. Tony Hawkins, president of SUNY Broome Community College. “The Avangrid Foundation understands the importance of this resource, and their generosity made the relocation, renovation, and reopening of the campus food pantry and clothing closet a reality.” “Studies show that more than one in three community college students do not have enough to eat,” said Pablo Colón, director of corporate citizenship at Avangrid and executive director of the Avangrid Foundation. “This statistic is staggering and highlights the need for initiatives like the Hornet Hope Center on campuses. This Center is unique because not only will it address food insecurity, but it will also address the growing issue of hygiene poverty by providing essential personal hygiene products and providing students with access to professional clothing for job interviews through the clothing bank. The Avangrid Foundation is very proud to support initiatives like this that address the underlying barriers students face and set them up for success beyond college.” “It's important that our students have the basic resources they need,” said Broome County Executive Jason Garnar. “Thanks to the Avangrid Foundation’s support, SUNY Broome’s Hornet Hope Center can do even more for those in need. This partnership shows how businesses can make a positive impact in our community and make a real difference in the lives of our students.” “I am so pleased to see the Avangrid Foundation grant the SUNY Broome’s Hornet Hope Center $100,000,” said Assemblyman Joe Angelino. “Making sure all students at our SUNY schools have basic necessities such as food and clothing is of the utmost importance. I’m glad to see this private-public partnership working to address this issue.” “Expanding services and support for students at our public educational organizations is important, and I am thrilled to recognize the Avangrid Foundation for stepping up to fund the expansion of SUNY Broome’s Hornet Hope Center, which provides students in need with access to nutritious food and other essentials,” said Michael Marinaccio, town of Dickinson supervisor. “Supporting students is vital to the future of Broome County.” About Avangrid Foundation: The Avangrid Foundation is an independent, nonprofit organization that funds philanthropic investments that primarily impact communities where Avangrid, Inc. and its subsidiaries operate.

MILLER INDUSTRIES ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDER LETTER,2024-03-21T17:14:00.000Z,Moderate,Neutral,"Miller Industries, Inc. responds to Advisory Research's call for a strategic review process, emphasizing the success of their current growth strategy with a 48.4% total shareholder return over the past year.","MILLER INDUSTRIES ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO SHAREHOLDER LETTER Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Miller Industries, Inc. responds to Advisory Research's call for a strategic review process, emphasizing the success of their current growth strategy with a 48.4% total shareholder return over the past year. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The call by Advisory Research for Miller Industries to form a special committee and conduct a strategic review is a significant event that warrants attention from a market research perspective. The company's defense, citing a 48.4% total shareholder return over the past year, suggests a strong recent performance. However, the push for a strategic review typically arises when investors believe there are untapped opportunities or inefficiencies in the current strategy that could be hindering further growth or maximizing shareholder value.It is important to understand that such calls can often lead to corporate actions like divestitures, acquisitions, or even changes in management that could potentially unlock value. The response from Miller Industries indicates a confidence in their existing growth strategy, which may be rooted in their market position as the 'World's Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment'. Yet, the market will likely keep a close watch on this development, as investor activism can lead to significant changes that might affect the company's stock performance.From a market research standpoint, the key will be to monitor the company's performance indicators closely, such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on equity, to assess whether the current strategy continues to yield results in line with or above industry benchmarks. Additionally, the sentiment and actions of other shareholders in response to Advisory Research's public statement could influence the stock's volatility in the near term. Financial Analyst Investors are often interested in the dynamics between a company's management and its shareholders, especially when it involves strategic decision-making and potential conflicts. In this case, the disagreement between Miller Industries' board and Advisory Research highlights a critical aspect of investor relations. Miller Industries' reference to a 48.4% shareholder return is a strong indicator of past performance, but the financial analyst community would scrutinize whether this performance is sustainable under the current strategy.Financial analysts would also evaluate the company's valuation metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratios, in comparison to industry peers to determine if the stock is currently undervalued or overvalued. This assessment could provide context to Advisory Research's claims regarding the need for a strategic review. If the company's valuation is indeed lower than its intrinsic value, there might be merit to the argument for exploring alternative strategies.Furthermore, the financial implications of any strategic changes, such as costs associated with restructuring or the potential for unlocking hidden value within the company's assets, would be of interest. Analysts would project how these changes could affect future earnings, cash flow and ultimately, shareholder returns. The long-term financial health of Miller Industries, including its debt levels and liquidity, would also be considered to ensure that the company is positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities or withstand market downturns. Investor Relations Expert The public disagreement between Miller Industries and one of its shareholders, Advisory Research, is a matter of concern from an investor relations standpoint. The tone and content of the exchange can influence investor perception and confidence in the company's governance and strategic direction. The board's willingness to engage in dialogue and review its corporate strategy is positive, but the outright dismissal of Advisory Research's claims could be perceived as a reluctance to consider alternative viewpoints or strategies that may benefit shareholders.Investor relations professionals would advise maintaining a balanced communication strategy that addresses shareholder concerns without appearing defensive or dismissive. Transparency in how the company evaluates and implements its growth strategy is essential to maintain trust. Additionally, the investor relations team would likely monitor the reaction of the broader investment community to this exchange, as it could impact investor sentiment and the company's reputation in the market.It's also worth noting that such public disputes can attract the attention of other activist investors, potentially leading to a more concerted effort to influence the company's strategic direction. The company must be prepared to navigate these challenges while ensuring that its communication with shareholders is clear, factual and focused on the long-term interests of the company and its investors. 03/21/2024 - 01:14 PM CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Miller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLR) (""Miller Industries"" or the ""Company""), the World's Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment, today responded to a public statement issued by Advisory Research, a shareholder in Miller Industries, calling on the Miller Industries Board of Directors (the ""Board"") to form a special committee and conduct a strategic review process. Ted Ashford, Lead Independent Director commented, ""Our Board routinely reviews our corporate strategy and is willing to discuss and challenge management's plans for value creation. At this time, the Board believes that the execution of our current plan and growth strategy, which has driven 48.4% in total shareholder return over the past year, is the best means to maximize long-term shareholder value and drive continued positive change. We're disappointed, but perhaps not surprised that after months of earnest engagement, Advisory Research has concluded that it is not willing to put its thesis to a vote to shareholders, but has instead decided to make a self-serving and short-sighted public complaint, with spurious allegations and no credible path for long-term value creation."" ""We welcome engagement with our shareholders and are always looking for ways to maximize value at Miller Industries. Thus far, Advisory Research's interactions with the Company have been consistently focused on near-term issues and share price performance. We are surprised by the persistent urgency in which they have insisted we move, particularly in light of the Company's share price performance over the past year. It appears that Advisory Research is operating based on faulty assumptions about the Company's fundamentals,"" continued Mr. Ashford. The Miller Industries management team and Board have been in regular dialogue with Advisory Research since it initiated its position in August 2022. The management team has regularly made themselves available both in person at conferences, as well as virtually, scheduling calls with the Advisory Research team following quarterly earnings. In an effort to continue to engage in good faith, the Company also facilitated multiple Board-level meetings between Advisory Research and Miller Industries' Lead Independent Director, Ted Ashford, and Chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee, Leigh Walton. During these interactions, Advisory Research provided numerous and shifting critiques about Miller Industries, including ideas on strategy, margin expansion and leadership changes. Ultimately, Advisory Research plainly stated that its desire was for the Company to be sold. After the meetings, the two directors shared Advisory Research's perspectives with the entire Board for consideration. Additionally, Advisory Research put forward two names for the Company to consider as potential additions to the Board. The Company thoroughly considered the candidates and conducted formal evaluations consisting of issuing and reviewing questionnaires, facilitating site visits with management and holding interviews with multiple Board members. Following the completion of that process, the Nominating & Governance Committee, as well as the full Board, determined the two candidates that Advisory Research put forth did not add any incremental value or skills beyond those the Company already has on its recently refreshed Board of Directors. Mr. Ashford concluded, ""We are proud of the current state of our business. Our backlog remains at near-record levels and our management team has been able to drive full year records for both net income and EPS in 2023, with high single digit growth expected on the horizon in 2024. We believe the Company and this management team, led by Chief Executive Officer William G. Miller, II., is well positioned to continue delivering excellent financial results, particularly given the strong macroeconomic backdrop ahead and the oversight of a highly effective Board of Directors.""

The 2024 Sands Cares investment supports three priority areas: the annual Sands Cares Global Hygiene Kit Build, which will mark more than 1 million kits built by Sands Team Members since 2014; the Drop By Drop Project, a program Sands established with The WASH Foundation to address water stewardship initiatives in the company's regions; and capacity-building funding to help The WASH Foundation expand its hygiene education programs around the world. After working with Clean the World for the collection and recycling of discarded hygiene amenities at the company's resorts, Sands provided its first donation to the foundation in 2014. Since that initial Sands Cares engagement, the partnership has produced a number of impacts, firsts and new programs over the years, including transformation of the organization's Las Vegas recycling center into a full soap manufacturing operation, expansion of Clean the World's operations in Asia and launch of Las Vegas' first mobile shower unit for people experiencing homelessness. Through its partnership with Clean the World, Sands has diverted more than 618,000 pounds of waste from landfills since 2011. The company has worked with The WASH Foundation to distribute 4.1 million bars of soap to people in need. In the United States, Sands Cares' support has enabled more than 62,000 showers to people experiencing homelessness. ""Across a remarkable decade-long partnership with Las Vegas Sands, we've embarked on numerous impactful initiatives rooted in improving public health and transforming communities worldwide,"" Shawn Seipler, founder and CEO of Clean the World Global and chairman of The WASH Foundation board, said. ""From pioneering projects like the Drop by Drop Project, which supports local water champions in Macao and Singapore, to our collaborative efforts in promoting access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), our journey has been one of innovation, resilience and meaningful change. As we celebrate this milestone, we not only honor the history we've built together but also reaffirm our commitment to continue championing these vital causes, ensuring a brighter, healthier future for all."" 2024 Sands Cares Contribution Components Spanning an increased number of hygiene kits for people facing hardship and expanded support for water stewardship and foundation initiatives, this year's Sands Cares engagement is providing accelerated support for The WASH Foundation's mission to transform people's lives and improve their health by promoting access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene for communities in need across the globe. Hygiene Kits to Address Hardship: One of the first companies to establish a global kit build program with The WASH Foundation, Sands has hosted these events in its regions around the world since 2014. During that time, the company's Team Members have built 938,000 kits and will increase annual production to 70,000 kits this year, bringing the cumulative total to more than 1 million kits. The WASH Foundation provides these critical hygiene supplies to people and communities facing hardships and crisis situations. Grants for Water Stewardship: As part of the $500,000 donation, Sands has increased its funding to The WASH Foundation for the Drop by Drop Project to provide larger grant amounts for the program's two grantees designated in Macao and Singapore. This year's recipients will be announced in summer 2024. The Drop by Drop Project was established by Sands and The WASH Foundation in 2019 to support innovative water stewardship projects in Macao and Singapore through grants to local environmental champions that are addressing the program's goals to increase water resiliency, reinvigorate ecosystems, incubate new water solutions and engage the community in these areas. Capacity-Building Support for the Foundation's Mission: The third component in this year's Sands Cares contribution is $100,000 earmarked for capacity-building to support The WASH Foundation in expanding its reach, with a priority on hygiene curriculum and programs for schools. The foundation has established hygiene curriculum for schools in Uganda and the Dominican Republic, which will become models for other school-centric initiatives. ""Our decade-long partnership with The WASH Foundation is our longest-standing global Sands Cares engagement, and it's provided a critical mechanism for us to address several core priorities, including relief for people facing hardship and environmental advocacy in our resorts and regions,"" said Ron Reese, senior vice president of global communications and corporate affairs, who oversees corporate responsibility initiatives and the global Sands Cares program. ""Many of the programs we've launched with Clean the World and The WASH Foundation have been pivotal, both for our communities and our people. The organizations' entrepreneurial drive, understanding of our goals and ability to deliver on the mission are why we continue to support these programs and greatly value our long-standing relationship."" Sands' partnership with Clean the World and The WASH Foundation supports each of the company's People, Communities and Planet corporate responsibility pillars – from providing an annual Team Member bonding opportunity through the kit builds as a supportive People program to addressing hardships and crisis situations through hygiene kit contributions and other hygiene-related initiatives under the Communities pillar and advancing recycling, conservation and water initiatives under the Planet pillar.

Despite efforts to suppress the vote, shareholders showed overwhelming support for the resolution.","NRx Pharmaceuticals Announces Results of the Vote Held During the Special Meeting of Shareholders Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announces the results of a Special Meeting of Shareholders with 61.4% of eligible shares voted, 94.4% in favor of a proposal for a reverse stock split. Despite efforts to suppress the vote, shareholders showed overwhelming support for the resolution. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The decision to authorize a reverse stock split is a significant financial strategy that companies often use to increase the perceived value of their stock, improve liquidity and possibly meet stock exchange listing requirements. In the case of NRx Pharmaceuticals, the substantial majority vote in favor suggests strong shareholder backing. This move could potentially reduce the number of shares available in the market, which may lead to an increase in the stock price, albeit without changing the company's market capitalization.However, investors should be aware that while a reverse stock split can provide short-term price support, it does not fundamentally alter the company's financial health or growth prospects. It is also essential to consider that such corporate actions could sometimes be perceived negatively, as they may indicate underlying issues with the stock's performance or a means to avoid delisting. The long-term effects will largely depend on the company's ability to leverage this structural change to attract institutional investors and improve its financial performance. Market Research Analyst NRx Pharmaceuticals' decision to pursue a reverse stock split comes amidst what appears to be a contentious atmosphere, with mention of active campaigns to suppress voting. This context is important for understanding market sentiment and investor relations. A high turnout and overwhelming support for the resolution reflect that despite external pressures or negative campaigns, the investor base seems to align with the board's strategic vision.From a market perspective, it's essential to monitor how this decision will be received once enacted. If the reverse stock split is perceived as a strategic move to strengthen the company's position, it could lead to positive market reception. Conversely, if the market views this as a last-ditch effort to stabilize stock price or comply with trading requirements, the reaction may not be as favorable. The company's communication strategy and subsequent performance updates will be critical in shaping investor perception post-implementation. Legal Expert The legal framework surrounding a reverse stock split involves regulatory compliance and adequate disclosure to shareholders and the market. NRx Pharmaceuticals will need to ensure that the final ratio selected for the reverse stock split is publicly announced and that all regulatory requirements are met. The mention of 'internet agents' attempting to suppress the vote introduces a layer of complexity regarding shareholder communication and potential manipulation.Legally, the company must navigate these waters carefully, maintaining transparency and adhering to SEC regulations. The board's discretion in determining the split ratio indicates a level of flexibility in responding to market conditions, which must be balanced with shareholder interests and legal obligations to provide fair and timely information. The upcoming annual report will be a important document for stakeholders to assess the company's governance practices and strategic direction in light of this significant corporate action. 03/21/2024 - 01:57 PM 61.4% (56,781,354) of eligible shares voted94.4% of votes were cast in favor of the resolutionRADNOR, Pa., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- NRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The series will feature never-before-heard and exclusive sound from Lyle Menendez from prison, along with interviews with the Menendez brothers’ lawyer Mark Geragos, and the prosecutor on the case Pamela Bozanich. Additional contributions are made throughout from comedian and actress Rosie O’Donnell, who conducted a 2023 interview with Lyle Menendez from prison, radio personality Adam Carolla and former Saturday Night Live cast member Darrell Hammond, who has advocated for the pair’s release from prison. In conjunction with the series, The Five co-host Judge Jeanine Pirro, former Westchester County District Attorney and the first woman to prosecute murder cases there, will host key discussions breaking down the Menendez case with crucial figures on both sides of the trial. Pirro will present a sit-down interview with Geragos to discuss the defense attorney’s fight to overturn the life convictions and whether a letter outlining allegations of abuse could bolster the brothers' self-defense claim. Separately, Pirro will moderate a panel including the supervising detective on the case, Thomas Edmonds, who will outline why he believes the killings were in cold blood and the convictions should stand. Additional panelists will include FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and psychologist Caryn Stark. In making the announcement, Petterson said, “This docuseries explores one of the most high-profile explosive murder cases of our time. As new evidence has been uncovered over the years, we are thrilled to add this captivating true crime series to FOX Nation’s library.” In August 1989 brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez shot and killed their parents, José and Kitty Menendez in Beverly Hills for what was believed at the time to be an opportunity to obtain their $14 million dollar inheritance. In 1996, the brothers were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole. However, Lyle and Erik’s attorneys argued they killed their parents out of self-defense and claimed they faced years of emotional and physical abuse. Now, after two trials, a massive cultural reckoning and the emergence of new evidence, the notorious crime story is reexamined in this special with the voices closest to the case. Developed and produced for FOX Nation, Pilgrim Media Group and Los Angeles Magazine Studios, the series was executive produced by Craig Piligian, Nicole Rittenmeyer, Scott Eldridge, Nicholas Caprio, Shane Farley, Chris Hannan and Adam Carolla.

The grants support projects aimed at developing cost-effective and durable ionomers and membranes, contributing to the advancement of the hydrogen economy and sustainability goals. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Industry Analyst The announcement of the Department of Energy's $60 million grant to Chemours signals a significant investment in the clean hydrogen sector, which has implications for the broader energy market. Clean hydrogen is gaining traction as an alternative energy source and advancements in technology could lead to more efficient production, storage and transportation, potentially reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness against fossil fuels. The focus on durable, high-performance membranes for PEM water electrolysis addresses a critical bottleneck in hydrogen production—electrolyzer efficiency and longevity.For investors and stakeholders, this development could indicate a strategic positioning of Chemours within the hydrogen economy, potentially leading to long-term growth as the demand for clean energy solutions rises. However, the scalability and commercial viability of these innovations remain to be seen, as the hydrogen market is still maturing. The collaboration with public, private and academic partners could be a key differentiator, leveraging expertise and resources to accelerate development. Sustainability Expert Chemours' involvement in the H2CIRC consortium and its focus on circularity for fuel cells and electrolyzers is an essential step towards sustainable clean energy practices. Circularity in the hydrogen economy is not just an environmental imperative but also an economic one, as it can lead to cost savings and resource efficiency in the long run. The creation of a blueprint for material recovery and recycling in the hydrogen industry is a proactive measure that could set industry standards and encourage other players to adopt similar practices.For the market, this move towards circularity could enhance Chemours' reputation as a sustainability leader, potentially attracting investors who are increasingly concerned with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. However, the implementation of such circular systems will require significant R&D and operational changes, which may affect short-term profitability. The long-term benefits, though, could include reduced material costs and improved resilience of supply chains. Financial Analyst The financial implications of the DOE's grants for Chemours are multifaceted. On one hand, the influx of $60 million earmarked for advancing hydrogen technology could bolster Chemours' R&D capabilities without diluting shareholder value, as it's non-dilutive funding. On the other hand, the actual impact on Chemours' financials will depend on the efficient allocation of these funds and the successful commercialization of the technologies developed. Investors should monitor the company's progress in achieving the project milestones and the broader market adoption of PEM electrolysis technology.The grants also reflect a broader governmental support for the hydrogen industry, which could signal a favorable regulatory environment for future growth. However, investors should be cautious and consider the competitive landscape, as other companies may also receive similar grants, potentially leveling the playing field. The long-term success of Chemours in this area will likely hinge on its ability to innovate and scale up production while managing costs effectively. 03/21/2024 - 12:35 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2024 / The Chemours CompanyTwo project grants will support development of next-generation membranes for PEM water electrolysis and developing a circularity infrastructure for clean hydrogen materialsChemours, a global chemistry company, announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, selected two of its applications for grants totaling $60 million.

""Our Nafion™ ion exchange membranes play a critical role in driving the hydrogen economy and helping to create a more sustainable future, and these funds will help to accelerate their further development as well as taking a proactive approach to building an infrastructure supporting circularity of fuel cells and electrolyzers.""The grants announced by the DOE under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are part of $750 million in funding for projects to advance hydrogen technologies and improve manufacturing and recycling capabilities for clean hydrogen systems and components. The funding directly supports the national clean hydrogen strategy outlined in the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap which emphasizes cost reduction, manufacturing, supply chains, and domestic jobs.""At Chemours, our advanced chemistry and technology are at the heart of the hydrogen economy and essential to producing and deploying clean hydrogen,"" said Gerardo Familiar, President of Advanced Performance Materials at Chemours. ""We have a unique place in the hydrogen supply chain as the leading global supplier of ionomers and membranes for PEM electrolysis, the only domestic manufacturer of ion exchange materials, and a key project partner in the Appalachian Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2) under the U.S. DOE's Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub initiative.

Global investors are increasingly utilizing CME Group's equity options products to manage risk and capitalize on market opportunities. Positive None. Negative None. Market Analyst The surge in average daily volume (ADV) for E-mini options across various indices, particularly the 83% year-over-year increase for the E-mini Russell 2000 options, indicates a growing appetite among investors for these derivative products. This trend suggests a shift in market sentiment where despite a lower overall volatility, there is an active pursuit of risk management and hedging strategies. The record trading day for E-mini S&P 500 options blocks also points to a significant event or series of events on March 15 that prompted an unusually high volume of trades. Such data is essential for understanding market dynamics and could signal increased sophistication and strategic behavior by market participants. From a market liquidity standpoint, higher trading volumes generally lead to tighter bid-ask spreads, which can reduce transaction costs for market participants. This can make the derivatives market more attractive for both institutional and retail investors, potentially leading to further increases in volume. Financial Analyst Record volumes in E-mini options trading can have a pronounced impact on the financial performance of CME Group. Increased trading activity translates directly into higher transaction fee revenues for the exchange. The growth in ADV, particularly the 40% year-over-year increase in E-mini S&P 500 options blocks, may be indicative of a strong revenue quarter for the CME Group. Investors and analysts might view these volume increases as positive indicators of the company's financial health and market position. However, it is important to consider the sustainability of this growth, as such trends can be influenced by market cycles and macroeconomic factors. Risk Management Specialist The growing use of E-mini options for portfolio hedging reflects a broader trend in risk management strategies employed by investors. E-mini contracts, being a fraction of the size of standard contracts, offer granularity that is particularly useful for precise hedging and risk management. This granularity, combined with capital efficiency, makes these instruments versatile for a wide range of market participants, from hedge funds to individual traders. The increase in volume suggests that investors are becoming more proactive in managing exposure to equity market risks, which could be a response to geopolitical uncertainties, economic policy changes, or anticipation of market-moving events. 03/21/2024 - 12:17 PM CHICAGO, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced that E-mini S&P 500, E-mini Nasdaq-100 and E-mini Russell 2000 options have reached record volumes in 2024.

Positive None. Negative None. 03/21/2024 - 12:00 PM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / March 21, 2024 / RayonierSafety is a way of life at Rayonier and one of the cornerstones of our culture. It is embedded within every action we take and guided by a fundamental respect for people.Originally published on Rayonier.comOur Senior Leadership Team and Board reinforce the importance of maintaining a strong safety culture. Our guiding principle is that all of our employees and contractors should return home safely each day. We believe that nearly all accidents are preventable, and we encourage our employees and contractors to challenge unsafe behavior with a zero-tolerance mindset. We take steps to help our employees feel comfortable raising any safety-related concerns, and we do not tolerate retaliation against teammates or contractors who report suspected violations. Leadership of our U.S. safety program resides with the Director of Health & Safety, who reports directly to the Executive Vice President & Chief Resource Officer. Leadership of our New Zealand safety program resides with the Director of Health & Safety, who reports directly to the Managing Director, Rayonier Matariki Forests.NEW ZEALANDIn New Zealand, workplace safety is regulated by the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015, and our comprehensive safety management program includes both employees and contractors pursuant to local laws. We are proud to have 100% of our eligible New Zealand contractors Safetree™ certified by the New Zealand Forest Industry Safety Council (FISC). In 2022, we focused on reinforcing the ""start when certain"" approach; health and safety systems, processes, and technology; and improving the driving experience for log truck drivers.""Start when certain"" approachIn 2022, we created a Health & Safety Advisor position and appointed an existing employee with the requisite skills. The new role is primarily focused on contractor and operations facing activities. With this resource in place, we began a series of critical risk activity reviews. Through the team's collaboration with our contractors, we have released an updated repair and maintenance safe system of work manual and are reviewing our tree felling safe work requirements. These initiatives continue to reinforce our ""start when certain"" approach to safe work practices.Health & safety systems, processes, and technologyWe continue to identify opportunities for improvement with our current systems and processes. A key focus has been on deploying a mobile app in New Zealand to support in-field entry of information, which will improve the efficiency of incident reporting. Implementation of the app is expected to be complete in 2023.Additionally, in 2022, we commissioned an external audit of our health and safety management system with the objective of identifying compliance vulnerabilities and improvement opportunities. No compliance issues were identified, and the process provided us with useful insight and direction on areas for improvement. One improvement opportunity was exposure to a critical risk roadmap. While the roadmap reconfirmed we are on the right track, it also provided a helpful nine-point framework to define critical risks, focus stakeholders' attention, and embed risk mitigation controls. We will apply this framework as we review our critical risks and safe work procedures.Improving the driving experience for log truck driversDue to a disproportionately high representation in accident statistics, we internally identified log transportation as a critical area of focus in New Zealand. To gain an understanding of how drivers rated various aspects of work in our forests, we rolled out a survey to our thirdparty log truck drivers. This survey resulted in several projects including, but not limited to, finding ways in which we can support increased operational flexibility, providing more timely responses, distributing action reports around at-risk infrastructure, and strengthening our systems to help drivers receive timely information about in-forest elevated risk situations. We also encourage drivers to report situations in need of our attention, such as loadout setups and road access infrastructure.UNITED STATESContractors perform several critical functions for Rayonier including timber harvesting, log hauling, site preparation, and replanting. Unlike in New Zealand, regulations incorporating contractor safety do not exist in the U.S. As a result, we have taken proactive steps to promote safe work practices among our contractors. Specifically, we have implemented a program with our U.S. contractors to facilitate better communication and education regarding safe work practices. While the program initially focused on building trust and strengthening relationships with contractors to establish an open dialogue about safety issues, we have continued to build on it over time. The program now includes safety alerts, a greater number of tailgate meetings on safety topics, education on best management practices, and our contractor safety near miss/ incident reporting program.In 2022, we added safety-focused personnel, held 15 in-person OSHA training sessions throughout our U.S. operating areas, and dedicated additional resources to work with contractors unable to attend the scheduled events. Over 600 contractors attended the in-person training events, which focused on providing our contractors with tools and guidance to build out and enhance their own safety programs. Overall, this initiative was well-received by our contractors. Encouragingly, there was a 50% year-over-year reduction in recordable injuries across our U.S. contractor workforce. We view this as significant progress towards our goal of raising the industry standard and are now requiring an active written safety program from all contractors. Unfortunately, there were still two contractor fatalities reported in 2022. In response to each fatality, we evaluated the situations surrounding the incidents and implemented action plans to highlight mitigation measures for the safety risks identified.Moving forward, we are aiming to expand our safety-related metrics. Specifically in 2023, we have been working toward developing internal methodologies for calculating contractor hours worked, which will advance our safety reporting to include TRIR and Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) for our U.S. contractors.50% YoY reduction in contractor recordable injury count 2021 14 2022 7SAFETY STAR RECOGNITION PROGRAM""Workplace health and safety is important for the well-being of both employees and the employer because human loss is immeasurable and intolerable.""-Don Webb, Rayonier, EmployeeDon Webb, Resource Unit Land Manager, was recognized as the Safety Star Employee of the Year. Don was recognized for his dedication to promoting a strong safety culture-his diligence for keeping coworkers informed about monthly tailgate meetings, his enthusiasm for researching topics to present at safety meetings, and his efforts to coordinate and conduct safety kick-off meetings with contractors.""It costs more money to do the right thing, but we take care of our equipment because our employees are like family. You can replace or fix a tractor that has been in an accident. You cannot replace someone's life.""-Dillon Stratton, 3D Trucking, ContractorDillon Stratton, 3D Trucking, was named as the Safety Star Contractor of the Year. Dillon was recognized for the innovative camera and driver alert system he uses on log trucks for his company, 3D Trucking. Each of Dillon's rigs has a camera facing out through the windshield and one looking back down each side of the truck. This helps his truckers stay protected and prevent accidents. In addition to taking video, the system records issues such as hard braking and speeding, which Dillon uses to coach his employees on safe driving techniques.We believe that our collaborative approach to employee and contractor safety is translating to heightened safety awareness and improved safety performance. We emphasize the importance of raising safety-related concerns at every opportunity, while also reassuring employees and contractors that we will not tolerate retaliation against anyone who reports suspected violations or near-misses. Our U.S. employee and contractor near-miss submissions increased during 2022 by more than 30% and 80%, respectively, versus the previous year. While we're encouraged by the upward trend in near-miss submissions reflecting increased awareness and communication, we unfortunately saw an increase in our U.S. employee recordable injuries in 2022.The charts above summarize our TRIR, LTIR, fatalities, and near misses in the U.S. and New Zealand over the last three years. TRIR and LTIR data covers employees in the U.S. and employees and contractors in New Zealand, whereas fatality and near-miss data covers both employees and contractors in the U.S. and New Zealand.To learn more, view the full Rayonier 2022 Sustainability Report.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Rayonier on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: RayonierWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/rayonierEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: RayonierView the original press release on accesswire.com What is Rayonier's approach to safety culture?

Financial Analyst The reported decrease in annual revenue for Electro-Sensors, Inc. reflects a contraction in sales, which is a concern for profitability and growth perspectives. The 5.2% drop in net sales could be indicative of competitive pressures or a decline in demand for their products. However, the strong performance in the fourth quarter suggests a potential recovery or cyclical nature of their market.Despite the revenue decline, the increase in income before taxes by 425% and earnings per share by 166.7% is noteworthy. This improvement in profitability metrics could be attributed to cost management and operational efficiencies. Investors should monitor whether these improvements are sustainable in future periods or if they resulted from one-time events.The gross margin decline by 400 basis points is a critical aspect that investors should consider. Margins are essential for understanding the company's pricing power and cost control. A decrease in gross margin could signal rising costs or pricing pressure, which might affect future earnings if not addressed. Market Research Analyst The stability in international sales, maintaining a consistent 10.3% of net sales, suggests that Electro-Sensors, Inc. has a steady global market presence. This is an important aspect for diversification and reduces reliance on domestic markets. However, the overall decrease in sales for both wired and HazardPRO wireless sensors and systems indicates a need for the company to innovate or enhance marketing efforts to stimulate growth.The mention of repeat HazardPRO orders from existing customers is a positive sign of customer loyalty and product satisfaction. It also indicates potential for up-selling and cross-selling within the existing customer base, which could be a strategic focus for the company to boost future sales. Industrial Analyst Electro-Sensors' product focus on machine monitoring sensors and hazard monitoring systems places it within the industrial automation and safety sector, which is expected to grow with advancements in technology and increased emphasis on workplace safety. The company's performance should be assessed in the context of industry trends, such as the adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and predictive maintenance.The report of customers delaying facility upgrades and capital projects earlier in the year may reflect broader economic conditions impacting capital expenditure decisions. Investors should consider macroeconomic factors and industry-specific drivers that could influence the company's performance, such as industrial production indices and regulatory changes in safety standards. 03/21/2024 - 01:30 PM MINNETONKA, Minn., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Electro-Sensors, Inc.

Market Research Analyst The strategic growth investment by TA Associates into SER underscores the burgeoning interest in the Intelligent Content Automation (ICA) and Enterprise Content Management (ECM) markets. Investments in AI and automation are pivotal for companies seeking to enhance efficiency and streamline operations. SER's expansion and shift to a subscription-first business model reflect a broader industry trend towards recurring revenue streams, which are often favored by investors for their predictability and potential for sustainable long-term growth.Furthermore, SER's international growth via organic investment and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) indicates a strategic approach to scaling operations. The company's ability to penetrate markets such as the US, UK and the Middle East, while maintaining a strong presence in the DACH region, suggests a robust market adoption of its ECM solutions.The partnership with TA is likely to provide SER with additional resources to accelerate its international expansion and invest in AI innovations. This could enhance SER's competitive edge in the ECM market, which is becoming increasingly crowded with players offering AI-powered solutions for digital transformation. Financial Analyst The involvement of TA Associates, a notable private equity firm, in SER's financial backing could potentially signal a positive outlook for the company's valuation and financial health. Private equity investments are often made with a view to drive operational improvements, expand market reach and ultimately prepare a company for a future exit event, either through a sale or public offering. TA's track record of successful investments may instill confidence among other investors and stakeholders in SER's growth trajectory.The shift to a subscription-based model is particularly noteworthy from a financial perspective. This model generally leads to a more stable and predictable revenue stream, which can be attractive to investors. It's also worth noting that subscription models can lead to higher lifetime customer value and lower customer acquisition costs over time, factors that are critical to a company's profitability and financial sustainability. Technology Industry Analyst SER's flagship product, Doxis ICA, represents a significant evolution in the ECM space, integrating AI to automate and manage content across various applications and ecosystems. This ability to bridge disparate systems is increasingly critical as enterprises seek to maximize the value of their content and ensure seamless workflows.The demand for such integrated solutions is a reflection of the growing complexity within enterprise IT environments, where content often resides in siloed applications. By offering a platform that can connect and automate content across ecosystems like SAP, Salesforce and Microsoft, SER is addressing a key pain point for enterprises undergoing digital transformation.With TA's investment, one can anticipate further enhancements to SER's AI capabilities and an expansion of its product offerings. This could potentially lead to an increased market share for SER in the competitive ECM industry, where innovation and scalability are key determinants of success. 03/21/2024 - 12:10 PM BONN, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SER (the “Company”), a leading global Intelligent Content Automation (“ICA”) software vendor in the Enterprise Content Management (“ECM”) market, today announced that TA Associates (“TA”), a leading global private equity firm, has agreed to make a strategic growth investment in the Company.

Accessories and customization options are available, with deliveries planned for the U.S. and Canada in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The release of LiveWire's S2 Mulholland electric motorcycle represents a significant step in the evolution of the electric vehicle (EV) market, particularly within the niche of electric motorcycles. The pricing strategy, set at $15,999 USD and $21,999 CAD, positions the S2 Mulholland as a premium offering, aligning with the current trend of EVs being priced at a premium compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts. This could potentially affect the stock market by influencing investor confidence in the EV sector and LiveWire's market positioning.Furthermore, the use of sustainable materials such as CAP Hemp bio-composite and HYLON® OCEAN (PCR Nylon 6) derived from discarded ocean fishing nets, signals a shift towards more sustainable production practices. This could resonate well with environmentally conscious consumers and investors who are increasingly valuing corporate responsibility and sustainability. The immediate availability of the motorcycle at dealers might stimulate short-term sales, but the long-term success will depend on consumer acceptance and the broader adoption of EVs. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the launch of the S2 Mulholland could have implications for LiveWire's revenue growth and market share in the electric motorcycle segment. The immediate availability of the motorcycle is a strategic move to capitalize on the growing demand for EVs and could lead to a positive short-term revenue uptick. However, the high price point could limit the addressable market, potentially affecting long-term sales volume.Investors should also consider the impact of the R&D and material costs associated with the development of the S2 Mulholland, especially given the use of novel sustainable materials. If these materials lead to cost savings or allow LiveWire to command a price premium, there could be a positive impact on profit margins. Conversely, if the costs outweigh the benefits, it could pressure the company's financials. Sustainability Expert The emphasis on sustainability in the manufacturing of the S2 Mulholland is a noteworthy development within the industry. The use of sustainable materials is not only a marketing point but also a reflection of the industry's pivot towards more eco-friendly production methods. The long-term implications of this strategy could be substantial if it leads to a competitive advantage and if consumers begin to prioritize sustainability over other factors when making purchasing decisions.Moreover, the decision to offer an unpainted Lunar White finish to minimize the use of traditional plastics and paints further highlights the company's commitment to reducing its environmental footprint. If this approach is successful, it could serve as a model for other manufacturers, potentially leading to widespread changes in the industry's approach to sustainability. 03/21/2024 - 12:00 PM The second bike on LiveWire’s S2 platform goes on sale today, with inventory available immediately at all U.S. dealers. MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LiveWire, the leading electric motorcycle manufacturer, is excited to announce the all-new S2 Mulholland, which goes on sale today with inventory available immediately at all U.S. and Canadian dealers. Mulholland represents a shift in design at LiveWire as the company has reimagined the profile and silhouette of the motorcycle—traditionally informed by the gas tank—while also using sustainable materials in key components for the first time. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240321330835/en/S2 Mulholland Two-Up on the California Coast (Photo: Business Wire) Priced at $15,999 USD and $21,999 CAD, S2 Mulholland is available for purchase immediately. Design Evolution As LiveWire’s performance cruiser, S2 Mulholland's design departs from traditional internal combustion motorcycles in the cruiser category—which typically celebrate the gas tank—as the electric S2 platform provided the design team with the opportunity to create a new profile and experience that prominently displays both the brake lines and wiring harness, creating a stronger connection between the human interface of the rider and motorcycle. First Use of Sustainable Materials S2 Mulholland continues to push the envelope of design further with LiveWire’s first use of sustainable and eco-friendly materials across key touch points on the bike including bodywork, seat, and secondary plastic components. Mulholland’s front and rear fenders are manufactured using CAP Hemp bio-composite. The motorcycle's radiator shrouds, and wiring caddies are manufactured from HYLON® OCEAN (PCR Nylon 6), the origin of which are discarded ocean fishing nets, further reducing the reliance on petroleum-based plastics. LiveWire also manufactured the seat using petroleum-free, recyclable silicone rather than leather or vinyl. Additionally, the bike will be available in an optional eco-friendly unpainted Lunar White finish that elevates the CAP Hemp material while minimizing the use of traditional plastics and paints—efforts unseen in this category prior to the launch of Mulholland. Liquid Black will be the sole painted option available. Performance & Charging S2 Mulholland is based on LiveWire’s S2 platform, and the riding characteristics of the motorcycle demonstrate the same level of performance established with S2 Del Mar. Weighing 432 pounds, Mulholland is capable of a 3.3 second zero to sixty time thanks to the 84 horsepower and 194 ft-lb of torque available to the rider. The 10.5 kWh pack contributes 121 miles of city riding range and 73 miles of highway range at 55mph to the riding experience. Mulholland also shares the same charging technology available on Del Mar, with both Level 1 and Level 2 equipped as standard. Charging Times L1, 20-80% 5.9hrs L2, 20-80% 78 min Riding Experience While S2 Mulholland utilizes the same S2 platform, the riding experience has been reshaped by the rider triangle and updated standard equipment which diverges dramatically from Del Mar. Using a six-inch handlebar riser, the handlebars are positioned higher and further back, allowing the rider to sit with a more upright riding position, reinforcing the riding style and the performance cruiser experience in contrast to the flat track inspired Del Mar. Mulholland’s 19 inch front and 17 inch rear wheels come equipped with Dunlop Sportmax Roadsmart IV tires, to utilize Mulholland’s 55°/50° left and right lean angles. Accessories Expected throughout Q2 and Q3, a range of S2 Mulholland accessories including passenger seats and pegs, windscreens, soft and hard bags, luggage racks, and cosmetic pieces will be launching to further add to the unique riding experience and visual appeal of S2 Mulholland. World Premier & Availability The introduction of the new electric performance cruiser, S2 Mulholland, will be limited to the U.S. and Canada for 2024, with deliveries for additional markets currently planned for 2025. In the U.S. and Canada Mulholland can be found at LiveWire retail partner locations nationwide. Additionally, customers can configure Mulholland colors and accessories online, send their order directly to a retail partner, or choose to work with a LiveWire product expert.

Completes $350 Million Term Securitization Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Travel + Leisure Co. (TNL) successfully completes a term securitization transaction, issuing $350 million in asset-backed notes with a weighted average coupon of 5.66%. The transaction received significant interest, resulting in a blended interest rate 112 basis points lower than the previous offering and an increase in the advance rate of 350 basis points. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The completion of a term securitization transaction by Travel + Leisure Co. signifies a strategic move to manage liquidity and leverage its timeshare receivables. The $350 million in asset-backed notes, with a weighted average coupon rate of 5.66%, indicates investor confidence in the company's creditworthiness. The advance rate of 95.25% is a testament to the quality of the underlying assets and the company's ability to negotiate favorable terms.Comparing the current transaction's blended interest rate to the previous one in October 2023, which is 112 basis points lower, suggests an improved market perception of the company's risk profile or a general decrease in market interest rates. This cost of capital reduction could lead to enhanced profitability through decreased interest expenses on the securitized debt. Investors should note the tiered structure of the notes, with varying coupon rates reflecting the differing risk profiles of each class. The higher coupon rate of 8.02% for Class D notes, for instance, indicates a higher risk associated with these notes. Credit Risk Analyst The issuance of asset-backed notes by Sierra Timeshare 2024-1 Receivables Funding LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Travel + Leisure Co., showcases a nuanced approach to risk distribution. The tranching of notes into Class A, B, C and D, with different coupon rates, allows investors to select their preferred risk-return profile. The structure of the transaction, relying on Rule 144A and Regulation S, suggests a targeted approach to reach qualified institutional buyers and international investors, bypassing the need for a public offering.From a credit risk perspective, the increase in the advance rate by 350 basis points could imply a lower perceived risk or higher demand for the company's securities. It is important for investors to consider the performance of the underlying timeshare receivables, as their ability to generate cash flow is directly linked to the servicing of these notes. An analysis of historical default rates and recoveries within the timeshare sector, along with Travel + Leisure Co.'s specific portfolio performance, would be essential for a comprehensive risk assessment. Securities Lawyer The transaction's reliance on Rule 144A and Regulation S indicates a strategic choice to streamline the capital-raising process. Rule 144A allows for the resale of privately placed securities to qualified institutional buyers, which can expedite the process and potentially reduce costs associated with public offerings. Regulation S provides an exemption for offerings made outside the U.S., thereby expanding the potential investor base. The legal framework of such a transaction is complex and it is designed to balance the company's need for capital with regulatory compliance and investor protection.Investors should be aware that the securities are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which means they are subject to certain restrictions on resale and may not have the same level of public disclosure as registered securities. The announcement of the sale as a matter of record only underlines that the offering is complete and no further sales are expected. This legal structuring is a common practice in private placements and is indicative of the company's strategic financial management. 03/21/2024 - 11:50 AM ORLANDO, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Travel + Leisure Co. (NYSE:TNL) announced today that it has completed a term securitization transaction involving the issuance of $350 million in principal amount of asset-backed notes with an overall weighted average coupon of 5.66%. The advance rate for this transaction was 95.25%. “Our first public term offering of the year received considerable interest from the investment community, which led to strong execution and a blended interest rate of 112 basis points below our October 2023 transaction and an increase in the advance rate of 350 basis points,” said Mike Hug, Chief Financial Officer of Travel + Leisure Co. Sierra Timeshare 2024-1 Receivables Funding LLC issued $143 million of Class A Notes, $90 million of Class B Notes, $85 million of Class C Notes, and $32 million of Class D Notes.

The round includes $25 million in equity capital and $67 million in debt capital. Coast's innovative software uses mobile technology and vehicle data to provide powerful controls for fleet managers, addressing the $120 billion annual fleet fuel payments market in the US. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent funding round for Coast, a company specializing in fleet and fuel management, is indicative of investor confidence in the niche of fleet management solutions. The infusion of $92 million, split between equity and debt capital, signals a robust valuation and growth potential. This level of investment suggests that the market for fleet management tools is ripe for innovation, particularly in the domain of digitalization and real-time data utilization.Coast's approach to integrating mobile technology with vehicle data and telematics represents a significant step forward in this industry. By offering advanced features such as real-time transaction flagging and location-based controls, Coast is positioned to capture market share from traditional fuel card services. The potential for increased efficiency and fraud prevention could resonate well with fleet-operating businesses, which are currently managing substantial annual fuel payments.The focus on mobile technology and automated systems could also indicate a shift in how fleet expenses are managed, with a trend towards more agile and responsive solutions. As Coast's technology gains traction, it could pressure incumbents to innovate, potentially leading to broader industry advancements in payment solutions and fleet management. Financial Analyst The $92 million funding for Coast, comprising both equity and debt, reflects a strategic financial decision. The equity component, led by a mix of existing and new investors, demonstrates sustained interest and validates the company's past performance and future prospects. On the other hand, the $67 million in committed debt capital from prominent institutions like Silicon Valley Bank and TriplePoint Capital underscores the financial credibility and the potential for leveraging debt to fuel growth without diluting existing equity holders' stakes.For stakeholders, the immediate impact could be an acceleration in Coast's product development and market expansion efforts. Long-term benefits may include the establishment of a strong foothold in the fleet management market and possibly an expansion into adjacent markets. However, there are risks associated with the debt component, such as the obligation to service the debt, which could impact financial stability if the company's growth does not meet expectations.Investors should monitor Coast's ability to turn this capital infusion into revenue-generating opportunities, particularly in a market where annual fuel payments are substantial. The company's performance in the coming quarters will be critical in assessing the return on this investment and its impact on the stock market, especially for the involved venture capital firms and financial institutions. Technology Analyst Coast's technological innovation in fleet payments is not just a feature enhancement; it's a paradigm shift. The integration of mobile technology with vehicle telematics is transformative, allowing for a more granular and dynamic approach to managing fleet expenses. Traditional fuel cards offer limited control and visibility, whereas Coast's solution provides real-time data and the ability to tailor controls to specific on-the-job needs.The use of real-time information from drivers' phones and onboard computers to authorize or flag transactions can significantly reduce unauthorized spending and improve operational efficiency. This technology could lead to a reduction in operational costs for businesses with large fleets, potentially improving their bottom lines. Additionally, the data collected through Coast's system can offer insights into driver behavior and vehicle usage, which can be leveraged for further optimizations.As businesses increasingly prioritize data-driven decision-making, Coast's offering aligns well with the trend towards digital transformation in the commercial fleet industry. The ability to automate approvals and alerts through SMS workflows simplifies the management process, which could be a key differentiator in a market where ease of use can drive adoption. 03/21/2024 - 11:28 AM NEW YORK, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Coast, which offers a simple and smart way for companies in the United States to manage fuel and fleet spending, today announced it has raised $92 million in new funding. The round includes $25 million in equity capital led by existing investors, including BoxGroup, Avid Ventures, Accel, Insight Partners, and Better Tomorrow Ventures, as well as new investor Vesey Ventures. The company also secured $67 million in committed debt capital from Silicon Valley Bank and TriplePoint Capital. For the nearly one million American businesses that collectively operate around 40 million vehicles in their commercial fleets – including field service businesses like HVAC, plumbing, landscaping, pest control, construction, government fleets and long-haul trucking – managing expenses in the field is a major challenge. Over the decades, a handful of now very large incumbent payment solutions have emerged to serve fleet-operating companies' needs with fuel cards, to allow fleet managers to set field-specific controls, like restricting purchases to only fuel products, or tracking expenses on a per-vehicle basis. The fleet fuel payments on these specialized cards add up to a staggering $120 billion annually in the US. Coast, led by founder and CEO Daniel Simon, reimagines the fleet payments product category, enabled by mobile technology and state-of-the-art vehicle data and telematics. Coast's software gives fleet managers powerful policies and controls that they can tailor to the on-the-job needs of different employees and vehicles in their fleets. It uses real-time information that employee drivers provide through their phones, as well as data from the onboard computers of company vehicles, to authorize or flag transactions. For example, the fleet manager of a commercial construction HVAC company could receive an alert if a driver purchased unleaded gas when driving a company diesel vehicle, indicating potential abuse; automatically block a transaction when the attempted purchase is far from the current GPS location of the vehicle; or pre-approve a one-time extra purchase of on-the-road supplies at Home Depot with a simple, automated SMS workflow. ""We've been amazed by the pace of execution of Coast's business since we first invested in the company at its founding, as well as by the scope and consistency of Daniel's vision for financial tools for fleet operating industries,"" BoxGroup Partner Adam Rothenberg said about the round. ""In the current market, it's more important than ever to back companies that have shown they can achieve really great unit economics by serving a well-understood need. We were thrilled to find an opportunity to deepen our investment in Coast and continue our partnership with Daniel."" The market has greeted Coast's offering with enthusiasm. The company has grown its business more than fivefold in 2023, and it now serves thousands of businesses, some with just a handful of fleet cards and others with over 1,000. Surveyed customers saved an average of 9-10% on their fuel bill and 16 hours of monthly administrative work when switching to Coast from another fuel card or payment method. Coast software controls have been so effective in reducing abuse and waste that the company recently rolled out a first-of-its-kind security guarantee, promising to cover any losses for fuel theft up to $25,000 annually for customers that enable Coast's unique security settings. To add to their momentum, Coast has inked partnerships with fuel brands such as 7-Eleven Fleet (including Speedway), Casey's, RaceTrac, and EG America brands (including Cumberland Farms), as well as retailers like Discount Tire to offer larger discounts to Coast customers while driving loyalty and repeat business for these brands. Coast also announced that it had entered into a relationship with Visa, a world leader in digital payments, to accelerate its fleet offering. ""Coast has been an innovative leader in fleet payments, and Visa is excited to collaborate further with them to create a new generation of offerings enabled by Coast's powerful expense management software,"" said SVP, North America Head of Visa Commercial Solutions Veronica Fernandez. ""With Coast's platform and Visa's advancement in fleet, together we can provide more security, control, visibility, and reporting to all kinds of fleet operators, for all of their vehicles, both gas and electric."" Coast cards are issued by Celtic Bank, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. With the new funding, the Coast team will focus on product development, adding new integration partners as well as supporting businesses expenses beyond fuel. The raise will also accelerate Coast's go-to-market capability, including the establishment of a second site in Salt Lake City. ""Coast is the financial platform for the future of transportation and the trades,"" Simon said. ""We are building a holistic expense management and finance platform for fleet-operating businesses. We're now well-positioned to expand our product and get it in the hands of more fleet operators and drivers."" Avid Ventures Founder and Managing Partner Addie Lerner said that they are convinced the Coast team's vision is sound. ""Since initially partnering with Daniel and Coast over three years ago, our conviction in the team's vision and execution capabilities has only deepened,"" Lerner said. ""This recent investment makes Coast one of the largest positions in Avid's first fund, reflecting our excitement in Coast's trajectory towards reshaping the industry. The team and market opportunity, combined with the company's best-in-class unit economics, rapidly evolving product suite, and growing traction with larger fleets reinforce our confidence."" Brian Foley, the head of warehouse lending and relationship management for SVB's national fintech practice, said that SVB is excited to continue to support Coast's growth. ""Coast provides a strong financial product backed by powerful software for fleet-operating businesses, which allows it to attract very high-quality companies as customers,"" Foley said. ""SVB is excited to continue to provide the debt capital to help them serve these businesses for the long term.""

National Association of Realtors settles class action lawsuit, shifting commission payment responsibility to buyer agents, potentially causing friction. Positive None. Negative None. Real Estate Analyst The introduction of the Buyer Agency Professional (BAP) designation by Kaplan is a strategic response to the recent court ruling that alters the traditional payment structure for buyer agents. With buyer agents now required to negotiate their commissions directly with clients, the real estate industry faces a paradigm shift that could influence the behavior of both agents and clients.From a financial perspective, this change may initially create market friction, as clients adjust to the new responsibility of paying buyer agent commissions out-of-pocket. This could lead to a short-term decrease in transactions if buyers are reluctant to incur additional costs. Conversely, the transparency in commission negotiations could empower buyers, potentially leading to more competitive pricing and a long-term increase in market efficiency.Moreover, the BAP designation could become a differentiating factor for buyer agents, potentially raising the standard of service and professionalism in the industry. Agents with this designation may command higher commissions, reflecting their enhanced expertise and value to the client. This could lead to a bifurcation in the market, where certified agents cater to a premium segment, while others compete on cost. Consumer Behavior Specialist Understanding the impact of the new commission structure on consumer behavior is key to gauging its long-term effects on the real estate market. With buyers now directly responsible for agent commissions, we may see a shift in how consumers approach the home-buying process. Buyers might become more discerning, seeking agents who provide substantial value or opting for less traditional services that offer lower commission rates.This could accelerate the growth of online real estate platforms and alternative service models that have been gaining traction in recent years. As consumers become more cost-conscious, these platforms could see increased usage due to their often lower fees and innovative approaches to home buying and selling.Additionally, the increased financial burden on buyers could impact overall demand, particularly among first-time homebuyers or those in lower income brackets. It will be important to monitor how this change affects the broader housing market, especially in terms of home affordability and accessibility. Market Research Analyst From a market research perspective, the introduction of the BAP designation and the shift in commission payments is likely to have significant implications for the real estate industry's competitive landscape. Agents who quickly adapt to the new model and acquire the BAP designation may gain a competitive edge, attracting clients who value certified expertise.Long-term industry trends will likely include consolidation as agents who fail to adapt to the new payment structure may exit the market, while larger firms with the resources to invest in training and certification could gain market share. Additionally, the change could stimulate innovation within the industry, with new business models and technologies emerging to cater to the evolving needs of both agents and buyers.It is also possible that the traditional commission-based model could see a decline in favor of fixed-fee or subscription-based models, as the industry seeks to align with the new consumer payment expectations. Tracking these developments will be important for stakeholders to understand the evolving dynamics of the real estate market. 03/21/2024 - 11:35 AM FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Kaplan has launched a Buyer Agency Professional (BAP) designation to help buyer agents succeed as they face a drastically different real estate business model on the horizon. A landmark federal court ruling in October 2023 has resulted in the National Association of Realtors announcing on March 15, 2024 a settlement in the class action lawsuit, upending a system in place for generations and shifting the burden of how buyer agents get paid to buyer agents themselves. Now they’ll have to negotiate their commission with their clients, who will have to pay them directly, potentially causing significant early friction. For more than three decades, in most states, the business has worked like this: Seller agents and buyer agents split a commission based upon the final price of the home sale, pre-decided on and paid for by the seller. The home purchaser generally has never had to even think about this part of the process…until now. Among the skills that real estate professionals will learn in the eight-hour, live online course: Buyer Agency and Responsibilities: Learn the responsibilities of a buyer agent. Unique Value Proposition: Create a compelling buyer agent value proposition that fits your style and demonstrates your value to potential buyers. Professional Fees: Find out the steps to secure your professional fees, including who can and can’t pay you. Service Menu Approach: Create a menu of services that allow you to deliver the services the buyer needs. Professional Service Agreement: Learn what this is, how to use it, and when to use this type of written agreement. “On a scale of 1-10, the National Association of Realtors’ decision to change how commissions are secured is a 10. This is by far the biggest change to hit the real estate industry in more than 30 years, and has added a new dimension of uncertainty among agents on how they are going to secure their fees when representing buyers. That’s not good for them, their clients, or the market. The Buyer Agency Professional (BAP) designation not only educates agents on the best processes and tactics to use when securing their fees, but also teaches them how to compete and market their services to get ahead on this significantly different landscape,” said Toby Schifsky, vice president of real estate education, Kaplan. “We also believe that potential buyers are going to look to hire agents who have this designation, as it demonstrates both their command of the new buyer representative/agency model and commitment to excellence.” Upon successful completion, agents will receive their BAP designation and a digital badge to use in their marketing efforts. The course launch comes amid a potential rebound in the real estate market, with sales of previously owned homes on the rise in January and mortgage rates creeping down. The increase in sales helped boost home prices compared with a year earlier for the seventh consecutive month. And the national median sales price rose 5.1 percent from January last year to $379,100 — the highest median sales price for January on records going back to 1999. The Buyer Agency Professional (BAP) course is now open for enrollment.

However, Disney disagrees with ISS's support for Trian nominee Nelson Peltz, emphasizing Maria Elena Lagomasino's valuable expertise. Disney urges shareholders to vote 'FOR' all 12 of Disney’s Director Nominees on the WHITE proxy card. Positive ISS recommends Disney shareholders vote 'FOR' 11 of Disney’s director nominees. ISS recognizes positive changes to the Board and the relevant experiences of Disney’s directors. Disney disagrees with ISS's support for Trian nominee Nelson Peltz. Disney emphasizes Maria Elena Lagomasino's valuable expertise and contribution to the Board. Disney urges shareholders to vote 'FOR' all 12 of Disney’s Director Nominees on the WHITE proxy card. Negative ISS fails to acknowledge the diverse set of skills and experience on Disney’s Board. ISS recommendation overlooks the value added by Maria Elena Lagomasino. Nelson Peltz is not seen as bringing additive skills to the board by Disney. ISS suggests that Trian's involvement with former Disney employee Ike Perlmutter is a potential distraction. Corporate Governance Expert The recommendation by ISS to support only 11 of Disney's director nominees presents a notable point of contention regarding the composition of the company's Board of Directors. From a corporate governance perspective, the inclusion or exclusion of certain directors can significantly influence the board's effectiveness in providing oversight and strategic direction. The emphasis on the qualifications and contributions of Maria Elena Lagomasino underlines the value placed on financial expertise and fiduciary responsibility within the boardroom.Ms. Lagomasino's extensive experience in capital markets and corporate governance, including her role as a governance expert and founder of a fiduciary standards think tank, is indicative of the growing trend towards a heightened focus on corporate responsibility and ethical investment practices. The debate over board composition is reflective of broader discussions in the corporate world about the balance between shareholder value creation and responsible governance. Financial Analyst Analyzing the potential impact of board composition on Disney's stock performance requires a nuanced understanding of the market's perception of the board's ability to drive value. The explicit mention of Ms. Lagomasino's roles and achievements in financial institutions and her leadership in investment oversight for significant funds is intended to reassure investors of the board's capability to manage complex financial strategies and uphold shareholder interests.However, the contested board seat and the involvement of Trian's silent partner, Ike Perlmutter, introduce elements of uncertainty. Market reactions to board disputes can be mixed, as investors may view internal disagreements as a sign of instability or, conversely, as a healthy part of corporate checks and balances. The long-term implications of such board dynamics on Disney's strategic direction and financial performance are key considerations for shareholders. Investor Relations Specialist From an investor relations standpoint, the public discourse between Disney and ISS regarding the board nominations is a delicate matter. Transparent communication is important in maintaining shareholder trust and the company's recommendation to vote for its complete slate of nominees, including Ms. Lagomasino, is a strategic move to project unity and confidence in its governance structure. The emphasis on long-term shareholder value creation and succession planning is intended to align with investors' interests and mitigate concerns about potential disruption caused by the election of Trian's nominee, Nelson Peltz.The reference to the support from another proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis, serves to bolster the company's position and provide a counter-narrative to ISS's recommendations. For shareholders, the contrasting views from advisory firms and the company itself underscore the importance of due diligence and the need to critically assess the implications of board composition on their investment. 03/21/2024 - 11:23 AM ISS recommends Disney shareholders vote “FOR” 11 of Disney’s director nominees, recognizing “positive changes” to the Board and the “relevant experiences and business insights” of Disney’s directors ISS recommendation fails to acknowledge the diverse set of skills and experience on Disney’s Board, including significant value added by Maria Elena Lagomasino Disney urges shareholders to protect the value of their investment and vote FOR all 12 of Disney’s Director Nominees – including Maria Elena Lagomasino – on the WHITE proxy card BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) today commented on a report published by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) in connection with the election of the company’s director nominees at the Company’s Annual Meeting on April 3, 2024: “While we’re heartened to see support for Michael Froman and ISS’s recommendation to withhold on dissident directors Jay Rasulo and the Blackwells’ nominees, we strongly believe that ISS reached the wrong conclusion in its recent report when it comes to adding Nelson Peltz to the board,” said Mark Parker, Chairman of The Walt Disney Company Board of Directors. “In contrast to Glass Lewis, ISS fails to acknowledge the breadth of perspective and expertise Ms. Lagomasino adds to the Board. The strong recent performance and results overseen by the Disney Board demonstrate our focus on long-term shareholder value creation and succession planning and our commitment to good governance practices.” The Walt Disney Company disagrees with ISS’s recommendation to support Trian nominee Nelson Peltz and believes Disney’s 12 Board nominees are best qualified to provide diligent oversight of management and create sustainable shareholder value. Nelson Peltz does not bring additive skills to the board, nor does he have a meaningful plan to deliver superior shareholder value in an evolving and increasingly complex global landscape, in stark contrast to the director Trian seeks to replace – Maria Elena Lagomasino. Furthermore, ISS suggests that the Board “comprises well-qualified and accomplished directors” and “does not lack a key skill set.” Additionally, it’s worth noting that Trian’s silent partner, former Disney employee Ike Perlmutter, owns almost 79% of Trian’s Disney shares. In its report, ISS agrees that Perlmutter’s involvement is “an unfortunate distraction” and that he “may cast a baleful shadow over the Board” if Peltz is elected. This dynamic is relevant to assessing the Trian Group’s nominees, as Mr. Perlmutter has a fraught history and longstanding personal agenda against Disney’s CEO, Robert A. Iger, which would likely inhibit Nelson Peltz from working constructively with Disney’s Board, threatening the company’s continued turnaround. Ms. Lagomasino is a seasoned financial leader with an extensive capital markets career that has been centered on fiduciary responsibility, honing an investor perspective, and deep expertise in corporate governance. She is a governance expert who brings a strong shareholder perspective to the Board as a founder of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, a think tank committed to promoting the vital importance of the fiduciary standard in investment and financial advice. She has, among other roles, served as the President and CEO of JPMorgan Private Bank, a Trustee of Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Chair of its Investment Committee overseeing $4b, and the CEO of WE Family Offices managing $14b for clients. She also serves as the Lead Independent Director of The Coca-Cola Company. The Board strongly believes that replacing any of Disney’s nominees with any of the Trian Group or Blackwells nominees would deprive the company of skills and expertise required to help drive value for shareholders, a belief Glass Lewis’ report on March 18 also supports. Disney recommends that shareholders vote FOR only its 12 nominees and withhold votes for the Trian Group and Blackwells nominees using the WHITE proxy card.

While some deals transacted at premium valuations, the median EBITDA multiple fell to 8.0x EV/EBITDA. However, certain industries showed improvement in purchase multiples, indicating resilience and recovery prospects for 2024. Positive Several industries displayed improved three-year average EBITDA purchase multiples in 2023 compared to the previous year. Buyers in middle market M&A processes showed increased discipline, resulting in fewer market clearing bids at higher EBITDA multiples. The average enterprise value of sold target companies decreased significantly in 2023, reflecting a challenging valuation environment. Quality companies with strong financials and stable end markets are expected to attract buyer interest in 2024, leading to a potential rebound in purchase multiples. Private equity buyers are anticipated to reenter the M&A markets in 2024 after a period of activity in 2023. The valuation environment may require time to recover, but the overall M&A and macroeconomic landscape in 2024 is predicted to be favorable for sellers seeking optimal exits. Negative Average M&A valuations experienced a decline in 2023, with median EBITDA multiples dropping compared to the previous year. The percentage of transactions closing at 10x EBITDA or higher decreased in 2023, indicating a shift towards lower levels of the middle market. The average enterprise value of sold target companies saw a substantial decrease in 2023, potentially impacting overall transaction value. Private equity buyers faced partner pressure in 2023, leading to reduced activity in the M&A markets. - Market Research Analyst The middle market M&A landscape has undergone significant changes, with average valuations declining to 9.6x EV/EBITDA from the previous year's 9.9x. This adjustment is a reflection of the market's response to macroeconomic shifts, notably the interest rate hikes. The decline in median EBITDA multiples to 8.0x from 8.5x further emphasizes a more cautious investment approach by private equity firms and strategic buyers. The drop in the average enterprise value of sold target companies from $139.3 million to $89.4 million suggests a retraction in market activity and a pivot towards smaller deals, which often carry less risk and require a lower capital outlay.Despite the downward trend, the resilience in sectors such as Business Services and Technology indicates that certain industries can withstand broader market volatility. This resilience is often attributed to these sectors' ability to demonstrate sustainable demand and financial stability. The shift in buyer behavior, with a reduction in transactions closing at 10x EBITDA or higher, signifies a disciplined approach to M&A, likely driven by the increased cost of capital and a strategic reassessment of long-term value creation. Financial Analyst The decline in middle market M&A valuations could have varying implications for investors and stakeholders. In the short term, the reduced valuations and transaction volumes may present buying opportunities for investors with available capital and an appetite for risk. However, the long-term perspective is cautiously optimistic, with expectations of a market rebound. This forecast is predicated on the alignment of seller and buyer expectations, which could lead to increased transaction activity and potentially higher valuations. The report's anticipation of private equity buyers reengaging in the market could inject liquidity and drive competition, potentially resulting in an upward pressure on valuations.It's important to note that the cost of capital is now a significant factor in deal structuring and valuation, as the Federal Reserve continues to adjust interest rates to meet its economic objectives. Investors should consider the impact of interest rates on leveraged buyouts and refinancing strategies within the middle market. Quality companies with strong financials are likely to remain attractive to buyers, but the valuation multiples may remain subdued until the broader macroeconomic conditions stabilize. Economist The report's findings are indicative of broader economic trends affecting the middle market M&A sector. The Federal Reserve's interest rate policy, aimed at controlling inflation, has increased the cost of borrowing, subsequently affecting deal valuations and the willingness of buyers to pay premium prices. The downward adjustment in valuations can be seen as a market correction following a period of high liquidity and low-interest rates, which had inflated asset prices.Looking forward, the potential realignment of buyer and seller expectations suggests that the market is adapting to the new economic realities. This adjustment phase could lead to a healthier, more sustainable M&A environment. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain and the pace of recovery will likely be influenced by factors such as inflation rates, consumer confidence and global economic conditions. While the report projects optimism for 2024, stakeholders should closely monitor these macroeconomic indicators to gauge the trajectory of the middle market M&A sector. 03/21/2024 - 11:26 AM BOSTON, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Capstone Partners, a leading middle market investment banking firm, released its 2023 Middle Market M&A Valuations Index, reporting that while equity markets largely shrugged off the rapid succession of interest rate hikes in 2023, middle market merger and acquisition (M&A) valuations experienced downward pressure. Elevated transaction costs, uncertainty over projected cash flows, and a reserved private equity buyer pool contributed to average M&A valuations falling to 9.6x EV/EBITDA in 2023, compared to 9.9x in 2022. Several deals that transacted at premium valuations helped to bolster this average, while the median EBITDA multiple fell more drastically to 8.0x EV/EBITDA compared to 8.5x in the prior year. While business owners encountered a challenging valuation environment, several bright spots of the market have provided optimism for resilience and recovery in transaction value in 2024. Notably, average three-year EBITDA purchase multiples in the Business Services, FinTech & Services, Industrial Technology, Technology, Media & Telecom, and Transportation, Logistics & Supply Chain industries improved on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. Buyers demonstrated heightened discipline in middle market M&A processes in 2023, refraining from overextending themselves to acquire target companies. While high-quality assets still commanded solid buyer interest and competition in bidding, market clearing bids were less frequent than in prior years. In 2023, 31% of transactions closed at 10x EBITDA or higher—a decline from 38% in 2022 and 43% in 2021. This may have coincided with buyers moving to lower levels of the middle market, a common occurrence amid market uncertainty. The average enterprise value of sold target companies amounted to $89.4 million, a substantial drop from $139.3 million in 2022. When buyers did pay premium multiples, typically these businesses had demonstrated gross margin defensibility, healthy revenue visibility, and sustained product or service demand. Many dealmakers are optimistic that 2023 marked a trough for both middle market M&A volume and pricing, with 2024 positioned to experience a rebound in purchase multiples. Seller and buyer expectations are anticipated to become more aligned after such dislocation post-pandemic, when purchase multiples at times became detached from fundamentals. For the first time in nearly a decade, the cost of money is meaningful, and likely will be for the foreseeable future as the Federal Reserve works to meet its mandate. However, quality companies with sound financials and resilient end markets are poised to garner buyer appetite. Private equity buyers, facing limited partner pressure to generate returns, are expected to reenter the M&A markets in 2024 after sitting on the sidelines for much of 2023. The valuation environment may take some time to recover, but the M&A and macroeconomic environment in 2024 is expected to present a favorable backdrop for many prospective sellers to achieve an optimal exit.

This system enhances data security, privacy, and integration among different departments, offering efficient data sharing and collaboration. Positive None. Negative None. Blockchain Technology Expert The introduction of a lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing system by WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. represents a significant advancement in the realm of enterprise data management and blockchain application. The adoption of consortium blockchains for this purpose underscores the technology's suitability for controlled, inter-organizational data sharing environments. Unlike public blockchains, consortium blockchains provide a balance between decentralization and central governance, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and privacy while enabling collaboration.The system's ability to overcome data silos and enhance interoperability across departments could lead to improved operational efficiencies and decision-making processes. This technology has the potential to streamline data access, query and analysis, which is essential for businesses that rely on timely and accurate information. Furthermore, as the system matures, it could become a key differentiator in competitive industries where data-driven strategies are paramount. Data Security Analyst WiMi's new data-sharing system emphasizes the importance of data security and privacy in today's digital landscape. By leveraging consortium blockchains, WiMi provides a framework where data is not only shared efficiently but also protected against unauthorized access and tampering. This approach meets the growing demand for robust security measures in the face of increasing cyber threats.From a security perspective, the decentralization of storage and the use of smart contracts for data handling are key features that enhance the system's resilience. The requirement for authorized access ensures that sensitive information remains confidential, addressing one of the primary concerns of businesses when it comes to data sharing. If executed correctly, this technology could set a new standard for secure data sharing, which is a critical aspect for businesses aiming to protect their intellectual property and customer information. IT Systems Analyst The practical implementation of a multi-sectoral data-sharing system is a complex undertaking that requires meticulous planning and execution. Beyond the technical capabilities of consortium blockchains, the success of such a system hinges on the quality of data integration and preprocessing. The steps of data cleaning, standardization and normalization are fundamental to ensuring the accuracy and usability of shared data.Moreover, the ability of various departments to interpret and apply the results of data analysis is important for the realization of business value. This requires not only advanced analytical tools but also a workforce skilled in data literacy. As businesses increasingly rely on data-driven insights for strategic decisions, the role of clear data interpretation and application grows more vital. The system WiMi proposes could serve as a catalyst for organizational change, prompting a shift towards more data-centric operations. 03/21/2024 - 11:00 AM BEIJING, March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- WiMi Hologram Cloud Inc. (NASDAQ: WIMI) (""WiMi"" or the ""Company""), a leading global Hologram Augmented Reality (""AR"") Technology provider, today announced that it developed a lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing system based on consortium blockchains. This system can connect data between different departments by creating a network of consortium blockchains and ensuring data security and privacy. In this process, data access and integration become a crucial step. This process involves collecting data from various sectors and integrating them into a unified data platform for subsequent analysis and sharing. Consortium blockchain is a blockchain-based distributed ledger technology that allows multiple participants to share and manage data in a coalition. Compared to public chains, a consortium blockchain is more suitable for data-sharing scenarios between multiple sectors, as it offers higher performance and scalability and can be customized to meet different needs. The core value of consortium blockchains lies in cross-industry data sharing and collaboration. Through smart contracts, different departments can upload data to consortium blockchains, forming a decentralized storage network. Each node has a complete data backup to ensure that the data will not be tampered with or lost. Meanwhile, only authorized users can access the data on the chain, ensuring data privacy and security. WiMi's lightweight multi-sectoral data sharing based on consortium blockchains is an efficient, secure and reliable way to share data. Through rational design and implementation, it can effectively facilitate data sharing and collaborative work among multiple departments and promote business development and innovation. However, realizing this goal requires overcoming some challenges, such as data silos and information barriers. Lightweight multi-sectoral data sharing based on consortium blockchains rationally designed data access and integration, data query and sharing, data analysis and mining will help to realize the value of data. In the lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing system based on consortium blockchains, data query and sharing are very important. Through a reasonable data query and sharing mechanism, data interoperability and collaboration among multiple departments can be realized, improving work efficiency and data utilization. In addition, data analysis and mining are also a key link. Before data analysis and mining, data cleaning and pre-processing are needed to ensure the accuracy and consistency of data. Data cleaning mainly includes removing duplicate values, and dealing with missing values and outliers. Pre-processing includes steps such as data standardization, normalization and feature selection. Through data cleaning and pre-processing, the quality of data can be improved to provide a reliable basis for subsequent data analysis and mining. In terms of the interpretation and application of the results of data analysis and mining, it is necessary to ensure that various departments can understand and utilize the mining results. The interpretation of results is mainly to interpret and explain the results of data analysis and mining so that various departments can understand and utilize them. The application of results is mainly to apply the results of data analysis and mining to the business to achieve business optimization and decision support. Through the interpretation and application of results, the results of data analysis and mining can be transformed into real value, and promote the development and application of lightweight multi-sectoral data sharing based on consortium blockchains. The lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing technology based on consortium blockchains provides an efficient, secure and reliable way for enterprises to share data. In the era of big data, making full use of this technology will help break data silos, promote inter-departmental collaboration, and provide strong support for enterprise innovation and development. In the future, as the lightweight multi-sectoral data-sharing technology based on consortium blockchains continues to mature and develop, it is expected to bring more convenient and efficient data sharing for enterprises.
