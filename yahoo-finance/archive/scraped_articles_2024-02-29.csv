Yahoo Finance,Viking Therapeutics stock has wild week after weight-loss drug results impress Wall Street,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/viking-therapeutics-stock-has-wild-week-after-weight-loss-drug-results-impress-wall-street-192133741.html,Viking Therapeutics is the center of attention after doubling estimated weight-loss rates in a recent drug trial.,"Viking Therapeutics stock (VKTX) has been on a tear this week after it announced the phase II clinical trial results for a new experimental drug in the booming weight-loss industry.On Tuesday, shares of Viking Therapeutics more than doubled, soaring over 120% to $85 as Wall Street cheered the results.The stock shed some of its massive gains on Thursday, falling by 15% to $80 a share in afternoon trading, after the California-based company announced a $550 million stock offering. Viking issued 6.47 million shares at $85 each and said it will use the cash to fund the development of its weight-loss treatments, including a pill version.Viking Therapeutics stock was already off to a strong start this year, but this latest win significantly added to its trajectory, with shares up 322% since the beginning of the year.The injectable drug in question, named VK2735, was credited with helping patients lose up to 15% of their body weight in just 13 weeks — results that analysts say could make Viking a top target for acquisition.Wall Street viewed the results as a surprising success, given that Viking only expected weight loss to occur at a range of between 7% to 8%, the current rate for current weight-loss drug standouts such as Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro and Zepbound.""What's so impressive about this data is this compound actually caused more weight loss than Eli Lilly's [medication],"" BTIG analyst Justin Zelin told Yahoo Finance Live. ""So they [Lilly] saw about a 7% weight loss around this time point. And Viking actually doubled that. They showed 15% around the same time point of 13 weeks. And that's why investors are so impressed here.""Various packages of the weight-loss drug ""Wegovy"" from the pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk lie on the sales counter in a Danish pharmacy. (Steffen Trumpf/picture alliance via Getty Images) (picture alliance via Getty Images)Zelin said that patients could potentially lose as much as 25% to 30% of their body weight after a year on the drug.Analysts at William Blair responded to the news by raising their peak sales estimate for Viking to $14.4 billion in the US and $7.2 billion in Europe from previous valuations of $10.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. They also pegged the company’s fair value at $9.9 billion ($98.99 per share), which is up from their previous valuation of $5.5 billion.Story continues""Ultimately, we believe that the value of VK2735 will be maximized in the hands of a big pharma, which could best navigate the rebate/discount-driven reimbursement landscape,"" the analysts wrote in a note following the results.Zelin agreed that Viking's results likely renewed interest in a potential takeover.""There’s been a lot of speculation on M&A and this name,"" Zelin said. ""Obviously, it’s a name that’s of interest to Big Pharma players.""""Look, the GLP franchises are doing over $4 billion a quarter in sales,"" he continued. ""Tirzepatide is doing over $1 billion a quarter; so, this is a high-interest space that pharma’s looking at. You could imagine that players like Pfizer –– who had an asset [they discontinued] — are paying close attention to the space currently.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"

Shares have more than doubled off an October low.The company is seen as one of the primary beneficiaries of artificial intelligence, and last month, optimism about new AI processors helped AMD shares recover from a weak forecast.Earlier Thursday, Citigroup Inc. wrote that it remains “wildly bullish on semis,” especially as “the AI market continues to grow” with all kinds of businesses and organizations all buying AI chips. The firm singled out AMD as one of the stocks it favors, along with Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc.Still, the stock doesn’t exactly look like a bargain after recent gains. Shares trade at nearly 50 times estimated earnings, making it far more expensive than industry leader Nvidia, whose multiple is a relatively milder 32 times.While analysts are broadly positive — more than three-fourths of the firms tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying AMD — shares are just 2% below the average price target, suggesting additional upside from here could be limited.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle ClassElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety ViolationsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less ChocolateHollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster ExperienceThere’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
Motley Fool,Here's Why DoubleVerify Stock Dropped Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-doubleverify-stock-dropped-185523903.html,Slowing growth has the market on edge.,"Shares of advertising-technology company DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) dropped on Thursday after the company reported results for the fourth quarter of 2023. Its report was pretty good, but management is guiding for its slowest top-line growth as a publicly traded company, which is why the market isn't happy. As of 1 p.m. ET today, DoubleVerify stock was down 17%.A good year for DoubleVerifyDoubleVerify is an adtech that makes sure that money is being spent as the advertisers intended. Business has been good: The company enjoyed year-over-year revenue growth of 29% in the fourth quarter, which was what management expected. For the year, the company generated revenue of $573 million, a 27% improvement from 2022.Profitability was also better than expected. Management had predicted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $61 million, at best, but the company surprised with adjusted EBITDA of over $65 million.Still, DoubleVerify guided for just 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024. With the stock trading at over 13 times sales prior to today's report, the market apparently thought that its valuation was too pricey considering its slowing growth.Still a lot to likeIn my opinion, the valuation for DoubleVerify stock is far more reasonable now. The company expects slow growth in the first quarter, but it also is forecasting it to accelerate later in the year, bringing its full-year gain up to 22%.Moreover, it is guiding for full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $205 million to $221 million, which is a big jump from its adjusted EBITDA of $187 million in 2023.The trends are in DoubleVerify's favor as more advertising goes digital. If the company can keep growing and remain profitable, then I expect its stock price to climb higher as well over the long term. And its reset valuation offers investors a more attractive starting point.Story continuesShould you invest $1,000 in DoubleVerify right now?Before you buy stock in DoubleVerify, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DoubleVerify wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Super Micro Computer Stock Is Surging Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-super-micro-computer-stock-183927250.html,Investors can thank Nvidia for Super Micro's latest boost.,"The stock of Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) is rallying in Thursday's trading. The share price was up 5.9% as of 12:30 p.m. ET today, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.Super Micro is gaining ground today thanks to bullish news for Nvidia. In addition to positive coverage for the chipmaker from an analyst, it was also announced that a new partner had joined Nvidia's machine-vision platform.Nvidia gives Super Micro another boostMovements for Nvidia's share price often have ripple effects for other companies in artificial intelligence (AI). Shares of the leader in graphics processing units (GPUs) were up 1.7% as of 12:30 p.m. today, and the bullish momentum was lifting Super Micro and other high-profile AI stocks.In a research note by Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth yesterday, the analyst maintained a buy rating on Nvidia and raised his one-year price target from $790 per share to $985. And Rail Vision announced that it's joining Nvidia's Metropolis machine-vision platform to advance the safety and efficiency of rail travel.What's next for Super Micro Computer stock?At least in the short term, Super Micro stock will likely continue to make moves in conjunction with shifts for Nvidia. Super Micro uses Nvidia's GPUs for its high-performance rack servers.Super Micro's long-term stock performance will mostly be shaped by its own business results. The good news for investors is that the company is serving up great results and looks poised to benefit from sustained demand tailwinds.If Super Micro hits the midpoint of management's guidance target for revenue of approximately $14.5 billion this year, sales will be up roughly 104% annually, and there's a good chance rapid expansion will continue from there.Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

TheStreet,Analysts Revamp C3.ai stock price targets after earnings,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-revamp-c3-ai-stock-183700730.html,Here's what could happen to C3.ai shares next.,"The artificial intelligence revolution has made shares of AI companies’ top Wall Street performers this year. Interest in leveraging generative AI apps has soared since OpenAI’s ChatGPT demonstrated how quickly and simply large language models can search, parse, and create content.As a result, companies and governments are spending big money training AI solutions, resulting in significant growth for high-end chips and services from companies like Nvidia and Super Micro Computer that can handle AI’s heavy workloads efficiently.Investors have responded positively to cloud service providers and enterprise spending on network equipment, sending Nvidia and Super Micro Computer shares surging 247% and 740% in the past year.AI’s potential isn’t limited to these tech infrastructure plays, though. Recently, investors have set sights on companies that may profit from creating AI solutions, such as C3.ai.C3.ai, founded by software titan Thomas Siebel, reported its quarterly earnings on Feb. 28, causing shares to surge and analysts to revamp their outlooks.Thomas Siebel, chairman and chief executive officer of C3 Energy, is riding a wave of interest in AI apps.Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAI activity is surgingAI only recently went mainstream following ChatGPT becoming the fastest app to have 1 million users sign up after its launch in December 2022.However, the possibility of machines thinking for themselves isn’t new. Famed mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing researched how to design AI computers in the 1950s, and Rand Corp, one of the most regarded research companies of its time, created the first AI program in 1956. AI has also been the subject of many books and movies.Related: Analysts Revamp SoundHound AI stock price targets ahead of earningsWhile AI isn’t new, its use is only now gaining real-world attention in the wake of ChatGPT’s success. Many companies and industries are considering how AI may reshape their businesses, making them more efficient and cost-effective.For example, banks are using AI to hedge risks, pharmaceutical companies are investigating how AI could be used to create better medicine, and retailers are exploring if it can curb theft. Governments are also considering whether AI can reduce wasteful spending and reduce casualties on the battlefield.Story continuesThe surge in AI app development has led to a retooling of enterprise and cloud service provider networks. Hefty AI workloads are too much to handle for traditional infrastructure based on central processing units or CPUs. So, hyperscalers are plowing billions into computers using more powerful and energy-efficient graphic processing units, such as those made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.The positive impact on revenue and profit is funding another wave of investment in next-gen AI infrastructure that could make creating AI solutions easier.Enterprises and governments line up for AI software solutionsDeveloping AI solutions isn’t easy. Training AI requires mountains of data, and garnering useful insight requires significant AI experience.As a result, many enterprises and government agencies are turning to third parties to help them navigate their AI needs and shorten their learning curves.More AI Stocks:Analyst reveals new Broadcom stock price target tied to AIAI stock soars on new guidance (it's not Nvidia!)Nvidia CEO Huang weighs in on huge AI opportunityThomas Siebel saw that trend emerging early on. Siebel, the billionaire founder of Siebel Systems, founded C3.ai in 2009 after he sold Siebel Systems to Oracle in 2006. C3.ai offers customers an AI development platform to create their solutions, and it markets dozens of pre-packaged AI solutions that enterprises and governments can use “out of the box.”Its customers span many of the world’s biggest companies, including Philips, Shell, and Raytheon. It also generates significant business from the U.S. Government, including the Department of Defense.These users, alongside new customers (the company signed on 50 new accounts last quarter), are accelerating C3.ai’s growth. In its most recent quarter ending Jan. 31, sales increased by 18% to $78.4 million, its fourth consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year revenue growth. Government revenue increased 100% year-over-year last quarter.While C3.ai still loses money, top-line growth, leveraged against fixed costs, has improved the company’s pathway to profitability. It lost 13 cents last quarter, and Wall Street expects its loss per share to improve from 69 cents in fiscal 2024 to 34 cents in fiscal 2025.Analysts update C3.ai stock forecastsWall Street analysts anticipated sales of $76.1 million and a loss of 28 cents per share. Given C3.ai beat those estimates, analysts are now revamping their models, resulting in updated outlooks.""Customer engagement grew 80% year-over-year. Our significant first mover advantage in Enterprise AI is generating tailwinds as market interest in adopting AI accelerates,” said Siebel.Following its quarter, C3.ai’s management boosted the low end of its full-year fiscal 2024 revenue to $306 million from $295 million, slightly above the consensus analysts’ forecast of $305.5 million.The improved outlook led Canaccord to bump its C3.ai stock price target by $4 to $31. Its analysts cited strength in subscription revenue, which increased by 20% in the quarter and accounts for about 90% of total revenue.Morgan Stanley also weighed in, inching its price target up $1 to $21. However, analysts think shares are pricey, given shares are trading at about 12.3 times revenue and annual revenue growth is still below 20%.More impressed, however, is Wedbush Securities. Their team, including analyst Dan Ives, lifted their C3.ai price target by $5 to $40, reiterating their “Outperform rating.”The updated forecast is supported by better-than-expected quarterly results and the potential for ongoing investments to allow it to penetrate global markets further.""C3 continues generating strong deal flow in the pipeline, seeing 73% y/y growth due to rising opportunities for C3’s Enterprise AI platform and Generative AI solutions,"" wrote Wedbush to clients on Feb. 29. ""We view this quarter as a step in the right direction for C3 as the company’s entire product portfolio continues generating unprecedented demand.""Related: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024"

While the PCE is still above the central bank’s 2% target — giving credence to officials’ wait-and-see approach — the data helped allay concerns about a more significant inflation increase.“For markets keenly focused on when the Fed will transition towards easing rates, this report will help restore confidence that it isn’t ‘if’ the Fed will begin to cut rates in 2024, but ‘when’,” said Quincy Krosby at LPL Financial.Treasury 10-year yields dropped three basis points to 4.24%. The S&P 500 wavered at the end of a strong month. Megacaps were mixed, with Nvidia Corp. up and Tesla Inc. down. Dell Technologies Inc. — which has more than doubled since the start of 2023 — will report earnings after the close. Bitcoin topped $62,000.To Krishna Guha at Evercore, the PCE report contains “no new bad news” on the inflation dynamics, with June remaining a solid bet for the first rate cut. Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group says concerns about a reacceleration in prices are “overblown”. And Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley notes the data may ease some immediate doubts among traders who had begun to wonder if the Fed would dig in its heels and keep rates higher for longer.Treasury yields retreated from near their highest levels of the year. The move was further aided by a bigger-than-expected jump in new jobless claims indicating labor-market softening, and by anticipation of bond-buying related to the turn of the month.Story continuesAlso, positioning indicators before Thursday’s data suggested that traders had exhausted their capacity for wagers on higher yields in the absence of new information.Wall Street continued to keep a close a eye on the latest Fedspeak.Fed Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic reiterated his view that it will probably be appropriate for the central bank to begin cutting interest rates this summer based on his outlook for inflation. Top officials emphasized this week that they are in no hurry to cut rates with the economy showing signs of continuing strength.Since the hot January consumer-price index data, “officials have generally balanced between acknowledging the heat as unwelcome news, but not overweighting one data point too much, especially given possible distortions,” said Peter Williams at 22V Research.“We still need to wait until next month’s CPI data to see if the inflationary jump we saw earlier this month was just a blip, or if it is in fact the beginning of a new inflationary trend,” said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. “At least for today, it should be all systems go and buyers should re-emerge.”To Michael Shaoul at Marketfield Asset Management, despite the relief that there wasn’t another upside surprise in inflation, it’s important to note that the “stickier” portions of Thursday’s data were “quite strong.”“Even allowing for some anomalies in the report, this is not consistent with taking core PCE down to 2% and keeping it there,” he said.Corporate Highlights:Best Buy Co. struck a more upbeat tone about reversing a two-year slump amid soft demand for electronics and appliances.Salesforce Inc. gave a lackluster annual sales forecast, but investors were pleased by the company’s continued profitability, a first-ever dividend and an increase in share buybacks.C3.ai Inc. reported sales that suggested customers are responding positively to the software company’s new artificial intelligence-based apps.Snowflake Inc., a software maker, delivered a disappointing sales forecast and announced that Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman is stepping down from the role.HP Inc. reported quarterly revenue that missed estimates, battered by the ongoing slump in personal computer sales.The US Justice Department is scrutinizing the midair blowout last month of a Boeing Co. door plug on an Alaska Air flight, in a move that could expose the company to criminal prosecution, according to a person familiar with the matter.Bayer AG plans to add activist investor Jeffrey Ubben to its supervisory board in the latest shakeup at the troubled chemicals and drugs company before a much-anticipated capital markets event next week.Grifols SA shares fell the most ever on Thursday after management said the Spanish plasma maker will generate less cash this year than investors were expecting, dealing a bigger blow to the stock than last month’s attack by a short seller.Key Events This Week:China official PMI, Caixin manufacturing PMI, FridayEurozone S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, CPI, unemployment, FridayBOE chief economist Huw Pill speaks, FridayUS construction spending, ISM Manufacturing, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, FridayFed’s Raphael Bostic and Mary Daly speak, FridaySome of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 rose 0.1% as of 12:26 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 rose 0.4%The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2%The MSCI World index was little changedCurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changedThe euro fell 0.4% to $1.0800The British pound fell 0.3% to $1.2621The Japanese yen rose 0.5% to 149.99 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 2.4% to $62,029.01Ether rose 3.3% to $3,432.98BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries declined three basis points to 4.24%Germany’s 10-year yield declined five basis points to 2.41%Britain’s 10-year yield declined six basis points to 4.12%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.3% to $78.77 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.5% to $2,045.17 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Julien Ponthus.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle ClassElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety ViolationsChocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less ChocolateHollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster ExperienceThere’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
