Positive None. Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 02:45 PM Through creative collaborations with like-minded companies such as WM, we can help advance the well-being of people and the planet. Together, we're developing a blueprint for sustainability in communities and in sports, helping events like the Grant Thornton Invitational address its environmental footprint.NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Given golf's intrinsic connection to nature, the significance of advancing sustainability in the sport cannot be overstated. And there's a growing responsibility to ensure its impact on the environment aligns with modern values for futureproofing. Doing so not only minimizes the ecological footprint of golf tournaments, course management, and other golf-related activities, but also sets a powerful example for fans, athletes, sponsors and brands alike. In alignment with such values, the inaugural Grant Thornton Invitational golf tournament sought the expertise of two companies known for their expertise in sustainability: Dow and WM.Two Brands, One Sustainability MissionWM's broad reach as a comprehensive environmental solutions provider and our leadership in materials science are bringing enhanced levels of sustainability and innovation to a variety of spheres - one of which is golf. For example, leveraging insights learned respectively from the acclaimed WM Phoenix Open and Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational, WM advises the PGA TOUR on sustainability, while Dow serves as the Official Sustainability Resource for the LPGA and Ladies European Tour.Both WM and Dow collaborate closely with the GEO Foundation for Sustainable Golf (GEO), an organization dedicated to championing sustainability in golf worldwide. Through this work, the 2019 Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational became the first-ever GEO-Certified LPGA event, while the 2017 WM Phoenix Open became the first GEO-Certified PGA TOUR event. The GEO Certification acknowledges adherence to the highest sustainability standards in golf.Just as the LPGA and PGA TOUR's best teamed up on the golf course at the Grant Thornton Invitational, WM united their strengths with ours to elevate the sustainability program of the tournament, further demonstrating their shared dedication to advancing environmental responsibility in and beyond the sport.A Closer Look at Dow & WM's Sustainability InitiativesWith the potential to reach millions, professional golf events like the Grant Thornton Invitational provide unparalleled opportunities to educate and raise awareness of environmental issues and sustainable solutions. Our companies came together to advance the shared goal of driving sustainability through carefully planned and executed initiatives at the tournament, including:Careful analysis of the tournament's footprint, such as tracking water and other natural resource usage, to support the development of a phased emissions reduction plan.A commitment to recycling, exemplified by using recycling and trash bins crafted from recycled cardboard.Active engagement with event attendees to foster a culture of environmental sustainability through educational efforts, such as clarifying the distinction between recyclable and non-recyclable materials.On-site sorting efforts to separate recyclable materials effectively, paired with pre-event guidance distributed to vendors outlining preferred items for on-site use.Collaboration with caterers to facilitate food donations.Our partnership with WM extends beyond the realms of the Grant Thornton Invitational - and golf. In November 2022, we co-launched a residential collection program in North America, specifically designed for hard-to-recycle plastic, including items like grocery bags and shrink wrap. In select markets, consumers now have the convenience of placing these materials directly in their curbside recycling, with WM handling the processing at their nearest state-of-the-art recycling facility. Once at full capacity, the program is anticipated to divert a notable 120,000 metric tons of plastic film away from landfills each year. Looking ahead, we are excited to expand our collaboration with WM in the future, through the sponsorship of the 2024 WM Phoenix Open. During the Grant Thornton Invitational, our teams participated, together with WM, in great discussions around best practices in the worlds of DEI, sustainability and purpose-driven sports marketing, that will help guide future collaborations - stay tuned!Driving aheadBy embracing innovative, environmentally conscious practices, it is possible to future-proof professional golf while inspiring a broader audience to champion sustainability. For us and for WM, golf isn't the final destination, but rather just one of the platforms being leveraged to amplify the use of environmentally responsible practices, and to develop game-changing, sustainable innovations and collaborations.Learn more about Dow's Partnerships in GolfLearn more about Dow and WM's Recycling ProgramCarlos Padilla II, Head of Global Sports Partnerships at Dow View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from DOW on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: DOWWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/dow Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: DOWView the original press release on accesswire.com What companies collaborated at the Grant Thornton Invitational to advance sustainability in golf?

The proceeds will be used to redeem existing notes and for general corporate purposes. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The pricing of Avis Budget Group's €600 million senior notes issuance is a significant financial move, indicating a strategic approach to capital management. The increase from the initially planned €400 million to €600 million suggests strong investor demand, which could be interpreted as market confidence in the company's creditworthiness and future prospects.From a financial perspective, the decision to redeem the existing 4.750% senior notes due 2026 with the proceeds from the new offering could result in interest savings, given the current interest rates. However, it is important to note the interest rate increase to 7.00% for the new notes, which raises the cost of debt for Avis Budget Group. This could impact their interest expense and net income in future periods.Investors and stakeholders should consider the implications of this debt restructuring on the company's leverage ratios and interest coverage metrics. While the immediate liquidity boost and potential debt repayment could strengthen the balance sheet, the higher interest rate may affect future earnings and cash flows. Market Research Analyst The automotive rental industry is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in vehicle fleets and infrastructure. Avis Budget Group's move to secure additional financing through senior notes could suggest an anticipation of growth opportunities or a need to refresh its vehicle fleet, which is critical to maintaining competitiveness in the market.Moreover, the use of proceeds for general corporate purposes could indicate strategic flexibility, allowing the company to adapt to market conditions and invest in areas such as technology upgrades, expansion into new markets, or enhanced customer service initiatives.It is also essential to analyze the potential impact on the company's stock performance. Debt offerings can sometimes be perceived negatively if they lead to over-leveraging, but they can also be seen as positive if they facilitate growth or improve capital structure. The market's reaction to this news will be a telling indicator of investor sentiment towards Avis Budget Group's financial strategy. Legal Expert The issuance of senior notes by Avis Budget Finance plc, a subsidiary of Avis Budget Group, is structured to comply with securities regulations, primarily targeting qualified institutional buyers. The reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 allows for a private offering, bypassing the need for public registration, which can expedite the process and reduce disclosure requirements.However, the private nature of the offering limits the pool of potential investors to those who meet specific criteria, which could influence the liquidity and secondary market for these securities. Additionally, the fact that these notes are unregistered securities means they carry certain restrictions on resale, which must be carefully considered by potential investors.It is also important to note that this press release is not a notice of redemption for the 4.750% senior notes, which implies that a formal notice will follow, adhering to the terms of the indenture governing those notes. The legal implications of the redemption process are crucial for current note holders, as they will need to understand the timing and process for the redemption of their investments. 02/21/2024 - 01:50 PM PARSIPPANY, N.J., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avis Budget Group, Inc.

EMALS offers enhanced operational capabilities and cost-efficiency compared to steam catapults.","HII Begins Topside EMALS Testing on John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) at Newport News Shipbuilding Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary HII begins topside testing of EMALS on aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy, marking a significant milestone in carrier construction. EMALS offers enhanced operational capabilities and cost-efficiency compared to steam catapults. Positive None. Negative None. Defense Industry Analyst The commencement of topside testing of the EMALS on the John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) signifies a critical juncture in naval defense capabilities and the ongoing modernization of the U.S. Navy's fleet. The successful integration of EMALS technology on the USS Gerald R. Ford and its subsequent deployment on the John F. Kennedy represents a significant advancement over traditional steam catapult systems. This transition to electromagnetic systems reflects a broader trend in defense technology towards more efficient, reliable and flexible systems.From an industry perspective, this development is a testament to the capabilities of Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) as a leading military shipbuilder. The progression to 'dead-load' testing indicates that the project is on track, which is likely to be well-received by investors and stakeholders. This phase is not only a technical milestone but also serves as a demonstration of HII's commitment to meeting Navy requirements and schedules.Moreover, the adoption of EMALS could potentially lead to increased demand for HII's services as other nations look to upgrade their aircraft carriers. The operational benefits of EMALS, such as higher launch-energy capacity and reduced stress on aircraft, could provide HII with a competitive edge in international markets. The long-term implications for HII's business could include sustained revenue from maintenance, upgrades and potential new contracts for similar systems globally. Military Technology Expert EMALS technology represents a paradigm shift in naval aviation launch systems, with the potential to redefine aircraft carrier operations. The electromagnetic system offers a more fine-tuned control over the launch process, enabling a wider range of aircraft to be deployed from carriers. This includes the latest generation of fighter jets as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are becoming increasingly central to modern warfare strategies.The ability to launch heavier payloads and the reduced wear on aircraft extend the operational lifespan of carrier-based fleets, potentially lowering long-term costs for the U.S. Navy. Additionally, the smoother acceleration profile of EMALS reduces the risk of damage to advanced electronic systems and airframes, which is crucial for maintaining the high readiness levels required for modern combat scenarios.For the defense sector and its investors, the successful deployment of EMALS on a second Ford-class carrier may signal increased confidence in the technology's reliability and performance. This could influence future carrier designs and retrofit programs, not just within the U.S. Navy but also among allied navies that operate or aspire to operate aircraft carriers. Financial Analyst HII's announcement of the progression to 'dead-load' testing of EMALS on the John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) could have implications for investor sentiment and the company's stock performance. The successful execution of this phase is a positive indicator of HII's ability to fulfill complex defense contracts and manage the risks associated with the development of cutting-edge military technologies.Investors typically monitor such milestones closely as they can impact project timelines and the company's financial projections. Delays or technical issues during this testing phase could result in cost overruns and schedule slips, affecting HII's profitability and cash flow. Conversely, meeting or exceeding testing milestones can enhance the company's reputation and lead to future contracts, bolstering long-term revenue streams.It is also important to note that defense contracts like those for the Ford-class carriers are typically multi-year engagements with significant financial implications. The consistent progress on the Kennedy and the visibility of future Ford-class carriers under construction provide a stable backlog for HII, which is an important aspect for investors seeking long-term growth and stability in the defense sector. 02/21/2024 - 02:30 PM NEWPORT NEWS, Va., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HII (NYSE: HII) announced today that its Newport News Shipbuilding division (NNS) recently began topside testing of the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) on aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). EMALS, first integrated into USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), replaces the existing steam catapults currently in use on the U.S. Navy’s Nimitz-class aircraft carriers. Following successful “no-load” testing on catapults one and two, known as the ‘bow cats,’ the NNS team, alongside the John F. Kennedy crew, has now started “dead-load” testing. In this phase, large, wheeled, car-like structures of graduated weights up to 80,000 pounds to simulate the weight of actual aircraft are launched off the carrier’s bow into the James River. They are then retrieved and relaunched until the conclusion of the test program to ensure the catapults are ready for their primary intended purpose: to launch all carrier-based fixed wing aircraft flown by the U.S. Navy. The first dead loads used in this testing have special significance. Family members of shipbuilders signed them with messages of congratulations and gratitude during the shipyard’s Family Day held in October. Photos and video accompanying this release is available at: https://hii.com/news/hii-newport-news-shipbuilding-carrier-cvn-79-dead-load-testing/. “As we make sustained progress in the construction, testing and turnover of John F. Kennedy, reaching the dead load testing phase is a visual demonstration of how far we’ve come,” said Lucas Hicks, vice president, John F. Kennedy (CVN 79) new construction aircraft carrier program. “It is evident from the thousands of written messages that our shipbuilders and their families appreciate and understand the significance of our work. We are proud of the incredible teamwork that has brought us to this point, and remain committed to delivering this mighty aircraft carrier to the fleet so the crew can carry out the important mission ahead.” “The first dead-load launch off the flight deck is a historic moment for PCU John F. Kennedy, and a testament to the power of great teamwork between our JFK crew, HII team, and NAVAIR engineers,” said CAPT Colin Day, commanding officer, PCU John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). “I’m particularly proud of our Air Department and the hard-working Aviation Boatswain Mates who worked tirelessly alongside the engineering and testing teams to get us to this critical moment.” Traveling more than 300 feet down the catapult track at more than 150 miles per hour, EMALS provides expanded operational capability at reduced costs, higher launch-energy capacity, and more accurate end-speed control, with a smooth acceleration at both high and low speeds. The launch profiles have been optimized to reduce stress on the aircraft, in contrast to the sudden acceleration of steam catapults. Kennedy is the second Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carrier under construction at NNS, which is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. In addition to Kennedy, two other Ford-class carriers are under construction at NNS: Enterprise (CVN 80) and Doris Miller (CVN 81). About HII HII is a global, all-domain defense provider. HII’s mission is to deliver the world’s most powerful ships and all-domain solutions in service of the nation, creating the advantage for our customers to protect peace and freedom around the world.

Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags acquisition Rhea-AI Summary BioVaxys Technology Corp. completes the acquisition of IMV Inc.'s assets, expanding its portfolio in oncology, infectious disease, allergy desensitization, and autoimmune diseases. The acquisition includes clinical-stage programs like Maveropepimut-S, with plans for organic growth through licensing and partnership opportunities. The Company aims to leverage the DPX™ and HapTenix© platforms for targeted immunotherapies. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The acquisition of IMV's portfolio by BioVaxys Technology Corp. represents a strategic expansion in the biotechnology sector, focusing on oncology, infectious disease, allergy desensitization and autoimmune diseases. The one-time payment structure, combining cash and equity, is indicative of a calculated investment designed to bolster BioVaxys' assets without overleveraging its financial position. This transaction impacts the company's market valuation, as the issuance of common shares at a deemed price affects the existing shareholders' equity. The long-term value, however, hinges on the successful integration and advancement of the clinical-stage programs.Investors should monitor the company's expenditure on these programs, as clinical development can be capital-intensive. The mention of potential licensing and partnership opportunities suggests a proactive approach to monetizing the newly acquired assets, which may lead to increased revenue streams. However, the inherent risks of clinical trials and the regulatory landscape must be factored into any financial forecasts.The market's response to this acquisition will likely be tied to the perceived value of the DPX™ and HapTenix© platforms, as well as the progress of the clinical programs. BioVaxys' ability to communicate the benefits and potential of its expanded portfolio to investors will be crucial in maintaining and possibly enhancing investor confidence. Medical Research Analyst The acquisition of IMV's intellectual property by BioVaxys provides a significant boost to the company's pipeline, particularly with the addition of Maveropepimut-S to its oncology portfolio. The potential of the DPX™ platform in creating improved mRNA vaccines and multivalent viral vaccines aligns with current trends in personalized medicine and could position BioVaxys favorably in a competitive market.From a medical research perspective, the DPX™ technology's ability to elicit a superior immune response is noteworthy. This could have implications for the efficacy of vaccines and immunotherapies, potentially leading to better patient outcomes. However, clinical success is not guaranteed and the research community will be keenly observing the progression of these assets through clinical trials.It is also important to consider the scalability of the technology and the regulatory hurdles that come with bringing new medical treatments to market. The success of these assets will depend not only on their clinical efficacy but also on their ability to meet stringent safety standards and gain approval from health authorities. Market Research Analyst The strategic acquisition of IMV's assets by BioVaxys positions the company to potentially capture a larger share of the biotech market. The focus on DPX™ and HapTenix© platforms suggests a commitment to innovation in immunotherapy, a field that has seen significant investor interest. The platforms' applications in mRNA vaccines and immune system diseases are particularly relevant given the recent global emphasis on vaccine development and immunological research.Market trends indicate a growing demand for targeted immunotherapies and personalized medicine, which could make BioVaxys an attractive partner for larger pharmaceutical companies seeking to expand their portfolios. The company's plan to identify target partners for licensing and partnership opportunities indicates a forward-thinking approach to growth and revenue diversification.The potential for organic growth through these partnerships may drive investor optimism, but it is essential to analyze the competitive landscape and the unique value proposition BioVaxys offers. The success of these collaborations will be a key determinant of the company's market position and its ability to deliver on the promises of its expanded portfolio. 02/21/2024 - 01:54 PM VANCOUVER, BC, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- BioVaxys Technology Corp.

The product aims to help solopreneurs achieve financial stability and make informed business decisions. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The introduction of QuickBooks Solopreneur by Intuit Inc. is a strategic move to capture a growing market segment of one-person businesses. The number of solopreneurs is on the rise, as indicated by Intuit's own Entrepreneurship Report, which aligns with broader labor market trends towards gig economy and self-employment. This product expansion caters to a niche yet expanding customer base, which could lead to increased user adoption and recurring revenue streams for Intuit.From a market perspective, the decision to target solopreneurs is astute, considering the lower market penetration of comprehensive financial tools in this segment compared to larger enterprises. The ease of use and the integration of business and tax management in one platform could reduce barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs, potentially leading to higher market demand.However, the success of QuickBooks Solopreneur hinges on user experience, pricing strategy and the effectiveness of its features in truly simplifying financial management for solopreneurs. Competitors are likely to respond with similar offerings, so Intuit's first-mover advantage and brand reputation will be critical in maintaining market share. Financial Analyst Intuit's launch of QuickBooks Solopreneur may have a positive impact on its financial performance. The tool's ability to streamline financial operations and tax preparation for solopreneurs addresses a significant pain point, potentially leading to increased customer loyalty and a lower churn rate. By simplifying the transition from bookkeeping to tax filing, Intuit is also leveraging its existing TurboTax platform, which could lead to cross-selling opportunities and enhanced customer lifetime value.The financial implications for Intuit will depend on the product's adoption rate and the ability to upsell additional services. If the tool gains traction, it could contribute to Intuit's top-line growth and further diversify its revenue sources. Investors should monitor user growth metrics and engagement levels post-launch to gauge the product's impact on Intuit's financial health.It's important to note that while this product may not immediately contribute a significant portion to Intuit's overall revenue, it represents an investment in capturing a growing demographic, which could be accretive to earnings over the long term. Tax Professional The integration of tax preparation features within QuickBooks Solopreneur is a significant development for solopreneurs who often struggle with tax compliance and management. The ability to track mileage, categorize business expenses and prepare tax returns within the same platform can save time and reduce errors, which are common challenges faced by individuals running their own business.For tax professionals, this tool could facilitate smoother collaboration with clients, as financial data would be more organized and accessible. However, the extent to which QuickBooks Solopreneur can replace professional tax advice remains to be seen, as complex tax scenarios may still require expert intervention.The tool's effectiveness in ensuring tax readiness and its adoption by solopreneurs could influence tax preparation practices within this demographic, potentially reducing the stress associated with tax season and improving overall tax compliance. 02/21/2024 - 01:00 PM New QuickBooks product tailored to the needs of solopreneurs, featuring intuitive tools to manage business transactions, stay tax-ready, and set financial goals MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Intuit Inc.

Board Increases 2024 Common Dividend 5.3%, Declares Dividend on Common Stock Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) increases its quarterly dividend by 5.3% to 54.75 cents per share, marking the twenty-first consecutive year of dividend growth. The company sets a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 50-60% and aims for 5-7% annual dividend and earnings per share growth. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Xcel Energy Inc. of a dividend increase to $0.5475 per share reflects a positive signal to investors about the company's financial health and commitment to returning value. This 5.3% increase is particularly notable as it marks the twenty-first consecutive year of dividend growth, which can be seen as a testament to Xcel Energy's consistent performance and strategic financial management. The established dividend payout ratio target of 50-60 percent aligns with the industry standard for utilities, which typically maintain higher payout ratios due to their stable cash flows and lower reinvestment needs compared to other sectors.Investors often view utilities as defensive investments, especially during volatile economic periods, due to their reliable dividends and inelastic demand for their services. Xcel Energy's reaffirmation of a 5-7 percent annual growth objective for both dividends and earnings per share suggests a balanced approach to capital allocation, aiming for sustainable growth and shareholder returns. However, it is crucial to monitor how this strategy will be supported by the company's operational performance and whether it can maintain this growth without compromising its financial stability. Energy Market Analyst Xcel Energy operates within a heavily regulated industry, where changes in policy and regulatory environment can have significant implications for the company's operations and financials. The company's ability to increase dividends consistently is indicative of not only its financial health but also its regulatory strategy and the stability of its operational regions. As an energy provider across 8 Western and Midwestern states, Xcel Energy must navigate various regulatory landscapes, which can impact its cost structure and revenue potential.The company's comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services, along with its customer base of 3.8 million electricity and 2.2 million natural gas customers, provides a diversified stream of revenue. The emphasis on both electricity and natural gas suggests resilience to fluctuations in energy demand and pricing. However, the transition to renewable energy sources and the associated capital expenditures required to update infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations could influence future financials and the ability to maintain dividend growth. 02/21/2024 - 12:06 PM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: XEL) today raised the quarterly dividend on the company’s common stock from 52 cents per share to 54.75 cents per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.19 per share. The dividends are payable April 20, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. “Today’s dividend increase of 5.3% marks the twenty first consecutive year that Xcel Energy has increased its dividend. It signals the strength of our business and our recognition of the importance of dividend growth to our shareholders,” said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. “In addition, we have established a long-term dividend payout ratio target of 50-60 percent. Our dividend growth and earnings per share growth objectives remain 5-7 percent annually,” said Frenzel. Xcel Energy is a major U.S. electricity and natural gas company, with operations in 8 Western and Midwestern states.

The company's revenue is expected to reach $64 million in FY 2024, with a focus on vertical integration and global expansion. Positive Speculative Buy rating and $4.00 price target from Taglich Brothers. Expected revenue of $64 million in FY 2024. Tangible book value per share of $3.09, suggesting undervaluation. Trailing Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.2X, below industry average. Anticipated growth from Cana Laboratories and generic drug portfolio. Potential revenue contribution of $30 million from Cana by 2025. Negative None. Financial Analyst The Speculative Buy rating and the substantial price target set by Taglich Brothers for Cosmos Health's common stock suggest an optimistic outlook on the company's financial health and growth prospects. The valuation metrics, such as the Price-to-Book ratio of 0.27X and the Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.2X, are significantly lower than the sector averages. These figures indicate that the stock may be undervalued, especially considering the tangible book value per share is nearly four times higher than the current share price.The forecasted revenue growth for FY 2024, which is expected to be 25% higher than previous years, reflects the positive impact of strategic acquisitions such as Cana Laboratories and the generic drug portfolio. The anticipated reduction in the full-year loss per share due to operating leverage from synergies also suggests improved profitability in the near term. However, investors should be cautious of the execution risks and the potential dilution from the exercise of warrants, which could affect the stock's performance. Market Research Analyst The healthcare sector is experiencing a push towards vertical integration, which Cosmos Health is capitalizing on. This strategy can create efficiencies and reduce costs, contributing to the company's anticipated revenue growth. The report's anticipation of substantial growth due to the company's evolution into a vertically integrated organization aligns with current industry trends of consolidation.Moreover, the report highlights the potential for significant growth beyond 2024, especially with Cana's expected contribution of at least $30 million of additional revenue by 2025. This suggests that Cosmos Health is not only focusing on immediate growth but is also strategically positioning itself for long-term expansion, particularly with the upcoming launch of a generic diabetes drug in Europe, which could tap into a large and growing market. Pharmaceutical Industry Expert The valuation of Cosmos Health appears to hinge on the successful integration of Cana Laboratories and the launch of new products, such as the generic diabetes drug. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and the success of new drugs is critical. The company's adjusted EBITDA improvement will be a key indicator of its ability to manage costs and generate profits from its expanded product lines.The trailing Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.2X is particularly noteworthy, as it is well below the average for the medical distribution and drug manufacturing sectors. If Cosmos Health can sustain its revenue growth and improve margins, there is potential for a re-rating of the stock closer to industry norms. However, the market will likely require evidence of sustained profitability and successful product launches before a significant revaluation can occur. 02/21/2024 - 11:50 AM CHICAGO, IL / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Cosmos Health Inc. (""Cosmos Health"" or the ""Company'') (NASDAQ:COSM), a diversified, vertically integrated global healthcare group engaged in innovative R&D, owner of proprietary pharmaceutical and nutraceutical brands, manufacturer and distributor of healthcare products, and operator of a telehealth platform, announced today that Taglich Brothers, Inc. (""Taglich Brothers"") published its first coverage report on the Company's common stock.The report, published on February 20, 2024, by analyst Howard Halpern, assigned a Speculative Buy rating and set a 12-month price target of $4.00 per share, compared to the share price of $0.83 at the time of publication.A summary is available in the Taglich Brothers website section dedicated to Cosmos Health, and the detailed report can be accessed here.Greg Siokas, Chief Executive Officer of Cosmos Health, stated: ""We are pleased that Taglich Brothers has published its inaugural coverage report on our common stock. As I have consistently stated, I believe our common stock is undervalued, given our accomplishments and growth prospects. In line with this, it's gratifying to see Taglich Brothers set a price target nearly 5 times higher than our current share price, underscoring the very reason I am also buying shares in the open market. We hope for even greater analyst coverage over time, which should further elevate awareness and highlight the intrinsic value of Cosmos.""Key highlights of the Taglich Brothers coverage report include:Price target of $4.00 per share implying the share price could increase nearly five-fold over the next twelve months.Tangible book value per share of $3.09, nearly four times higher than the current share price, suggesting a Price-to-Book ratio of 0.27X.Substantial growth is anticipated due to the Company's evolution into a vertically integrated global health organization.FY 2024 revenue is expected to reach $64 million, approximately 25% higher than FY 2022A and FY 2023E, reflecting, among others, the benefits from a full year's contribution from Cana Laboratories ('Cana') and sales from the Company's recently acquired portfolio of generic drugs.Trailing Price-to-Sales multiple of 0.2X is significantly below the average price-to-sales multiple of 2.2X for companies in the medical distribution and drug manufacturing sectors.Applying a price-to-sales multiple of 1.4X to the 2024 sales per share forecast of $3.50, and accounting for execution risks and potential dilution from the exercise of warrants, results in a year-ahead price target of approximately $4.00 per share.Valuation is expected to improve as Cosmos Health reports revenue growth, narrows operating losses, reduces cash burn, and improves adjusted EBITDA.The full-year loss per share is anticipated to decrease significantly due to substantial operating leverage from synergies with Cana and the associated increase in pharmaceutical production.Moving beyond 2024, significant growth is anticipated from Cana, with the potential to contribute at least $30 million of additional revenue by 2025 through the relaunch of its proprietary products, contract manufacturing services, production of new internally developed products, as well as the launch of a generic diabetes drug in Europe.About Cosmos Health Inc.Cosmos Health Inc.

Five Star Bancorp invests in San Francisco Bay Area expansion strategy by hiring five commercial banking professionals and planning full-service office in San Francisco,2024-02-21T17:45:00.000Z,Low,Neutral,"Five Star Bancorp (FSBC) aims to fill the gap in high-tech, personalized concierge banking in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is expanding its presence by hiring seasoned professionals and opening a new office in San Francisco.","Five Star Bancorp invests in San Francisco Bay Area expansion strategy by hiring five commercial banking professionals and planning full-service office in San Francisco Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Five Star Bancorp (FSBC) aims to fill the gap in high-tech, personalized concierge banking in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is expanding its presence by hiring seasoned professionals and opening a new office in San Francisco. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The strategic move by Five Star Bancorp to fill a niche in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly targeting the high-tech sector and offering personalized concierge banking services, is indicative of a proactive approach to capitalizing on market opportunities created by the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank. This initiative could have significant implications for the company's growth trajectory and market share.From a market research perspective, the expansion into a region known for its high concentration of technology firms and affluent clientele presents a substantial growth opportunity. The recruitment of seasoned professionals suggests a commitment to quality service, which is crucial in attracting high-net-worth individuals and tech companies seeking bespoke financial solutions post the vacuum created by the downfall of local banking giants.However, the success of such an expansion will hinge on the company's ability to differentiate its services and foster trust among a clientele that may be wary following recent bank instabilities. The long-term impact on Five Star Bancorp's financials will depend on the effectiveness of their client acquisition and retention strategies in a competitive banking landscape. Financial Analyst The announcement of Five Star Bancorp's expansion and the opening of a new full-service office is a strategic decision that could potentially enhance the company's profitability and diversify its revenue streams. The hiring of a specialized commercial banking team indicates an aggressive push into the high-tech sector, which could lead to an increase in high-margin banking services.Investors should monitor the company's cost management closely, as expansions can be capital-intensive and may affect short-term profitability. The expected opening in the third quarter of 2024 allows for a timeline to assess the initial capital outlay and operational costs versus the potential revenue generated from new clients. The company's quarterly financial results following the opening will be a key indicator of the success of this expansion.It will be important to observe how Five Star Bancorp manages risks associated with the high-tech sector, which is known for its volatility. Diversification within their client portfolio will be essential to mitigate sector-specific risks. Additionally, the company's ability to leverage the experience of the newly hired team to secure a foothold in the Bay Area will be critical in determining the long-term impact on the company's stock performance. Economist The entry of Five Star Bancorp into the San Francisco Bay Area banking sector, especially after the collapse of two major local banks, suggests a strategic response to a shift in the economic landscape. The bank's initiative to offer high-tech, personalized concierge banking services is positioned to meet the demand for specialized financial services in a region with a significant high-tech industry presence.From an economic standpoint, the presence of a new player in the market could stimulate competition, potentially leading to more favorable terms for consumers and businesses in need of financial services. Moreover, the expansion could contribute to local economic growth by providing financing options for startups and established tech firms, fostering innovation and job creation.The broader economic implications of this move include the potential stabilization of the local banking sector and the restoration of confidence among investors and customers. However, the success of this venture will depend on the economic conditions of the region and the banking sector's overall health. Monitoring macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, investment flows and the performance of the tech sector will be crucial in evaluating the potential impact of Five Star Bancorp's expansion on the local economy and its business prospects. 02/21/2024 - 12:45 PM Five Star Bancorp seeks to fill a San Francisco Bay Area gap in high-tech, personalized concierge banking left by Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank failuresRANCHO CORDOVA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Five Star Bancorp (Nasdaq: FSBC) (“Five Star” or the “Company”) announced the hiring of a team of five seasoned commercial banking professionals in San Francisco to advance the Company’s expansion strategy in the San Francisco Bay Area.

The personal genetic information, including heritage, names, and addresses, was compiled into lists and sold on the dark web. The breach poses a significant threat to customer safety, especially from potential government tracking. 23andMe has been accused of not informing compromised customers about the breach, leading to a class-action lawsuit. Positive None. Negative 23andMe (ME) faced a significant data breach, compromising the personal genetic information of 7 million users, with a focus on Jewish and Chinese customers. The breach has raised concerns about customer safety and potential government tracking. The company's delayed response and lack of disclosure to affected customers have resulted in a class-action lawsuit. Cybersecurity Expert The incident involving 23andMe represents a significant cybersecurity failure with substantial implications for privacy and data protection. The targeted nature of the hack, focusing on specific ethnic groups, elevates the concern as it suggests a potential for discriminatory practices and heightened risks for those populations. The sale of this sensitive data on the dark web could lead to a range of malicious activities, from identity theft to targeted phishing attacks.From a cybersecurity perspective, the delay in disclosing the full extent of the breach is troubling. It raises questions about the company's incident response protocols and transparency with its users. Companies holding sensitive data are expected to have robust security measures in place and to act swiftly when those measures fail. The impact on 23andMe's reputation and customer trust could be severe, potentially affecting user retention and stock valuation. Legal Expert The legal ramifications of this data breach could be extensive for 23andMe. The lawsuit alleges that the company failed to adequately inform affected customers, a potential violation of various data protection laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if European citizens are involved. The specificity of the targeting could also introduce elements of discrimination law.Moreover, the fact that 23andMe is accused of concealing the targeted nature of the hack could exacerbate their legal liability and lead to punitive damages. This could have a significant impact on the company's financials, as legal costs and potential settlements or fines could be substantial. Investors should be aware of the potential for long-term financial repercussions and the possibility of regulatory scrutiny that could affect the company's operations. Financial Analyst The disclosure of the 23andMe data breach is likely to have immediate and potentially long-term financial implications for the company. In the short term, the company may face a decline in stock price as investors react to the uncertainty and potential costs associated with the breach. This includes direct costs such as legal fees and settlements, as well as indirect costs like increased security measures and potential loss of customers.In the longer term, the company's brand image and competitive position could suffer, impacting its ability to attract and retain customers. This could result in decreased revenue streams and potentially impact future earnings. Additionally, if the breach results in regulatory fines or changes in legislation, 23andMe could face increased operational costs. Investors will need to monitor the situation closely to understand the full financial impact as the legal process unfolds and the market responds. 02/21/2024 - 12:15 PM NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / 23andMe (NASDAQ:ME) was hacked in December 2023, affecting approximately 7 million users of its genetic services website. According to a recently filed class complaint, hackers who infiltrated 23andMe's system were after the personal information of Jewish and Chinese customers, but the company hid that detail when notifying affected customers.The hackers specifically targeted the personal genetic information of Jewish and Chinese customers and compiled that data - including genetic heritage, names, and addresses - into lists that were then sold on the dark web, but 23andMe concealed both those revelations when it announced the extent of the breach in December 2023.According to the lawsuit, the hacker leaked a list of over 1 million Jewish customers expressly in retribution for the Israel-Hamas war. The hacker was also more than happy to leak a list of 350,000 Chinese customers upon request from a user with the alias ""Wuhan.""These lists generated a huge amount of interest from hackers on the dark web from all over the world and were shared and reshared an untold number of times.The disclosure of these lists threatens the safety of those customers, including from the Chinese government, which has a long history of tracking Chinese citizens.According to the lawsuit,to this day, 23andMe has not informed the 7 million compromised customers that their personal genetic information was disclosed on the dark web, nor has it told its Jewish and Chinese customers that they were specifically targeted.IF YOU ARE A VULNERABLE person whose personal genetic information identifies you as having Ashkenazi Jewish heritage or Chinese ancestry, and/or live in California, Illinois, Oregon, or Alaska, please contact us to review your rights and eligibility for compensation:https://bit.ly/3sYm8CnADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:According to a recently filed class action complaint, on Oct. 1, 2023, a hacker using the alias ""Golem"" leaked the 23andMe data of 1 million Ashkenazi Jews on Breach Forums, calling it ""the most valuable data you'll ever see.""""Golem's explicit targeting of Jewish 23andMe users is further conveyed by his use of the character 'Gollum' from The Lord of the Rings - a creature driven by greed with ugly and outsized facial features - as his profile picture.""A few hours later, a user with the alias ""Wuhan"" asked Golem if he had ""Chinese accounts,"" according to the complaint. The next day, Golem leaked the data of 7 million users, saying in the post that the customer information included phenotype and health information, photos, and identification data.Golem listed prices for the customer profiles at $1,000 for 100 profiles, $5,000 for 1,000 profiles, $20,000 for 10,000 profiles and $100,000 for 100,000 profiles.Interest in the leaked Jewish and Chinese information was immediate and overwhelming following an Israeli bombing of a Palestinian hospital.23andMe attempted to shift the blame to customers, telling them the breach was a result of customers using recycled login credentials from their accounts on other websites.Further, 23andMe then waited until December to report that 7 million customers were directly affected by the breach and didn't say anything about the data being sold on the dark web or that Jewish and Chinese customers were specifically targeted.Levi Korsinsky, LLP is investigating whether affected customers are entitled to compensation.

Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Dividend announcements are pivotal for shareholders as they represent a direct return on investment, reflecting a company's financial health and its ability to generate cash flow. Kennedy Wilson's declaration of a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend suggests a stable payout policy, with the annual rate of $0.96 per share offering insight into the company's long-term financial strategy. It is crucial to assess the dividend yield, which is the dividend per share divided by the stock price. This metric provides investors with a comparative tool to evaluate the attractiveness of Kennedy Wilson's stock against other investment opportunities, taking into account the current interest rate environment and market volatility.Furthermore, the sustainability of dividends is often scrutinized through the payout ratio, the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends. A lower ratio may indicate a conservative approach, leaving room for reinvestment in growth opportunities or as a buffer against economic downturns. Conversely, a high payout ratio could signal limited growth prospects or a mature company in a steady industry. Investors should consider these factors alongside their investment goals and risk tolerance when evaluating the impact of dividend announcements. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Kennedy Wilson's dividend announcement can be seen as a signal to the market regarding the company's performance and expectations. Dividends are often interpreted as a sign of confidence by management in the company's profitability and financial stability. However, it's important to analyze this within the context of the real estate investment sector, which has unique dynamics such as sensitivity to interest rate changes, the cyclical nature of property markets and regulatory changes. The timing and consistency of dividend payments can also affect investor sentiment and stock price performance.Comparing the announced dividend to industry averages and historical payouts can provide additional context. If Kennedy Wilson's dividend is higher than its peers, it might suggest a competitive advantage or a more aggressive distribution policy. Conversely, if it's lower, it might indicate a more cautious approach or potential reinvestment in the company's growth. Investors with a focus on income generation might find the stock more attractive if the dividend is competitive within the sector. 02/21/2024 - 02:36 PM BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global real estate investment company Kennedy Wilson (NYSE: KW) today announced that the company will pay a dividend of $0.24 per share to common shareholders of record as of March 28, 2024, with a payment date of April 4, 2024.

(UBCP) declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.1725, a 6.2% increase over the previous year. They also approved a special dividend of $0.15 per share. The company is projected to pay cash dividends of $0.84 in the current year, with a forward yield of 5.4%. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The increase in the cash dividend declared by United Bancorp, Inc. reflects a positive signal to the market about the company's financial health and confidence in sustained earnings. A 6.2% increase in the dividend payout, along with a special dividend, suggests that the company has generated sufficient cash flow and maintains a robust capital structure. Investors often view such announcements as a reaffirmation of a company's commitment to returning value to shareholders, which can be a driver for stock performance.From a valuation perspective, the forward yield of 5.4% is a critical figure. It stands out in the current interest rate environment, which has been characterized by relatively low yields. This yield might attract income-focused investors, particularly if it surpasses the average yield offered by competitors or the broader market. However, it's essential to consider the sustainability of such dividends, particularly in the context of the company's earnings and payout ratio. Market Research Analyst United Bancorp's strategic decision to issue a one-time special dividend in addition to the regular dividend could be interpreted as a strategic move to optimize shareholder returns. This action might be aimed at signaling underlying strength and confidence in future performance, potentially influencing investor sentiment. The company's position within the Ohio and West Virginia markets suggests a stable regional banking operation, which may have benefited from local economic conditions. Analyzing the regional economic trends could provide further insights into the company's performance and its ability to maintain such dividend policies.Furthermore, the banking sector is heavily influenced by regulatory changes, economic cycles and interest rate fluctuations. The company's ability to navigate these factors while still increasing shareholder returns could set it apart from its peers and might be indicative of adept management and operational efficiency. Economist The announcement from United Bancorp, Inc. comes at a time when the broader economic landscape is contending with issues such as inflationary pressures and potential shifts in monetary policy. The banking sector is sensitive to these changes, as they can affect net interest margins and loan demand. A higher dividend yield might be particularly attractive if the market expects a downturn or a more conservative monetary policy, which could lead to lower returns from other asset classes.In the long-term, the company's ability to continue offering attractive dividends will depend on its operational resilience and the economic health of the regions it serves. A detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and forecasts would be necessary to assess the long-term sustainability of its dividend policy amid economic uncertainties. 02/21/2024 - 11:00 AM MARTINS FERRY, OH / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2023 / On February 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of United Bancorp, Inc.

The offering was made via a prospectus filed with the SEC and facilitated by WallachBeth Capital, LLC. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The exercise of an over-allotment option, often referred to as a 'green shoe' option, is a post-IPO mechanism allowing underwriters to buy additional shares from the company at the initial offering price. This typically occurs when there is strong investor demand and can provide additional capital to the company. In the case of BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc., the decision by underwriters to purchase an additional 218,382 shares indicates a positive reception from the market, which can be seen as a vote of confidence in the company's prospects.From a financial perspective, this move is likely to increase the liquidity of BullFrog AI's shares in the market. For existing and potential shareholders, it could mean more stability in the stock price post-IPO due to the increased number of shares available for trading. However, it is also important to monitor for potential dilutive effects on earnings per share, as the increase in outstanding shares could spread the company's earnings more thinly among shareholders. Market Research Analyst BullFrog AI operates in the burgeoning field of AI-driven drug development, which is becoming increasingly competitive as companies seek to leverage technology to streamline the drug discovery process. The fact that the underwriters have exercised their over-allotment option could be interpreted as a signal that the market sees BullFrog AI's technology and approach as promising within this sector.An analysis of the company's market positioning should consider the competitive landscape, including the number of patents held, the pipeline of potential drugs and strategic partnerships. These factors can greatly influence the company's ability to capitalize on its technology and secure a significant market share. Additionally, the successful capital raise through the exercised option could enable BullFrog AI to accelerate its research and development efforts or expand its operations, potentially leading to new breakthroughs or collaborations that could further enhance its market position. Biotechnology Legal Expert In the context of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, compliance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations is paramount. BullFrog AI's adherence to the necessary legal procedures, including the filing of a registration statement on Form S-1 that became effective, ensures that the offering meets the regulatory requirements. This legal compliance mitigates the risk of future litigation or sanctions that could arise from non-compliance and can be a reassuring factor for investors.It is also noteworthy that the offering is limited by jurisdiction, avoiding any potential legal issues that could arise from offering securities in states or countries where it would be unlawful without proper registration or qualification. This careful approach to compliance can be indicative of the company's overall risk management strategies, which is an important consideration for investors who are often concerned with both financial and legal risks associated with their investments. 02/21/2024 - 12:01 PM GAITHERSBURG, Md., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BullFrog AI Holdings, Inc.

(MSI) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 98 cents per share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024.","Motorola Solutions Declares Quarterly Dividend Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags dividends Rhea-AI Summary Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI) declares a regular quarterly dividend of 98 cents per share, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement by Motorola Solutions, Inc. regarding the approval of a regular quarterly dividend of 98 cents per share represents a significant event for investors and the market as dividends are a direct reflection of a company's financial health and its commitment to returning value to shareholders. From a financial perspective, the stability or growth of dividend payments can be indicative of a company's consistent cash flow and profitability. Investors often view such announcements as a positive signal, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a positive impact on the stock price.It is important to assess how this dividend aligns with the company's historical payout patterns and industry standards. If the 98 cents per share represents an increase from previous dividends, it could suggest that Motorola Solutions is experiencing growth in earnings or cash reserves. Conversely, if it is a decrease or stagnation, questions may arise regarding the company's future growth prospects or financial management. Additionally, the dividend yield, calculated by annualizing the quarterly dividend and dividing by the stock price, is a critical metric for investors, as it provides a measure of the income generated from an investment in the company's stock relative to its price. Market Research Analyst Dividend announcements can also have broader implications within the industry and competitive landscape. Motorola Solutions' declaration of a quarterly dividend payment may influence the dividend policies of peer companies, as they strive to remain attractive to dividend-seeking investors. It is essential to analyze this dividend in the context of the sector's average dividend yield and payout ratio to determine its competitiveness. A higher than average dividend yield or payout ratio could attract income investors and could be used as a strategic move to capture a larger market share of investor capital within its sector.Furthermore, the timing of the dividend, payable on April 15, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024, is typical for quarterly dividends and aligns with the fiscal calendars of most investors. This regularity ensures predictability for income-focused portfolios and can be a factor in investment decisions for both institutional and retail investors looking for steady income streams. 02/21/2024 - 02:30 PM CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: MSI) today announced that its board of directors has approved a regular quarterly dividend of 98 cents per share.

The offer includes a 'no-cost' period until existing contracts expire and professional services for agent migration. Cortex XDR is a leading endpoint protection platform recognized for its effectiveness in identifying threats.,"Palo Alto Networks Enables Customers to Break Free from Legacy Solutions with Cortex Platform Offer for Endpoint Security Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Palo Alto Networks (PANW) introduces a new Cortex platform offer for endpoint security to help customers transition from legacy solutions to Cortex XDR. The offer includes a 'no-cost' period until existing contracts expire and professional services for agent migration. Cortex XDR is a leading endpoint protection platform recognized for its effectiveness in identifying threats. Positive None. Negative None. Cybersecurity Analyst The introduction of Palo Alto Networks' cost-alleviating offer for transitioning to Cortex XDR represents a strategic move in the cybersecurity industry to increase adoption rates of advanced endpoint protection platforms. This initiative is likely to resonate with organizations seeking to enhance their cybersecurity posture in response to the escalating sophistication of cyber threats. Cortex XDR's capabilities in identifying evasive threats through behavioral analytics and accelerating investigations by providing comprehensive attack narratives are critical in this context. This offer not only positions Palo Alto Networks favorably within the competitive landscape but could also potentially increase the company's market share and customer loyalty.From a cybersecurity perspective, the transition from legacy systems to more integrated and advanced solutions like Cortex XDR may significantly improve an organization's ability to respond to incidents. The 'no-cost' period and professional services included in the offer may reduce the financial and operational barriers typically associated with such transitions, possibly leading to a faster adoption curve. However, it is essential for organizations to consider the long-term implications of adopting a single vendor's platform, including potential lock-in and the need for continuous updates to combat evolving threats. Financial Analyst The announcement made by Palo Alto Networks concerning the new offer for its Cortex XDR platform has potential implications for the company's financial performance. By providing a 'no-cost' period to qualified customers, the company is likely to incur short-term costs associated with the provision of professional services and support for the platform transition. However, this customer-centric strategy could lead to long-term financial benefits through the development of a stronger customer base and the generation of recurring revenue streams once the legacy contracts expire and organizations fully adopt the Cortex XDR solution.The company's recognition in the latest Gartner MQ for Endpoint Protection Platforms may further instill confidence in potential customers and investors, potentially impacting the stock price positively. It is crucial, however, to monitor the uptake of the offer and the subsequent financial impact on Palo Alto Networks, including the effects on revenue growth, customer acquisition costs and profit margins. The success of this strategy will depend on the balance between short-term expenses and long-term financial gains. Market Research Analyst The strategic promotion of Cortex XDR by Palo Alto Networks taps into the growing demand for integrated endpoint security solutions. Market trends indicate a shift away from siloed security products towards comprehensive platforms that offer a unified approach to threat detection and response. By providing incentives to switch from legacy systems, Palo Alto Networks is not only addressing the market's demand but also potentially disrupting the competitive dynamics within the cybersecurity sector.Understanding customer behavior and market response to such offers is crucial. If successful, this program could serve as a blueprint for similar initiatives by other cybersecurity firms, thereby altering the market's expectations for vendor support during product transitions. This could lead to increased pressure on competitors to offer similar incentives, affecting overall market pricing strategies and customer retention efforts. The effectiveness of the offer in driving platform adoption will be a key metric to assess, as it will provide insights into the potential for market share expansion and the establishment of Palo Alto Networks as a dominant player in the endpoint security market. 02/21/2024 - 11:00 AM New offer alleviates the cost of switching from legacy endpoint security solutions to Cortex XDR SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW) today announced a new Cortex platform offer for endpoint security to help customers accelerate platformization and improve their endpoint protection. Organizations struggle to prevent, detect, and respond to the continuous advancement of cyberthreats. To simplify their architectures, increase efficiencies and create better security outcomes, organizations are adopting platformization. The offer enables qualified customers to accelerate platformization and seamlessly transition to Cortex XDR by providing a ""no-cost"" period of the solution until existing legacy contracts expire. Additionally, the program includes a baseline package of ""no-cost"" professional services to assist with the agent migration.

Today, we are building on that commitment by offering qualified customers a higher standard of endpoint protection through our new offer.

The deal includes engine maintenance services through an EngineWise® agreement, showcasing Vietjet's confidence in Pratt & Whitney's expertise and technology. Positive None. Negative None. Aerospace Industry Analyst The announcement of Vietjet's exercise of options for an additional 19 GTF-powered A321neo aircraft represents a significant order for Pratt & Whitney, potentially affecting RTX's stock performance. The GTF, or Geared Turbofan, engines are a line of high-efficiency jet engines that have been gaining market share due to their reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions compared to traditional engines. This deal not only indicates Pratt & Whitney's competitive position in the market but also reflects the ongoing trend in the aviation industry towards more environmentally friendly and cost-efficient technologies.For stakeholders, the implications are multifaceted. On the one hand, this order could increase Pratt & Whitney's revenue backlog, providing a more stable financial outlook. On the other hand, fulfilling this order will require successful scaling of production and maintenance capabilities, which could pose challenges. The long-term benefits for Vietjet include potential operational cost savings and an enhanced eco-friendly brand image, which could attract environmentally conscious customers. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the exercise of options for additional aircraft is a bullish signal for Pratt & Whitney's parent company, RTX. It suggests confidence in the GTF engine's market performance and reliability. The EngineWise® Comprehensive service agreement accompanying the engine order is a strategic move to secure long-term service revenue, which typically offers higher margins than the initial sale of engines. This could improve RTX's future earnings visibility and margins, making it an attractive point for investors.However, investors should also consider the capital expenditure associated with expanding service capabilities and potential risks in the supply chain that could affect delivery timelines and cost structures. The impact on the stock market will depend on how well Pratt & Whitney manages these operational aspects and whether they can meet or exceed market expectations for profitability and efficiency. Market Research Analyst Examining the broader market implications, the selection of GTF engines by Vietjet may influence other airlines' procurement decisions, potentially leading to increased market share for Pratt & Whitney. The aviation industry is highly competitive and airlines are continuously seeking ways to reduce operational costs. The GTF engine's promise of lower fuel consumption and maintenance costs positions Pratt & Whitney favorably against competitors.It is also worth noting the strategic importance of the signing ceremony's location at the Singapore Airshow, a major event in the aviation industry that garners significant attention. Such public commitments can enhance brand reputation and serve as a marketing tool to attract new customers. The ripple effects of this deal could be seen in subsequent orders from other airlines, influenced by Vietjet's decision and the visibility gained at the airshow. 02/21/2024 - 10:28 AM GTF engines selected for follow-on A321neo order SINGAPORE, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- (SINGAPORE AIRSHOW) - Pratt & Whitney, an RTX (NYSE: RTX) business, and new-age airline Vietjet announced today that the airline has exercised options for an additional 19 firm GTF-powered A321neo aircraft.

Cactus PFS Highlights Scalable, Long-Life Operations Average annual production of approximately 55 ktons or 110 million pounds (“lbs”) of copper (“Cu”), with a peak of 74 ktons or 149 million pounds of copper Initial Life of Mine (“LOM”) 21 years, recovering 1,153 ktons or 2.31 billion pounds of Copper LME Grade A cathode onsite via heap leach facility and SXEW Maiden Proven & Probable (“P&P”) Reserves of 276.3 million tons at 0.48% Soluble Copper (“Cu TSol”) or 3.0 Billion lbs Copper Favourable metallurgy with a range of 85%-92% LOM average soluble copper recoveries Private land ownership with streamlined permitting process Low carbon footprint mining project: Powered by an existing 69 KV Transmission line with access to “Green Energy” through the Palo Verde Nuclear Plant West of Phoenix for costs of $0.07/kWh Heap Leach and SXEW Process Conveyors and radial stackers used to move ore to leach pads Robust Economics First quartile capital intensity of $10,343/tonne of average annual production Total initial capital cost of $515 million, including $75 million of contingencies over an 18-24 month construction period Total revenues of $9.0 billion over 21 years Post-tax unlevered Free Cash Flow of $2.4 billion C1 Cash Costs of $1.84/lb and All in Sustaining Cost (“AISC”) of $2.34/lb Post-tax net present value (“NPV”) $509 million (CA$687 million) using an 8% discount rate and an internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 15.3% and using a $3.90/lb flat long-term copper price Pre-tax NPV $733 million (CA$990 million) Post-tax payback period of 6.8 years from initial production At $4.25/lb Copper the NPV increases to $780 million post-tax (CA$1,054 million) and $1,064 million pre-tax (CA$1,436 million), using an 8% discount rate Significant Copper Project in the USA Proven & Probable (“P&P”) Reserves of 276.3 million tons at 0.48% Soluble Copper (“Cu TSol”) or 3.0 Billion lbs Copper Underground Proven Reserve grade of 0.89% and 0.82% Cu TSol from Cactus East and Parks/Salyer, respectively Measured & Indicated Resources of 5.2 billion lbs Copper and Inferred Resources of 2.2 billion lbs Copper (as announced October 16, 2023) (inclusive of reserves) Future Opportunities to Further Improve Business Case Drilling to upgrade known inferred resources and bring them into the mine plan potentially increasing the LOM production, reducing underground development costs, operating expenses, capital expenses and overall strip ratio Drilling to prove a maiden resource at MainSpring as a potential open pit providing operational flexibility and gaining lower cost access to the Parks/Salyer deposit. Bringing MainSpring into the mine plan potentially improves operational and financial synergies within the Cactus Project Continued exploration success on the Cactus Project in the “Gap Zone”, below the envelope of the existing Cactus West Open Pit Shell and in the North-East Extension. Nuton LLC’s (“Nuton"") leaching technology driving primary sulphide optionality, currently excluded from the mine plan George Ogilvie, ASCU President and CEO commented, “The 55,000-ton Copper Cathode per annum mine plan presented in the PFS illustrates an achievable long-life operation with robust economics and an opportunity for continued scaling of the asset. Our operation has the potential to be among the top 10 copper operations within the US, supplying the domestic supply chain with copper cathodes in the near term. With global copper mine disruptions occurring and a structural deficit currently underway, our timing to develop the asset has a high likelihood to coincide with much higher copper incentive prices. As compared to the original PEA, the PFS demonstrates a significant increase of free cash flow at a conservative long-term copper price assumption of $3.90 per pound.” He continued, “A real organic growth opportunity exists within our 5,370 acres at the MainSpring Property. Based on initial drilling of our MainSpring property there are early indications for Mainspring to be the southern near surface extension of our Parks/Salyer deposit and thus will be a focus of drilling in 2024. Through our 2024 drilling programs, our team has the potential to convert the 1.3 billion pounds of leachable inferred resources of copper to the indicated resources category, contributing to an extended mine life. Over and above, ASCU also looks forward to the continued metallurgical testing and incorporation of the Nuton technology to our Cactus flowsheet, which if executed, lowers our cost of capital, provides a funding partner for the initial capex and ongoing operating costs, as well as provides execution support from a top global mining partner.” “With this cornerstone now placed, we are excited to continue building Cactus, which today is a significant asset, with plenty of future optionality to continue upgrading the asset with scale.” Bernie Loyer, ASCU SVP Projects notes “Our Cactus Project PFS demonstrates a solid business case, and the potential to deliver a long-life operation utilizing a well-established and industry proven process technology in the treatment of ore from four separate and well understood feed sources. All situated on privately held ground, this brownfield project site located within 45 minutes of the Phoenix city center which is the 10th largest metropolitan area within the United States, is wrapped with an enviable complement of all required infrastructure. Add to all of that, a project team with a strong combination of project and operational experience on complex mining projects throughout North and South America, and the foundation for the Cactus Project and future operation is well-placed.” Pre-Feasibility Summary The 2024 PFS outlines a lower risk and long-life copper project with low first quartile capital intensity. The heap leach operation will produce on average 55 kstpa of LME Grade A copper cathodes via SXEW. Key metrics are shown in TABLE 1 below. Conventional open pit mining methods have been selected for the extraction of oxide and secondary sulphide material from the lower grade Cactus West pit, while the higher-grade Parks/Salyer and Cactus East deposits will be mined via underground using the Sublevel Caving (“SLC”) method from the 1,500 ft (457 m) and 1,200 ft (366 m) levels, respectively. Reserve grades of the Parks/Salyer and Cactus East deposits are high grade, at 0.93% CuT and 0.95% CuT, and 0.82% Cu TSol and 0.89% Cu TSol, respectively. The Stockpile will be a rehandling exercise moving low grade tonnage to a lined pad for leaching. Onsite facilities at the mine site will consist of an open pit, underground mining operations, a fine crushing plant incorporating all crushing, classification, agglomeration and conveying systems and an SXEW process plant. On site supporting infrastructure will include site power distribution, access roads and heap leach facilities.

The Cactus Mine Project is accessible on North Bianco Road off of West Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway with direct access to interstate highway 10. During historic ASARCO operations (1974-1984), a rail spur was connected directly with the United Pacific Railroad to ship concentrates to its El Paso refinery in Texas; while the spur has been removed, the onsite rail line is still in existence. Current onsite infrastructure includes power lines and substation, water wells and a water pond, geological buildings, core sheds and administrative offices, keeping the capital intensity low and demonstrating robust economics. Since 2019, ASCU has drilled 141 new holes at the Cactus West and East deposits to support verification, metallurgical testing, and resource extension for the Cactus mineral resource estimate. The Parks/Salyer resource database is composed primarily of 74 new holes drilled by ASCU between late 2020 and 2023. The historical ASARCO holes for the district comprised of 171 drillholes. The bulk of these holes were in the Cactus West and Cactus East deposits or comprised regional exploration holes. An extensive verification and re-assay programs were undertaken to support the use of historical drilling in resource estimates. Since 2020, ASCU has drilled 514 sonic drillholes to support resource estimates on the stockpile. In addition to verification of historical drilling, for all ASCU holes physical checks on collar, downhole survey, logging, and assay quality assurance and quality control (“QA/QC”) have been completed by the qualified person. The Cactus Mine Project is host to a large porphyry copper system that has been dismembered and displaced by Tertiary extensional faulting. The major host rocks are Precambrian Oracle Granite and Laramide monzonite porphyry and quartz monzonite porphyry. The mine trend features the formation of horst and graben blocks of mineralization where the Cactus deposits are situated, extending from the Cactus East deposit, southwest to the Parks/Salyer deposit. Drilling to the northeast and southwest along the trend indicates that mineralization continues in both directions and at depth at the Cactus West deposit. Reserves and Resources The PFS is based on the updated 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”), as published on October 16, 2023, showing a 221% increase of leachable Measured and Indicated (“M&I”) pounds over the mineral resource base used in the 2021 PEA. The Mineral Resources and Reserves for the Cactus Mine Project are shown in TABLES 3 and 4 and illustrated in FIGURE 3 below.

Tons are reported as short tons. 2. Stockpile resource estimates have an effective date of 1 March 2022, Cactus resource estimates have an effective date of 29th April 2022, Parks/Salyer resource estimates have an effective date of 19th May 2023. All resources use a copper price of US$3.75/lb. 3. Technical and economic parameters defining resource pit shell: mining cost US$2.43/t; G&A US$0.55/t, 10% dilution, and 44°-46° pit slope angle. 4. Technical and economic parameters defining underground resource: mining cost US$27.62/t, G&A US$0.55/t, and 5% dilution. 5.

HL selling cost of US$0.27/lb; Mill selling cost of US$0.62/lb. 6. Royalties of 3.18% and 2.5% apply to the ASCU properties and state land respectively. No royalties apply to the MainSpring (Parks/Salyer South) property. 7. For Cactus: Variable cutoff grades were reported depending on material type, potential mining method, and potential processing method. Oxide material within resource pit shell = 0.099% TSol; enriched material within resource pit shell = 0.092% TSol; primary material within resource pit shell = 0.226% CuT; oxide underground material outside resource pit shell = 0.549% TSol; enriched underground material outside resource pit shell = 0.522% TSol; primary underground material outside resource pit shell = 0.691% CuT. 8. For Parks/Salyer: Variable cut-off grades were reported depending on material type, associated potential processing method, and applicable royalties. For ASCU properties - Oxide underground material = 0.549% TSol; enriched underground material = 0.522% TSol; primary underground material = 0.691% CuT. For state land property - Oxide underground material = 0.545% TSol; enriched underground material = 0.518% TSol; primary underground material = 0.686% CuT. For MainSpring (Parks/Salyer South) properties - Oxide underground material = 0.532% TSol; enriched underground material = 0.505% TSol; primary underground material = 0.669% CuT. 9. Mineral resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, sociopolitical, marketing, or other relevant factors. 10. The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there is insufficient exploration to define these inferred mineral resources as an indicated or measured mineral resource; it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured classification. 11. Totals may not add up due to rounding. As shown in TABLE 4 below, a total of 276 million short tons or 3.0 billion pounds were converted into a P&P Reserve out of the leachable M&I Resource base of 4.43 billion lbs, representing a conversion rate of 68%. The Inferred material and primary sulphides are treated as waste, with conversion drilling at Cactus West, a focus for 2024 as part of the dual track ASCU/Nuton Work Plan as announced on January 30, 2024. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Mineral Reserves have an effective date of November 10, 2023. The Qualified Person for the underground estimates of Cactus East and Parks/Salyer is Nat Burgio of AGP Mining Consultants Inc. The Qualified Person for the open pit estimates of Cactus West and Stockpile is Gordon Zurowski of AGP Mining Consultants Inc. 2. The Mineral Reserves were estimated in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves. 3. The Mineral Reserves are supported by a combined open pit and underground mine plan, based on open pit and underground designs and schedules, guided by relevant optimization procedures. Inputs to that process are: Metal prices of Cu $3.70/lb. Processing costs which are variable and based upon material type, processing destination, copper grade, and copper recovery. Processing costs include a fixed unit cost component, a net consumption cost, and a cost for refining and selling copper cathode. General and administration cost of $0.47/ton processed. Royalty cost of 2.5% for BCE land and 2.54% for Parks/Salyer, Cactus and Stockpile Ores, excluding BCE ore – royalty discussion noted below. Process recoveries which are variable depending upon mineralization type, sequential copper grades, and comminution size. Open pit geotechnical design criteria from Call and Nicholas, Underground geotechnical design criteria from Call and Nicholas, Open pit mining costs including an escalation factor with pit depth. Underground mining cost of $27.62. 4. The footprint delineations for the Cactus East and Parks/Salyer mines were based on a resource model block cash flow dollar value (CFTC1) of $27.62 (net of process, G/A and royalties). Drawpoints were shut-off when the grade value fell below a CFTC1 of $27.62 following the necessary removal of swell material within the footprint. 5. Dilution and mining loss adjustments are incorporated into the underground mining inventories by way of cave flow modelling software. Inferred resources included in the mixing process have been assigned zero grade. No allowance for mining dilution or ore loss has been provided in the open pit mining inventories. Mining Operations The Cactus Mine plan includes production from four separate mining areas: Cactus West Open Pit, Historical Stockpile, Cactus East Underground, and Parks/Salyer Underground. Ore processing in the mine schedules involves oxides and secondary sulphides being processed on a heap leach after multi-stage crushing. The mine production schedule is initially focused on the surface sources of ore (Stockpile and Cactus West Open Pit) beginning in year -1, along with Parks/Salyer underground starting development in Year 1. The Cactus East deposit is developed later in the mine life, starting in Year 8. Cactus West and the Stockpile ore sources are depleted in Year 7 after which the ore stream becomes exclusively underground. The overall site layout is shown in FIGURE 8. The Cactus West mine life consists of 2 phases and includes one year of pre-stripping and seven years of mining. Phase 1 starts with 24 million tons (“Mt”) of pre-production stripping and is completed in Year 4. Phase 2 mining begins in Year 2 and is mined out in Year 6. Target ore production is 12 Mt per annum with a peak mining rate of 47 Mt in Years 2 and 3. A total of 75.5 Mt of leach ore grading 0.307% total copper is mined at a strip ratio of 1.9 to 1. Bench elevations at Cactus West range from the 1,440-ft level to the 380-ft level. Over the course of the open pit mine schedule, approximately 13.1 Mt of low-grade ore is stockpiled and reclaimed in order to smooth the ore release from the open pits. This amount includes approximately 3.0 Mt of material stockpiled in the first three years of mining, and then processed in Year 3 and 4, and another 10 Mt stockpiled later in the mine schedule before being reclaimed in Years 7 and 8. Historic Stockpile (FIGURE 5) mining begins near the end of the pre-production year with approximately 3.0 Mt of ore sent to the leach pad. Mining continues concurrently with the Cactus West pit into Year 7 at an annual ore production rate of 12 Mt. A total of 76.8 Mt of leach ore at 0.163% total copper is mined. A small amount, 5.5 Mt of waste is mined from the historic stockpile and sent to the waste storage areas. The initial Parks/Salyer SLC (FIGURE 6) level will commence at 1,120 ft (341 m) below surface and include 11 sublevels to a final depth of 1,930 ft (588 m) below surface. Access to the Parks/Salyer deposit will be via a surface portal and twin declines. One decline will be dedicated to ore haulage using an inclined conveyor and the other decline providing access for personnel and equipment. Production extends from year 1 to 20, with steady state production beginning in year 7 to year 20, peaking at 6.9 Mtpa in year 13. A total of 96 Mt of leach ore @ 0.82% Cu TSol will be processed. The initial Cactus East SLC (FIGURE 7) level will commence in year 9 at 1,325 ft (404 m) below the surface and will be comprised of 7 sublevels to a final depth 1,845 ft (562 m) below surface. Access will be via a single decline with a portal located within the existing Cactus West pit. Ore haulage to surface will be via a vertical conveyor which can be supplemented with truck haulage to surface via the open pit if necessary. Production is planned from year 9 to 19, with steady state production beginning in year 12, peaking at 3.9 Mtpa in year 15. A total of 28 Mt of leach ore @ 0.89% Cu TSol will be processed. SLC production crosscuts have primarily been designed so that each level is horizontally offset from the level above and below. The design parameters for the SLC production drives at Cactus East and Parks/Salyer are in line with other SLC operations. The amount of ore to be extracted will be limited in the upper three production levels to the following proportions: First Level ~40% (swell only) Second Level ~60% Third level ~100% Lower levels >100% to shutoff grades or dollar values. The production strategy will help control caveability, minimise the formation of air gaps and create a blasted ore blanket above the production levels to minimise early dilution entry from the overburden rocks. These restricted draw rates also apply to areas where large step-outs distances are required from one sublevel to the next. The Cactus East Ore/Waste Handling System consists of a crusher station and a 1,600 ft (488 m) vertical conveyor with a capacity of 630 tons/h that will convey ore from the top of the orebody to surface via a vertical raise feeding an overland conveyor. Ore will be hauled by 55-ton diesel trucks to a sizer located adjacent to the bottom of the vertical conveyor. Ore will be crushed to a maximum 6-in dimension. A short conveyor from the sizer will feed the vertical conveyor. Waste will be trucked to the portal for disposal within the Cactus West open pit. The mine plan for Parks/Salyer consists of two ramps with one dedicated for material handling. The ore/waste handling system consists of a series of initially four, extending to five switchback conveyors and two crushing sizers on -270 L, one of which will subsequently be relocated at the -470 L. that will deliver material from the mine working levels to the surface portal, from where materials will then be transported on surface via an overland conveyor. Ventilation is driven by a fresh air drive developed from the access drive, in which the fresh air will be splitting right and left to connect to the return air drives at the extremities of the footprint. This allows natural flow of ventilation through the entire footprint. Processing Operations Material mined from the existing stockpile will be placed in 20-ft lifts and material from all other sources will be stacked in 30-ft lifts. Material will be reclaimed and transferred by haul truck to the crushing circuit where it will be crushed down to P80 minus ¾-in. From the crushing circuit, the material will transfer by overland conveyor to the agglomeration drums, mobile transfer conveyors, and mobile radial stacker to be placed on the geomembrane lined heap leach facility (HLF). Leaching solutions, containing dilute sulfuric acid will be pumped and applied to the top of each lift and allowed to percolate though the copper leach material. Copper is dissolved into the solution while acid is consumed at approximately 13.6 lb/ton of material leached. Acid consumption is net of regenerated acid in the SXEW process. The height of the leach material on the pad will eventually reach approximately 180 ft (55 m) in overall height. The pregnant leach solution (PLS) collected from the HLF will be conveyed in pipes to the heap leach ponds where it will be pumped for processing in a copper SX/EW plant capable of producing initially up to 30,000 ton/y of copper cathodes with a design PLS flow of up to 12,000 gpm and grade at approximately 3.0 g/pL Cu based on an overall 71% total copper (85-92% soluble copper) recovery from the heap leaching method for the resources considered. The solvent extraction plant is designed to be operated in a series, parallel, or series-parallel configurations with a single stage of stripping. The optionality of the solvent extraction plant will allow the plant to operate at 4,000 gpm, 8,000 gpm, or 12,000 gpm PLS flowrates based on the variability in copper grades and tonnages in the mine plan. The electrowinning circuit capacity will be expanded in Year 3, doubling in size to the overall plant capacity required to a nominal 60,000 ton/y of copper cathodes. The principal objective of the HLF design is to efficiently extract copper by leaching metals within the geotechnically stable facility. The anticipated ore production will be approximately 65,000 tons/d for the first seven years and reduced to 24,500 tons/d after that for the life-of-mine (LOM) for an average of 55,000 tons of cathode production annually. The pad will be loaded with conveyor belts coming in from the west along the northern side of the pad to discharge to the eastern area of the pad (Phase 1). This area provides a relatively flat area that facilitates the construction of the first phase of the pad and allows for mining of the existing stockpile to liberate additional space for the consecutive phases of construction. A visual representation of the flow sheet is depicted below, in FIGURE 9. Cost Estimates The capital cost estimates for the PFS were developed with a -15% to +20% accuracy and an estimated contingency of approximately 15% according to the Association of the Advancement of Cost Engineering International Class 4 estimate requirements. The estimates include the cost to complete the design, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of all process plant facilities. The project capital cost estimate was compiled by Ausenco Engineering USA South Inc. (“Ausenco”) with input from AGP and Samuel Engineering for the open pit, underground mining operation, SXEW process plant, conveying, crushing and screening equipment, site sub-station, site power distribution, access roads, heap leach facilities and associated infrastructure. all direct costs, growth allowances, project indirect costs, and associated contingency within their scope of work, but separately identified.

Well established road network existing from either ADOT, Pinal County or the City of Casa Grande surrounding the property. Union Pacific rail road line and rail spur adjacent to the property. Five miles distance to Casa Grande and allowing the ability of the town to supply materials/consumables in addition to just labor. Kinder Morgan/El Paso Natural Gas two high pressure natural gas pipelines adjacent to the property should natural gas be needed. The City of Casa Grande Water Treatment Facility located within 3 miles of the Cactus Mine Project that can supply effluent water for the operation and possibly treat waste. An existing Arizona Water Company potable water line is adjacent to the property. Water supply is already available via buried pipeline to the property boundary as a result of prior mining and commercial operations. The cities of Casa Grande and Maricopa are nearby and, combined with Phoenix, can supply sufficient skilled labor for the Cactus Mine Project. In addition, the State of Arizona has a significant presence of copper mining in the state that can specifically provide skilled labor to the Cactus Mine Project. Metallurgical Testwork The metallurgical studies and testing for the Cactus Project has been ongoing since late 2019, via 45 column tests covering the resources identified in the study. Additional tests include, bottle roll testing, mineralogical analyses and other metallurgical and materials property testing. Arizona Sonoran geologists are working with metallurgical engineers to quantify the metallurgical performance from the samples obtained in a large drilling campaign. The drill core samples were safely recovered and placed in bags to be studied by geologists and subsequently shipped for testing to a well-established Mineral Processing research and development firm in Reno, Nevada (McClelland Analytical Service Laboratory (“McClelland”), an ISO 9000, ISO 17025 accredited facility). Additional testing work was completed on-site by ASCU staff and at HydroGeoSense Inc. (“HGS”) laboratories in Tucson, Arizona. The metallurgical test program completed at McClelland has been developed by and supervised by Mr. James L. Sorensen. Mr. Sorensen has also reviewed and inspected the ongoing metallurgical testing at site and information developed by HGS. Ownership, Social License, Permitting, Taxes and Royalties The Cactus Mine Project is 100% controlled by ASCU through its wholly owned subsidiary Cactus 110 LLC and encompasses an area of approximately 5,381 acres, as shown in FIGURE 10. The Cactus Mine Project includes exploration and mining on private land and on two Arizona State Land Department (""ASLD”) leases. There is no federal nexus for permitting the project. Of the 5,381 acres, 4,731.92 acres is fee simple land, three ASLD prospecting permits that the State has surface and minerals (649.12 acres), two ASLD prospecting permits that the State has minerals only with ASCU owning the surface (797.5 acres) and 18 BLM unpatented mining claims, this is for mineral only as ASCU owns the surface rights (320 acres). The BLM unpatented mining claims are outside of the known mineralization and there are currently no plans for mining at this area. ASCU has a well-developed community engagement plan that it has implemented through numerous public meetings and outreach. With the presence of legacy mining in the Casa Grande area and the determination of Cactus as a “brownfield” and disturbed site, the local community is supportive of the Cactus Mine Project. There is no significant opposition to the Cactus and Parks/Salyer Project. Permitting is limited to State of Arizona-required permits including the Aquifer Protection Permit, Industrial Air permits and the Mined Land Reclamation Permit which ASCU has received from state regulators. Modifications of each will be required to address changes in the mine plan presented in this PFS. A Mined Land Reclamation Plan was completed and submitted to the Arizona State Mine Inspector’s office in January 2023. The submitted plan does not include the Parks/Salyer mine plan and will therefore need to be modified to reflect the addition of new facilities described in this PFS. In 2009, approximately 25 years after the Cactus Mine ceased operation, the mine was conveyed to the ASARCO Multi-State Environmental Custodial Trust as part of ASARCO bankruptcy proceedings, who helped lead a subsequent remediation program. Structures were demolished and reclaimed, and site characterization studies were conducted. Based on the results of the characterization studies and reclamation work, the ADEQ released ASCU from potential legacy liabilities, under the terms of the Prospective Purchaser Agreement (“PPA”) signed in 2019. The PPA does not cover unidentified environmental conditions or contamination. A corporate tax rate of 25.9% combined federal and state taxes has been applied to taxable income in the PFS with an effective tax rate of 22.3% after applicable deductions and credits. A royalty of 2.5% was applied to all sales from the Cactus deposits and the Parks/Salyer deposit. A royalty of 2.5% was applied to all sales from the Bronco Creek Exploration (“BCE”) land (west of the Parks/Salyer deposit). As cathodes will be produced onsite, no transport or refining fees have been added. The Cactus Mine Project is subject to three royalties based on potential mining production. Tembo/Elemental Altus holds a 3.18% net smelter return (“NSR”) royalty, with an option to buy back 0.64% possible for payment of $8.9 million. BCE holds a 1.50% NSR royalty based on a portion of the Parks/Salyer Deposit, with an option to buy back 1% for payment of $0.5 million. ASLD owns a sliding net return royalty (2.00% to 8.00% and estimated at 2%) that is payable to ASLD and the State Trust on a portion of production from the Parks/Salyer Deposit, overlapping with BCE land. ASCU still needs to formalize the royalty percentages with ASLD. Formalization will be done once ACSU submits a Mineral Development Report to ASLD to convert the existing MEP to a Mineral Lease. Exploration Upside The Cactus Mine Project mineral resource estimate includes three deposits along a 4 km mine trend. The mineralization is present within horst blocks developed as part of regional extensional faulting. High grade mineralization was emplaced within brecciated host granite at the margin of the intruding monzonite porphyry zone and locally forms a linear NE trend called the mine trend. Drilling has demonstrated potential for extending mineralization south of Parks/Salyer onto MainSpring as shown in FIGURE 11. At the Cactus West deposit, potential to extend resources exists towards the SW adjacent to the PFS pit and also on the NE edge. These are zones where higher-grade primary mineralization as part of the mine trend have been intercepted previously. The NE Extension zone represents a further horst block of mineralization to the NE of Cactus East that to date has been explored by wide spaced historical drilling. ASCU drilled one exploration hole into the target in 2023. The Gap Zone represents a deeper target between Parks/Salyer and Cactus West. There is potential to explore for a down dropped extension of Parks/Salyer within this zone with analogies to Cactus East. Next Steps Future opportunities to build value may include a potential MainSpring starter pit, and the successful application of the Nuton technology for leaching of primary sulphides. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) will define the impact of those two opportunities. A PEA inclusive of an inferred MainSpring mineral resource and the application of the Nuton technologies to the primary sulphides using the same PFS assumptions is underway with M3 Engineering as lead consultant. The study is expected in the summer of 2024 Continued metallurgical testing Infill drilling at MainSpring and around the Cactus West Pit An updated PFS to include the MainSpring opportunity is expected in 2H 2024 A DFS is expected to begin post MainSpring PFS, for release in 1H 2025 Nuton and ASCU have agreed to working towards the Integrated Nuton PFS release by the end of 2024, unless extended mutually by both parties.

The company welcomed Dr. Rahul Gupta to its Columbus facility for discussions and a tour regarding the production of overdose reversal medicine. Positive None. Negative None. Pharmaceutical Industry Analyst The collaboration between Hikma Pharmaceuticals and the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) underscores a significant public health initiative with the potential for considerable business implications. As a pharmaceutical industry analyst, it's pertinent to assess Hikma's strategic positioning within the opioid antagonist market, particularly in relation to naloxone. The increasing prevalence of opioid overdoses in the United States has led to a heightened demand for overdose reversal medications. Hikma's commitment to manufacturing KLOXXADO®—a high-dose naloxone nasal spray—positions the company to potentially capture a larger market share in the opioid overdose treatment sector.Moreover, the public-private partnership exemplified by this visit could enhance Hikma's corporate reputation and solidify its standing as a socially responsible entity. This can lead to increased brand loyalty among healthcare providers and patients, which may translate into higher sales volumes. However, it is essential to monitor the pricing strategies and insurance coverage for naloxone products, as these factors will greatly influence accessibility and, consequently, the company's financial performance. Health Policy Expert The engagement between Hikma Pharmaceuticals and the ONDCP is a proactive measure in addressing a critical public health crisis. From a health policy perspective, the focus on expanding access to naloxone is aligned with current government initiatives aimed at reducing the mortality associated with opioid overdoses. Access to naloxone has been identified as a key intervention in harm reduction strategies.For stakeholders, including healthcare systems and patients, the implications of this partnership are two-fold. On one hand, increased availability of naloxone can lead to a reduction in emergency healthcare costs and a decrease in preventable deaths. On the other hand, there may be concerns regarding the potential for moral hazard, where increased availability of naloxone could inadvertently encourage riskier opioid use among individuals. It is crucial to balance these considerations while formulating policies that support the distribution and use of naloxone. Market Research Analyst Analyzing the market trends, the opioid overdose epidemic presents a growing challenge that has triggered a surge in demand for effective treatment options. Hikma's focus on naloxone, especially through their product KLOXXADO®, is strategically relevant. The product's differentiation as a high-dose nasal spray could cater to a niche yet rapidly expanding segment within the emergency medication market.Long-term implications for stakeholders might include sustained growth in the naloxone segment, spurred by government endorsements and initiatives. The partnership with ONDCP could potentially lead to preferential treatment in government procurement processes for Hikma, providing a competitive edge over other pharmaceutical companies. However, it is crucial to monitor any regulatory changes that could affect market dynamics, such as the introduction of over-the-counter naloxone or changes in prescription guidelines. 02/21/2024 - 01:20 PM Continues Hikma and the Office of National Drug Control Policy effort to combat the opioid overdose epidemic in the US COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC (Hikma), the multinational pharmaceutical company, today welcomed Dr. Rahul Gupta, Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), to its Columbus, Ohio manufacturing facility for a visit and important dialogue on the US opioid overdose epidemic and Hikma's and ONDCP's shared goal of expanding the availability and awareness of life-saving naloxone. During the visit, Dr. Gupta met with Hikma employees and toured the Columbus facility, observing firsthand the production of Hikma's overdose reversal medicine KLOXXADO® (naloxone HCl) nasal spray 8mg. Following the tour, Dr. Gupta and Hikma's leadership held a roundtable with members of two Ohio-based harm reduction organizations to discuss the ongoing opioid epidemic and how industry, government, community organizations and others can work together to meet the urgent needs of US patients and communities. ""In his Unity Agenda, President Biden set a clear directive: we must all come together to address the nation's overdose epidemic,"" said White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) Director Dr. Rahul Gupta. ""Not only are we working closely across federal agencies, but with partners at the state, local, and community levels to save lives and ensure everyone has the resources they need to stay healthy and thrive. Expanding access to overdose reversal medication like naloxone is a key priority of this Administration, and we will continue doing all we can to get this lifesaving tool in communities throughout the country."" ""We were honored to host Dr. Gupta at our Columbus facility for this important visit to advance our shared goal of saving lives through expanding access to overdose-reversal medicines like naloxone,"" said Brian Hoffmann, President, Generics, Hikma. ""Hikma firmly believes that no one who needs overdose reversal medicine should lack access because of costs, awareness or availability. That's why Hikma is proud to manufacture all forms of naloxone including generic sterile injectable and pre-filled syringe formulations, in addition to KLOXXADO®. We are committed to continuing to work with Dr. Gupta and his colleagues, health care providers, non-profit organizations and the public health community to ensure naloxone is widely accessible to all who can benefit from it."" ""We were grateful to have participated in today's important conversation about how government and industry can work together with the harm reduction community to address the ongoing opioid epidemic,"" said Kelsey Caitlin Bates, Black Community Strategy Director and Regional Coordinator, Harm Reduction Ohio. ""Driven by a commitment to science, compassion, and human rights, we advocate for the autonomy of choice, empowering individuals to navigate their health decisions, including naloxone use, in alignment with their values and needs."" As the US FDA, ONDCP and others have noted, naloxone is a critical tool for individuals, families, first responders and communities to help reduce opioid overdose deaths, and expanding access to all forms of naloxone is one of the top ways to address the overdose crisis. Hikma manufactures multiple formulations of naloxone and has been working with communities across the US for more than 20 years to provide medicines that help people recover from opioid use disorder. Through its Hikma Community Health™ initiative, it has partnered with US non-profits and harm reduction organizations to help expand access to its entire naloxone portfolio.

(NYSE: AGR) reaches a significant milestone by achieving commercial operation of the 106 MW Midland Wind farm in Illinois, boosting the company's total capacity in the state to over 600 MW.

(NYSE: AGR) reaches a significant milestone by achieving commercial operation of the 106 MW Midland Wind farm in Illinois, boosting the company's total capacity in the state to over 600 MW. The wind farm is expected to generate nearly 400,000 MWh of renewable energy, equivalent to powering 37,000 homes. Avangrid CEO, Pedro Azagra, highlights the company's commitment to clean energy transition and community support, with the project creating local jobs and contributing over $25 million in property taxes to support various sectors. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The commissioning of Avangrid's Midland Wind farm represents a significant expansion of renewable energy capacity, particularly in the state of Illinois. This development contributes to the diversification of the energy mix in the region and aligns with broader trends towards renewable energy adoption. The addition of 106 MW is a substantial increment, considering the scale of energy projects and could potentially influence the company's revenue stream and cost structure in the medium to long term. With energy production now operational, the direct financial benefits will stem from the sale of generated electricity, likely under long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), which provide revenue stability.Moreover, the local economic impact through job creation during construction and ongoing operations can enhance Avangrid's corporate image and community relations. This may indirectly benefit the company's stock by bolstering its reputation as a sustainable and socially responsible investment. Additionally, the $25 million in property taxes underscores the project's contribution to the local economy and supports the narrative of renewable energy projects as drivers of regional development. Sustainability Expert Avangrid's achievement in surpassing 600 MW of wind capacity in Illinois with Midland Wind underscores the company's strategic commitment to sustainability and clean energy. The environmental impact of this project is noteworthy; the farm's 25 turbines will generate approximately 400,000 MWh annually, enough to power around 37,000 homes. This transition to clean energy sources is critical in the context of climate change and reducing carbon emissions.The project also highlights the scalability of wind energy as a renewable source. By expanding its renewable portfolio, Avangrid not only contributes to reducing the carbon footprint but also aligns itself with investor and consumer expectations for environmentally friendly practices. This alignment can enhance brand value and potentially attract environmentally conscious investors, which can have a positive impact on the company's stock valuation over time. Market Research Analyst Avangrid's expansion in Illinois positions the company as a key player in the Midwest's renewable energy sector. With Illinois now hosting the largest capacity within Avangrid's portfolio in the region, this could provide a competitive advantage in terms of market share and influence within the renewable energy market. The proximity of Midland Wind to other Avangrid projects may offer operational synergies and cost efficiencies, which can improve the company's overall profitability.From a market perspective, the increasing installed capacity of over 8.6 GW positions Avangrid as the third-largest renewable energy operator in the U.S., which may bolster investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and operational expertise in the renewable sector. This expansion may also reflect positively on the stock as investors often seek companies with a clear growth strategy and a demonstrated ability to execute on large-scale projects. 02/21/2024 - 12:54 PM Company eclipses 600 Megawatts (MW) in Illinois with the addition of 106 MW Midland Wind PORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avangrid, Inc.

We look forward to continuing our efforts in developing green energy solutions while supporting Illinois communities.” Midland Wind’s 25 turbines will generate nearly 400,000 MWh of renewable energy, which is enough clean energy to power the equivalent of 37,000 homes.

(NYSE:TXT) declares a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share on Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst Textron Inc.'s recent announcement of a quarterly dividend payment represents a direct financial return to shareholders. Dividends are a tangible distribution of earnings, reflecting the company's current financial health and management's confidence in its ongoing cash flow. The declared dividend amount, $0.02 per share, must be evaluated against historical payments to assess the trend of shareholder remuneration. An increase, decrease, or steady dividend can signal different strategic directions and investor attractiveness. A consistent or increasing dividend trend may attract income-focused investors and could indicate a stable financial position. Conversely, a decrease might raise concerns about the company's future earnings or cash management strategies.For stakeholders, dividends provide immediate, realized income and can sometimes offer tax advantages. The timing and reliability of these payments can influence investor sentiment and the stock's desirability, potentially affecting the stock price. In the short term, the announcement of a dividend often leads to a positive market reaction, assuming the dividend is in line with or exceeds market expectations. Long-term implications include the sustainability of dividend payments, which are contingent upon the company's profitability and strategic financial planning. Market Research Analyst The declaration of dividends by Textron Inc. also serves as an indicator of the company's positioning within the broader market. By examining industry benchmarks and comparing Textron's dividend yield to its peers, one can gauge the company's performance relative to the industry standard. This perspective is crucial for investors who weigh the risk-reward ratio of their portfolios. The dividend yield, calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the stock price, is a metric used to compare companies within the same sector and assess relative value.Furthermore, the timing of the dividend declaration can be strategic. The payment date and record date are important for investors, as they determine eligibility for receiving the dividend. The ex-dividend date, typically set two business days before the record date, is the last date on which the shares can be purchased to be eligible for the dividend payment. These dates are critical for investors' trading strategies and can influence trading volumes and stock price volatility around these times. 02/21/2024 - 12:28 PM PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Textron Inc.

The purchase price is 98.5% of the net asset value per share. Morgan Stanley Investment Management has over $1.5 trillion in assets under management. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The tender offer by Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund represents a significant repurchase program, aiming to buy back approximately 20% of its outstanding shares. This move can be interpreted as a signal of confidence from management in the intrinsic value of the Fund, which could be perceived positively by investors. The repurchase at 98.5% of the net asset value (NAV) suggests a slight discount, providing an immediate, albeit modest, value proposition to participating shareholders.However, the large oversubscription, with tenders for around four times the number of shares on offer, indicates a substantial demand from investors to liquidate their positions at the proposed price. This could reflect a desire for liquidity or concerns about the future performance of the Fund. The pro-ration of 24.1% means that shareholders who opted to tender their shares will only sell a fraction of what they offered, which could lead to potential dissatisfaction among investors. Market Research Analyst The context of this tender offer should be considered against the backdrop of the Chinese equity market and global economic conditions. The Fund's performance is tied to the A-shares market, which consists of stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and is subject to the regulatory environment and economic trends within China. Investors should be aware of the geopolitical risks, regulatory changes and market volatility that can affect the performance of such funds.Moreover, the repurchase program's impact on the Fund's liquidity and future NAV should be monitored. While a reduced number of shares could lead to a higher NAV per share in the short term, the Fund's ability to manage large redemptions and maintain a balanced portfolio composition could be challenged, potentially affecting long-term performance. Economist An economist might highlight that share repurchase programs, such as the one executed by the Fund, can often be a mechanism to return capital to shareholders and improve financial ratios. However, the decision to sell back at a slight discount to NAV indicates that the Fund is seeking to balance shareholder returns with the need to manage its capital efficiently.It is also important to consider the macroeconomic environment, particularly the interest rate landscape and the flow of capital into and out of emerging markets like China. The redemption could be a response to shifts in investor sentiment regarding Chinese equities, influenced by both domestic economic policies and the global economic climate. 02/21/2024 - 10:05 AM NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Morgan Stanley China A Share Fund, Inc.

Direct distribution channels are leading growth, with potential opportunities for insurers to capitalize on market conditions in 2024.","U.S. Consumers Continue to Shop and Switch Auto Insurance at Higher Rates, Dragging Down Carriers' Retention Rates Rhea-AI Impact (Low) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary The LexisNexis Insurance Demand Meter for Q4 2023 indicates a 'Hot' market with increased auto insurance shopping, new policies, and improved combined ratios. Consumers are switching carriers at a higher rate, driving growth despite rising rates. Direct distribution channels are leading growth, with potential opportunities for insurers to capitalize on market conditions in 2024. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The report from the LexisNexis Insurance Demand Meter indicates a significant shift in consumer behavior within the U.S. auto insurance market. The observed increase in shopping and policy switching suggests a more competitive environment, where customer retention has become more challenging. Insurers' response to these market dynamics, primarily through rate adjustments and marketing strategies, particularly in the direct distribution channel, can lead to a reshuffling of market share. As such, understanding regional trends and consumer preferences becomes crucial for insurers to tailor their offerings and maintain or improve profitability.From a market research perspective, the double-digit growth in certain states and the contrasting negative growth in others like Texas, which had previously seen positive developments, underscore the importance of localized strategy. Insurers will need to analyze these state-by-state variations to optimize their rate strategies and marketing spend. The direct distribution channel's 27% growth, in contrast to agent-based channels, highlights a consumer shift towards digital platforms for insurance shopping and may indicate a broader trend in consumer purchasing behavior.Looking forward, insurers must balance rate competitiveness with customer acquisition costs to capitalize on the current 'hot' market conditions. The focus on profitability and potential re-underwriting of policies could lead to further increases in shopping behavior as consumers seek cost-effective options. Financial Analyst The 'Hot' Q4 2023 as described by the LexisNexis Insurance Demand Meter has significant implications for the financial health of auto insurers. The reported improvement in combined ratios, which measure incurred losses and expenses against earned premiums, suggests that insurers are becoming more effective at underwriting and expense management. This improvement is critical for returning to profitability, particularly given the pressures of increased claims costs and vehicle repair expenses that have previously detracted from profitability gains.The trend of consumers switching carriers at an increasing rate could pressure insurers to offer more competitive rates, potentially affecting their underwriting margins. However, the increase in shopping and policy growth presents an opportunity for insurers to expand their customer base, provided they can do so without incurring unsustainable acquisition costs. The 9.8% year-over-year annual policy growth indicates a robust demand that, if capitalized upon effectively, could lead to market share gains and improved financial performance for the insurers that navigate this environment successfully.Investors should monitor insurers' strategies for customer acquisition and retention, as well as their ability to manage rate increases without sacrificing market share. The state-level data provided by the report could be instrumental in predicting which insurers are better positioned to thrive in this evolving market. Economist The data presented by the LexisNexis Insurance Demand Meter reflects broader economic trends, such as inflationary pressures manifesting in increased vehicle repair costs and the impact of unfavorable reserve development. The auto insurance industry's response to these economic pressures, through rate increases and strategic marketing, is indicative of insurers attempting to maintain profitability in a challenging economic environment.The increased shopping and policy switching behavior may also reflect consumer sensitivity to price changes and a willingness to seek better deals, a behavior often seen in periods of economic uncertainty or when disposable incomes are under pressure. The shift towards direct distribution channels could be associated with broader digital transformation trends and a consumer preference for convenience and immediacy in purchasing decisions.From an economic standpoint, the insurance industry's ability to achieve rate adequacy while maintaining customer satisfaction and retention will be a delicate balance that could influence the sector's stability and growth. The potential for increased market segmentation, as suggested by the varied growth rates across different states, could lead to a more dynamic and possibly fragmented market structure in the long term. 02/21/2024 - 01:30 PM According to the LexisNexis Insurance Demand Meter, a ""Hot"" Q4 2023 spelled continued rate increases, along with improved combined ratios, and now opens a window for insurers to capitalize on continued shopping as they seek a return to profitability in 2024 ATLANTA, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Key takeaways U.S. auto insurance shopping and new policies posted positive year-over-year growth and record volumes for the final quarter of the year, both registering as 'Hot' on the LexisNexis® Insurance Demand Meter.Year-over-year shopper growth showed the strongest Q4 growth since 2020.Quarterly year-over-year growth for new policies outpaced shopper growth for the sixth consecutive quarter, meaning consumers continue to switch carriers at an increasing rate when they shop.Not resigned to higher rates, 41% of insured households shopped their auto insurance at least once in 2023.Retention levels have dropped a staggering three percentage points since Q1 2022 as consumers hit the marketHeightened new policy and shopping activity counters traditional fourth quarter lulls. In an already ""hot"" shopping market, consumers actively shopped their auto insurance policies.Year-over-year shopper growth rebounded from -1.2% in Q3 to 4.7% in Q4.Quarterly year-over-year growth for new policies rose from 3.9% to 7.0%2023 year in review. Overall, shopping and new business volumes exploded in the first months of the year, as rate increases impacted the market.Claims costs, inflated vehicle repair costs and unfavorable reserve development slowed growth by detracting from profitability gains.Insurers walked back new customer acquisition efforts during the summer, resulting in a short-lived dip in shopping in Q3.In Q4, activity bounced back, brought on by elevated rates and increased market efforts, creating prime conditions for a hot market.In the final quarter of the year, insurer marketing spend, particularly in the direct distribution channel, increased shopping and switching and brought the year-over-year annual policy growth to 9.8%.""As the industry sees rates spike and expands marketing to prime consumers for increased shopping, it will be key to observe activity on a state-by-state level,"" said Adam Pichon, senior vice president, U.S auto and claims, LexisNexis® Risk Solutions. ""When we look at Texas, a leading state for improved profitability, both the number and size of rate increases have dwindled. While we can't predict the shopping trajectory for states still looking to achieve rate adequacy, we will watch closely to determine whether Texas can serve as a bellwether for the rest of the country."" Direct distribution stages a comeback with increased market activity.As market dynamics shift, the direct distribution channel single-handedly drove Q4 growth. This sits in contrast to the previous quarter when independent agents zeroed in on consumer desires to shop policies from multiple carriers. Direct distribution channel growth exploded, increasing by 27%.The direct distribution channel offset the negative growth in the agent-based channels.Western and Midwestern regions led shopping growth in Q4.Twelve of the 15 fastest-growing states are located in the West and Midwest regions. Across the U.S., 39 states saw positive growth; of that, 15 experienced double-digit growth.Top-performing states for shopping growth included: Hawaii (67%), West Virginia (44%), Iowa (41%), South Dakota (29%) and Utah (23%).States that saw negative growth year-over-year included Washington D.C. (-15%), Oklahoma and New York (-7%), Rhode Island (-6%), New Hampshire (-5%) and Texas (-4%).Looking aheadWith 2024 already underway, insurers have an opportunity to seize market share, particularly evident in the direct channel where factors like marketing expenditure and rate adjustments are prompting increased shopping behavior. Texas, one of the first states to increase rates and experience positive growth, saw negative shopping numbers in the final quarter of 2023. This may highlight the need for insurers to adapt their strategies and balance acquisition with rate competitiveness to capitalize on increased shopping before it stabilizes. While there's a window of opportunity, it may be temporary. Insurers may only have a limited timeframe to take advantage of current insurance industry conditions and secure their market position. ""With profitability top of mind in 2024, we expect to see many insurers taking a closer look at their portfolios and in some cases re-underwriting certain policies,"" said Pichon.

Customers can choose from various tree species to reduce energy bills and enhance environmental benefits. Positive None. Negative None. Environmental Economist An initiative like the Energy-Saving Trees program presents several economic and environmental benefits. From an environmental economics perspective, the distribution of 600 trees to residential customers is a strategic move that can lead to significant energy savings and a reduction in carbon emissions over time. The program is expected to save nearly 26.34 million kWh of energy, which translates into substantial cost savings for consumers and reduced demand on the power grid.Furthermore, the trees' ability to absorb over 195,072 pounds of air pollutants contributes to the public health benefits by improving air quality. This is a classic example of a positive externality, where a private transaction has beneficial side effects for third parties. Additionally, the nearly $10 million in combined energy and community benefits underscores the tangible impact of such environmental initiatives on both individual and societal levels.However, it is essential to consider the long-term growth and maintenance of these trees, as well as the potential for urban forestry management challenges. The success of the program hinges on proper planting and care by the homeowners, which requires ongoing education and support from the company and its partners. Sustainability Analyst The partnership between Delmarva Power and the Arbor Day Foundation, now in its 12th year, is a testament to the growing importance of corporate sustainability efforts. As a Sustainability Analyst, it's clear that Delmarva Power is aligning its business practices with broader environmental goals, such as reducing carbon emissions and enhancing community resilience.The Energy-Saving Trees program is particularly impactful as it offers a direct, consumer-facing approach to sustainability, engaging customers in energy conservation efforts. By providing interactive tools to help customers plant trees effectively for energy savings, the program also empowers consumers to take part in environmental stewardship.Delmarva Power's broader commitment, as evidenced by its Sustainable Communities Grant Program and Climate Commitment and Path to Clean goals, indicates a strategic approach to sustainability that goes beyond one-off initiatives. This may enhance the company's reputation and could potentially attract environmentally conscious investors and customers who are increasingly looking for companies with strong sustainability credentials. Urban Planning Expert Integrating tree planting within urban environments, as seen with Delmarva Power's initiative, is a critical component of urban planning aimed at creating sustainable cities. As an Urban Planning Expert, the significance of this program lies in its dual impact on energy efficiency and urban livability.The selection of native tree species is crucial for the success of such programs, as these species are more likely to thrive and require less maintenance, which is beneficial for both the homeowners and the local ecosystem. The program's emphasis on calling 811 to have utility underground lines marked before planting is a critical reminder of the importance of planning and coordination in urban settings to avoid damaging existing infrastructure.Additionally, the program's potential to reduce energy bills by 15 to 30 percent as trees grow demonstrates how urban greenery can be a cost-effective measure for energy conservation. The role of trees in breaking up winter winds and providing shade during the summer is a classic example of natural climate control, which can reduce the urban heat island effect and improve overall community well-being. 02/21/2024 - 10:30 AM Company to make 600 trees available to residential customers, in turn reducing costs, improving energy efficiency and furthering sustainabilityNEWARK, DE / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Delmarva Power customers can now request a free tree to plant at their home as part of the company's partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation's Energy-Saving Trees program.

Solventum, with anticipated sales of $8.2 billion in 2023, will list on the NYSE as 'SOLV'. The leadership team includes Bryan Hanson as CEO, Wayde McMillan as CFO, and Carrie Cox as Board Chair. An Investor Day is scheduled for March 19, 2024, in New York City. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The announcement of 3M's Health Care business spin-off into a new entity, Solventum and its subsequent listing on the NYSE under ticker 'SOLV' represents a strategic realignment with significant implications for the market. The separation of a major division such as 3M's Health Care, which reported sales of $8.2 billion in 2023, is a substantial event that warrants close examination of the market dynamics and competitive landscape. The new entity will carry a workforce of over 20,000 employees, indicating a significant scale of operations.Investors and analysts will be keen to understand how this spin-off could potentially unlock value. Historically, spin-offs have been used to streamline operations, allowing both parent and offspring companies to focus on their core competencies. For 3M, this could mean a sharpened focus on its remaining businesses, while Solventum may benefit from increased agility and a dedicated strategy in the health care space. The scale of the operation and the experienced leadership team suggest that Solventum could emerge as a strong competitor in its sector. Financial Analyst The financial health and potential growth trajectory of Solventum post-spin-off are pivotal for stakeholder value. With $8.2 billion in sales, Solventum's financial performance will be closely scrutinized for profitability, R&D investment efficiency and market share expansion. The leadership structure, with Bryan Hanson as CEO and Wayde McMillan as CFO, suggests continuity and a strategic vision that could reassure investors.Moreover, the listing on the NYSE facilitates access to capital and provides a transparent valuation benchmark. The investor day event is also critical as it will provide a platform for Solventum to present its financials, growth strategy and value creation plan to potential investors. The details shared during this event will be instrumental in shaping investor perception and could influence Solventum's initial market valuation. Legal Expert The spin-off process is governed by complex legal and regulatory frameworks. The filing of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC is a critical step that involves disclosing detailed information about Solventum's business operations, financials and risks. This transparency is crucial for investor trust and is mandated by securities law to ensure fair trading. The final approval from the 3M Board and meeting other conditions highlight the procedural rigor involved in the spin-off.Furthermore, the separation must be structured to comply with tax laws, which can significantly affect the financial outcomes for both 3M and Solventum. The legal structuring of the spin-off will also determine the distribution of assets, liabilities and contractual obligations between the two entities. This legal demarcation is essential for both companies to operate independently without encumbrances. 02/21/2024 - 10:00 AM Solventum anticipated to spin off from 3M on April 1, 2024 ST. PAUL, Minn., Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- 3M (NYSE: MMM) today announced the filing of a Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as the newly independent health care company Solventum.

Leveraging its global expertise in ChemCycling®, BASF is offering customers ISSC+ certified advanced recycled building blocks from the BASF TotalEnergies Petrochemicals (BTP) facility in Port Arthur, Texas. ChemCycling utilizes recycled feedstock that is derived from plastic waste in the conventional production process, thereby partially replacing fossil resources. The recycled feedstock is attributed to the advanced recycled building blocks via a mass balance approach. These building blocks can be used for many BASF products manufactured in the U.S., for example super absorbent polymers, engineered plastics or polyurethanes. “As a pioneer in the industry for advanced recycling, BASF is building on its experience, innovative strength and great partnerships along the value chain to create a more circular economy for plastics,” said Dr. Gulay Serhatkulu, Senior Vice President Petrochemicals, BASF North America. “By using recycled raw materials at the beginning of the chemical value chain, plastic waste becomes a resource, creating value for the environment, society and the economy.” Each year, less than 9% of plastic waste is recycled in the U.S.1 By establishing advanced recycling as a complementary solution to mechanical recycling, it is possible to utilize more plastic waste, particularly plastics that cannot be recycled mechanically for technological, economic, or ecological reasons. These include plastics with residues and mixed plastic waste fractions, which would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated. “We are excited to highlight this new local production to our customers. New products from advanced recycling have the same properties as products using fossil-derived building blocks,” said Johanne Wilson, Business Development Manager for ChemCycling at BASF. “Our customers can process Ccycled products in the same way as conventionally manufactured products for use in their downstream businesses including high-performance packaging and demanding applications such as automotive or construction.” About BASF BASF Corporation, headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey, is the North American affiliate of BASF SE, Ludwigshafen, Germany. BASF has approximately 16,000 employees in North America and had sales of $25.7 billion in 2022. For more information about BASF’s North American operations, visit www.basf.com/us. At BASF, we create chemistry for a sustainable future. We combine economic success with environmental protection and social responsibility. More than 111,000 employees in the BASF Group contribute to the success of our customers in nearly all sectors and almost every country in the world.

Financial Analyst The announcement of Essential Utilities Inc.'s dividend increase is a significant indicator of the company's financial health and its commitment to shareholder returns. A 7% increase in the dividend payout suggests confidence in the company's ongoing profitability and cash flow stability. Investors often view such increases as a positive signal, potentially leading to a favorable market response. Historically, companies with a strong record of dividend growth are perceived as reliable investments.Moreover, Essential Utilities' track record of paying dividends for 79 years and consistently increasing them over the past 32 years underscores its resilient business model and financial discipline. This could attract income-focused investors, particularly in a low-interest-rate environment where reliable dividends are highly valued. Market Research Analyst From a market perspective, Essential Utilities operates within the utility sector, which is known for its defensive investment characteristics. The sector often becomes a haven for investors during volatile market conditions due to its essential services and stable earnings. The dividend increase announcement could thus be seen as reinforcing the company's position within the sector, potentially making it more attractive compared to its peers.Investors may also interpret the dividend increase as a sign of management's confidence in the company's future growth prospects and regulatory environment. It is important to note that the utility industry is heavily regulated and companies in this sector must maintain a balance between investing in infrastructure and providing returns to shareholders. Economist Dividend policy decisions, such as those made by Essential Utilities, are often influenced by broader economic conditions. The decision to increase dividends could reflect management's assessment of the macroeconomic environment, including inflation rates, interest rates and economic growth expectations. A stable or growing dividend can be particularly appealing during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation, as it provides a potential hedge for investors.Additionally, the company's ability to raise dividends consistently may indicate a strong competitive position and pricing power within its market. This can be an important factor in the long-term sustainability of the company's financial performance, especially in the face of economic headwinds or increased competition. 02/21/2024 - 12:08 PM BRYN MAWR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The board of directors of Essential Utilities Inc.

Negative None. 02/21/2024 - 12:00 PM RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altria Group, Inc. (Altria) (NYSE: MO) is participating in the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference in Boca Raton, Florida today. Billy Gifford, Altria’s Chief Executive Officer, and Sal Mancuso, Altria’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will highlight our exciting progress toward our Vision, discuss how our traditional tobacco businesses continue to support our strategies and provide more detail on our long-term growth aspirations. “I’m confident about the future for tobacco harm reduction in the U.S. There is a significant opportunity to shift millions of smokers away from cigarettes to the benefit of adult tobacco consumers, our shareholders and society,” said Billy Gifford. “As the leader in the U.S. nicotine industry, we believe we are best positioned to lead the tobacco harm reduction opportunity.” Remarks and Presentation The presentation will be webcast live on www.altria.com in a listen-only mode, beginning at approximately 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time. A copy of the business presentation, prepared remarks and a replay of the webcast will be available at www.altria.com. 2024 Full-Year Guidance We reaffirm our guidance to deliver 2024 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) in a range of $5.00 to $5.15, representing a growth rate of 1% to 4% from a base of $4.95 in 2023. We expect 2024 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our guidance includes the impact of two additional shipping days in 2024 and assumes limited impact from enforcement efforts in the illicit e-vapor market on combustible and e-vapor volumes. While the 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios, the external environment remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy, including the cumulative impact of inflation, (ii) adult tobacco consumer dynamics, including purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products, (iii) illicit e-vapor enforcement and (iv) regulatory, litigation and legislative developments. Our 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of our Vision, such as (i) marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products and (ii) continued smoke-free product research, development and regulatory preparation expenses. The 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes an estimated per share gain of $1.14 related to the sale of the IQOS Tobacco Heating System commercialization rights that we expect to occur in the second quarter of 2024. Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes the impact of certain income and expense items that our management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include, for example, loss on early extinguishment of debt, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges, acquisition, disposition and integration-related items, equity investment-related special items (including any changes in fair value of our former equity investment in JUUL Labs, Inc. (JUUL) recorded at fair value), certain income tax items, charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items, and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the MSA (NPM Adjustment Items). Our management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items, including those items noted in the preceding paragraph, on our reported diluted EPS because these items, which could be significant, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result, we do not provide a corresponding U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measure for, or reconciliation to, our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Altria’s Profile We have a leading portfolio of tobacco products for U.S. tobacco consumers age 21+. Our Vision is to responsibly lead the transition of adult smokers to a smoke-free future (Vision). We are Moving Beyond Smoking™, leading the way in moving adult smokers away from cigarettes by taking action to transition millions to potentially less harmful choices - believing it is a substantial opportunity for adult tobacco consumers, our businesses and society. Our wholly owned subsidiaries include leading manufacturers of both combustible and smoke-free products. In combustibles, we own Philip Morris USA Inc. (PM USA), the most profitable U.S. cigarette manufacturer, and John Middleton Co. (Middleton), a leading U.S. cigar manufacturer. Our smoke-free portfolio includes ownership of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (USSTC), the leading global moist smokeless tobacco (MST) manufacturer, Helix Innovations LLC (Helix), a leading manufacturer of oral nicotine pouches, and NJOY, LLC (NJOY), currently the only e-vapor manufacturer to receive market authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a pod-based e-vapor product.

Our management does not view any of these special items to be part of our underlying results as they may be highly variable, may be unusual or infrequent, are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Our management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Our management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance, including allocating capital and other resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not required by, or calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

This is driven by macro-economic factors that led to a decrease in consumer demand in the first half of the year, offset by a return to growth in the second half of the year. Despite the cautious consumer sentiment, the mattress product category grew year-over-year partly as a result of our partnership with Resident, the largest direct-to-consumer mattress company in North America.Same Store Sales (1)Same store corporate sales decreased by 2.6% or $64.2 million comparable to the year ended December 31, 2022 driven by the factors discussed in the revenue section above.Gross ProfitThe gross profit margin increased by 7 basis points from 44.06% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 44.13% in the year ended December 31, 2023. This favourable result is due to a decrease in ocean and overland transportation costs and a more favourable product mix for the year.Selling, General and Administrative ExpensesThe Company's SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased to 36.57%, an increase of 262 basis points over the prior year of 33.95%. The Company's SG&A as a percentage of revenue for the year increased due to a decline in sales, increases due to provincial wage increases, an increase in point-of-sale retail financing fees due to the continuing Bank of Canada interest rate increases and an overall increase in marketing spend to drive revenue.Adjusted Net Income (1) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (1)Adjusted net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $141.5 million, a decrease of $35.7 million or 20.2% over the prior year.Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the Company decreased to $2.06 per share compared to $2.60 per share in the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $0.54 per share.Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per ShareIncluding the mark-to-market impact of the Company's financial derivatives, net income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $138.9 million, or $2.02 per diluted earnings per share (net income of $179.4 million, $2.64 per diluted earnings per share in 2022).(1) Please refer to the sections of this press release with the headings ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" and ""Supplementary Financial Measures"".DividendsAs previously announced, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share on 8th day of January 2024. Today the Directors have declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per common share payable on the 8th day of April 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on the 8th day of March 2024. As of 2007, dividends paid by Leon's Furniture Limited are ""eligible dividends"" pursuant to the changes to the Income Tax Act under Bill C-28, Canada.OutlookGiven the Company's strong and continuously improving financial position, our principal objective is to increase our market share and profitability. We remain focused on our commitment to effectively manage our costs but to also continuously invest in the business to drive growth initiatives that will drive more customers to both our online eCommerce sites and our 303 store locations across Canada.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresThe Company uses financial measures that do not have standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. The Company calculates the non-IFRS financial measures by adjusting certain IFRS measures for specific items the Company believes are significant, but not reflective of underlying operations in the period, as detailed below:Non-IFRS MeasureIFRS MeasureAdjusted net incomeNet incomeAdjusted income before income taxesIncome before income taxesAdjusted earnings per share - basicEarnings per share - basicAdjusted earnings per share - dilutedEarnings per share - dilutedAdjusted EBITDANet income Adjusted Net IncomeThe Company calculates comparable measures by excluding the effect of changes in fair value of derivative instruments, related to the net effect of USD-denominated forward contracts. The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its financial risk in accordance with the Company's corporate treasury policy. Management believes excluding from income the effect of these mark- to-market valuations and changes thereto, until settlement, better aligns the intent and financial effect of these contracts with the underlying cash flows.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, mark-to-market adjustment due to the changes in the fair value of the Company's financial derivative instruments and any non-recurring charges to income (""Adjusted EBITDA"") is a non-IFRS financial measure used by the Company. The Company considers adjusted EBITDA to be an effective measure of profitability on an operational basis and is commonly regarded as an indirect measure of operating cash flow, a significant indicator of success for many businesses. The Company's Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to the Adjusted EBITDA measure of other companies, but in management's view appropriately reflects the Company's specific financial condition. This measure is not intended to replace net income, which, as determined in accordance with IFRS, is an indicator of operating performance.The following is a reconciliation of reported net income to adjusted EBITDA:For the Three months ended Year ended(C$ in millions)December 31,2023December 31,2022December 31,2023December 31,2022Net income46.243.2138.9179.4Income tax expense15.113.943.656.8Net finance costs4.26.019.521.5Depreciation and amortization27.027.1107.8110.0Gain on settlement of warrant--(20.0)-Mark-to-market loss/(gain) on financial derivative3.61.93.5(3.0)Adjusted EBITDA96.192.1293.3364.7 Total System Wide SalesTotal system wide sales refer to the aggregation of revenue recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements plus the franchise sales occurring at franchise stores to their customers which are not included in the revenue figure presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Total system wide sales is not a measure recognized by IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, but it is a key indicator used by the Company to measure performance against prior period results. Therefore, total system wide sales as discussed in this MD&A may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. We believe that disclosing this measure is meaningful to investors because it serves as an indicator of the strength of the Company's overall store network, which ultimately impacts financial performance.Franchise SalesFranchise sales figures refer to sales occurring at franchise stores to their customers which are not included in the revenue figures presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements, or in the same store sales figures in this MD&A. Franchise sales is not a measure recognized by IFRS, and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, but it is a key indicator used by the Company to measure performance against prior period results. Therefore, franchise sales as discussed in this MD&A may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Once again, we believe that disclosing this measure is meaningful to investors because it serves as an indicator of the strength of the Company's brands, which ultimately impacts financial performance.Supplementary Financial MeasuresThe Company uses supplementary financial measures to disclose financial measures that are not (a) presented in the financial statements and (b) is, or is intended to be, disclosed periodically to depict the historical or expected future financial performance, financial position or cash flow, that is not a non-IFRS financial measure as detailed above.Same Store SalesSame store sales are defined as sales generated by stores, both in store and through online transactions, that have been open for more than 12 months on a fiscal basis. Same store sales as discussed in this MD&A may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers, however this measure is commonly used in the retail industry. We believe that disclosing this measure is meaningful to investors because it enables them to better understand the level of growth of our business.About Leon's Furniture LimitedLeon's Furniture Limited is the largest retailer of furniture, appliances and electronics in Canada.

Winmark Corporation Announces Year End Results,2024-02-21T15:39:00.000Z,Neutral,Negative,"Winmark Corporation (Nasdaq: WINA) reported a net income of $40,178,100 for 2023, with revenues reaching $83,243,500. The company's fourth quarter net income was $9,716,800. Winmark focuses on franchising resale stores like Plato’s Closet® and Once Upon A Child®.","Winmark Corporation Announces Year End Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Negative) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Winmark Corporation (Nasdaq: WINA) reported a net income of $40,178,100 for 2023, with revenues reaching $83,243,500. The company's fourth quarter net income was $9,716,800. Winmark focuses on franchising resale stores like Plato’s Closet® and Once Upon A Child®. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported net income for Winmark Corporation shows a moderate increase from the previous year, indicating a steady performance in a challenging economic environment. The earnings per share (EPS) growth is marginal, suggesting that the company's profitability has improved slightly, but not significantly. The increase in annual revenues also reflects a positive trend, although the growth rate is relatively modest.It is important to note that the company's decision to run-off its leasing portfolio in May 2021 may have influenced these figures. This strategic move likely resulted in a shift in the company's revenue streams and could have long-term implications for its financial stability and growth potential. The impact of this decision should be closely monitored in future quarters.The mention of an extra week of operations in the 2022 fiscal year is a critical factor to consider when comparing year-over-year performance. This anomaly could have inflated the previous year's figures, making the 2023 growth appear more subdued than it actually is. Market Research Analyst Winmark Corporation's focus on sustainability and support for small business formation through franchising is a strong strategic position in the current market, where there is an increasing consumer demand for sustainable options and entrepreneurial opportunities. The franchise model provides a scalable way to grow the business while leveraging the local knowledge and commitment of franchise partners.The company's portfolio of resale franchises caters to a growing segment of consumers interested in second-hand goods, a market that has been expanding due to both economic pressures and a cultural shift towards more sustainable consumption patterns. This positions Winmark well within a niche that could see continued growth as consumer behaviors evolve.With 1,319 franchises in operation and an additional 71 awarded but not yet open, Winmark appears to have a strong pipeline for expansion. However, the growth rate in the second half of the year did slow, which could signal market saturation or operational challenges that may need to be addressed to maintain growth momentum. Economist The modest increase in net income and revenues for Winmark Corporation must be contextualized within the broader economic landscape. Given the macroeconomic conditions of 2023, which likely included various challenges such as inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and possibly a cautious consumer spending environment, Winmark's performance can be seen as resilient.The performance of the franchise partners, as highlighted by the CEO, is a key driver of the company's success. The health of the franchise sector is often linked to consumer confidence and disposable income levels, making it a bellwether for the broader economy. The slowdown in growth during the second half of the year could reflect broader economic trends that may continue to affect the company's performance in the short to medium term.Given the company's reliance on the success of its franchisees, economic indicators such as consumer spending, unemployment rates and small business loan rates would be critical in forecasting Winmark's future performance. 02/21/2024 - 10:39 AM MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Winmark Corporation (Nasdaq: WINA) announced today net income for the year ended December 30, 2023 of $40,178,100 or $11.04 per share diluted compared to net income of $39,424,900 or $10.97 per share diluted in 2022. The fourth quarter 2023 net income was $9,716,800 or $2.64 per share diluted, compared to net income of $10,176,600 or $2.86 per share diluted, for the same period last year. Revenues for the year ended December 30, 2023 were $83,243,500, up from $81,410,800 in 2022. 2023 results were impacted by the Company’s decision in May 2021 to run-off its leasing portfolio. Additionally, financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2022 included an extra week of operations due to the Company’s fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of December. “Our 2023 results reflected positive performance by our franchise partners; however, growth was lower in the second half of the year,” commented Brett D. Heffes, Chair and Chief Executive Officer. Winmark - the Resale Company®, is a nationally recognized franchisor focused on sustainability and small business formation. We champion and guide entrepreneurs interested in operating one of our award winning resale franchises: Plato’s Closet®, Once Upon A Child®, Play It Again Sports®, Style Encore® and Music Go Round®.

The company received Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU, expanding into a $25 billion market segment. Immix Biopharma plans to continue quarterly updates, select new indications, and dose US patients with NXC-201, positioning itself as a leading autoimmune CAR-T company. Positive FDA clearance for NXC-201 CAR-T in AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma High response rates of 100% and 95% in AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma patients, respectively Orphan Drug Designation in the US and EU for AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma Plans to continue clinical updates, expand into new indications, and dose US patients with NXC-201 Strong clinical data presentation at ASH annual meeting Negative None. Medical Research Analyst The recent announcement by Immix Biopharma regarding the progress of their CAR-T cell therapy NXC-201 is a significant milestone within the biopharmaceutical industry. The therapy's Investigational New Drug (IND) clearance by the U.S. FDA is a critical step forward, enabling the commencement of clinical trials in the U.S. This clearance, along with the Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) received for both AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, suggests a recognition of the therapy's potential to address unmet medical needs in these areas.The reported overall response rates of 100% for relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients and 95% for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients are particularly noteworthy. These figures substantially exceed typical response rates observed in the treatment of these conditions, which may indicate a significant advancement in therapeutic options. However, it is essential for stakeholders to consider the sample size and the phase of the trial to contextualize these results appropriately. The long-term efficacy and safety profile of NXC-201 will be crucial for its commercial success and impact on Immix Biopharma's valuation. Financial Analyst Immix Biopharma's update has the potential to influence the company's stock performance, given the high investor interest in innovative treatments with blockbuster potential. The autoimmune disease market, valued at $25 billion, represents a substantial opportunity for Immix Biopharma. The company's positioning as a leader in this space could attract significant investor attention, particularly as they expand into additional autoimmune indications.Furthermore, the expansion of the scientific advisory board and the team's expertise, along with the strategic activation of top-tier U.S. clinical sites for NXC-201 dosing, may be perceived as a move to strengthen the company's clinical development capabilities. This can foster investor confidence in the company's ability to navigate the complex regulatory and clinical trial landscape. However, the financial implications of these developments will depend on the outcomes of the ongoing trials and the subsequent commercialization strategy adopted by Immix Biopharma. Market Research Analyst The autoimmune disease segment, particularly AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, has been an area of intense research and development due to the limited treatment options currently available. Immix Biopharma's focus on this segment aligns with the growing demand for innovative therapies that can offer better outcomes for patients with these conditions. The 'Single-Day CRS' feature of NXC-201, which refers to a single-day cytokine release syndrome management, could represent a significant improvement in the safety profile of CAR-T therapies, potentially increasing its adoption rate among healthcare providers.It is also important to monitor the competitive landscape, as other biopharmaceutical companies are also investing heavily in CAR-T and other cell therapies. Immix Biopharma's ability to maintain a competitive edge will be influenced by their clinical trial results, the speed of their regulatory approvals and their capacity to establish strong partnerships with clinical sites and foster relationships with key opinion leaders in the field. 02/21/2024 - 09:31 AM LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Immix Biopharma, Inc. (Nasdaq: IMMX), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company trailblazing cell therapies in autoimmune disease, today announced its 12-month progress update including shareholder letter. “The past 12 months have seen landmark achievements for Immix Biopharma, cementing our position as a leading cell therapy company in autoimmune disease.

NXC-201 is the only CAR-T in AL Amyloidosis and is expanding into additional autoimmune indications, a $25 billion combined annual market segment, where limited treatments are available today. At the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in December 2023, we presented clinical data from additional NXC-201 patients enrolled in our ongoing NEXICART-1 clinical trial, totaling 73 NXC-201 patients dosed to-date, demonstrating 100% and 95% overall response rates in relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis patients and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients, respectively. We received U.S. FDA Orphan Drug Designation in both AL Amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, as well as EU Orphan Drug Designation for AL Amyloidosis. NXC-201 is the first and only ‘Single-Day CRS‘ CAR-T, a critical advancement for autoimmune diseases like AL Amyloidosis,” said Ilya Rachman, MD PhD CEO Immix Biopharma. Gabriel Morris, CFO Immix Biopharma, added, “In the next 12 months, we plan to continue our approximately quarterly clinical data updates, presenting at premier academic forums, finalize the selection of our next autoimmune indication, and to dose U.S. patients with NXC-201.

As we reflect on the last 12 months of progress, we wish to connect with you offering an update on Immix Biopharma. We express our deep appreciation for the patience of our shareholders throughout these impactful 12 months. We are excited to share remarkable progress at Immix Biopharma. Our recent clinical trials for the groundbreaking NXC-201 CAR-T cell therapy have yielded promising results in treating relapsed/refractory AL Amyloidosis (r/r ALA) and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM), for which NXC-201 has received US FDA Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) in both indications. NXC-201 has demonstrated favorable toxicity, promising clinical results and “Single-Day CRS”, uniquely suited for dosing AL Amyloidosis and expanding into other autoimmune indications. These trials showcased high response rates and promising patient outcomes, solidifying our position as the premier autoimmune CAR-T company, with an unparalleled 73 patients treated to-date. A concise summary of our 2023 clinical results can be found on our “publications” section of our website under “65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Meeting December 2023.” ASH is the global premier forum for presenting clinical results in blood diseases. In addition, we plan to continue our success in the U.S., and in new autoimmune indications with high unmet medical need beyond r/r ALA and r/r MM. We recently received U.S. FDA IND (Investigational New Drug) approval in Q4 2023, and are initiating U.S. clinical studies. This achievement underscores our commitment to pioneering transformative therapies that redefine patient care and treatment paradigms. As a recognition of our cell therapy leadership, we were invited by the global investment community to present at the Bank of America Healthcare Trailblazers Conference in October and the JMP Securities Hematology and Oncology Summit in December. We must credit our team’s tireless efforts for their advancement of our clinical programs, and are grateful to our board of directors, scientific advisory board members, and team members who have supported Immix Biopharma along our journey to bring innovative cell therapies to deliver widely accessible cures. Patients are waiting!

The report highlights increasing customer experience scores across all performance categories, with midsized providers receiving the highest average scores. AI services are in high demand, with enterprises willing to pay more for AI features. While most performance categories saw year-on-year improvements, the report notes lower scores in certain technology areas like Payroll/Benefits Administration and supply chain services. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Enterprises' increasing satisfaction with technology and business services providers, particularly in AI services, indicates a positive shift in the industry's ability to adapt and deliver value in a challenging economic climate. The uptick in customer experience (CX) scores, especially in 'Governance and Compliance' and 'Execution and Delivery,' suggests that providers are successfully addressing key areas of concern for businesses. This is reflective of a broader trend where service quality and compliance are becoming differentiators in the competitive landscape.From a market research perspective, the willingness of enterprises to pay a premium for AI features in software underscores the growing importance of AI in business operations. This trend could lead to increased investments in AI capabilities by service providers, potentially driving up their market value and attractiveness to investors. Furthermore, the report's insights into regional variations in CX scores can guide providers in tailoring their strategies to regional needs, potentially impacting their market share and revenue in different geographies. Financial Analyst The reported increase in CX scores across all pillars can be seen as a leading indicator of potential revenue growth for providers, particularly for those in the AI services segment. Midsized providers achieving the highest average CX scores could attract increased business, potentially impacting their stock performance positively. Investors may view these providers as strong candidates for portfolio diversification, especially in a market that values robust governance, compliance and execution capabilities.However, it's important to scrutinize whether these improved scores translate into tangible financial outcomes such as increased contract sizes, client retention rates and long-term profitability. The report's indication that enterprises are cutting discretionary spending while optimizing technology investments suggests a cautious approach to expenditure, which could temper the financial impact of higher CX scores. Technology Analyst The emphasis on AI and its high CX score reflects a significant shift towards AI integration in business processes. This presents an opportunity for technology providers to innovate and offer more sophisticated AI-driven solutions. The report's findings also highlight the critical role of Application Development and Maintenance (ADM) in enterprise cost optimization, signaling a need for providers to focus on cloud-native and AI-based applications to remain competitive.For the technology sector, the increasing demand for AI services and the premium enterprises are willing to pay for these features could lead to a surge in R&D investments in AI. However, providers must also be aware of the growing regulation in this space, which could introduce compliance costs and affect the pace of AI adoption. 02/21/2024 - 11:00 AM Clients rated providers higher in all performance categories in an uncertain macro environment, ISG Star of Excellence™ CX Insights Report finds STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enterprise buyers’ ratings of technology and business services providers rose for a second straight year in 2023, with buyers in particular giving high marks to providers for AI services, according to a new report from Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm. The 2023 Annual ISG Star of Excellence™ CX Insights Report, which sums up ISG’s quarterly reviews on how enterprises rate their ITO, BPO and as-a-service outsourcing providers, shows enterprise customer experience (CX) scores increased from 2022 in all six pillars covered by ISG’s quarterly CX survey. The largest gains were in ratings for “Governance and Compliance” and “Execution and Delivery.” Enterprises gave midsized providers (those with annual revenues of $1 billion–$3 billion) the highest average CX scores of any revenue segment. The average provider’s CX score rose from 80.1 in 2022 to 83.7 in 2023, despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment last year that saw enterprises reduce discretionary spending while working to optimize technology investments, ISG says. “Heightened scrutiny on IT spend and tightening of outsourcing deals are driving providers to go above and beyond to deliver better CX to their customers,” said Heiko Henkes, ISG director and principal analyst in charge of the study. “Providers have stepped up their performance to meet rising expectations in the areas that enterprises consider most important.” AI received a CX score of 78.9, the highest among emerging technologies, and is becoming a significant part of many outsourcing engagements, the report says. With both increasing enterprise use and growing regulation of AI — trends ISG expects to continue through 2024 — companies are seeking AI-related provider services in many areas, especially enterprise service management and compliance, the report says. Enterprises are willing to pay between 6 percent and 9 percent more per seat for AI features in software, according to ISG’s research. In addition to higher CX scores for “Governance and Compliance” and “Execution and Delivery,” year-on-year improvements were observed in all other performance categories, including “Collaboration and Transparency,” “People and Culture Fit,” and “Business Continuity and Flexibility.” The average score for “Innovation and Thought Leadership” rose from 78.0 to 80.9 but remained the lowest of the six pillars. The report also tracks CX scores for 17 technology areas, with Application Development and Maintenance (ADM) receiving the highest score last year, at 81.5, moving up three places from the prior year. ADM is becoming essential to achieving enterprise cost optimization and business objectives, especially given the rise of cloud-native and AI-based applications, ISG says. Scores for Contact Center — Customer Experience were close behind, at 80.0, with enterprises increasingly focused on improving CX. Scores were lowest for Payroll/Benefits Administration (71.6) as firms grappled with changes in hiring trends, and for supply chain services (74.5) as organizations still struggle to improve in this area following the COVID-19 crisis. The public sector raised CX scores more than any other industry in 2023, up 9.4 percent, as organizations recognized providers’ ability to comply with policies and regulations, proactively resolve issues and maintain strong cybersecurity, the report says. Public sector scores were highest by a wide margin, followed by manufacturing and financial services. Telecom and media industry clients slashed their average CX scores by 14.3 percent, but providers could improve these by better adapting to external changes and providing agreed-upon resources on time, ISG says. Survey results by region show providers received lower average scores from enterprises in the Americas (77.9) than in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (82.7) or Asia Pacific (78.3). North American enterprises gave relatively high ratings, especially for governance and compliance and collaboration and transparency, but providers have room to improve in Central/South America, especially in helping clients adapt to emerging technologies, ISG says. The report reveals details about trends in these and other areas, including the top technology vendors for CX and subcategories of what enterprises want from providers. ISG will discuss the results of this study and preview its 2024 ISG Star of Excellence Research and Awards program during a webinar tomorrow, Thursday, February 22, at 10 a.m., U.S. Eastern time. Enterprises and providers are invited to register for the webinar by visiting this webpage.

"Governor Lee, Commissioner McWhorter Announce Shoals Technologies Group to Expand Manufacturing and Distribution Operations in Sumner County",2024-02-21T16:00:00.000Z,Moderate,Very Positive,"Shoals Technologies Group to create 550 new jobs in Portland with an $80 million expansion, enhancing solar power capabilities.","Governor Lee, Commissioner McWhorter Announce Shoals Technologies Group to Expand Manufacturing and Distribution Operations in Sumner County Rhea-AI Impact (Moderate) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Shoals Technologies Group to create 550 new jobs in Portland with an $80 million expansion, enhancing solar power capabilities. Positive None. Negative None. Economist The investment of $80 million by Shoals Technologies Group into expanding its operations in Portland, Tennessee, is a significant economic development. The creation of 550 jobs over the next five years is likely to have a multiplier effect on the local economy. As new employees spend their wages, there will be increased demand for goods and services, which can lead to further job creation in other sectors. Additionally, the company's decision to expand within Tennessee, rather than relocating to another state or country, demonstrates confidence in the local workforce and business environment.However, for investors, the long-term impact on Shoals' financials will depend on how effectively the company can leverage its increased capacity to meet growing customer demand. If the expansion enables Shoals to scale operations and reduce per-unit costs, it could improve profit margins and shareholder value. Conversely, if the expansion leads to operational inefficiencies or if the market for solar power does not grow as anticipated, the investment could strain the company's finances. Market Research Analyst Shoals Technologies Group's expansion highlights the robust growth within the solar, energy storage and eMobility sectors. As a leading EBOS provider, Shoals is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on the increasing global shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles. The choice of expanding manufacturing capabilities indicates a proactive approach to address supply chain challenges and meet rising demand.For stakeholders, the key question is whether Shoals can translate this increased capacity into a competitive advantage. The ability to rapidly scale production and distribute products can be a critical factor in winning large contracts and establishing long-term customer relationships. Investors should monitor the company's operational efficiency metrics and customer acquisition rates post-expansion to gauge the success of this strategic move. Environmental Policy Analyst The expansion of Shoals Technologies Group aligns with broader environmental and policy trends promoting renewable energy and decarbonization. As governments and corporations commit to sustainability goals, the demand for solar and energy storage solutions is expected to grow. This expansion could position Shoals as a key player in supporting these initiatives.From a policy perspective, the investment in renewable energy infrastructure can be seen as a response to incentives and regulatory frameworks designed to encourage clean energy development. It's also indicative of a favorable policy environment in Tennessee that supports green industry growth. The long-term implications of this expansion may include increased influence in policy discussions and potential for partnership on future clean energy initiatives. 02/21/2024 - 11:00 AM Leading EBOS provider for solar, energy storage and eMobility to create approximately 550 new jobs in Portland with multi-million dollar expansion NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tennessee Gov.

The Company's maintains a focus on exploration for high value battery metals required for the electric vehicle (EV) market.About the Nevada North Lithium ProjectThe Company owns the Nevada North Lithium Project located in the Granite Range southeast of Jackpot, Nevada about 73 km north-northeast of Wells, Elko County, Nevada. The first round of drilling, completed in October 2022, identified a strongly mineralized zone of lithium bearing clays occupying a strike length of almost 1,620 meters. Widths of the mineralized horizons are at least 400 meters, supported by highly anomalous soil values indicating potential for the clay horizons to be much greater in extent. The potential for a significant lithium deposit can be illustrated by the average lithium content within all near surface clay zones intersected in 2022 drilling, applying a 1000 ppm cut-off, was 3254 ppm.Initial assay results from the first hole of the 2023 season (NN2301) had a high of 8070 ppm lithium with an average of 4,067 ppm lithium at a 1,000-ppm cut-off (See news release September 12, 2023). The 2023 drill program expanded the known lithium-rich clay from the current 1,620 meters strike length to more than 3,500 meters and the known width of the mineralization to 950 meters from the previously drill-indicated 400 meters. The 2023 drill program is now completed with all assays received.

The initiative aims to improve milk production and quality through technology.","Modernizing Dairy Farming in India Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Very Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) partners with ISAP India Foundation to modernize dairy farming in Antargaon, Maharashtra. The initiative aims to improve milk production and quality through technology. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst Rockwell Automation's partnership with ISAP India Foundation represents a strategic move into the agritech sector, specifically focusing on dairy farming modernization in India. This initiative could potentially disrupt the traditional dairy farming practices in the region, which may lead to increased efficiency and higher yields. As India is a significant player in global milk production, any advancements in this sector could have a ripple effect on worldwide dairy supply chains.From a market perspective, Rockwell Automation's venture into agritech through CSR projects can enhance its brand image and corporate reputation, potentially leading to improved investor sentiment. Moreover, such initiatives might open up new revenue streams if the technology proves commercially viable and scalable. However, it's crucial to monitor the execution of this initiative and its actual impact on local dairy yields and quality, as these factors will ultimately determine its success and potential market implications. Sustainability Analyst Addressing water scarcity while promoting economic and social development through technology aligns with global sustainability goals. Rockwell Automation's initiative in Antargaon could serve as a model for sustainable development in other water-stressed regions. By leveraging technology to enhance dairy farming efficiency, the project may contribute to the conservation of water resources, which is a critical environmental concern.The long-term benefits of such a CSR initiative could include strengthened community relationships and a positive impact on the company's sustainability metrics. Investors are increasingly considering environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when making decisions and Rockwell Automation's project could positively influence ESG ratings. However, the actual environmental impact of the project and its ability to be replicated in other regions should be carefully evaluated. Agricultural Technology Expert The collaboration with eVerse.AI to implement technology in dairy farming could introduce innovative solutions such as precision agriculture, IoT for livestock management and data analytics for yield optimization. These technologies have the potential to transform the antiquated practices prevalent in the region by enhancing milk production efficiency and product quality. Furthermore, it could lead to the development of new agricultural technologies suitable for the unique challenges of Indian dairy farming.It is important to understand how these technologies will be adapted to local conditions and whether the farmers will receive adequate training and support. The scalability of such technology in a decentralized farming structure and its adoption rate among local farmers are critical factors that will determine the project's overall impact on the industry. 02/21/2024 - 10:15 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) has partnered with ISAP India Foundation to modernize dairy farming in the water-scarce region of Antargaon in Wardha District, Maharashtra.The initiative - ""Economic and Social Development of Indian Village Through Technology-Enabled Dairy Farming"" - also involved collaboration with technology implementation partner eVerse.AI to implement the corporate social responsibility (CSR) project.India has the world's largest bovine population and is a leader in milk production. However, it faces challenges such as low milk-yield per animal and insufficient quality of milk products. The decentralized structure of dairy farming in India and limited awareness about scientific veterinary practices among rural farmers contribute to these issues.By partnering with ISAP India Foundation - a not-for-profit agency engaged in leading national-level livelihood promotion and agriculture marketing consultancy - Rockwell aims to improve livelihoods of dairy farmers in one of the most water-scarce areas of India by using innovative products and services that leverage digital technologies for livestock development through scientifically-proven veterinary practices.The initiative provides a suite of services to dairy farmers, including:Supplying Internet of Things (IoT) enabled collar devices for tracking vital health parameters of dairy animals;Providing mobile phone-based alerts and advice to farmers from veterinary experts;Use of muzzle-based biometric identification system to provide digital identity to animals along with 12-digit Pashu Aadhar;Use of eVerse.AI's newly launched CowGPT platform to provide accurate insights and advisory to dairy farmers about animal health, ration balancing advisory services, fodder development activities, supply of quality animal feed, village level animal health services, dairy farming extension programs (training, demos, expert visits), market integration activities for milk sale, and the creation of additional revenue sources for families of dairy farmers utilizing animal waste products.The project, which began in May 2023, has already yielded promising results. In a recent field visit to Antargaon, progress was shared with local dairy farmers through an interactive session. Farmers expressed positive feedback, citing a 15-20% increase in milk production within the last six months. Milk quality has also improved, helping them to achieve higher prices and increasing household income.""We are thrilled that our CSR project at Antargaon, Maharashtra, is already showing early signs of success and providing tangible benefits to local farmers, and augmenting their incomes,"" said Dilip Sawhney, managing director, Rockwell Automation India. ""We are confident that this project will continue to help the people of Antargaon to benefit from the technology-enabled scientific management of the health and reproductive cycles of their farm animals.

The reported 80% reduction in response time to social media inquiries is not just an operational improvement; it's a significant competitive advantage in the hospitality industry. In today's digital age, rapid response is closely tied to customer satisfaction and retention. The ability to prioritize and swiftly handle guest recovery cases across various communication channels can lead to improved customer loyalty and potentially increase repeat business, which is a key driver for revenue growth.Moreover, the integration of Google Reviews into the guest recovery process is a proactive approach to managing online reputation, a factor that is critically influential in consumer decision-making. The real-time tracking of guest data and feedback can provide actionable insights for Dine Brands, enabling the company to refine its services and offerings. This data-driven strategy can also inform targeted marketing campaigns, menu adjustments and operational improvements, ultimately contributing to the company's top and bottom lines. Customer Experience Expert Enhancing the guest experience through technological innovation, as Dine Brands has done with Emplifi, aligns with the increasing consumer demand for immediate and personalized service. The expectation of a one-hour response window highlighted in the Harris Interactive research underscores the urgency with which brands must engage with customers. By meeting and exceeding these expectations, Dine Brands is likely to see an uptick in customer satisfaction scores, which can influence the overall brand perception and increase customer lifetime value.The ability to consolidate guest interactions and reviews into a single, measurable workflow allows for a more cohesive understanding of the guest journey. This holistic view can empower franchisees with the knowledge to make informed decisions that resonate with their customer base. The strategic focus on the customer experience is not merely a short-term fix but a long-term investment in building a resilient and adaptable brand that can thrive in a rapidly evolving consumer landscape.

(NYSE: DIN), the parent company of Applebee’s Neighborhood Grill + Bar®, IHOP®, and Fuzzy’s Taco Shop® restaurants. After managing messages from guests directly in the Facebook app – without the ability to respond, monitor, or measure guest interactions from a single dashboard – Dine Brands’ Guest Relations team required more streamlined and integrated guest recovery capabilities. Dine Brands was already using Emplifi Agent, a customer service engagement CRM, before they seamlessly integrated Emplifi’s social media management features into their workflow. Within a few weeks of deploying these features, Dine Brands saw immediate improvements across its social media guest recovery efforts. The Guest Relations team reduced the time spent handling social cases from five minutes to sixty seconds or less – an astounding 80% cut in time spent answering guest inquiries. In addition to faster response times, Dine Brands was able to: Prioritize social media guest recovery cases every day of the week, exactly as they do for other case scenarios on email, phone support lines, and other communication channels. Curate and measure impactful data from their social recovery workflows by tracking guest data in real-time. Support the unique needs of their restaurants, ensuring guest feedback is heard and shared back to franchisees quickly. Integrate Google Reviews into their social media guest recovery processes, including the ability to respond to any guest reviews that come through the Google Review platform. “From integrating Emplifi’s social media management features into our suite of tools to working with our wonderful Customer Success Manager, Emplifi has made life a lot easier,” said Alex Bresette, Director of Guest Relations at Dine Brands. “The technology has proven to be extremely valuable to our overarching guest recovery strategies.” Research conducted by Harris Interactive and commissioned by Emplifi shows that more than 52% of consumers – or, in Dine Brands’ case, guests – expect brands to respond to customer inquiries within an hour, but 20% of customers say they typically have to wait 24 hours before getting a response. The gap in customer expectations and brand response times not only negatively impacts the customer experience, but can jeopardize critical outcomes, including customer loyalty efforts and revenue gains. Dine Brands is well-positioned to exceed their guests’ expectations and vastly improve the guest experience — as well as internal processes and workflows. “Today’s most successful brands are the ones that have been able to remove the silos between their marketing, customer care, and commerce efforts. Dine Brands is a perfect example of a company that understands this paradigm at an in-depth level,” said Zarnaz Arlia, CMO, Emplifi. “Brands need tools that easily integrate and come equipped with intuitive dashboards so that they can manage customer communications from a single platform without having to navigate between multiple social channels. Dine Brands has achieved this — faster response times combined with valuable guest insights — making it clear just how important social media platforms are to customer service initiatives.” About Emplifi Emplifi is a leading unified customer engagement platform that empowers businesses to reach and grow communities through digital- and social-first strategies.

The most generous limit on DentalInsurance.com was $10,000, while the lowest was $500. The surge in sales was attributed to the strategic decision to offer more plans with high maximum benefits to counter rising inflation post-COVID. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The substantial increase in annual sales (122 percent) of high maximum benefit dental plans reported by DentalInsurance.com suggests a significant shift in consumer preferences and market dynamics within the dental insurance industry. This trend may reflect a broader consumer response to increasing healthcare costs, particularly in the wake of inflationary pressures post-COVID. The data indicating that 40 percent of core sales were plans with high maximums in the third quarter of 2023 highlights a strategic pivot by the company to capitalize on this demand, which could potentially influence competitors to follow suit and offer similar high-benefit plans.Analysis of the market share and consumer behavior could provide insights into the potential for sustained growth within this segment. The mention of top brands like MetLife, Cigna and Humana offering high maximum dental plans through DentalInsurance.com also underscores the importance of brand partnerships in driving sales and expanding market reach. This trend might indicate a growing niche for premium dental insurance products, which could have implications for the profitability and stock performance of these insurance providers. Financial Analyst The reported 122 percent year-over-year growth in sales of high maximum benefit dental plans is a robust indicator of DentalInsurance.com's financial health and operational success. This performance metric may positively influence investor sentiment and the company's valuation due to the direct impact on revenue streams. The diversification of product offerings, specifically targeting higher-end insurance plans, aligns with a strategy to increase average order value and customer lifetime value.Investors and stakeholders should consider the implications of this growth on future earnings potential. The strategic focus on high maximum benefit plans could lead to increased average premiums and potentially higher profit margins. However, it is also vital to assess the risk of increased claims associated with higher coverage limits. The financial stability and claim-paying ability of the partnered insurance providers like MetLife, Cigna and Humana will be crucial in sustaining this growth trajectory without adversely affecting loss ratios. Healthcare Policy Expert The increase in sales of high maximum benefit dental plans reflects a potential shift in healthcare policy and consumer protection sentiment. As out-of-pocket healthcare costs rise, there is a growing demand for insurance products that offer more comprehensive coverage. This trend could lead to policy discussions around the adequacy of coverage limits and the role of insurance in mitigating the financial impact of healthcare inflation on consumers.Understanding the implications of these high maximum benefit plans on access to dental care is essential. While they may provide better protection against high costs, they could also contribute to the rising cost of care if they lead to increased utilization of services. It is important to balance the need for comprehensive coverage with cost containment measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system. Stakeholders, including policymakers and insurance providers, must consider these factors when designing and regulating insurance products. 02/21/2024 - 10:07 AM LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- DentalInsurance.com, the leader in dental insurance comparison shopping, announced today that their annual sales of high maximum benefit dental plans rose 122 percent in 2023 as compared to 2022. The data was based on core business sales comprising purchases coming from organic search engine traffic, search engine marketing, and affiliate advertising. A maximum benefit is the annual limit on insurance company spending toward a consumer's covered dental care. Both preferred provider organizations (PPO) and indemnity plans have maximum benefit limits, and these plans make up over nine-out-of-ten plans sold in the private dental insurance market. In 2023, the average maximum benefit observed across DentalInsurance.com products was $1,893 (when considering all PPO and indemnity plans across the fifty states and Washington D.C.). A high maximum benefit is an annual limit of at least $2,500 (which is 32 percent above the observed national average). The most generous limit among high maximum plans on DentalInsurance.com was $10,000, while the lowest among regular PPO and indemnity plans was $500. ""Soon after COVID hit, inflation began to spike in consumer goods,"" commented DentalInsurance.com President Avery Smith. ""We knew it was only a matter of time before dentists had to raise their prices. To protect consumers from large out-of-pocket costs, DentalInsurance.com made a strategic decision to offer more plans with high maximum benefits. The approach has proven hugely popular with consumers. In the third quarter of 2023, 40 percent of our core sales were dental plans with high maximums.""

The award highlights CSG's platform stability and performance crucial for over 114,000 merchants. TSG's Global Experience Monitoring platform validates CSG's top position based on real-world data and experiences. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst CSG Forte's recognition by TSG for having the 'Lowest Minute Outage' in North America is a significant indicator of the company's reliability and efficiency in payment processing. This accolade can enhance CSG Forte's brand reputation, potentially increasing its market share in the digital payments sector. Payment gateways are a critical component of e-commerce and with the increasing volume of online transactions, a gateway's stability becomes a major factor for merchants when selecting a provider.From a market perspective, this award could signal to potential and current clients that CSG Forte is a trustworthy partner, which may lead to increased customer retention and acquisition. Furthermore, as the digital payments industry is highly competitive, such recognition could provide a competitive edge over others in the market. It is essential to monitor if this award will translate into tangible business growth in subsequent financial quarters. Financial Analyst The award for 'Lowest Minute Outage' could be a precursor to financial growth for CSG Forte. As a key performance indicator, platform stability is directly correlated to user experience and can influence merchant and consumer confidence. This confidence, in turn, affects transaction volumes and revenue streams. Investors should look for any positive changes in CSG's financial metrics in the aftermath of this award, such as an increase in the number of merchants using their platform or an uptick in processed transaction volumes.It's also noteworthy that operational excellence in payment gateways can lead to cost efficiencies. Fewer outages mean less downtime and potentially lower operational costs related to customer service and technical support. This operational leverage could improve profit margins and, ultimately, shareholder value. Cybersecurity Expert While the award focuses on the operational aspect of CSG Forte's gateway, it's crucial to consider the cybersecurity implications. A stable and reliable payment gateway is less likely to suffer from breaches or downtime due to cyber-attacks, which can be costly in terms of both finances and customer trust. A platform that can demonstrate robust security measures alongside its operational stability is well-positioned to gain market confidence.CSG Forte's commitment to reducing risk and fraud, as highlighted in their cloud-based payments platform, is a vital component of their offering.

As announced by PharmaDrug on February 14, 2024, the technical transfer and development activities for PD-001 are completed and successfully demonstrated the ability to manufacture clinical GMP manufacturing batches of PD-001 to support future filings to Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in the United States. Manufacturing of product for clinical studies is scheduled for the second quarter of 2024. Sairiyo has commenced working on a regulatory application to the TGA for its proposed Phase 1 study in Australia. Fabio Chianelli, CEO and Chairman of PharmaTher, commented, “We are pleased that our investment in Sairiyo is being unlocked as it approaches its next phase of growth as a clinical-stage company exploring a patented reformulated orally bioavailable version of cepharanthine that has the potential to treat responsive cancers and infectious diseases. We expect to submit the regulatory package to the TGA for a proposed Phase 1 clinical study in Australia in Q2-2024.”About Sairiyo Therapeutics Inc.Sairiyo Therapeutics Inc., which is owned by PharmDrug Inc. (51%) and PharmaTher (49%), is focused on advancing the clinical development of an improved and patented enteric-coated orally bioavailable formulation of cepharanthine (PD-001) to treat responsive cancers and infectious disease, including COVID-19. Cepharanthine is a natural product and an approved drug used for more than 70 years in Japan to successfully treat a variety of acute and chronic diseases. In clinical research, cepharanthine has been shown to exhibit multiple pharmacological properties including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, immuno-regulatory, anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-parasitic effects. However, historically cepharanthine's low oral bioavailability has represented a major obstacle to realizing its full clinical potential. Compared to generic cepharanthine, PD-001 has been shown in rodent and non-rodent models to possess markedly improved oral bioavailability (more easily absorbed). These findings support the development of an orally administered formulation, and in so doing, removes the undesirable requirement for frequent intravenous dosing to maintain therapeutic levels of drug in circulation. Sairiyo endeavours to develop an efficacious oral therapeutic to potentially improve outcomes for infectious disease and oncology applications. About PharmaTher Holdings Ltd. PharmaTher Holdings Ltd. (OTCQB: PHRRF) (CSE: PHRM) is focused on the development and commercialization of KETARX™ (Ketamine) to fill the global unmet medical needs for anesthesia, sedation, pain, mental health, and neurological indications. PharmaTher owns 49% of Sairiyo Therapeutics Inc., which focuses on advancing the clinical development of an improved and patented enteric-coated orally bioavailable formulation of cepharanthine (PD-001) to treat responsive cancers and infectious diseases, including COVID-19.

If approved, Mullen can sell these vans to all branches of the U.S. government. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The pending determination by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) regarding Mullen Automotive's Class 1 EV cargo vans has significant market implications. If the ruling is favorable, Mullen would gain immediate access to a substantial customer base within the U.S. government. This could potentially lead to a surge in demand for their EV cargo vans, providing a new revenue stream and possibly improving the company's competitive positioning in the EV market.Government contracts are known for their large scale and long-term stability, which could translate into predictable and recurring revenue for Mullen. This would be a substantial development for a company in the emerging EV space, where capital and scale are critical. The prospect of such contracts could also affect investor sentiment positively, potentially leading to an uptick in stock valuation. Financial Analyst A favorable CBP ruling for Mullen Automotive could have a tangible impact on the company's financials. Access to government contracts could lead to increased production volume, which in turn could drive down unit costs through economies of scale. This cost advantage could improve margins and profitability in the long term.However, investors should be cautious and consider the company's current financial health, production capacity and ability to scale operations to meet potential government demand. Additionally, the market will be looking at how Mullen's supply chain and manufacturing capabilities stack up against established competitors who may already have a foothold in government contracts. Legal Expert The legal intricacies of CBP rulings involve compliance with numerous trade and customs regulations. A favorable ruling would not only indicate that Mullen's Class 1 EV cargo vans meet these stringent requirements but also set a precedent for future product classifications and rulings. This could streamline Mullen's ability to bring new products to market, especially in the highly regulated government sector.Moreover, the legal certainty provided by a positive ruling could reduce the regulatory risk profile of the company. It is important for investors to understand that while the ruling is pending, there remains an element of uncertainty which can be a risk factor for the company's stock performance. 02/21/2024 - 09:30 AM CBP informed counsel on Feb. 20, 2024, that a final determination on the ruling request is now expected within one to two monthsBREA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN -- Mullen Automotive Inc.

The split will reduce issued shares from 93,679,260 to approximately 1,561,321, with no shareholder vote required.","Lytus Technologies Holdings PTV. Ltd. announces 1 for 60 Reverse Stock Split Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags stock split Rhea-AI Summary Lytus Technologies Holdings PTV. Ltd. (Nasdaq:LYT) announces a 1-for-60 reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules. The split will reduce issued shares from 93,679,260 to approximately 1,561,321, with no shareholder vote required. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of a reverse stock split by Lytus Technologies Holdings is a strategic financial maneuver aimed at addressing the company's non-compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. By consolidating shares at a 1-for-60 ratio, the company effectively increases its share price, bringing it closer to meeting the $1.00 per share threshold. This is a common tactic employed by public companies facing delisting threats due to share price depreciation.From an investor's perspective, the reverse split does not inherently add value as the market capitalization remains the same; however, it often leads to improved market perception by aligning the stock price with those of peer companies. For current shareholders, the adjustment means that for every 60 shares owned, they will now hold a single share. The provision of whole shares in lieu of fractional shares could result in a slight increase in the shareholder's percentage of ownership, albeit negligible.It is important to monitor the stock's performance post-split, as the market can react variably to such actions. In some cases, the higher per-share price can improve liquidity and attract institutional investors, while in others, it may be viewed as a cosmetic change that does not address underlying financial health issues. Market Research Analyst Reverse stock splits are often met with mixed reactions in the market. Historical data suggests that the market's response can be contingent on the reasons behind the split and the company's overall strategic direction. For Lytus Technologies Holdings, the explicit goal is to maintain Nasdaq listing, which can be seen as a defensive move rather than one driven by growth or operational improvements.Analysts typically scrutinize such actions to determine if they are part of a broader turnaround strategy. The market will likely assess Lytus's future prospects, including revenue growth, profitability and sector performance. In the context of the technology services industry, where investor confidence is paramount, the company's ability to articulate a clear vision post-reverse split will be critical in maintaining investor support.Additionally, the timing and communication of the reverse split are essential. By not requiring a shareholder vote, Lytus Technologies Holdings expedites the process, which may be seen as a positive by investors eager for swift resolution to compliance issues. However, the lack of direct shareholder involvement could also be perceived as a top-down decision-making approach, which might not always resonate well with the investment community. Legal Expert The legal implications of a reverse stock split such as the one announced by Lytus Technologies Holdings are multifaceted. The company has opted for a non-shareholder vote approach, which is permissible under certain jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands where the company is registered. This method streamlines the process but also bypasses direct shareholder input, which could raise questions about corporate governance practices.In terms of regulatory compliance, the reverse stock split is a tool to ensure that the company meets Nasdaq's listing requirements. Failing to comply with these requirements can lead to delisting, which would have significant repercussions for the company's ability to raise capital and for shareholders' liquidity. The legal steps involve filing amendments with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs, which is a standard procedure in such corporate actions.For shareholders, especially those holding certificated shares, the legal process of exchanging stock certificates will be handled by Vstock Transfer, which should be a straightforward process. The company's clear communication on this matter is crucial to avoid any legal complications or shareholder confusion. 02/21/2024 - 09:19 AM Dubai, UAE, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lytus Technologies Holdings PTV. Ltd. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:LYT), a leading global technology-driven services company, today announced that on February 5th, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reverse stock split (the “Reverse Split”) of its authorized, issued and outstanding ordinary shares, par value $0.01 per share, at a ratio of 1-for-60 so that every 60 shares currently authorized and issued is combined into one (1) share. Shareholders otherwise entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Split will receive a whole share in lieu of such factional share. In connection with the Reverse Split, a vote of the shareholders of the Company is not required and as such, no shareholder vote or meeting of shareholders will be held. The Reverse Split will be effected by filing amendments with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the British Virgin Islands. The Company intends to file the amendments with the Registrar of Corporate Affairs of the British Virgin Islands on February 22nd, 2024, and it is anticipated that the ordinary shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens on February 23rd, 2024. The Company is effecting the Reverse Split in order to maintain its listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”).

When an Ounce of Prevention Can Be Worth a Lifetime of Cure,2024-02-21T14:15:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,"Aflac Incorporated's CEO, Dan Amos, emphasizes the importance of preventive care and early detection in managing health risks and reducing costs.

The company's claims volume is returning to pre-pandemic levels as Americans prioritize their health post-pandemic. Positive None. Negative None. Healthcare Policy Analyst Insurance companies like Aflac play a pivotal role in shaping healthcare outcomes by influencing policyholder behavior. The emphasis on preventive care, as highlighted in the recent statement, underscores a strategic shift towards proactive health management. This shift aligns with broader industry trends where insurers are increasingly investing in wellness programs that encourage regular check-ups and screenings. Such initiatives can lead to a decrease in long-term healthcare costs by catching illnesses early, which ultimately benefits both the consumer and the insurer financially.However, the impact on the insurer's financials can be nuanced. In the short term, increased preventive care can lead to higher claims volume as more policyholders utilize their insurance benefits for routine care. Over time, though, the potential reduction in the severity and frequency of claims due to early detection and treatment of diseases could lead to a more favorable claims experience for the insurer. This could result in improved profit margins and potentially lower premiums for policyholders, fostering a competitive advantage in the market. Financial Analyst The return to pre-pandemic levels of claims volume is a significant indicator of normalization for Aflac's operations. For investors, this normalization suggests stability in core business activities. It's important to monitor how this trend affects the company's loss ratio, which is the percentage of premiums paid out as claims. A balance must be struck between the increased cost of claims due to preventive care and the potential long-term savings from reduced catastrophic claims.Furthermore, the emphasis on preventive care could also serve as a differentiator in the insurance market, potentially attracting a more health-conscious customer base. This demographic could be associated with lower risk profiles, which might lead to more favorable underwriting results. Investors should thus examine the company's underwriting practices and customer acquisition strategies to assess the potential for sustained growth and profitability. Economist From an economic perspective, the insurance sector's focus on preventive healthcare has broader implications for the economy. Early detection and treatment of diseases can lead to a healthier workforce, which in turn can boost productivity and reduce absenteeism. This has the potential to exert a positive effect on the gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, by potentially lowering the overall healthcare expenditure, there could be a reduction in the financial burden on both public and private sectors.The long-term economic benefits of a healthy population are substantial, including potentially lower healthcare costs, increased lifespan and a reduction in the incidence of chronic conditions that can drain economic resources. Stakeholders, including policymakers and healthcare providers, may find these insights valuable as they consider the interplay between healthcare practices and economic outcomes. 02/21/2024 - 09:15 AM NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 21, 2024 / Aflac IncorporatedOriginally published on the Aflac NewsroomBy Dan Amos, Chairman, CEO, and President, Aflac IncorporatedA few years ago, a friend told me his wife had been feeling out of sorts. She didn't know why, but because of the pandemic she hadn't been going to her regularly scheduled checkups. When she finally went, the news wasn't good. Stage 3 cancer.Dan Amos, Chairman, CEO, and President, Aflac Incorporated. Thankfully, she continues to improve, but sadly, her story isn't unique. Research shows that millions of Americans neglected their personal health during the pandemic,1 and while too many still are, I am pleased that our claims volume continues to return to pre-pandemic levels. We want to pay claims, and here's why.As an insurance company, managing risk is what we do. For policyholders, we see part of managing risk to mean that they will take more charge of their personal health care needs. That's because we know that preventive care, like routine checkups and prescribed screenings, helps save lives, and as stewards of our customers' health and financial security, we are obligated to encourage this behavior through our policy offerings and our words.Proactive care ought to be important to everyone, as not only can an ounce of prevention be worth a lifetime of cure, in the long run, early detection can help reduce costs to consumers2 and insurers and reduce stress on the overall economy.3 After all, the least expensive medical challenge is the one that never happens or the one that is treated before it becomes catastrophic.In 2024, our goal is to impress upon people that the time to prepare is now. Think about it - would you wait for a hurricane to happen before weatherproofing your house? Of course not. Instead, you would install storm shutters, secure loose items in the yard and, yes, purchase insurance that will cover your property in the event of significant damage. We should do the same with our health care.The American Cancer Society recently released its 2024 statistics. Some of the news is good. Death rates from cancer are declining due to, you guessed it, early detection and improvements in treatment protocols.We urge people, regardless of life stage, to review the cancer warning signals, none of which would mean you have cancer, but could serve as incentive to see your doctor.4 Young people should develop good health habits, particularly as advancements like telemedicine have made it easier than ever to have a routine examination.Of course, we believe Aflac is the preferred choice for individuals seeking the financial protection provided by supplemental health insurance, but our concern goes much deeper than that. We simply don't want families to go through what my friend's wife endured, when it could be avoided.Dan Amos is Chairman, CEO and President of Aflac Incorporated.

The new options, including Cboe MSCI World Index Options, Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options, and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options, are set to launch on March 18.

Market Research Analyst The expansion of Cboe's product suite through the introduction of three new options tied to MSCI's benchmark indices represents a strategic move to cater to the evolving needs of investors seeking diversified international exposure. The inclusion of these options broadens the spectrum of investment products available, potentially attracting a wider clientele interested in hedging or speculating on international markets. The introduction of products with smaller index values, such as MXWLD and MXUSA, may particularly appeal to retail investors and smaller asset managers due to their increased affordability and accessibility.From a market research perspective, the demand for such instruments typically correlates with the global economic climate and the volatility of international markets. As investors look for tools to manage risk in a cost-effective manner, the new Cboe MSCI Volatility Indices, which apply the VIX methodology to international markets, could become a benchmark for measuring market sentiment and implied volatility in these regions. This innovation could enhance the attractiveness of Cboe's offerings and potentially increase trading volumes and revenue for the exchange. Financial Analyst Financially, the launch of new index options and volatility indices may have several implications for Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and its stakeholders. For one, the diversification of products could lead to an increase in trading activity, as these options provide investors with additional avenues to gain exposure to international, developed, emerging and U.S. markets. This could result in higher transaction fees and revenue growth for Cboe. Furthermore, the fractional index options could lower the barrier to entry for smaller investors, thereby potentially expanding Cboe's customer base and market share.It is important to note, however, that the success of these new offerings will depend on various factors, including market reception, competitive dynamics and the broader economic environment. The ability of these products to generate significant volume and liquidity will be critical in determining their impact on Cboe's financial performance. Additionally, the regulatory approval process is a key variable that could influence the timeline and success of these product launches. Legal Expert Regulatory approval is a pivotal aspect of introducing new financial instruments to the market. The pending regulatory approval for the new Cboe MSCI Index options and volatility indices indicates that these products must comply with stringent regulatory standards to ensure they operate within the legal framework of financial markets. The regulatory scrutiny will likely focus on the transparency, fairness and systemic risk implications of these new products.Moreover, the European-style exercise and cash-settlement of these options highlight the legal and operational considerations taken into account to streamline the settlement process and minimize legal complexities associated with physical delivery. The tax treatment of these instruments is another legal aspect that could influence investor interest and participation in these markets. Should these products receive favorable tax treatment, it could enhance their appeal to investors seeking tax-efficient investment strategies. 02/21/2024 - 09:24 AM Latest initiative represents Cboe and MSCI's growing relationship and will expand Cboe's current product suiteCboe plans to offer three new options tied to MSCI's international, developed, emerging and U.S. markets benchmark indices, set to launch on March 18, pending regulatory approvalCboe also introduces two new volatility indices based on existing MSCI Index options and the proprietary VIX Index MethodologyCHICAGO, Feb. 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced a new strategic initiative in collaboration with MSCI Inc. (MSCI), a leading provider of critical decision support tools and services for the global investment community, to expand its suite of Cboe-MSCI Index options and volatility indices. The initiative underscores Cboe and MSCI's deepening relationship and continues to leverage the companies' combined expertise to develop innovative solutions for investors worldwide. Cboe and MSCI have collaborated successfully for many years to offer a variety of indices and tradable products. In this latest initiative, Cboe will further expand its existing MSCI Index options suite by introducing three new products based on additional MSCI global indices: Cboe MSCI World Index Options (MXWLD), Cboe MSCI ACWI Index Options (MXACW), and Cboe MSCI USA Index Options (MXUSA). These options are set to begin trading on Monday, March 18, pending regulatory approval. In addition, Cboe is broadening its volatility index suite with the launch of two new Cboe MSCI Volatility Indices: the Cboe MSCI EAFE Volatility Index (VXMXEA) and the Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Volatility Index (VXMXEF). Developed using Cboe's proprietary VIX® Index methodology, these indices are based on existing MSCI EAFE Index Options (MXEA) and MSCI Emerging Markets Index Options (MXEF) and are designed to provide a transparent measure of the market's expectation of 30-day implied volatility by these respective MSCI index option classes. Similar to the VIX Index, which is designed to reflect investors' consensus view of future (30-day) expected U.S. stock market volatility, the new Cboe MSCI Volatility Indices aim to provide comparable measures for international and emerging equity market volatility. ""In today's rapidly evolving landscape, investors require sophisticated tools to navigate the markets with confidence,"" said Catherine Clay, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. ""Our ongoing collaboration with MSCI reflects our shared commitment to fostering innovation and providing solutions that empower investors to better manage risk and seize potential opportunities in the global marketplace. We are excited to expand our Cboe-MSCI toolkit with additional index options and volatility indices – an enhancement that will not only broaden our customers' product choice, but also enrich the ways they interact with and analyze the global markets."" Clay added, ""Crucially, the three new index options, which cover developed and emerging markets, are expected to also give investors comprehensive access to gain a variety of different exposures around the globe."" The new options will be based on the MSCI World Index, the MSCI ACWI Index and the MSCI USA Index, which are renowned benchmarks for measuring international, developed and emerging markets and U.S. equity performance, respectively. Significantly, both MXWLD and MXUSA options will be based on a fraction (1/100th) of the value of their underlying index. With a smaller index value, MXWLD and MXUSA options may be more accessible to a broad base of customers with diverse investment objectives, ranging from asset owners aiming to track benchmark index exposure, registered investment advisers in search of new sources of yield, or individual investors seeking straightforward exposure to options linked to global benchmark indices. ""We are pleased to expand our strategic relationship with Cboe in new offerings that investors around the world can use to help them manage risk and exposure,"" said George Harrington, Global Head of Derivatives Licensing at MSCI. ""The launch of the Cboe MSCI EAFE Volatility Index (VXMXEA) and Cboe MSCI Emerging Markets Volatility Index (VXMXEF) provides the investment community with benchmarks for option investing, and Cboe's launch of options linked to the MSCI World Index, MSCI ACWI Index and MSCI USA Index further develops the ecosystem of tradable products."" MXACW, MXUSA, and MXWLD will have standard options that expire on the third Friday of each month. In response to customer feedback, Cboe plans to also list five end-of-week expirations, which are expected to begin trading on March 21, 2024, pending regulatory approval.

The technical knowledge and soft skills I've gained through this program elevated my job performance and positioned me well for career advancement here at Medtronic,"" said Candi.We know that degree requirements can be a barrier to talented candidates, including ethnically diverse groups and veterans, when it comes to advancing their careers. Candi is among the first group of MAPS graduates and obtained her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 2023. Her story is just one of many that have emerged from MAPS, which has helped hundreds of Medtronic employees pursue their academic goals and advance in their careers by removing barriers to education.The best part of her experience? ""My 11-year-old daughter wants to be a software engineer and my teenage son wants to design lifesaving equipment for first responders,"" she said.

The report emphasizes the role of service providers in driving digital transformation and creating value through innovative solutions. Key technologies such as AI, IoT, AR, and VR are being leveraged to enhance customer experiences and improve efficiency. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The emphasis on digital innovation in Brazil, as highlighted by the ISG report, signifies a substantial shift towards integrating modern technologies in the country's core economic sectors. This shift is not just a trend but a strategic move that could redefine competitive dynamics within the Brazilian market. For investors, this suggests potential growth areas, especially in tech-related sectors and could signal upcoming investment opportunities in companies that are at the forefront of Brazil's digital transformation.Furthermore, the focus on sustainable and inclusive development aligns with global ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) investment trends. Providers that are capable of delivering digital solutions that also cater to these ESG criteria may attract attention from socially responsible investors. The report's identification of leaders in digital innovation services can serve as a guide for investors looking to allocate funds in companies that are likely to benefit from this digital push. Technology Analyst The integration of cutting-edge technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and advanced data analysis in Brazil's digital transformation efforts is poised to increase operational efficiencies and foster service differentiation. For businesses, this translates into enhanced capabilities to meet consumer expectations through personalized experiences, which can lead to increased customer loyalty and potentially higher revenue streams.Extended Reality (XR) services are particularly noteworthy as they offer immersive experiences that could revolutionize sectors like retail, education and entertainment. The reference to 'Leaders' in these technologies suggests that these companies are at the innovation frontier, potentially offering investors high-growth prospects. The mention of 'Rising Stars' also indicates that there are emerging players with significant potential, which could be attractive for investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Sustainability Analyst The report's focus on sustainable value creation within digital innovation initiatives is crucial, as it reflects a broader trend where technology intersects with sustainability. Companies that incorporate social and environmental responsibility into their business models are increasingly favored by consumers and investors alike. This trend is likely to continue, with the potential for regulatory tailwinds as governments worldwide push for more sustainable business practices.For stakeholders, the long-term implications are significant. Companies that are able to leverage digital innovation while maintaining a commitment to sustainability could see enhanced brand reputation and customer loyalty, as well as potential benefits from government incentives aimed at promoting sustainable development. The ability of service providers to adapt to specific needs while operating responsibly can be a differentiating factor that adds to their competitive advantage. 02/21/2024 - 09:24 AM Digital innovation is poised to transform Brazil by creating or improving products, processes, business models and user experiences, ISG Provider Lens™ report says SÃO PAULO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Digital innovation is attracting immense attention from Brazil’s private and public sectors as the country seeks to use modern technologies to change processes, products and services in various sectors of the economy and society, according to a new research report published today by Information Services Group (ISG) (Nasdaq: III), a leading global technology research and advisory firm.

The Brazilian government has supported this progress by favoring sustainable and inclusive economic and social development via digital technologies, the ISG report says. “Service providers are playing a pivotal role in Brazil’s digital transformation by offering brand- and value-oriented strategies,” said Shafqat Azim, ISG partner and Americas lead, Digital Transformation. “They are designing effective alternatives that offer speed, innovation and an emphasis on purpose.” Local providers have established centers of excellence (CoEs) that create future value for companies by reimagining, restructuring and renewing business functions, the ISG report says. These providers are choosing partners that share similar values and objectives and are able to collaborate through agile, cross-functional teams to deliver digital solutions with speed and quality, the report says. According to the ISG report, the best-performing providers interconnect people, processes and cutting-edge technologies. They understand and evaluate the business through data analysis, co-create design and propose recurring innovation strategies that deliver tangible results. Top providers also have a firm grasp on consumer expectations, create initiatives relevant to CX and evaluate the best technological solutions to address current problems, the report says. These solutions may incorporate innovative technologies such as AI, machine learning, IoT and advanced data analysis to improve efficiency, personalization and service differentiation, and use augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies to further enhance customer experience, ISG says. “Brazilian enterprises are looking for providers that can adapt to their specific needs and expectations and offer personalized and future-oriented approaches,” said Jan Erik Aase, partner and global leader, ISG Provider Lens Research. “The goal is to create sustainable value while operating with a sense of social and environmental responsibility.” The report also examines how providers in Brazil are offering Extended Reality (XR) services that allow users to have immersive and engaging experiences through AR, VR and mixed reality (MR) in virtual environments created using 3D modeling software.

Reports Fourth Quarter and Twelve Months 2023 Financial and Operating Results Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags earnings Rhea-AI Summary STEALTHGAS INC. (NASDAQ: GASS) reported impressive financial results with an all-time record net income of $51.9 million for the twelve-month period, showing a 51% increase compared to last year. The fourth quarter also saw strong profitability with a net income of $8.9 million, reflecting a basic EPS of $0.25. Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The reported all-time record Net Income of $51.9 million, which signifies a 51% increase compared to the previous year, is a robust indicator of STEALTHGAS INC.'s financial health. This performance, especially in the volatile shipping sector, could be attributed to strategic fleet utilization and cost management strategies. The basic earnings per share (EPS) of $1.38 reflect the company's profitability on a per-share basis, which is a critical metric for investors evaluating the company's value and growth potential.Moreover, the strong quarterly net income of $8.9 million, or $0.25 EPS, suggests consistent performance and operational efficiency. Investors should note that shipping companies like STEALTHGAS can be heavily influenced by global trade volumes, charter rates and fuel costs. The reported figures imply that the company has successfully navigated market challenges, which may have positive implications for future dividend payouts and reinvestment opportunities. Market Research Analyst The increased period coverage mentioned in the report likely refers to the company securing more long-term charters, which provides visibility on future revenues and helps mitigate the volatility inherent in the spot market. This strategic move can be attractive to investors as it suggests a stable and predictable cash flow. Given the cyclical nature of the shipping industry, STEALTHGAS INC.'s ability to lock in charters could safeguard against market downturns and position the company favorably against competitors.It's also important to consider the broader context of the LPG market, which has been experiencing growth due to increased demand in emerging markets and the use of LPG as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels. The company's performance may reflect these industry trends and its future prospects could be tied to the global push for cleaner energy sources. Economist From an economic standpoint, the performance of STEALTHGAS INC. provides a microcosmic view of the health of the international shipping industry, particularly the LPG sector. The 51% year-over-year net income growth indicates not only company-specific success but could also suggest that the industry is benefiting from broader economic trends such as increased energy consumption and shifts in global supply chains.Investors should, however, remain cognizant of macroeconomic factors such as fluctuating oil prices, geopolitical tensions and trade policies that could impact the shipping industry. While the company's current financials are strong, these external factors can introduce risks that affect future performance. A diversified portfolio strategy is often recommended in sectors with such external susceptibilities. 02/21/2024 - 09:10 AM ATHENS, Greece, Feb. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- STEALTHGAS INC. (NASDAQ: GASS), a ship-owning company serving the liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sector of the international shipping industry, announced today its unaudited financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2023. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS All-time record Net Income of $51.9 million for the twelve-month period, a 51% increase compared to last year, corresponding to a basic EPS of $1.38. Strong profitability continued for the fourth quarter with Net Income of $8.9 million for the three-month period corresponding to a basic EPS of $0.25. Further increased period coverage.

Fourth Quarter 2023 Results: Revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $34.1 million compared to revenues of $42.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 20%, as the number of our vessels declined from 34 vessels at the end of Q4 2022 to 27 vessels at the end of Q4 2023.Voyage expenses and vessels’ operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were $3.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively, compared to $6.5 million and $14.6 million, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The $3.2 million, or 49%, decrease in voyage expenses was the result of the reduction in spot market days, while the $1.7 million, or 12%, decrease in vessels’ operating expenses was mainly due to the decrease in the average number of owned vessels in our fleet partly offset by extraordinary costs related to one of our vessels.Drydocking costs for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.03 million and $0.6 million, respectively. No vessels were drydocked during the fourth quarter of 2023 while drydocking expenses during the fourth quarter of 2022 mainly relate to the drydocking of two vessels. Management fees for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The change is attributed to the decrease in the average number of owned vessels in our fleet.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. The change is mainly attributed to the increase in stock-based compensation expense.Depreciation for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5.6 million and $6.8 million, respectively, as the number of our vessels declined.Interest and finance costs for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were $2.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The $1.1 million, or 32%, decrease from the same period of last year is mostly due to the reduction in debt outstanding despite increases in variable interest rates as well as profits from closing swap positions due to debt prepayments.Interest income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.0 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The increase is mainly attributed to increases in interest rates over the corresponding period.Equity earnings in joint ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was a gain of $0.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The $0.3 million decrease was mainly due to the drydocking of one of the vessels during the 2023 period.As a result of the above, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company reported net income of $8.9 million, compared to net income of $7.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 an increase of $1.2 million, or 16%. The weighted average number of shares outstanding, basic, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was 35.3 million and 38.0 million, respectively. Earnings per share, basic, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $0.25 compared to earnings per share of $0.20 for the same period of last year.Adjusted net income1 was $10.3 million corresponding to an Adjusted EPS1 of $0.29 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to Adjusted net income of $10.3 million corresponding to an Adjusted EPS of $0.27 for the same period of last year.EBITDA1 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $15.8 million. Reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA1 to Net Income are set forth below.An average of 27.0 vessels were owned by the Company during the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to 34.0 vessels for the same period of 2022. _________________________1 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP set forth later in this release. Twelve Months 2023 Results: Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $143.5 million, a decrease of $9.3 million, or 6%, compared to revenues of $152.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a reduction in the fleet size.Voyage expenses and vessels’ operating expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were $13.2 million and $53.1 million, respectively, compared to $22.2 million and $54.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The $9.0 million, or 41%, decrease in voyage expenses was mainly due to the decrease in spot days. The $1.8 million decrease in vessels’ operating expenses was the result of the decrease in the number of vessels partly offset by inflationary cost pressures and cost overruns particularly in certain cost categories like spares and crew and was more pronounced during the Q1 23’ and less so during Q4 23’.Drydocking costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $2.6 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 mainly related to the completed drydocking of three of the larger handysize vessels, while the costs for the same period of last year related to the drydocking of five vessels.General and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $5.3 million and $3.4 million, respectively. The change is mainly attributed to the increase in stock-based compensation expense.Depreciation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $23.7 million, a $4.1 million decrease from $27.8 million for the same period of last year, due to the decrease in the average number of our vessels.Impairment loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $2.8 million relating to two vessels, for which the Company had entered into separate agreements to sell to third parties - both were delivered to their new owners in January 2024.Impairment loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $3.2 million relating to four vessels, for which the Company had entered into sale agreements and were all delivered to their new owners in a subsequent period.Gain on sale of vessels for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was $7.6 million, which was primarily due to the sale of seven of the Company’s vessels, whereas loss on sale of vessels for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 was $0.4 million due to the sale of three of the Company’s vessels in 2022.Interest and finance costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $10.0 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Despite increases in interest rates during that period, interest costs fell mainly due to the decrease of our outstanding indebtedness as well as profits from closing swap positions due to debt prepayments.Interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $3.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The more than three-fold increase is mainly attributed to increases in interest rates and in our average cash and cash equivalents on time deposits over the corresponding period.Equity earnings in joint ventures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was a gain of $12.3 million and a gain of $10.9 million, respectively. The $1.4 million increase from the same period of last year is mainly due to a gain on sale of one of the Medium Gas carriers owned by one of our joint ventures.As a result of the above, the Company reported a net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 of $51.9 million, compared to a net income of $34.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 an increase of $17.6 million, or 51%.

Reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income are set forth below.An average of 29.3 vessels were owned by the Company during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, compared to 34.8 vessels for the same period of 2022.As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) amounted to $83.8 million and total debt amounted to $123.5 million. Fleet Update Since Previous Announcement The Company announced the conclusion of the following chartering arrangements (of three or more months duration): · A twelve months time charter extension for its 2011 built LPG carrier Gas Cerberus, until Dec 2024. · A twelve months time charter extension for its 2014 built LPG carrier Eco Chios, until Nov 2024. · A twelve months time charter extension for its 2016 built LPG carrier Eco Dominator, until Mar 2025. · A twelve months time charter for its 2012 built LPG carrier Gas Husky, until Dec 2024. · A six months time charter extension for its 2015 built LPG carrier Eco Royalty, until Aug 2024. · A six months time charter for its 2017 built LPG carrier Eco Frost, until May 2024. · A three months time charter for its 2009 built LPG carrier Gas Astrid, until April 2024. As of January 2024, the Company has total contracted revenues of approximately $200 million. For the year 2024, the Company has circa 66% of fleet days secured under period contracts, and approximately $120 million in contracted revenues. In addition the following charter arrangements were concluded for the joint venture vessels: · A twelve months time charter extension for the 2008 built LPG carrier Gas Shuriken, until Dec 2024. · A six months time charter extension for the 2008 built LPG carrier Gas Defiance, until May 2024. · A six months time charter for the 2007 built LPG carrier Gas Haralambos, until May 2024. · A five months time charter for the 2015 built LPG carrier Eco Lucidity, until Apr 2024. During January 2024, the Company concluded the previously announced sale of the 2015 built Eco Dream (4,989 cbm) and 2015 built Eco Green (4,991 cbm) and also took delivery of the MGC newbuildings Eco Oracle (40,551 cbm) and Eco Wizard (40,551 cbm) in Korea. Upon delivery, the vessels were deployed on their previously announced respective period charters. The Company received $70 million in finance proceeds from a recently concluded 8-year credit facility related to these vessels. In regards to the joint venture vessel Eco Ethereal, the charterer notified of its intention to exercise its purchase option on the vessel. The sale, subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to be completed in April 2024. The sale will result in a profit being recorded at the time of delivery for the joint venture and the proceeds, subject to the joint venture partners decision, are expected to be distributed thereafter. Board Chairman Michael Jolliffe Commented StealthGas reported for the fourth quarter 2023 Net Income of $8.9 million. It was yet another quarter of strong profitability. For the full year 2023 Net Income amounted to $51.9 million, far surpassing last year’s record yearly profit of $34.3 million, corresponding to a 51% increase. So it gives me great pleasure that not only has the Company managed to sustain its record profitability but drastically improve it successively. Obviously the main driver of such results is the lasting recovery of the LPG markets that hopefully will continue. But markets are volatile, and sound policies as well as opportunistic plays need to also guide decisions. As such the Company did not focus on growth for 2023, it rather focused on taking advantage of the market and securing more period charters, currently having over $200 million in contracted revenues, selling vessels as asset prices were rising, paying down debt as interest rates were rising, over $150 million was repaid in 2023 and over $30 million in the current quarter and returning value to our shareholders by buying back our own stock, having bought over 10% of the issued shares during last year and spending $19.1 million. That being said, it was also important not to neglect to renew the fleet and in January of this year StealthGas took delivery of the two 40,000 MGC vessels, Eco Oracle and Eco Wizard, whose period charters should support profitability this year. So far, the beginning of 2024 looks promising as the market for our vessels remains firm and barring any extraordinary events we should expect solid revenues in the current quarter.
