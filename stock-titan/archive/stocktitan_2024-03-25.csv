Negative None. 03/24/2024 - 06:30 PM VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Euro Manganese Inc. (TSX-V and ASX: EMN; OTCQX: EUMNF; Frankfurt: E06) (the ""Company"" or ""EMN"") today provided follow up comments to the Company’s announcement dated March 20, 2023 regarding the European Commission’s proposed Critical Raw Materials Act (“CRMA” or the “Act”), which outlines how the European Union (the ""EU"") intends to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of critical raw materials that are essential in supporting the energy transition. With the Council of the EU’s (the “Council”) recently announced final approval of the CRMA, Euro Manganese’s Chvaletice Manganese Project (the ""Chvaletice Project"" or the ""Project"") in the Czech Republic positions the Company to become the only European producer of high-purity manganese for use in the battery supply chain. Highlights The Council of the European Union has given final approval to the Critical Raw Materials Act.A statement from the Council outlined this approval as the final stage in the process of formally implementing the Act.The final text, officially adopted on March 18, 2024, identifies two lists of materials (34 critical and 17 strategic), that are crucial for green and digital transitions.High-purity manganese (battery grade) listed as a strategic raw material, and manganese listed as a critical raw material. “Manganese – Battery Grade” was listed as a strategic raw material, which recognizes its importance in meeting Europe’s decarbonization efforts and in defence and space applications. Manganese was listed as a critical raw material, which are those considered to be of high economic importance and high supply risk to the EU.Chvaletice Project supports EU requirements for local extraction, processing, and use of recycled raw materials. The Act sets out three benchmarks for domestic mining, processing, and recycling and the Company believes the Project satisfies all three requirements.To strengthen the EU’s raw materials value chain, the CRMA established the concept of Strategic Projects, which are those that will make a meaningful contribution to the security of the EU’s supply of strategic raw materials. The Chvaletice Project meets the criteria for recognition as a Strategic Project, and the Company intends to submit an application for recognition of the Project as a Strategic Project as soon as the application process opens, which in turn will allow the Project to qualify for priority permitting and expand access to funding. Dr. Matthew James, President & CEO of Euro Manganese, commented: “We are pleased to see the EU’s approval of the Critical Raw Materials Act and view this as a key milestone towards securing access to critical raw materials to support the energy transition. This announcement, in combination with the expected approval of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment for our Chvaletice Project, position Euro Manganese to become the only European producer of high-purity manganese in the battery value chain.” The full statement from the Council of the EU is available here.

JSC Kaspi.kz Announces Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs,2024-03-25T08:01:00.000Z,Neutral,Neutral,Kaspi.kz Completes Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs,"JSC Kaspi.kz Announces Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs Rhea-AI Impact (Neutral) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Neutral) Tags Rhea-AI Summary Kaspi.kz Completes Cancellation of Listing of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs Positive None. Negative None. Financial Analyst The announcement of Kaspi.kz's delisting of ADSs and Rule 144A GDRs from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) represents a significant shift in the company's capital markets strategy. Delisting can be a strategic move for a company looking to reduce regulatory burdens and costs associated with being publicly traded. However, it also reduces liquidity and access to capital from a broad investor base. Investors should consider how this may affect the company's financial flexibility and its ability to raise funds in the future.Furthermore, the delisting might be indicative of a larger restructuring or a shift in business focus. Shareholders should assess the potential implications on the company's valuation, as delisting often leads to a narrower investor pool and potentially lower stock prices. The timing and execution of such a transition are crucial, as it could also signal the company's confidence in its ability to sustain operations with less reliance on public markets. Legal Expert From the legal perspective, the completion of the delisting process of Kaspi.kz's securities is a clear indication that the company has adhered to the necessary regulatory requirements. The mention of 'inside information' in the announcement is a reminder of the stringent regulations governing market abuse in the United Kingdom. It is imperative for investors to understand that the dissemination of inside information must be managed carefully to prevent market manipulation or unfair advantages.Moreover, the announcement's emphasis on compliance with jurisdictional laws highlights the complex legal landscape companies must navigate when operating in international markets. The implications of delisting should be examined not just from a financial angle but also considering the legal ramifications and the company's ongoing obligation to maintain transparent communications with its stakeholders. Market Research Analyst Delisting from a major exchange like the LSE suggests a pivotal change in Kaspi.kz's market approach. This could be a response to market conditions or a new business strategy. It is essential to analyze market trends and the competitive landscape in Kazakhstan and how they might have influenced this decision. The impact on investor sentiment should be monitored, as delisting could be interpreted as a negative signal, potentially affecting the company's reputation and brand value.Investors should also consider the broader market implications, such as how the delisting might alter the competitive dynamics within the industry. A reduced presence on public exchanges might limit the company's exposure to potential international partners or acquirers. The long-term strategic outcomes of this decision will depend on how the company leverages its private status to achieve its business objectives. 03/25/2024 - 04:01 AM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN WHOLE OR IN PART IN, INTO OR FROM ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF THAT JURISDICTION.

The parties will collaborate as preferred partners on a project-by-project basis, for point source carbon capture plants for pulp and paper mills, with the ambition to deploy Aker Carbon Capture's modularized Just Catch series. Both parties will be working toward a standard CDR solution, which includes post-combustion carbon capture and compression for recovery boilers, power boilers, lime kilns and other stack emissions. CO280 is a leading developer of Carbon Dioxide Removal projects in the pulp and paper industry. In partnership with pulp and paper companies CO280 develops, finances, owns, and operates large-scale CDR projects. CO280's projects address a critical supply gap in the CDR market by supplying permanent, verifiable, and affordable CDR to corporate buyers in the voluntary market. JPMorgan Chase signed one of the largest carbon removal agreements ever announced with CO280 in May, 2023. CO280 currently has more than 10 million tonnes per year of permanent CDR under development. North America's pulp and paper industry represents a carbon removal opportunity of up to 130 million tonnes per year. This is due to the fact that individual mills have a CO2 emissions profile that is 80-90% biogenic. ""We are excited to expand on our collaboration with CO280 on accelerating carbon removal in the US and Canada. Carbon capture will play a key role in achieving global climate goals as it enables both carbon reduction and carbon removal. Together, C0280 and Aker Carbon Capture will enable large-scale delivery of CDRs,"" said Egil Fagerland, Chief Executive Officer at Aker Carbon Capture.

Data will help constrain the geological model for CV13 ahead of a maiden mineral resource estimate scheduled for Q3 2024.Darren Smith, Vice President of Exploration for the Company, comments:""The 2023 surface program, albeit significantly reduced in scope due to the unprecedented wildfires in the province, was successful in identifying a new spodumene pegmatite occurrence (CV14) along trend of the CV9 and CV10 spodumene pegmatites. The discovery highlights the extensive nature of the spodumene mineralized system along the CV Lithium Trend, which extends across the Property where a large portion remains unexplored for lithium pegmatite. We are excited to follow-up this area with systematic surface exploration as this local prospective lithium pegmatite trend has now been extended to approximately 3.6 km. Coupled with the numerous spodumene pegmatite boulders discovered over the Property, there remains strong potential for additional discoveries at Corvette."" Patriot Battery Metals Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Patriot"") (TSX: PMET) (ASX: PMT) (OTCQX: PMETF) (FSE: R9GA) is pleased to announce results from its 2023 surface exploration campaign at the Corvette Property. The Corvette Property (the ""Property"" or ""Project""), wholly owned by the Company, is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, with a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1, is situated central to the Property, approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The 2023 surface exploration program at Corvette included ground geophysics, geological mapping, channel sampling, and regional prospecting. The program was completed sporadically over the summer-fall field season due to the unprecedented wildfires in the province, which significantly reduced the program's scope. Despite the disruptions, the 2023 surface exploration at Corvette continued to build upon prior success, highlighted by the discovery of a new spodumene pegmatite occurrence, herein termed ""CV14"", located southwest along the same magnetic trend as the CV9 and CV10 spodumene pegmatite clusters (Figure 1). Grab sample assays from the principal pegmatite outcrop (~33 m x 9 m), comprised of spodumene hosted in a smoky-quartz and feldspar groundmass, include 0.94% Li2O and 0.86% Li2O (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Collectively, CV14 forms part of an approximate 3.6 km long prospective spodumene pegmatite trend extending through CV10, and to the CV9 Spodumene Pegmatite. This discovery at CV14 highlights a local trend of growing significance and prospectivity, and requires additional prospecting and mapping. Additionally, approximately 450 m up-ice to the northeast of CV14 a mineralized pegmatite boulder was discovered (0.53% Li2O). Based on interpreted glacial ice direction in the area, it may suggest the potential for a yet to be discovered lithium pegmatite to be present to the north-northeast of the primary CV9-CV10-CV14 trend. Limited surface exploration has been completed in this area to date. A total of 474 surface rock grab/chip samples were collected over the course of the 2023 prospecting program. In addition to the discovery of the CV14 spodumene pegmatite occurrence (outcrop), a plethora of spodumene mineralized pegmatite boulders were discovered south of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite with 29 boulders, dominantly subangular and 1-3 m in size, assaying between 0.49% Li2O to 3.22% Li2O (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Interpretation of glacial ice movement over the Property indicates that, although many of these boulders are undoubtedly sourced from the principal CV5 Pegmatite body, a significant number indicate spodumene pegmatite(s) is present near-surface immediately south of CV5, and along strike eastwardly of the principal CV5 pegmatite body towards CV4, where it remains open. Other mineralized boulders on the property also suggest undiscovered spodumene pegmatite to the north of the primary CV Lithium Trend (Figure 4). These include a large (2 m x 2 m) mineralized boulder (1.00% Li2O) discovered in 2019 to the north of the CV5–13 corridor, suggesting potential for yet to be discovered spodumene pegmatite north of CV5. Also, two mineralized boulders (2.20% and 2.69% Li2O), discovered in 2021, located northeast of the CV8 Spodumene Pegmatite suggest potential for yet to be discovered spodumene pegmatite northeast of CV12 and north of CV13. A tightly spaced (50 m) ground magnetic survey over the CV5 through CV13 corridor was also completed in 2023. The data has further resolved local geological trends along the corridor and will provide strong guidance as drilling advances through this area (Figure 6). There is a distinct lack of outcrop over the corridor due to glacial till cover, further highlighting the value of the magnetic dataset to assist in understanding the local structure and trends which can be used as a general proxy to interpret pegmatite location. At CV13, the surface channeling campaign, which began in 2022, continued in 2023 with 147 m of channel sampling completed. Results in 2023 include 13.4 m at 1.22% Li2O, 6.4 m at 1.44% Li2O, 5.4 m at 1.93% Li2O, and 16.7 m at 0.80% Li2O, including 8.1 m at 1.36% Li2O. A peak sample of 6.43% Li2O (over 0.5 m) was also collected. Of the 147 m of channel sampling completed in 2023 at CV13, a total of 139 m consisted of pegmatite and collectively averaged 0.51% Li2O and 120 ppm Ta2O5. The channel sampling data, which effectively approximates a horizontal drill hole, will help constrain the geological model for CV13 ahead of a maiden mineral resource estimate scheduled for Q3 2024. The 2023 surface work also included initial prospecting over approximately 1/3 of the Property's Corvette East claim block. Although a significant amount of pegmatite was discovered in this area of the Property, no spodumene pegmatite was identified. However, multiple samples returned anomalous pathfinder geochemistry, including low K/Rb ratios indicating evolved and highly fractionated pegmatites are present. The area remains of high interest for continued surface exploration with a significant number of LiDAR derived targets remaining to be prospected (Figure 7). The 2024 surface exploration campaign is currently being designed; however, is anticipated to include: Follow-up of the CV14 Spodumene Pegmatite discovery with targeted prospecting traverses and mapping, as well as channel sampling.Follow-up of the multiple boulder fields indicating yet to be discovered spodumene pegmatite.Additional detailed geological mapping of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite to further constrain the geological model at surface.Continued channel sampling of the CV5 and CV13 pegmatites to constrain the geological model near surface and support an indicated mineral resource classification. 1 The CV5 mineral resource estimate (109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O and 160 ppm Ta2O5 inferred) is reported at a cut-off grade of 0.40% Li2O with an effective date of June 25, 2023 (through drill hole CV23-190). Mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. Largest in the Americas based on contained LCE. Quality Assurance / Quality Control (QAQC)A Quality Assurance / Quality Control protocol following industry best practices was incorporated into the program and included insertion of quartz blanks and certified reference materials into sample batches submitted to the laboratory. All surface samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which includes drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. The pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Management cautions that prospecting surface rock samples and associated assays, as discussed herein, are selective by nature and represent a point location, and therefore may not necessarily be fully representative of the mineralized horizon sampled. About the CV Lithium TrendThe CV Lithium Trend is an emerging spodumene pegmatite district discovered by the Company in 2017 and is interpreted to span more than 50 kilometres across the Corvette Property. The core area includes the approximate 4.4 km long CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, which hosts a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2 Mt at 1.42% Li2O inferred1. To date, eight (8) distinct clusters of lithium pegmatite have been discovered across the Corvette Property – CV4, CV5, CV8, CV9, CV10, CV12, CV13, and the recently discovered CV14. Given the proximity of some pegmatite outcrops to each other, as well as the shallow till cover in the area, it is probable that some of the outcrops may reflect a discontinuous surface exposure of a single, larger pegmatite ""outcrop"" subsurface.

Appendix 1 – JORC Code 2012 Table 1 (ASX Listing Rule 5.7.1)Section 1 – Sampling Techniques and Data Criteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Sampling techniques • Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialized industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. • Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. • Aspects of the determination of mineralization that are Material to the Public Report. • In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverized to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralization types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. • Prospecting rock samples were collected as grab and/or chip samples and represent a point location. • Channel sampling followed best industry practices with a 3 to 5 cm wide, saw-cut channel completed across the pegmatite as practical, perpendicular to the interpreted pegmatite strike. Samples were collected at ~1 m contiguous intervals with the channel bearing noted, and GPS coordinate collected at the start and end points of the channel. • All prospecting rock and channel samples collected from were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). Drilling techniques • Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc). • n/a Drill sample recovery • Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. • Measures taken to maximize sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. • Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. • n/a Logging • Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. • Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography. • The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. • Channel samples were geologically logged upon collection on an individual sample basis. • The logging is qualitative by nature, and includes estimates of spodumene grain size, inclusions, and model mineral estimates. • These logging practices meet or exceed current industry standard practices and are of appropriate detail to support a mineral resource estimation. Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation • If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. • If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry. • For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. • Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize representivity of samples. • Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. • Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. • A QAQC protocol for the channel samples included insertion of quartz blanks and CRMs into sample batches. • The Company relied predominantly on internal laboratory QAQC protocols for the surface rock samples with blanks and CRMs inserted at the geologist's discretion. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Quality of assay data and laboratory tests • The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. • For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. • Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established. • Samples collected were shipped to SGS Canada's laboratory in Val-d'Or, QC, for standard sample preparation (code PRP89 special) which included drying at 105°C, crush to 90% passing 2 mm, riffle split 250 g, and pulverize 85% passing 75 microns. Sample pulps were shipped by air to SGS Canada's laboratory in Burnaby, BC, where the samples were homogenized and subsequently analyzed for multi-element (including Li and Ta) using sodium peroxide fusion with ICP-AES/MS finish (codes GE_ICP91A50 and GE_IMS91A50). • The Company relies on both its internal QAQC protocols (use of blanks and certified reference materials), as well as the laboratory's internal QAQC. • All protocols employed are considered appropriate for the sample type and nature of mineralization and are considered the optimal approach for maintaining representativeness in sampling. Verification of sampling and assaying • The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. • The use of twinned holes. • Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. • Discuss any adjustment to assay data. • Intervals for channels are reviewed and compiled by the VP Exploration and Project Managers prior to disclosure, including a review of the Company's internal QAQC sample analytical data. • Data capture utilizes MX Deposit software whereby logging data is entered directly into the software for storage, including direct import of laboratory analytical certificates as they are received. The Company employs various on-site and post QAQC protocols to ensure data integrity and accuracy. • Adjustments to data include reporting lithium and tantalum in their oxide forms, as it is reported in elemental form in the assay certificates. Formulas used are Li2O = Li x 2.153, and Ta2O5 = Ta x 1.221. Location of data points • Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. • Specification of the grid system used. • Quality and adequacy of topographic control. • Each channel's start and end-point has been surveyed with a RTK Trimble Zephyr 3 or RTK Topcon GR-5. • The coordinate system used is UTM NAD83 Zone 18. • The Company completed a property-wide LiDAR and orthophoto survey in August 2022, which provides high-quality topographic control. • The quality and accuracy of the topographic controls are considered adequate for advanced stage exploration and development, including mineral resource estimation. Data spacing and distribution • Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. • Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. • Whether sample compositing has been applied. • Surface prospecting samples are randomly distributed based on the location of the outcrop or boulder. • At CV13, the objective was to channel each pegmatite outcrop. Due to the size of the outcrops, often only one channel was completed. Therefore, channel distribution is dominantly a function of outcrop location. Channels were completed perpendicular to the pegmatite trend as best interpreted. • Channel sample lengths average ~0.5 m. Orientation of data in relation to geological structure • Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. • If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralized structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. • No sampling bias is anticipated based on structure within the mineralized body. • The principal mineralized bodies are relatively undeformed and very competent, although have some meaningful structural control. • At CV5, the principal mineralized body and adjacent lenses are steeply dipping. • At CV13, the principal pegmatite body has a shallow varied strike and northerly dip. • At CV9, the orientation and geometry of the pegmatite is not well understood. The pegmatite is currently interpreted to be comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. Sample security • The measures taken to ensure sample security. • Samples were collected by Company staff or its consultants following specific protocols governing sample collection and handling. Samples were bagged, placed in large supersacs for added security, palleted, and shipped directly to Val-d'Or, QC, being tracked during shipment along with Chain of Custody. Upon arrival at the laboratory, the samples were cross-referenced with the shipping manifest to confirm all samples were accounted for. At the laboratory, sample bags are evaluated for tampering. Audits or reviews • The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. • A review of the sample procedures for the Company's 2021 fall drill program (CF21-001 to 004) and 2022 winter drill program (CV22-015 to 034) was completed by an Independent Competent Person and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Corvette Property, Quebec, Canada"", by Alex Knox, M.Sc., P.Geol., Issue Date of June 27th, 2022.) • A review of the sample procedures through the Company's 2023 winter drill program (through CV23-190) was completed by an independent Competent Person with respect to the CV5 Pegmatite's maiden mineral resource estimate and deemed adequate and acceptable to industry best practices (discussed in a technical report titled "" NI 43–101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property"" by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. • Additionally, the Company continually reviews and evaluates its procedures in order to optimize and ensure compliance at all levels of sample data collection and handling. Section 2 – Reporting of Exploration Results Criteria JORC Code explanation Commentary Mineral tenement and land tenure status • Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. • The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area. • The Corvette Property is comprised of 424 CDC claims located in the James Bay Region of Quebec, with Patriot Battery Metals Inc. being the registered title holder for all of the claims. The northern border of the Property's primary claim block is located within approximately 6 km to the south of the Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure corridor. The CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite is situated approximately 13.5 km south of the regional and all–weather Trans-Taiga Road and powerline infrastructure. The CV13 and CV9 spodumene pegmatites are located approximately 3 km west-southwest and 14 km west of CV5, respectively. • The Company holds 100% interest in the Property subject to various royalty obligations depending on original acquisition agreements. DG Resources Management holds a 2% NSR (no buyback) on 76 claims, D.B.A. Canadian Mining House holds a 2% NSR on 50 claims (half buyback for $2M) and Osisko Gold Royalties holds a sliding scale NSR of 1.5-3.5% on precious metals, and 2% on all other products, over 111 claims. The vast majority of the CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite, as is currently delineated, is not subject to a royalty. • The Property does not overlap any atypically sensitive environmental areas or parks, or historical sites to the knowledge of the Company. There are no known hinderances to operating at the Property, apart from the goose harvesting season (typically mid-April to mid-May) where the communities request helicopter flying not be completed, and potentially wildfires depending on the season, scale, and location. • Claim expiry dates range from February 2025 to November 2026. Exploration done by other parties • Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. • No assay results from other parties are disclosed herein. • The most recent independent Property review was a technical report titled ""NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the CV5 Pegmatite, Corvette Property, James Bay Region, Québec, Canada"", by Todd McCracken, P.Geo., of BBA Engineering Ltd., and Ryan Cunningham, M.Eng., P.Eng., of Primero Group Americas Inc., Effective Date of June 25, 2023, and Issue Date of September 8, 2023. Geology • Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralization. • The Property overlies a large portion of the Lac Guyer Greenstone Belt, considered part of the larger La Grande River Greenstone Belt and is dominated by volcanic rocks metamorphosed to amphibolite facies. The claim block is dominantly host to rocks of the Guyer Group (amphibolite, iron formation, intermediate to mafic volcanics, peridotite, pyroxenite, komatiite, as well as felsic volcanics). The amphibolite rocks that trend east-west (generally steeply south dipping) through this region are bordered to the north by the Magin Formation (conglomerate and wacke) and to the south by an assemblage of tonalite, granodiorite, and diorite, in addition to metasediments of the Marbot Group (conglomerate, wacke). Several regional-scale Proterozoic gabbroic dykes also cut through portions of the Property (Lac Spirt Dykes, Senneterre Dykes). • The geological setting is prospective for gold, silver, base metals, platinum group elements, and lithium over several different deposit styles including orogenic gold (Au), volcanogenic massive sulfide (Cu, Au, Ag), komatiite-ultramafic (Au, Ag, PGE, Ni, Cu, Co), and pegmatite (Li, Ta). • Exploration of the Property has outlined three primary mineral exploration trends crossing dominantly east-west over large portions of the Property – Golden Trend (gold), Maven Trend (copper, gold, silver), and CV Trend (lithium, tantalum). The CV5 and CV13 spodumene pegmatites are situated within the CV Trend. Lithium mineralization at the Property, including at CV5, CV13, and CV9, is observed to occur within quartz-feldspar pegmatite, which may be exposed at surface as high relief 'whale-back' landforms. The pegmatite is often very coarse-grained and off-white in appearance, with darker sections commonly composed of mica and smoky quartz, and occasional tourmaline. • The lithium pegmatites at Corvette are categorized as LCT Pegmatites. Core assays and ongoing mineralogical studies, coupled with field mineral identification and assays, indicate spodumene as the dominant lithium-bearing mineral on the Property, with no significant petalite, lepidolite, lithium-phosphate minerals, or apatite present. The pegmatites also carry significant tantalum values with tantalite indicated to be the mineral phase. Drill hole Information • A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes: o easting and northing of the drill hole collar o elevation or RL (Reduced Level – elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar o dip and azimuth of the hole o down hole length and interception depth o hole length. • If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. • n/a Data aggregation methods • In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. • Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail. • The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated. • Length weighted averages were used to calculate grade over width. • No specific grade cap or cut-off was used during grade width calculations. The lithium and tantalum average of the entire pegmatite interval is calculated for all channels. • No metal equivalents have been reported. Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths • These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. • If the geometry of the mineralization with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported. • If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known'). • At CV5, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports a principal, large pegmatite body of near vertical to steeply dipping orientation, flanked by several subordinate pegmatite lenses (collectively, the 'CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV13, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation supports an upper and lower pegmatite body, each trending sub-parallel to each other with a shallow northerly dip (collectively, the 'CV13 Spodumene Pegmatite') • At CV9, geological modelling is ongoing on a hole-by-hole basis and as assays are received. However, current interpretation indicates CV9 is comprised of a single principal dyke, which outcrops at surface, has a steep northerly dip, and is moderately plunging to the east-southeast. A strike length of 450 m has been delineated through drilling and outcrop. • All reported channel widths are apparent. Diagrams • Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. • Please refer to the figures included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. Balanced reporting • Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. • Please refer to information included herein as well as those posted on the Company's website. • Balanced reporting has been completed. Other substantive exploration data • Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples – size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. • The Company is currently completing baseline environmental work over the CV5 and CV13 pegmatite area. No endangered flora or fauna have been documented over the Property to date, and several sites have been identified as potentially suitable for mine infrastructure. • The Company has completed a bathymetric survey over the shallow glacial lake which overlies a portion of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite. The lake depth ranges from <2 m to approximately 18 m, although the majority of the CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite, as delineated to date, is overlain by typically <2 to 10 m of water. • The Company has completed preliminary metallurgical testing comprised of HLS and magnetic testing, which has produced 6+% Li2O spodumene concentrates at >70% recovery on both CV5 and CV13 pegmatite material, indicating DMS as a viable primary process approach, and that both CV5 and CV13 could potentially feed the same process plant. A DMS test on CV5 Spodumene Pegmatite material returned a spodumene concentrate grading 5.8% Li2O at 79% recovery, strongly indicating potential for a DMS only operation to be applicable. • Various mandates required for advancing the Project towards economic studies have been initiated, including but not limited to, environmental baseline, metallurgy, geomechanics, hydrogeology, hydrology, stakeholder engagement, geochemical characterization, as well as transportation and logistical studies. Further work • The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). • Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive. • The Company intends to continue surface exploration in 2024, including prospecting, geological mapping, and channel sampling.

Announces Finalization of Agreements in Equatorial Guinea Rhea-AI Impact (High) Rhea-AI Sentiment (Positive) Tags Rhea-AI Summary VAALCO Energy, Inc. announces approval of Joint Operating agreement for Block P in Equatorial Guinea, paving the way for development and production. CEO George Maxwell expresses excitement for the project and highlights the company's strong portfolio and operational track record. Positive None. Negative None. Energy Sector Analyst The approval of the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) by the Government of Equatorial Guinea for VAALCO Energy's Venus-Block P is a significant step forward for the company. This approval, along with the finalized documents, represents a substantial milestone in project development, signaling the transition from planning to execution. The 25-year Production Sharing Contract (PSC) is indicative of long-term commitment and potential revenue generation. However, the project's success hinges on the economic viability determined by the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study and subsequent Final Investment Decision (FID).Investors should note that the development of offshore projects is capital intensive with a long lead time before revenue generation commences. The statement regarding VAALCO's current operational cash flow and bank-debt free status is positive, but it's essential to monitor how the company will finance the Block P development without compromising its financial health. The diversification mentioned by the CEO could mitigate risks, but it also requires careful management to ensure integration and synergy among the new assets. Financial Analyst VAALCO's announcement is likely to be closely scrutinized by the market, especially regarding the impact of the Venus-Block P development on the company's financials. The reference to growing cash positions and the absence of bank debt is reassuring for investors concerned about financial leverage, especially in an industry known for its volatility. However, the cost of the FEED study and subsequent development phases will be a test of VAALCO's financial robustness.Investors should consider the potential upside of adding a producing asset like Block P to VAALCO's portfolio, which could lead to an increase in the company's reserves and production volumes. Nevertheless, it is important to keep an eye on commodity prices, as they will significantly influence the project's profitability. The upcoming earnings release and Form 10-Q will be pivotal in providing more details on the company's financial trajectory and how the Block P development fits within its broader strategy. Market Research Analyst The oil and gas sector is influenced by geopolitical, regulatory and market dynamics that can affect project timelines and profitability. VAALCO's entry into Equatorial Guinea with the Venus-Block P project expands its geographical footprint and diversifies its risk profile. The 25-year PSC term showcases a long-term investment in the region, which could be beneficial if managed effectively.From a market perspective, the timing of the project coincides with a global push for energy diversification and security. However, the shift towards renewable energy sources and the pressure of environmental regulations could impact future oil projects. VAALCO's emphasis on remaining bank-debt free while expanding its portfolio is a strategy that could resonate well with stakeholders looking for companies with prudent financial management in a sector prone to cyclical fluctuations. 03/25/2024 - 03:00 AM HOUSTON, March 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VAALCO Energy, Inc.

The Company bought 8,000 ordinary shares at an average price of £81.3906 per share, with the intention to cancel them, resulting in 164,266,233 ordinary shares in issue. Positive None. Negative None. Market Research Analyst The recent share buyback by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC represents a strategic use of the company's capital to manage its share structure. By reducing the number of shares outstanding through cancellation, the company is effectively increasing the earnings per share (EPS), which could lead to a positive market reaction. This action also signals to the market that the company believes its shares are undervalued, which can be seen as a confident move by management regarding the company's financial health and future prospects.However, it's essential to consider the opportunity cost of such a buyback. The capital used could have been invested in growth opportunities or used to pay down debt. Investors may want to watch the company's future investment strategies and debt levels to assess the long-term impact of this buyback on the company's financial flexibility. Financial Analyst From a financial perspective, the share repurchase carried out by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC via Goldman Sachs International on the London Stock Exchange is a noteworthy event for investors and analysts. The transaction details, including the aggregate number of shares purchased, the price range and the average price paid per share, provide important data points for evaluating the company's market valuation and liquidity.The cancellation of the purchased shares will potentially increase the value of the remaining shares if the market perceives the buyback as a positive signal about the company's intrinsic value. Additionally, this could potentially improve financial ratios such as return on equity (ROE), which may make the stock more attractive to investors seeking companies with efficient equity usage. Corporate Governance Expert Share repurchases are often subject to scrutiny from a corporate governance standpoint. The decision by InterContinental Hotels Group PLC to buy back shares following authorization from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting demonstrates adherence to good governance practices. It also reflects shareholder alignment, as the repurchase was executed under shareholder-approved terms.However, it's important for stakeholders to monitor the balance between returning value to shareholders and maintaining sufficient capital for operational needs and strategic initiatives. The impact of this buyback on corporate governance can be seen as positive, provided it was made with a long-term strategic vision and not merely for short-term stock price enhancement. 03/25/2024 - 03:00 AM Purchase of own sharesLONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / March 25, 2024 / InterContinental Hotels Group PLC (NYSE:IHG)(LSE:IHG)(OTC PINK:ICHGF)The Company announces that on 22 March 2024 it purchased the following number of its ordinary shares of 20340/399 pence each through Goldman Sachs International (""GSI"") on the London Stock Exchange in accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2023 (the ""Purchase"").

Over 235,000 test kits were distributed in 2023, with New Zealand being the latest country to benefit from this program. Positive None. Negative None. Public Health Expert Increasing the accessibility of HIV self-testing kits through Grindr's partnership with Burnett Foundation Aotearoa represents a significant step in public health, particularly for the LGBTQ+ community. This initiative addresses several barriers to HIV testing, such as stigma, privacy concerns and logistical challenges. By embedding the distribution within a social platform widely used by the target demographic, the program leverages existing user behavior to facilitate health interventions.The impact of such a program can be substantial. For instance, early detection of HIV can lead to timely treatment, improving individual health outcomes and reducing the transmission rate within the community. Moreover, the normalization of regular HIV testing as part of routine health care can be a powerful tool in combating the HIV epidemic. The success of the program could also inspire similar initiatives in other regions, potentially leading to a global reduction in new HIV infections. Market Analyst From a market perspective, Grindr's initiative to distribute free HIV self-test kits may not directly influence its financial performance in the short term, but it enhances the company's brand image and corporate social responsibility profile. This goodwill can translate into increased user loyalty and attract users who value companies with strong social initiatives. Over the long term, such brand equity can contribute to user base growth and retention, which are critical factors for any social networking platform's revenue potential.Furthermore, Grindr's proactive approach to public health could set a precedent for other tech companies, potentially leading to partnerships with healthcare organizations. These collaborations may open up new revenue streams, such as sponsored health content or services within the app. As Grindr expands this program globally, the potential for market differentiation and leadership in social impact could make it an attractive partner for NGOs and governments, further solidifying its market position. Healthcare Policy Analyst The collaboration between Grindr and the Burnett Foundation Aotearoa aligns with global health policy goals of reducing HIV transmission rates. By providing free HIV self-test kits, they are effectively decentralizing HIV testing and making it more accessible. This initiative can serve as a case study for public-private partnerships in healthcare, showcasing how technology can be harnessed to address public health challenges.Policy implications of such initiatives are profound. They demonstrate an innovative approach to healthcare delivery that could be replicated for other health conditions. Additionally, the data generated from the usage of these kits could inform future public health strategies and resource allocation. The partnership also highlights the role of non-traditional healthcare players, such as tech companies, in contributing to health outcomes, potentially influencing future policy on collaboration between the tech and healthcare sectors. 03/24/2024 - 04:00 PM New Zealand joins the growing number of countries where Grindr, the premiere LGBTQ+ social connector, is partnering with local organizations to expand HIV self-testing, with distribution of more than a quarter million test kits to date LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Grindr Inc. (NYSE: GRND), the world’s largest social network for the LGBTQ+ community, today announced the launch of its new partnership with Burnett Foundation Aotearoa to offer free HIV self-test kits to Grindr users throughout New Zealand. The partnership is the latest step in Grindr’s expansion of its work to advance public health for the LGBTQ+ community, driven by Grindr for Equality, the company’s global social impact initiative. As of today, Grindr users in New Zealand can order free HIV self-test kits through Burnett Foundation directly from links embedded in the Grindr app in less than one minute. Grindr for Equality’s partnerships with public health organizations, launched nationally one year ago to expand free at-home HIV test kit distribution, has proven remarkably successful. Grindr for Equality works with Building Healthy Online Communities and others to enable Grindr users in the U.S. and a growing number of other countries, to order free HIV self-test kits by connecting them directly to self-testing partner organizations through the Grindr app. In 2023 alone, this program distributed more than 235,000 HIV test kits, many to Grindr users in the U.S. who had never previously been tested. This success inspires Grindr and the Burnett Foundation's efforts in New Zealand, where they aim to promote HIV testing awareness and education globally. Today’s announcement builds on Grindr’s continued collaboration with the Burnett Foundation to promote safe sex practices nationwide. Over the last year, Grindr has helped to raise awareness for the HIV resources made available by the Foundation in New Zealand, periodically sharing in-app messages to encourage users to obtain self-test kits distributed by Burnett. Now, Grindr users in New Zealand will be able to order these kits directly through the Grindr app around the clock. “Grindr could not be more thrilled to expand in-app access to HIV self-testing to our community in New Zealand,” said Steph Niaupari of Grindr for Equality. “In launching similar initiatives in other countries, we’ve seen the tangible impact that in-app access can drive in increasing global access to HIV testing. We look forward to bringing similar programs to Grindr users around the world.” “We are incredibly excited to partner with Grindr to make HIV self-test kits more easily available across Aotearoa New Zealand,” said Joe Rich, Chief Executive at the Burnett Foundation. “We hope this will encourage more people in our communities to test for HIV regularly so they can know their status and enjoy great sexual health. Testing for HIV regularly is a vital tool in helping us achieve an Aotearoa with zero HIV transmissions.” Increasing access to testing remains one of the most valuable tools in the fight against the global HIV epidemic. Self-testing, in particular, offers a convenient and discreet alternative to in-person testing, which can pose obstacles such as clinic operating hours, transportation, and costs. These barriers can be even more pronounced for a variety of Grindr users, such as those living in rural areas and those who are not “out” to their families. Grindr is proud to partner with Burnett Foundation to help its users across New Zealand overcome these challenges, and to drive community-led progress towards eliminating HIV. Through Grindr’s partnership with Burnett Foundation, New Zealand becomes the fourth country in which users can order free HIV self-test kits directly through the Grindr app. Last November, Grindr partnered with MPOWER and Equality Movement to offer free HIV self-test kits through its app to users across Georgia and Ireland. Today’s launch in New Zealand builds on Grindr’s commitment to advancing public health for the LGBTQ+ community globally. Grindr looks forward to collaborating with similar programs around the world. About Grindr Inc. With more than 13 million monthly active users in virtually every country in the world, Grindr has grown to become a fundamental part of the LGBTQ+ community since its launch in 2009. The company continues to expand its ecosystem to enable gay, bi, trans, and queer people to connect, express themselves, and discover the world around them.

The project covers an area of 14.80 km2 (3,656.1 acres) and is located 200km southeast of Reno and 18km east of Mina, Nevada. It is well situated for the supply of power, water and skilled labour and proximity to transport infrastructure in Mineral County and is centred around four existing mineral deposits: Garnet; Good Hope; Gunmetal and Desert Scheelite, all of which possess significant skarn-style tungsten-copper-silver-zinc mineralisation. The Pilot Mountain project consists of 176 active lode mining claims and 4 filed mill site claims. The four mill site claims filed at the former Dunham mill site have secure access to groundwater supply sufficient for the proposed project.Garfield ProjectThe Garfield Project is an exciting copper-gold-silver prospect consisting of 65 lode mining claims covering 5.4 km2 (1,338 acres) located in Mineral County, Nevada, approximately 14km due east of the town of Hawthorne and 120km due west-northwest of Tonopah. Exploration to date has included detailed geochemical sampling and follow up analysis which highlighted the presence of both porphyry and skarn-type mineralisation and alteration at the 'High-Grade Zone'. Further to this, mapping, prospecting and rock sampling was recently completed with results confirming presence of high-grade copper, silver and gold mineralisation as well as leading to the bedrock discovery of the Pamlico Au Zone with individual rock samples up to 18.35g/t Au, 1,225g/t Ag & 1.89% Cu. Following this, geochemical analysis of the full suite of data confirmed the strong presence of porphyry style mineralisation across the Project, as well as potentially overprinting epithermal style mineralisation leading to increased gold-silver prospectivity.Kibby Basin Lithium ProjectThe Kibby Basin Project covers two claim packages which are prospective for lithium brine mineralisation. The southern claim package is less than 250m from a 2022 drillhole which returned a significant interval (169m) of lithium brine mineralisation which was determined to be open in all directions. The Project is less than 5km to the southeast of the Company's flagship Pilot Mountain Project.Golconda Summit ProjectGolden Metal is the operator of the Golconda Summit project, which is held under an earn-in right to acquire up to 100 per cent. of the project from the mineral claim owner pursuant to an option agreement. The Golconda Summit project is an exploration stage gold and silver project located in Humboldt County and situated at the confluence of the Getchell and Battle Mountain - Eureka metallogenic trends, and consists of 44 lode mining claims, covering a total area of approximately 3.22 km2 (795.4 acres) located approximately 27km east of Winnemucca.Stonewall ProjectThe Stonewall project is an exploration stage gold-silver property prospective for epithermal gold-silver mineralisation. The property consists of 19 lode mining claims covering 1.59 km2 (392.5 acres) located on the northern flank of Stonewall Mountain, on the western edge of the Nellis Airforce Range Restricted Access Area, in Nye County, Nevada, approximately 24km south-east of the historic gold mining town of Goldfield and 60km due south of Tonopah.This information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Collectively the three contiguous districts stretch over 120-km in NNE/SSW direction (refer to Figure 6).This region provides access to major infrastructure resulting from oil & gas and mining operations, including Cerrejón, the largest coal mine in South America, held by global miner Glencore. Max's twenty mining concessions collectively span over 188-km². In 2022, Max executed a 2-year co-operation agreement with Endeavour Silver Corp. (TSX: EDR) (NYSE: EXK), which assists to expand its 100% owned landholdings, Endeavour will hold an underlying 0.5% NSR.Figure 6: Location and Scale of the Cesar Copper Silver Project, NE Colombia.To view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:https://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/3834/202972_maxfig7.jpgAM DistrictStarting in the far north of the Jurassic basin, classic stacked red bed outcrops with extensive lateral continuity have been rock sampled over many kilometres within the AM District. Highlight values of 34.4% copper and 305 g/t silver have been documented in the sedimentary red bed sequences. The Company confirmed that stratiform mineralization continues at depth with two scout drill holes completed earlier this year (Max News Release dated April 4, 2023). In addition, Colombian field crews continue to discover and sample new mineralized outcrops including at the recently identified AM-7 target (Max News Release dated May 25, 2023 and Max News Release dated June 22, 2023).Conejo DistrictMidway south, the Conejo District is the most recent to be recognized and is characterized by structurally controlled mineralization hosted in intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks. Numerous mineralized outcrops have been discovered over 3.7-km at the primary target in the district with surface samples averaging 4.9% copper (2% cut-off). No drilling has been conducted at Conejo, but it has emerged as an area of focus for the Company.URU DistrictMineralization within the URU District is hosted in intermediate volcanic rocks and is structurally controlled, similar to deposits in the Central African Copper Belt. At URU-C, a 9.0m of 7.0% copper and 115 g/t silver surface discovery was confirmed at depth by drill hole URU-12, which intersected 10.6m of 3.4% copper and 48 g/t silver. At the URU-CE target, 750m to the east, 19.0m of 1.3% copper discovered in outcrop was confirmed by drill hole URU-9, which intersected a broad zone of copper oxide returning 33.0m of 0.3% copper from 4.0m, including 16.5m of 0.5% copper (Max News Release date January 24, 2023).CESAR Target EvaluationMax has identified and is evaluating 28 targets along the 120-km-long belt for potential drill testing. The Company is focused on expanding, refining, and prioritizing these targets in preparation for a drill program. Initial efforts have been concentrated on those targets with the greatest size potential with work that includes the following field activities:Systematic chip and channel sampling of the mineralized outcrops.Detailed geological and structural mapping of each showing.Target scale prospecting and soil sampling.Airborne Magnetic/Radiometric Surveys.Regional ExplorationMax has demonstrated that the Cesar basin is fertile for copper-silver mineralization over a large area; however, only a fraction of the basin has been explored. As a result, Max has dedicated one of its geological teams to regional exploration with the goal of discovering additional copper-silver prospects within its land package covering more than 1,000 sq-km.Qualified PersonThe Company's disclosure of a technical or scientific nature in this news release was reviewed and approved by Tim Henneberry, P.Geo (British Columbia), a member of the Max Resource advisory board, who serves as a qualified person under the definition of National Instrument 43-101.About Max Resource Corp.Max Resource Corp.

Riders of Iron Menace will start their exhilarating journey in the remains of an old steel mill and then climb 160 feet where they’ll hang over the beyond-vertical first drop before diving into the first of four mind-bending inversions. With nearly 2,200 feet of steel track, this awe-inspiring roller coaster will feature a unique “hold and dive” element, where riders will find themselves hanging on the edge of their seats, breathlessly awaiting the heart-pounding 95-degree, 152-foot drop. With speeds up to 64 miles per hour, Iron Menace will boast the first-ever tilted loop on a dive coaster. After the initial, beastly drop, the train will pull up sharply and flip 180 degrees in an Immelmann inversion. A zero g-roll will dish out a 360-degree inversion in wild weightlessness, while the tilted loop and a 360-degree corkscrew spin will leave riders wondering which way is up.

""Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah, is the perfect venue for new Jeep concepts, with more than 20,000 Jeep enthusiasts gathering each year to celebrate the most iconic 4x4 brand in the world,"" said Bill Peffer, senior vice president and head of Jeep brand North America. ""From 4xe electrification to unmatched 392 power, this year's Jeep 4x4 concepts illustrate how the most capable Wrangler ever appeals to such a wide range of people."" Four distinctive Jeep brand and Jeep Performance Parts (JPP) concept vehicles are equipped with an array of proven propulsion systems. The Jeep Wrangler Low Down concept, a tip of the hat to the Lower 40 concept from 2009, features the 392 V-8 engine. The Jeep Wrangler 4xe Willys Dispatcher concept marries the advanced 4xe plug-in hybrid propulsion system with a throwback design theme that honors early post-war civilian Jeep SUVs. Two JPP concepts, the Jeep Gladiator-based High Top concept and the Jeep Grand Wagoneer-based Vacationeer concept, both feature six-cylinder power, a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 and a Hurricane Twin Turbo 510, respectively. ""Our extended Jeep Performance Parts from Mopar team can't wait to get back to Moab for the 58th annual Easter Jeep Safari,"" said Mike Koval Jr, North America senior vice president, Mopar service, parts and customer care. ""We look forward to unveiling a new set of concept vehicles that feature our latest custom and factory-tested and factory-backed production parts and accessories that allow us to tackle some of the toughest trails in the world."" The 2024 Easter Jeep Safari (EJS) concept vehicles include: Jeep Low Down ConceptFifteen years ago, the Jeep design team wowed attendees at the 43rd annual Easter Jeep Safari with the radically modified Jeep Wrangler Lower 40. Rolling at stock ride height to maintain its center of gravity, the two-door Lower 40 accommodated huge 40-inch mud-terrain tires while packing a 5.7-liter V-8 under hood for prodigious power. An instant classic, the Lower 40 still draws a crowd a decade-and-a-half later and remains one of the fan favorites of all EJS concepts. The new Low Down concept pays homage to the Lower 40, in which by some creative clearance work, this new Jeep Wrangler concept squeezes massive 42-inch BFGoodrich Krawler 42x14.5R20 mud-terrain tires mounted on 20-inch beadlock wheels under its custom high-clearance carbon fender flares. The stock Wrangler Rubicon 392 suspension remains intact, but Dana 60 axles with 5.38 gears replace the standard Dana 44 axles with 4:10 gears. Between the diameter of the tires and the shortening of the front and rear bumpers, the Low Down's center of gravity remains low, while the ground clearance, breakover, and approach and departure angles all get dramatic increases. The body, coated in deep Poison Apple Red paint, is streamlined via removal of the rear door handles, a custom carbon hood with see-through power dome and a bespoke race-style fuel filler door located in the driver-side rear quarter panel. The interior features custom black leather seats with cloth inserts, Rhino-lined floors and a custom radio-delete instrument panel. A purpose-built, red-tinted bikini top casts a warm red glow upon the interior compartment. Like its Lower 40 predecessor, the Jeep Low Down is powered by a V-8 engine, though in this modern interpretation, that translates to the formidable 475-horsepower 6.4-liter 392 V-8 engine, which is mated to an eight-speed automatic. Jeep Willys Dispatcher ConceptA mix of where the Jeep brand's been and where it's going, the Jeep Willys Dispatcher is a Wrangler 4xe-based concept that invokes the nostalgia of the early post-war civilian Jeep, with its rugged, utilitarian looks, juxtaposed with the electrified off-road capability of the modern, technologically advanced 4xe propulsion system. On the exterior, the Willys Dispatcher concept gets a retro makeover from the ground up. Super Traxion 36-inch tires are wrapped around vintage-style 16-by-7-inch alloy ""steelies."" A custom old-school front bumper houses a brand-new, classic-looking 8274 Warn winch, featuring a Warn Epic Series winch hook and D rings. Like the beloved flat-fender Jeeps of yesteryear, WILLYS lettering is embossed into the sides of the hood. The windshield header is coated in gloss black, while the exterior is otherwise painted in a custom shade of Element 115 Green, beautifully accented with the cream-colored steelies. Inside, the Dispatcher gets a custom retrim in a mix of distressed saddle leather and houndstooth cloth inserts. The front and rear headrests have been removed to give the seats the low-back vintage feel that ruled the road back in the day. A JPP bikini top keeps passengers shielded from the weather, be it rain or shine. To protect from water, mud or other muck, the Dispatcher sports rugged JPP vinyl covering for the floor, while a JPP onboard air compressor comes in handy when managing tire pressures on the trail. The Willys Dispatcher is powered by the award-winning 2.0-liter plug-in hybrid 4xe propulsion system that delivers 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque through an eight-speed automatic. Dana 50 Advantech front and rear axles with 4.70 gears effortlessly transfer all the power and torque to the Super Traxion tires. Jeep Gladiator Rubicon High Top ConceptThe Jeep Gladiator Rubicon High Top concept reflects the drive of the JPP design and engineering teams from Mopar to push the performance boundaries of the world's most off-road capable midsize truck even further for the annual trek to Moab. The bold Ginger Snap metallic exterior with retro-inspired two-tone graphics is an attention-getter. The Gladiator Rubicon High Top concept rides high on massive new 40x13.5R18 BFGoodrich All-Terrain T/A KO3 tires mounted on 18-by-9-inch Satin Black KMC Grenade Crawl beadlock wheels. Concept JPP flat fender flares at all four corners provide plenty of off-road ride clearance. Unstoppable Dana 60 front and rear axles with matching 5.38:1 gearing and an AccuAir adjustable air suspension help make easy work of any serious off-road excursion. The robust 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine, mated to a TorqueFlite eight-speed automatic transmission, delivers a broad torque band with a focus on low-end torque, essential for off-roading. A modified front bumper from American Expedition Vehicles features a custom protective hoop sitting just above a Warn winch. Rock rail power steps from Rock Slide Engineering protect the undercarriage and help provide easy entry and exit from the cabin. A DECKED truck bed storage system offers additional lockable cargo space through dual sliding drawers, while still allowing for storage on top in the bed area. Inside, seats have been retrimmed with custom quilted and perforated tan and black Alea leather and feature an embossed JPP logo on the headrests. Overhead protection is provided by a JPP sun bonnet. Completing the interior are a JPP pedal kit, all-weather floor mats and door sill guards. Jeep Vacationeer ConceptFrom the Spearminted exterior to the custom-trimmed and expanded interior space, the Jeep Vacationeer concept is a premium SUV that combines comfort and adventure with modern capability while honoring the legendary heritage of the Jeep brand. And with a nostalgic nod, the JPP design team is quenching the desire of many a classic Jeep aficionado, meticulously fitting the Vacationeer concept with unique bodyside woodgrain graphics that harken back to Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models that traversed both town and country from the late 1960s through the early 1990s. Ready for any challenging excursion that Moab has to offer, 35-inch BFGoodrich mud-terrain tires, wrapped around 18-by-9-inch bead grip 701 Method racing wheels, provide a natural 1.5-inch lift for superior off-road performance. Larger wheel openings and custom bodyside flare extensions add to the aggressive look. Front and rear skid plates provide underbody protection while a front mounted Warn winch addresses difficult off-road situations. At the front of the white, Rhino-lined roof, three 11-inch TYRI LED lights provide exceptional forward lighting. Affixed to the roof of the Vacationeer concept is a custom, carbon-fiber RedTail Overland Skyloft – a climate-controlled oasis with sleeping space for two people and enough windows to soak in the panoramic views. The stock second- and third-row seats have been removed to accommodate integration of the Skyloft. A custom weatherproof, pass-thru entrance allows easy access from the interior floor to the Skyloft. A fore/aft sliding door and a small step, which also doubles as a usable table, eases access. The rear space features a bed-lined cargo floor that can handle outdoor elements with ease, such as escaping a downpour or removing muddy hiking gear. The Jeep brand turned to renowned fashion designer and Wagoneer enthusiast/owner Kiel James Patrick for the front Tupelo leather seats. Patrick, a native New Englander, displays his profound appreciation for authentic Americana with custom fabric inserts featuring classic Jeep vehicles within a distinctive and charming New England-inspired pattern. ""For over three decades, the Jeep Wagoneer has been more than just a vehicle to me; it has literally been part of the fabric of my life threaded through my most cherished journeys,"" said Patrick. ""As a designer and lifelong Jeep 4x4 owner, this was a dream project. I could not be more excited to honor the heritage and stories of the Jeep brand."" Power in the Jeep Vacationeer concept comes from the 3.0-liter Hurricane Twin Turbo 510 engine, delivering 510 horsepower and 500 lb.-ft. of torque. The powerful Hurricane engine provides premium performance while also delivering improved fuel economy versus many competitors' naturally aspirated V-8 and boosted six-cylinder engines. Jeep BrandBuilt on more than 80 years of legendary heritage, Jeep® is the authentic SUV brand that delivers legendary off-road capability, interior refinement, high-tech features and versatility to people who seek extraordinary journeys.
