Motley Fool,Why VinFast Auto Stock Dropped This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-vinfast-auto-stock-dropped-190735377.html,VinFast is spending money expanding while EV prices are dropping.,"It has been a mixed week for stocks in the electric vehicle (EV) sector. Many EV stocks are extending year-to-date losses. One of those is Vietnamese EV maker VinFast Auto (NASDAQ: VFS).Just as VinFast is working to expand globally, growing EV competition is leading to price wars. That's especially bad news for EV start-ups like VinFast. Investors have knocked its stock down by more than 35% so far in 2024, including a drop of 8% this week, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. That comes as price cuts from more established EV companies expanded in recent days.Increased spending and larger lossesVinFast has expansion plans across the globe. Its first North American plant is under construction in North Carolina. It is also adding dealer partners in North America as well as Indonesia. Most recently the company broke ground for another new factory in India.VinFast is also ramping up production as these projects are underway. The company delivered nearly 35,000 EVs in 2023, but expects to ship 100,000 in 2024.But slowing EV sales growth is causing larger EV makers to cut prices, notably in VinFast's local Asian market. BYD and Tesla have both been working to increase sales in China. This week BYD slashed the price of its cheapest car, the Seagull, by 5%. That brought the cost for consumers to the equivalent of less than $10,000.There's plenty of other competition in China as well. So while VinFast expects 2024 capital expenditure to remain on pace with last year, it has to plan for lower selling prices. VinFast has already reported a 15% increase in net loss from 2022 to 2023. Investors are likely expecting that pattern to continue in 2024 and are driving the stock lower as a result.Should you invest $1,000 in VinFast Auto Ltd. right now?Before you buy stock in VinFast Auto Ltd., consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and VinFast Auto Ltd. wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Why Marvell Technology Stock Was Sliding Today,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-marvell-technology-stock-sliding-190300675.html,The chip-maker's shares slipped on disappointing guidance.,"Shares of chip-maker Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) were sliding today after the company delivered results in line with expectations but offered weaker-than-expected guidance for the first quarter.Marvell, which specializes in networking and storage solutions, is expected to benefit from the boom in AI, but high expectations were already baked into the stock after shares had doubled over the last year coming into the report.As of 1:07 p.m. ET, the stock was down 10.1% on the news.Image source: Getty images.Marvell falls short of expectationsMarvell is still sensitive to the overall chip cycle, which is just starting to return to growth after an earlier slump, and revenue in the quarter rose just 1% to $1.43 billion, which edged out guidance at $1.42 billion.Like the rest of the semiconductor industry, Marvell saw strong growth in the data-center segment, where revenue jumped 54% to $765.3 million, though revenue in every other category fell double digits, including enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial.Gross margin in the quarter declined from 47.5% to 46.5%, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) operating expenses rose as well, which included increased stock-based compensation and a $26 million restructuring charge. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were flat at $0.46, which matched expectations.CEO Matt Murphy said, ""AI drove strong growth in our data center end market revenue,"" adding, ""as a critical enabler of accelerated infrastructure for AI, Marvell is well-positioned to capitalize on this massive technology inflection.""What's next for MarvellMarvell expects demand to continue to grow in the data-center segment, driven by AI shipments, but overall guidance disappointed as it still sees weakness in other segments.For the first quarter, the company expects revenue of $1.15 billion +/- 5%, which was short of the consensus at $1.37 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.18 to $0.28, missing estimates at $0.40.Story continuesThat guidance explains why the stock is down today. While Marvell is benefiting from the AI boom, it will take time for the rest of the business to return to growth. After the stock's gains over the last year, investors will have to be patient.Should you invest $1,000 in Marvell Technology right now?Before you buy stock in Marvell Technology, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Marvell Technology wasn’t one of them.

Warnings about a consolidation have surfaced after the benchmark gauge’s 35% surge since the start of last year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 1.5%. Nvidia Corp. halted a six-day rally, Tesla Inc. extended this week’s slide to 13% and Broadcom Inc. sank on soft chip sales.“The issue again is that across many levels we are seeing both overbought/extended conditions alongside notable divergences between price action and momentum,” said Dan Wantrobski at Janney Montgomery Scott. “This very much creates vulnerability to a pullback in the coming weeks/months.”Never miss an episode. Follow the Big Take podcast on iHeart, Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. Read the transcript.A report Friday showed the economy continued to add jobs — without spurring a surge in wages, which could hinder the disinflationary process. The figures revived hopes the Federal Reserve will be able to achieve a soft landing, allowing officials to start easing policy this year, but without running the risk of doing that too soon.“The report didn’t necessarily amount to an ‘all-clear’ signal for the Fed, but there also didn’t appear to be anything in it that would derail its plan to cut rates,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley.Treasury two-year yields fell three basis points to 4.47%, with traders almost fully pricing in a quarter-point Fed cut in June. The dollar was set for its longest losing streak since October. Gold hit a fresh peak. Bitcoin briefly touched $70,000.Story continuesThe US jobless rate climbed to a two-year high in February even as hiring remained healthy, pointing to a cooler yet resilient laboWhile bulls argue that its valuation based on future earnings growth is relatively cheap, some potential investors may balk at the price.r market.Nonfarm payrolls advanced 275,000 last month following a combined 167,000 downward revision to the prior two months. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9% and wage gains slowed.The report was seen as being “all over the place” by Seema Shah at Principal Asset Management and several other market observers. Nonetheless, Shah sees the broad figures as somewhat market positive.“If the economy can continue to add jobs, without triggering a resurgence in wage growth, the Fed will achieve its soft landing,” she noted.In other words, this report confirms that the labor market is strong — but not overheating — which means the Fed is still on track for rate cuts this year, says Sonu Varghese at Carson Group.“Labor is rolling, and wage inflation is rolling over — the Fed is threading the needle on its dual mandate,” said Jamie Cox at Harris Financial Group. “No one expected this result, but it’s happening.”Swap contracts that predict the Fed’s decisions repriced to lower rate levels, implying traders expect close to 100 basis points of Fed easing by year-end. Last month, these contracts briefly priced in less than 75 basis points of easing this year, down from more than 150 basis points seen early in 2024.To Gina Bolvin at Bolvin Wealth Management Group, the fact that unemployment ticked up was the biggest takeaway of Friday’s numbers. She’s among those betting the odds of a rate cut in June are increasing as the Fed would become worried if unemployment reached 4%.“If we are genuinely seeing the unemployment rate having troughed and moving higher and wage growth slowing, then it obviously pushes the door for rate cuts open wider,” said Charles Hepworth at GAM Investments.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, testifying this week before lawmakers, said he believed the labor market was “coming into better balance between supply and demand.” He also suggested the central bank is getting close to the confidence it needs to start lowering interest rates.Ian Lyngen at BMO Capital Markets says soft wage figures were notable.“If nothing else, this update on wage inflation reflects Powell’s messaging that the first cut is nearing,” he noted.About $4.4 billion was pulled from tech funds in the week through March 6, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. The outflows come as Apple Inc. shares entered a technical correction this month, amid concerns about the firm’s slumping iPhone sales and regulatory pressures.Hartnett — who has taken a more neutral tone on stocks this year after remaining bearish in 2023 — said equity markets are showing “abnormal gains” in “abnormal times.” That’s left positioning “stretched and extended” ahead of expectations for an eventual rate cut by the Fed, he wrote in a note.Nvidia, the poster child of the artificial-intelligence frenzy that has powered the bull market, lost traction on Friday. But it’s scorching rally this year has sent it well above the level where it last split its shares. Some see the AI giant well placed to do so again.The company last announced a four-for-one stock split in May 2021, when it was trading at about $600 per share. The stock topped $900 earlier this week. The reasoning Nvidia gave for its 2021 split was “to make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees,” according to a statement.To be sure, Nvidia hasn’t made any indication that it would split its shares anytime soon.Corporate Highlights:A United Airlines Holdings Inc. aircraft ran off the taxiway into a grassy area after landing at Houston on Friday, marking the third headline-grabbing incident this week involving the carrier’s Boeing Co. planes.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is set to win more than $5 billion in federal grants to support a chipmaking project in Arizona, according to people familiar with the matter, in what would mark a major milestone in President Joe Biden’s effort to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing.Eli Lilly & Co.’s Alzheimer’s disease drug donanemab faces further delays in gaining US approval, with regulators planning to hold a hearing of external advisers to explore how safe the therapy is and how well it works.Gap Inc. reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, a sign that efforts to turn the storied apparel retailer around are bearing fruit.Huawei Technologies Co. and its partner Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. relied on US technology to produce an advanced chip in China last year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Novo Nordisk A/S expects the price of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy to drop as more patients get access to the treatment via insurers and health-care systems, paving the way for broader use, Chief Executive Officer Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said.Some of the main moves in markets:StocksThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% as of 1:36 p.m. New York timeThe Nasdaq 100 fell 1.6%The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changedThe MSCI World index fell 0.3%CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%The euro fell 0.1% to $1.0936The British pound rose 0.3% to $1.2844The Japanese yen rose 0.7% to 147.00 per dollarCryptocurrenciesBitcoin rose 1.8% to $68,529.79Ether rose 1.4% to $3,929.83BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.08%Germany’s 10-year yield declined four basis points to 2.27%Britain’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 3.98%CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 1.5% to $77.75 a barrelSpot gold rose 0.9% to $2,179.14 an ounceThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.--With assistance from Felice Maranz, Liz Capo McCormick, Elizabeth Stanton and Carmen Reinicke.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never BuiltHow Microsoft’s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing’s Great FirewallThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World’s Most Coveted Office ChairAirbus Is Soaring at Boeing’s ExpenseElon Musk Is Right About OpenAI But for the Wrong Reasons©2024 Bloomberg L.P."

The gauge has dropped 1.1% this week and is poised for its biggest weekly decline this year.Even as traders await next week’s consumer price report, a slew of US labor data this week pointed to some softening in the pace of hiring and helped reinforce market speculation that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in June. The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged Thursday and lowered its inflation outlook, bolstering expectations it will cut rates in June as well.“The dollar’s selloff may be overdone, particularly given the dovish takeaway from the ECB yesterday,” said Jane Foley, Head of FX strategy at Rabobank in London. Recent data have allowed the market “to see what it wanted to see, which is a softening in labor market conditions,” she said, noting that overall US employment growth remains solid.The dollar extended declines on Friday despite a better-than-expected February nonfarm payrolls number. Downward revisions to prior data and an uptick in the unemployment rate to 3.9% provided sufficient fodder for dollar bears.“The market was indeed going short dollars into NFP, and this momentum looks set to continue,” said Yusuke Miyairi, an FX strategist at Nomura International Plc in London. Still, he cautioned that for the softer USD “to become a trend, a green-light from the Fed is needed, such as an unchanged or more dovish dot plot in this month’s Summary of Economic Projections.”Story continuesPolicymakers will announce their interest-rate decision on March 20, and with no change expected.Friday’s “messy but net soft” US data “neither adds significant pressure to front-load easing nor to postpone it,” said Patrick Locke, an FX strategist with JPMorgan in New York.

Yahoo Finance,February jobs report settles Wall Street fears inflation could take rate cuts off the table,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/february-jobs-report-settles-wall-street-fears-inflation-could-take-rate-cuts-off-the-table-174153030.html,New labor market data helped ease fears that persistent wage growth could bring a resurgence in inflation and delay Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.,"The February jobs report calmed concerns that a rise in inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to hold off on reducing interest rates this year.The data, released Friday, showed that the US economy added far fewer jobs in the previous two months than previously believed and signs of slowing wage growth are beginning to emerge.Meanwhile, an uptick in unemployment back to 3.9%, in line with its highest level seen in the last two years, bolstered the narrative that the labor market remains resilient but isn't growing at pace uncomfortable for the Fed in its fight against inflation.""Alongside the rise in the unemployment rate to a two-year high and a much weaker rise in wages, there is less reason now to be concerned that renewed labour market strength will drive inflation higher again,"" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Entering Friday's report, Wall Street strategists had grown increasingly concerned that a resurgence in inflation could halt the Fed's plans to cut interest rates this year. A week ago, Apollo Global's chief economist Torsten Sløk said the Fed likely wouldn't cut rates at all this year given ""sticky"" wage growth and concerning underlying trends in inflation.(Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)But after a string of fresh economic data, other economists across the Street feel little fuel has been added to that potential fire for markets.On Wednesday, the latest JOLTS report showed job openings approaching a three-year low while confidence among workers appears to be ebbing. The quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, slipped to 2.1%, down from 2.2% in the previous month and marking its lowest level since August 2020.This, Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten said, is a welcome sign on the inflation front.""The decline in the quits rate is consistent with moderation in wage growth, which remains too rapid for the Fed,"" Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.Story continues""Most measures of annual wage growth are still running above 4%, higher than the roughly 3.5% pace that is consistent with 2% inflation, assuming trend productivity growth of about 1.5%. The Fed does not need to see wage growth at 3.5% or inflation at 2% to begin cutting rates but needs to be confident that those measures are on a sustainable path back to those targets.""In February, year-over-year wage growth came in at 4.3%. But on a monthly basis wages increased just 0.1%, down from the 0.6% last month. This economists say, is a crucial indicator that wage growth could keep slowing.""The rise in unemployment and easing in wage inflation should make the [Federal Open Market Committee] a little more confident that the labor market is moving back into balance,"" JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Friday's market action reflects that investors believe interest rate cuts are still coming this year.Investor bets on when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates were little changed following the latest jobs report, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Markets are still pricing in a 78% chance the first Fed cut comes in June. For the year, investors are still pricing in a range of three to four rate cuts this year.This falls in line with commentary from Fed chair Jerome Powell earlier this week who said during his annual testimony on Capitol Hill he still expects cuts ""at some point this year.""Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the ""Federal Reserve's Semi-Annual Monetary Policy Report"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2024. REUTERS/Bonnie Cash (REUTERS / Reuters)While a key reading on inflation scheduled for release on March 12 could challenge the narrative once again, BlackRock's CIO of global fixed income Rick Rieder explained the current economic backdrop leaves ""maintenance cuts"" from the Fed on the table starting in May or June. This, Rieder said, would be a welcome sign for stocks.""Historically speaking, this kind of an environment has been good for market returns, as capital begins to move out of cash and cash-like accounts into more productive areas,"" Rieder wrote in a note to clients on Friday.Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
