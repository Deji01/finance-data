Motley Fool,Is Caterpillar Stock a Buy?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/caterpillar-stock-buy-193200412.html,"The cyclical stock is trading close to an all-time high, but is there to room for it to run?","Caterpillar's (NYSE: CAT) stock trades close to its recent all-time high, and the company is firing on all cylinders right now. Revenue and profit came in at record levels in 2023, demonstrating excellent pricing power throughout the year as its equipment resonates with customers.And management upgraded its medium-term targets for cash flow and profit margin. There's a lot to like about Caterpillar, but is it enough to make the stock a buy?Caterpillar's medium-term targetsManagement's guidance implicitly recognizes the inherent cyclicality in Caterpillar's sales, earnings, and cash flow. The chart below shows how volatile its revenue and operating profit margin (and by extension, its profit) have been over the years.The cyclicality is understandable when considering its key end markets, including nonresidential construction, infrastructure, mining machinery, energy, transportation, and power.CAT Revenue (TTM) ChartAs for management's guidance, due to the company's relatively high fixed costs, its margins tend to expand when revenue increases and contract when revenue declines. That's why current guidance for operating profit margin is for 10% to 14% with $42 billion in revenue, rising to 18% to 22% with $72 billion in revenue.For reference, revenue was $67.5 billion in 2023, with an adjusted operating profit of 20.5%.Management also estimates its machine, energy & transportation (ME&T) free cash flow (FCF) through the cycle. It's not uncommon for industrial companies to give FCF guidance in this way since it eliminates the distortive impact of their financial services business (lending to customers to finance purchases) on cash flow.The good news from the recent results is that management upgraded its estimates for FCF throughout the cycle.SegmentPrevious Target Range Through the CycleCurrent Target Range Through the Cycle2023 Actual2024 GuidanceMachinery, equipment & transportation free cash flow$4 billion to $8 billion$5 billion to $10 billion$10 billion""Top half of the updated range""Data source: Caterpillar.Story continuesIs Caterpillar overvalued?These ranges are useful for valuation purposes. For example, valuing a mature industrial company on 20 times its FCF is reasonable. But given the cyclicality of its earnings and FCF, taking the average FCF through the cycle makes more sense. In the case of the updated guidance, that's $7.5 billion, giving a target market cap of $150 billion. Note that this figure is $13 billion below the current market cap of $163 billion.This is a particularly relevant point as management's FCF guidance for 2024 suggests its earnings and FCF have peaked in the current cycle. On that basis, the stock is overvalued.Caterpillar can still outperform expectationsThat said, investors shouldn't count out the stock just yet, not least for two key reasons.First, Caterpillar is a cyclical stock whose earnings prospects depend on conditions in its end markets. These conditions can change throughout the year. Indeed, the company's actual earnings exceeded Wall Street estimates in every quarter of 2023.Moreover, lower interest rates will inevitably boost nonresidential construction. And they could boost demand for commodities and, in turn, capital spending in mining and energy. Also, underlying demand for infrastructure should hold up, given spending commitments in the infrastructure bill.Image source: Getty Images.The second reason is somewhat demonstrated above. Going back to the argument that Caterpillar should be valued at the midpoint of its targeted FCF range, it's worth noting that the previous midpoint was $6 billion, implying a $120 billion market cap, and as discussed earlier, the current midpoint is $7.5 billion, implying $150 billion in market cap.In the real world, investors don't simply upgrade their price targets by 25% on the day when managements upgrade medium-term targets in this manner. Instead, they invest ahead in anticipation of these events.In this case, management raised its targeted FCF guidance on the back of Caterpillar's sustained ability to generate operating profit over its cost of capital. The company can continue to improve this metric by growing its services revenue. Management aims to hit $28 billion in services revenue by 2026, from just $14 billion in 2016 and $23 billion in 2023. Doing so would reduce the cyclicality in its earnings and improve its return on capital and FCF through the cycle.What it means to investorsAll told, Caterpillar looks overvalued. But suppose you are optimistic about lower interest rates later in the year and are bullish on the outlook for commodity and construction spending. In that case, it won't be hard to see the upside potential to Caterpillar's earnings in 2024 and, quite possibly, its FCF generation over the medium term.Should you invest $1,000 in Caterpillar right now?Before you buy stock in Caterpillar, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Caterpillar wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,90 Billion Reasons Why Buying Nvidia Stock Is a No-Brainer Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/90-billion-reasons-why-buying-192200500.html,The company is getting a nice chunk of its revenue from a fast-growing niche in the AI semiconductor market.,"Any doubts about Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) ability to sustain its red-hot stock market momentum were put to rest last week following the release of the company's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results (for the quarter ending Jan. 28). The semiconductor giant not only crushed Wall Street's expectations handsomely, but it also guided strongly for the current quarter, suggesting that its artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled growth is here to stay.Not surprisingly, Nvidia stock soared impressively following its earnings release. Additionally, analysts have started raising their growth forecasts for the current and the next two fiscal years, suggesting that its outstanding growth is here to stay.NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartHowever, a key statement from Nvidia CFO Colette Kress on the company's earnings conference call suggests that it can sustain its terrific growth for a much longer period: ""We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference.""Let's dive into the details.AI inferencing could help Nvidia maintain its supremacy in this lucrative marketNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) shot into the limelight once it was evident that they are playing a mission-critical role in training large language models (LLMs), which form the backbone of popular generative AI applications such as ChatGPT. Multiple cloud service providers have lined up to get their hands on Nvidia's GPUs to train their AI models and bring generative AI services to the market. As a result, Nvidia controls a whopping 90% share of the AI training chip market.As it turns out, the demand for Nvidia's flagship H100 AI GPU is so strong that customers are willing to wait between 36 and 52 weeks to get their hands on this piece of hardware. Nvidia is shoring up its supply capacity to meet that solid demand, and that explains why the company is expected to keep growing at a terrific pace and more than double its revenue by fiscal 2027 as compared to fiscal 2024's reading of $60.9 billion.Story continuesNVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year ChartHowever, Kress' comment that 40% of Nvidia's data center revenue is coming from selling chips used for AI inference applications suggests that it could keep up its eye-popping growth for a very long time. That's because AI inference chips are expected to account for the majority of the overall AI chip market. According to technology news and analysis provider TechSpot, inference is expected to account for 45% of the AI chip market, while AI training chips will account for 15% of this space in the future.That's not surprising, as once an AI model is trained using general-purpose computing chips such as graphics cards, which Nvidia sells, it will be put to use to generate results using new data sets. This process of generating results from an already trained AI model is known as inferencing. By 2030, Verified Market Research estimates that the demand for AI inference chips could jump from an estimated $16 billion in 2023 to almost $91 billion in 2030.Based on Kress' statement, Nvidia sold $19 billion worth of AI inference chips last year (40% of its total data center revenue of $47.5 billion for the year). That's higher than the $16 billion revenue estimate from Verified Market Research. This means that Nvidia is dominating the AI inference market already, and the potential revenue opportunity bodes well for the company's future.If the AI inference chip market indeed generates $90 billion in revenue as Verified Market Research estimates, then Nvidia's data center revenue could keep growing nicely through the end of the decade and supercharge its overall business.What's more, Nvidia is taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in the AI inference space with a potential move into custom chips, formally known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips are specifically designed for AI inference purposes thanks to their computing power and low power consumption. According to third-party estimates, the market for custom chips used for inferencing could jump from an estimated $30 billion in 2023 to $50 billion in 2025.In all, it is easy to see why analysts are forecasting outstanding growth for Nvidia.The valuation makes the stock an enticing buyNvidia's earnings and revenue are set to increase rapidly in the coming years. The market should ideally reward Nvidia stock with handsome gains if it can indeed deliver on that front.That's why buying this AI stock right now looks like a no-brainer, especially considering its forward earnings multiple of 33 is currently lower than its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 39. Meanwhile, Nvidia remains extremely cheap when you look at its price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio).The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing a company's P/E ratio by the estimated annual earnings growth it could deliver. As the following chart shows, Nvidia's PEG ratio is way below 1, the reading below which a stock is considered to be undervalued.NVDA PEG Ratio ChartAll this means that investors are still getting a good deal on Nvidia despite its big surge in the past year, and they should consider buying this AI stock hand over fist given the moves it is making to ensure solid growth.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Where Will Moderna Stock Be in 5 Years?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/where-moderna-stock-5-years-181700502.html,Can Moderna be a good stock to buy if it can no longer count on billions in revenue from its COVID vaccine?,"Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) was a top stock to own during the early stages of the pandemic. The COVID-19 vaccine maker reached a market cap of nearly $200 billion at its peak in 2021. But nowadays, with revenue from its vaccine diminishing and no longer being a strong growth catalyst, investors have become bearish on the healthcare stock. Since 2022, shares of Moderna have fallen by more than 60%.But all hope isn't lost for the business. The company has been working on its pipeline and developing new drugs. What might the business look like in five years, and is the stock worth buying and hanging onto until then?Investors shouldn't expect much COVID-related revenueIt has been around four years since COVID crashed the stock market, albeit temporarily. The pandemic sent the healthcare industry into a panic, with vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer providing relief and stability to global economies. But odds are that in five years, COVID vaccine revenue will be minimal at best for Moderna.The company just released its latest results and revenue totaled $6.8 billion for 2023, coming mainly from its COVID vaccine. That's down sharply from the $19.3 billion in sales Moderna recorded in 2022.Moderna is projecting $4 billion in revenue this year, which factors in approval of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, which the company anticipates should come within the first half of the year. The company is still working on a combination shot for COVID and the flu, which looks to still be part of its long-term strategy.But with Moderna scaling back its COVID operations and demand for the shots likely being lower in the future, I would be surprised if this were still a major source of revenue for the business in five years. If it is still relying on COVID revenue, that could be a bad sign, indicating that the company hasn't come out with more promising products along the way.Moderna's operations will likely be broaderExpanding beyond COVID is going to be key to Moderna stock being a good long-term investment. The company does have products in its pipeline that could be blockbusters, including its RSV vaccine (peak sales of up to $2.1 billion) and its vaccine for the cytomegalovirus (potentially $5 billion at its peak). But it will take years for sales from those products, assuming they obtain approval, to flow through to the business.Story continuesIn the meantime, the company is also working on developing other products, such as mRNA-3927, which is a treatment for propionic acidemia (an organic acid disorder). Its most promising product may be the personalized cancer vaccine it is working on with Merck, which is currently in phase 3 trials. It could potentially treat multiple cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, and other types of tumors.Is Moderna's stock a good buy today?Moderna has a lot of trials going on and may have a lot of potential sources of revenue in the future. But this isn't a stock I'd buy today as there isn't anything terribly exciting in its pipeline outside of its personalized cancer vaccine. If that proves to be a winner, the stock could surge. But flu vaccines, COVID shots, and RSV vaccines may not be enough to make the business profitable in the long run.Even at a reduced market cap of $36 billion, investors would be paying a big premium for the healthcare stock, which is why I expect Moderna's value to decline over the next five years.Should you invest $1,000 in Moderna right now?Before you buy stock in Moderna, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Moderna wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,This Dividend King's Yield Has Never Been This High. Time to Buy the Stock?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-kings-yield-never-high-181700303.html,Wall Street is seemingly doubting Hormel and its 58-year dividend growth streak.,"Dividend stocks with high yields are often a red flag. When investors don't trust the dividend, the share price falls, and the yield rises abnormally high. A company that consistently raises its dividend is a green flag. Increasing dividends signal management's confidence in the business.So, what happens when a Dividend King, a stock with 50 or more years of consecutive dividend growth, trades at its highest-ever dividend yield? That's where Hormel Foods (NYSE: HRL) finds itself today.The question is whether Hormel's yield is an opportunity or a trap.Here is what you need to know.Hormel's recent adversityHormel Foods sells a variety of packaged foods and meats to retailers and restaurants worldwide. Some of the company's best-known brands include Spam, Skippy, Planters, Jennie-O, and Hormel-branded meat products. The company has been in business for generations, but you can see below how revenue and operating margins have trailed off recently. Note that the big jump in revenue was due to acquiring Planters in 2021.HRL Operating Margin (TTM) ChartWhat's the culprit? The pandemic caused supply chain disruptions and inflation to pressure Hormel in 2022, which continued in 2023. Management has cited operational changes and investments to address the supply chain problems. This transformation, as management calls it, could create an additional $250 million in operating income by 2026.Additionally, Hormel has dealt with challenging issues like bird flu and a soft market hurting its international business, especially in China. Fortunately, management is hoping this begins to recover in the fourth quarter of 2024. Hormel should ultimately be judged on its financial strength, because it can't control something like bird flu or broad weakness in the market.A solid start to 2024Management had some good things to say when Hormel recently reported its earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 28. The company reaffirmed full-year guidance, citing growth in its food service segment and the expected rebound in international sales. Volume did jump 11% year-over-year on higher exports, so this should carry through to sales growth as the Chinese market rebounds.Story continuesThe company's operating margin did drop to 9.5% from 9.7% in the year-ago period, but investors should look for that to start turning around. The supply chain transformation is expected to be a modest earnings contributor in 2024, so it should start to make a bigger impact over the next two years and beyond.Overall, it's a solid start to Hormel's fiscal year 2024. The next three quarters will be important for showing numbers to support the notion that Hormel's actions to improve its profitability are bearing fruit.Is the dividend safe?For now, Wall Street seems reluctant to give Hormel the benefit of the doubt. You can see that Hormel's yield has never been this high. Over the past five years, the stock price has dropped and the dividend has risen. Is Hormel's financial condition as dire as the dividend yield would have investors believe? Well, not really.The dividend payout ratio is at 76% of cash flow, leaving the company wiggle room to pay the dividend. The company's operating income was roughly $1 billion over the past year, and $777 million was free cash flow. Hormel's dividend will have plenty of breathing room if management achieves its goals to grow operating income.HRL Dividend Yield ChartAdditionally, the balance sheet is in fine shape. Management has traditionally been conservative with debt, though it made an exception when it bought the Planters nuts brand for $3.35 billion in 2021. Even now, though, leverage is just 1.9 times net debt to EBITDA. That's well below the 3 ratio I generally start to worry about.The verdict is...There's no doubt that Hormel is going through some bumps and bruises today, but the company remains very financially solid. This is not a yield trap. Hormel is a fine dividend stock to buy and hold long-term. The market could even boost the stock's valuation once it becomes clear that these challenges are in the past.Today, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 19. Analysts are currently down on the stock, estimating mid-single-digit earnings growth over the next three to five years. But if management's company transformation boosts operating income by $250 million, Hormel should have no issues outperforming analysts' expectations.Should you invest $1,000 in Hormel Foods right now?Before you buy stock in Hormel Foods, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Hormel Foods wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,"Billionaire Dan Loeb Has 27% of His Third Point Portfolio in 3 Brilliant ""Magnificent Seven"" Stocks, but Completely Sold Out of Another",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-dan-loeb-27-third-180800486.html,One of the best hedge fund managers of all time is banking on these tech leaders.,"Daniel Loeb is something of an iconic figure in the annals of Wall Street. The billionaire is CEO of Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb secured his place in investor history by starting Third Point with just $3 million in seed money -- collected from family and friends -- and parlaying that into a $6 billion financial empire. In 2022, Loeb made the list of the ""Best Hedge Fund Managers of All Time.""So when Loeb talks, Wall Street listens.Over the past year, Loeb's Third Point's holdings have been heavily weighted toward the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. The common thread that unites these industry leaders is artificial intelligence (AI). They were also all among the top performers in the Nasdaq Composite last year:Nvidia: up 239%.Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META): up 194%.Tesla: up 102%.Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): up 81%.Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG): up 58%.Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): up 57%.Apple: up 48%.Image source: Getty Images.Loeb has made no bones about the onset of generative AI, calling it ""transformative"" and saying ""profound economic upheaval"" coming. ""We believe generative and other forms of AI could compare to the Industrial Revolution but compressed into a period of months and years rather than decades,"" he said.Let's look at which Magnificent Seven stocks dominated his portfolio in the fourth quarter and which one he sold completely out of.1. Microsoft: 11.5% of holdingsMicrosoft earned its place on Loeb's list thanks to a quick pivot to embrace AI. The company integrated AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its existing products and services. However, the biggest potential opportunity comes from its AI assistant, Copilot, which helps streamline and automate a variety of tasks, significantly enhancing worker productivity. Demand for the product has been robust.Loeb has minced no words about its potential. ""Microsoft's introduction of its AI-assisted Office Copilot software ... could increase its revenues by as much as $25 billion or more on software sales alone.""Story continuesIt's worth noting that Loeb trimmed his position in Microsoft by more than 9% during the quarter -- but the position is actually larger than when the quarter began. Why? The stock jumped 19% during the fourth quarter, so even as Loeb took a little off the top, the total value of his Microsoft holdings grew.At 34 times forward earnings, Microsoft might seem a little pricey, but given its pole position in AI, it's deserving of a premium.2. Amazon: 9.7% of holdingsLoeb's stake in Amazon shouldn't be a surprise, as he's held the position for years. In early 2022, when the company's market cap was $1.6 trillion, Loeb stated that he believed there was more than $1 trillion in ""untapped value"" in Amazon. He estimates that its online retail business was worth more than $1 trillion alone, while its cloud infrastructure business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- was worth more than $1.5 trillion.Furthermore, Loeb has argued that ""the most direct consequence"" of the accelerating adoption of generative AI is that it ""will drive faster revenue growth"" for cloud infrastructure services providers -- including Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. He went on to say that such services ""are the 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush and should benefit"" no matter who wins the AI revolution.Loeb trimmed his Amazon holdings by about 10% during the fourth quarter, but -- as with Microsoft -- the value of the position increased. This was thanks to Amazon's stock price gains of 20% during the fourth quarter.However, at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is still very much a bargain.3. Meta Platforms: 6.2% of holdingsIn keeping with Loeb's big bets on the Magnificent Seven and AI, he established a sizable position in Meta Platforms in the third quarter and added again in Q4. Meta's ties to AI are well established, as the company has long used these advanced algorithms to help target its advertising while surfacing relevant content for users on its various social media sites. Furthermore, the recovery of the advertising market is still ongoing, representing additional upside potential for Meta.There's also Meta's foray into generative AI with its Large Language Model Meta AI, which is available on all the major cloud platforms. This represents a new source of revenue for the company.While he hasn't explained his reasoning, Loeb obviously believes the stock is still a good value. While not addressing Meta specifically, Loeb's penchant for ""high-quality companies trading at reasonable valuations"" is well documented. Indeed, Meta Platforms stock was selling for 24 times earnings to close out 2023, a discount to the S&P 500, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.4. Alphabet: 0% of holdingsLoeb closed out of his entire position in Alphabet, selling all 900,000 shares of Class A stock valued at roughly $125 million at the end of the quarter. Loeb has been mum as to his mindset, but broader portfolio shifts might provide some insight. In addition to Alphabet and trimming his Microsoft and Amazon holdings, Loeb significantly reduced his stake in other technology stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Intercontinental Exchange, and Uber, among others. At the same time, the billionaire investor initiated positions in several utilities, including Verizon and Vistra, while increasing his stake in Pacific Gas & Electric. This suggests Loeb was rebalancing his portfolio and saw greater opportunities in utility stocks, particularly given the epic run in tech stocks over the past year.To be clear, I believe Loeb made a mistake selling out of Alphabet. It stands to benefit from the advertising rebound and the same AI tailwinds that will drive the other Magnificent Seven stocks higher. Furthermore Alphabet is selling at just 24 times earnings, a fair discount to the market.Where to invest $1,000 right nowWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Motley Fool,Better Blockbuster-Drug Stock: Novo Nordisk vs. Eli Lilly,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/better-blockbuster-drug-stock-novo-175100961.html,"This is a close contest, and it'll go on for at least a few more rounds.","Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are two of the hottest pharmaceutical stocks of the past three years. Both companies have marked returns far in excess of the market's, thanks to popular demand for their freshly launched medications that treat obesity as well as type 2 diabetes. Both medicines are blockbuster drugs -- defined as those that generate annual sales totaling more than $1 billion. Blockbuster medicines tend to generate a lot of buzz, and the businesses that can get more drugs with blockbuster potential out the door are likely to outperform those with fewer.So which of these two giants has more blockbuster potential on its roster? Let's answer that question by examining each pharma's portfolio to identify the most likely candidates for billion-dollar drugs.The case for Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk has more than one billion-dollar drug today, with even more on the way. The most recent star performer you've probably already heard of is called Ozempic, which treats type 2 diabetes and is based on a molecule called semaglutide. The company's leading obesity medicine, Wegovy, is based on the same compound, and it's a similarly big earner. Around 90% ($31.2 billion) of Novo Nordisk's revenue in 2023 was derived from sales of diabetes and obesity medicines.In the future, Novo Nordisk is hoping to apply semaglutide to other indications that could also end up minting blockbuster drugs if they get approved. It has a phase 3 program investigating whether it can treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, also known as NASH), a liver disease. One group puts the market for such drugs as large as $16.3 billion by 2030. There's also another phase 3 trial targeting its use in Alzheimer's disease.But semaglutide is far from the only lucrative vein in the company's portfolio. It has a couple of late-stage programs for treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure, as well as a late-stage program for chronic kidney disease (CKD). All of those candidates could easily become blockbuster drugs, given the massive sizes of their target markets.Story continuesSo Novo Nordisk has no shortage of potential big winners that'll be stepping up for approval in the next couple of years. That means investors will have plenty of catalysts to possibly power outsized returns if things go as planned with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The case for Eli LillyMuch like Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly's pipeline is chock-full of near-term opportunities to launch winning therapies, and it has a few strong performers in hand as well. Its rising star of the moment is Zepbound, an obesity medicine that began coasting toward blockbuster status shortly after its sibling medicine Mounjaro, targeted at type 2 diabetes, reached it. Mounjaro brought in $5.1 billion in 2023, and Zepbound sold $175.8 million in its first months on the market.Both Mounjaro and Zepbound are based on the molecule tirzepatide. In addition to testing it in phase 2 trials for MASH, Eli Lilly is testing tirzepatide in phase 3 trials for treating cardiovascular disease. So it could soon pick up at least two more blockbuster-ready indications, which is a bullish sign for the stock, to say the least.It's also trying to enter the Alzheimer's disease market, and regulators are reviewing whether to grant approval to one of its candidates right now. As if that weren't enough, its pipeline features mid- to late-stage programs for pain, arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and cardiovascular disease -- all of which are large and growing markets with annual spending in the tens of billions of dollars annually. It won't need to succeed with all of its attempts in order to have multiple new valuable medicines in hand in the near term.The verdict isn't the most meaningfulBased on comparing their pipelines, Eli Lilly has a couple more opportunities to hit home runs than Novo Nordisk does, but the contest is far from being a blowout. Both companies are very likely to make multiple high-earning medicines across the short term, medium term, and long term. Either business could make for a good investment, and it might even make sense to buy both to take advantage of their efforts to penetrate the type 2 diabetes and obesity markets.On that note, the pair aren't exactly fighting tooth and nail to secure market share in those markets. In fact, Novo Nordisk's management anticipates that there will continue to be so much demand for Ozempic and Wegovy that it won't need to get into a direct competitive fight for some time.

Motley Fool,"Is Ginkgo Bioworks Destined to Be in a ""Magnificent Seven"" of Healthcare Stocks?",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ginkgo-bioworks-destined-magnificent-seven-174500920.html,"It isn't ready for membership today, but it could have a path in the future.","Could Ginkgo Bioworks Holdings (NYSE: DNA) one day be part of the healthcare sector's version of the ""Magnificent Seven"" group of high-performing stocks? It's more likely than you think. The Boston-based biofoundry has large aspirations to disrupt the way new drugs are developed -- and there's reason to believe that over time it could succeed in a big way. Consider the following.The argument for ""magnificent"" statusPerhaps the most illustrious of the current Magnificent Seven stocks (which all focus on technology) is Nvidia, the graphics-card and chipmaker business that's seeing its shares reach meteoric heights. It's risen 497% in three years as a result of the swelling hype about its role in the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI).In essence, it sells shovels that its customers need to claim their own portion of the ongoing AI gold rush. The current expectation is that demand for those shovels will keep rising sharply, and that Nvidia will be consistently able to meet demand -- while also continuing to innovate so that its tools remain the most appealing option.That situation may not seem comparable to the biopharma sector. But that's because the key ingredient -- a hot commodity that customers know they need to buy in order to succeed in the emerging competitive environment -- does not (yet) exist in healthcare in the same fashion.Think about it. There's already plenty of demand for advanced new medicines of all sorts, and that won't change. Drugmakers are widely trying to innovate with research and development (R&D) in areas like AI-enabled drug design, and in next-generation manufacturing. And they're willing to spend big. The golden goose, a unified automation solution that can handle a majority of research activity (from discovery stage through late pre-clinical stage) as well as most manufacturing activity, remains elusive.But that's exactly what Ginkgo Bioworks is building. With its biofoundry, it's aiming to provide its customers with a reliable and highly efficient platform to compete in the upcoming biotechnology revolution. The services it offers can, at least in theory, streamline the entire drug development stack to the point where clients hand off their specifications for a specialized bioengineered microorganism, and then later receive the exact chemical or cellular products they want for their desired end use. Most of that process will be highly automated with a combination of software, AI, and laboratory robotics.Story continuesOf course, clinical research organizations (CROs) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) have existed for a long time, but they don't necessarily have a reputation for being innovative or inexpensive.If, on the other hand, Ginkgo can realize economies of scale in both R&D and manufacturing as a result of its automation, it could avoid those problems. And that would make it a premium provider of critical services like Nvidia, which could make Ginkgo's stock fly over time and eventually make it one of the healthcare sector's leading investments.A few pieces still need to fall into placeThere is a growing body of evidence suggesting that Ginkgo is gaining traction. Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Merck, Eli Lilly, and Moderna are all already working with the company by running programs on its platform.As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Ginkgo had 162 active programs, a 45% increase from the prior year. For 2024, it aims to onboard as many as 120 additional programs, generating as much as $235 million in total revenue in the process. The demand for its services is clearly there, so it is probable that it will hit its target.Nonetheless, it still needs to convince the market that it could have a similar trajectory to Nvidia's, and the biggest remaining barrier is that its core thesis is not yet proven. Its quarterly operating margin was deeper in the red in the third quarter than it was three years earlier. It is very far from reaching break-even profitability, and that might not ever happen if the company doesn't find ways to significantly drive down both the fixed and the marginal costs of servicing its programs.If that situation starts to change, however, the stock could surge. On a long enough timescale, it's fully conceivable that Ginkgo Bioworks would be among the most important collaboration partners in biopharma, enabling players large and small to slash some of their biggest costs.So, while it isn't necessarily destiny for Ginkgo to eventually join the Magnificent Seven of healthcare, many of the ingredients for doing so are currently present -- and the last missing elements are (hopefully) within its control to address one day.Should you invest $1,000 in Ginkgo Bioworks right now?Before you buy stock in Ginkgo Bioworks, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ginkgo Bioworks wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,Will Coca-Cola Stock Finally Beat the Market This Year?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-stock-finally-beat-164500051.html,Sales are moving in the right direction.,"Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is one of the most recognized brands on Earth with a top-10 global brand value. It's a Warren Buffett favorite, and it's the top-selling beverage company in the world.So it might come as a surprise that Coca-Cola stock has underperformed the broader market for decades. Over the past 10 years, it's delivered a total return of 122%, while the S&P 500 has gained 232% (dividends included).Coca-Cola has been flexing its brand and pricing power during the inflationary environment, raising prices to match rising costs, and it's generating higher sales and income. Will it finally go back to beating the market this year?Revitalizing tired salesYou'd have to delve into Coca-Cola's historical performance to get a better sense of why it has been underperforming the market. For a quick glimpse, these charts tell part of the story.KO Revenue (Annual) ChartCoca-Cola stock wasn't performing well because the company wasn't. It got a new CEO in 2017, and it took a few years and a global pandemic for it to make the right corrections and get back on track. Actually, just prior to COVID-19, as you can see, it began to turn around.Sales plummeted again, but Coca-Cola made some major structural changes as the pandemic landed. It restructured its operating groups and slashed its brand portfolio from 400 to 200 brands. Those were bold actions, and they have led to incredible results. Revenue and net income are both rising, and the company is in an excellent cash position.KO Free Cash Flow ChartCash is important for any company, but it plays a major part in Coca-Cola's strategy, since it needs to fund its storied dividend and the accompanying annual raises.With sales back up, can Coca-Cola stock beat the market?Believe it or not, Coca-Cola's annual sales are still below where they were 10 years ago. But as they're finally swinging higher, Coca-Cola stock might finally perk up, too. It did beat the market in 2022, when it gained 7% as investors piled into safe stocks and the market dropped 19%. But even though it excelled under pressured conditions last year, it lost 7% while the market rebounded.Story continuesIn some ways, it's back to where it started 10 years ago, and it can now start ramping up again. But is it likely to beat the market?Coca-Cola is an established value stock, and these kinds of large, slow-growing secure stocks don't typically beat the market. Coca-Cola's sales increased 7% year over year in 2023, and earnings per share were up 13%. Management is expecting sales to increase a similar amount in 2024 with inflationary pricing moderating at some point.But such stocks do offer other benefits. Coca-Cola is a classic Dividend King and has raised its dividend annually for 62 years. Its dividend yields 3.2% at the current price, which is more than double the S&P 500 average.Even if Coca-Cola stock doesn't beat the market this year, it could still be a valuable addition to your portfolio. One reason is the reliable and growing passive income stream. Another is as a value anchor to a diversified portfolio and a hedge for uncertain times, such as when it beat the market in 2022. Even if it doesn't beat the market over the next decade, it's likely to provide gains and value in other ways.Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

Motley Fool,3 Magnificent Dividend Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist in March,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-magnificent-dividend-stocks-buy-163900526.html,"Devon Energy, MPLX, and Enbridge pay attractive dividends and have solid track records of increasing those payouts.","Dividend stocks can be magnificent investments. Not only do they provide passive income, but they can also produce above-average total returns as they grow their earnings and shareholder payouts. Over the last 50 years, dividend stocks have outperformed the average return of stocks in the S&P 500, and dividend growers in particular have delivered the best total returns. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), MPLX (NYSE: MPLX), and Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors for their magnificent ability to pay and regularly hike their dividends. Here's why they think investors should buy them hand over fist this month. There's only one problem with EnbridgeReuben Gregg Brewer (Enbridge): If you buy North American midstream giant Enbridge you have to accept one negative -- its dividend will likely provide the bulk of your returns on the investment. But given that it yields a huge 7.9% at the current share price, that's probably not going to bother income-oriented investors. And while its dividend growth isn't likely to be huge, it should track the company's distributable cash flow growth, which management expects to be around 3% to 5% over the longer term. That's enough to keep up with, if not exceed, average inflation over time. Basically, Enbridge is a slow and steady tortoise.The distributable cash flow payout ratio is currently about 65%, which is comfortably in the middle of the company's target range. And the balance sheet backing that dividend is investment-grade rated. In other words, the dividend sits on a solid financial foundation.The company's collection of energy infrastructure, meanwhile, is vital, and would be difficult if not impossible to replace. It spans a wide gamut, including oil and natural gas pipelines, natural gas utilities, and renewable power. These assets all produce reliable cash flows from fees or they have regulated returns. Enbridge is set to add three more natural gas utilities to its portfolio in 2024, further increasing its exposure to regulated assets -- and making its cash flows even more boring and reliable.Story continuesThat brings the story back to the dividend, which management has increased annually for an impressive 29 consecutive years. There's absolutely no indication that this streak is at risk of ending.A fantastic income producerMatt DiLallo (MPLX): MPLX doesn't get enough credit for its ability to distribute cash to its investors. The master limited partnership (MLP) has increased its payouts every year since its formation in 2012, and delivered 10% hikes in each of the last two years. That would be impressive for any company, but it's even more so for one that offers a monster 8.8% yield at its current share price. That big-time payout is on an extremely firm foundation. MPLX generates stable cash flows backed by long-term contracts with high-quality customers, including its parent, refining giant Marathon Petroleum. Meanwhile, it distributes a conservative portion of that steady cash to investors -- its distribution coverage ratio was a comfortable 1.6 times last year. That enabled the MPLX to retain all the money it needed to fund expansion projects with more than $800 million to spare. That excess free cash added to its already fortress-like balance sheet. MPLX ended last year with $1 billion in cash and a low 3.3 times leverage ratio. That's comfortably below the 4.0 times leverage ratio its stable cash flow can support. MPLX has the financial flexibility to invest in expansion projects and make acquisitions that grow its cash flow. It's currently building several natural gas processing plants and has a couple of pipeline capacity expansion projects underway. These projects should grow its cash flow as they enter service over the next two years. The MLP will also make acquisitions as opportunities arise. For example, in December, it took full control of a gathering and processing joint venture, spending $270 million to buy the 40% interest that it hadn't previously owned. These growth-related investments will increase its cash flow, giving it more fuel to raise its distribution. Given the strength of MPLX's financial foundation, its payout makes the stock a no-brainer buy this month for income seekers.This stock just raised its dividend by 10%Neha Chamaria (Devon Energy): Devon Energy has been one heck of a dividend stock in recent years, especially after it launched the oil and natural gas industry's first fixed-plus-variable dividend policy in 2021 following its merger with WPX Energy. In the three years that followed, dividends have contributed significantly to Devon shareholders' total returns.DVN ChartNow is a great time to pick shares of this oil stock, considering that it has fallen nearly by 14% over the past six months and yields 5.5% as of this writing. Devon Energy's latest numbers prove that the company is on solid footing. Its fourth-quarter production surpassed its guidance, and solid oil volumes and cash flows even encouraged management to raise its fixed quarterly dividend payout by 10% to $0.22 a share, effective for March.Devon now pays a fixed dividend every quarter, as well as a variable dividend of up to 50% of its excess free cash flow. In Q4, the oil and natural gas giant announced a fixed dividend of $0.22 per share plus a variable dividend of the same amount. Now, it's important to note here that Devon's total Q4 dividend was still significantly below the dividends it paid out through last year. But that's because of lower oil prices, which hit its free cash flows. What matters here is the hike in the fixed dividend, which is a testimony to the company's resilience and financial strength.Devon plans to moderate its production growth as it focuses on value instead of volume, and this strategy should keep driving its earnings per share higher. The company's also buying back shares aggressively, so investors who buy Devon now should make solid returns in the long term, driven by both earnings and dividend growth.Should you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?Before you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.
